AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has a major influence upon sorption/desorption and transport of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in soil environments. However, the molecular mechanisms of DOC sorption and its effects on aged HOC desorption in contaminated soils still remain largely unclear. Here, effects of three different DOC (one from commercial peat and two from biochars produced at 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C pyrolysis temperatures, respectively) and oxalate (as a reference) on abiotic desorption behavior of aged phenanthrene from three agricultural soils were investigated. Results showed that desorption of aged phenanthrene from soils was predominantly dependent on soil organic carbon content. The presence of DOC and oxalate resulted in higher desorption of phenanthrene compared to water alone, and the effects were positively related to soil organic carbon content and DOC/oxalate concentration. The facilitating effects of DOC were further increased during the second consecutive desorption, whereas oxalate had no such effect. Ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry confirmed the molecular fractionation of DOC at the soil-water interface during DOC sorption. Specifically, the DOC molecules with O-rich moieties were preferentially adsorbed, whereas the molecules with phenolic and aromatic structures were selectively retained in the soil solutions through competitive displacement and co-sorption reactions during sorption. The enriched phenyl structures in the retained DOC facilitated its association with phenanthrene in the solutions and thus the release of phenanthrene from the soils. In contrast, oxalate replaced some organic carbon from the soils and thus released the associated phenanthrene into the solutions. Our findings highlight the importance of the molecular composition and structure of DOC for the desorption of phenanthrene in soil-water environments, which may help improve our understanding of the release and transport of organic compounds in the environments.

AB Humic stress is associated with the widespread and ongoing browning of lakes. Natural landscape gradients in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) potentially result in aquatic communities with different tolerances to humic substances and thus expected contrasting responses to further lake browning. If zooplanktonic species are adapted to different background concentrations of DOC, then we expected that the zooplankton from naturally DOC-rich lakes would maintain higher diversity, biomass and overall density in the face of experimental browning than the zooplankton from DOC-poor lakes. We tested this hypothesis in a common-garden experiment by exposing, in enclosures, zooplankton from replicate DOC-rich and DOC-poor source lakes to simulated browning and to clear water. We conducted a 2x2x3 factorial-design field transplant experiment with zooplankton from replicate DOC-rich (>8.5mgL(-1)) and DOC-poor (<3.5mgL(-1)) lakes (Quebec, Canada) over eight weeks. There were two fixed effects: water treatment (brown or clear water) and zooplankton source (from DOC-rich or DOC-poor lakes). Lake source was included as a random variable in the model for the response of copepod body size in the enclosures. A substance derived from peat, SuperHume', was used as a source of DOC. The diversity, biomass and total density of zooplankton from DOC-rich and DOC-poor lakes did not differ upon experimental addition of further DOC. This was despite the presence of different copepod body size phenotypes between source lakes that could have potentially caused different community responses: several dominant species of copepods (Cyclops scutifer, Leptodiaptomus minutus and Tropocyclops prasinus mexicanus) had a larger mean population body size in DOC-rich source lakes than in DOC-poor source lakes. Our findings suggest that the zooplankton from DOC-rich lakes does neither better nor worse than zooplankton from DOC-poor lakes when faced with browning from a humic stressor.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs can comprise a mosaic of vegetation patches and open-water pools, with hydrological and biogeochemical connections between pools and the surrounding peat and vegetation. To establish these connections, we studied the spatial heterogeneity of hydrology and water chemistry in two zones of distinct vegetation assemblages in the subboreal Grande plee Bleue peatland, southern Quebec, Canada. We show that seasonal water-level fluctuations are greater and organic C, N and P concentrations are higher in the peat pore water of a forested zone than in a neighboring open-bog zone; that vegetation is responsible for 69% of the spatial variations in hydrology and water chemistry. Vegetation also explains 31% of the temporal variation in water chemistry, with higher increases in C, N and P concentrations over the growing season in the forested peat and pools than in the open-bog zone. We also show that C, N and P concentrations and water-level fluctuations in pools, especially during precipitation events, were lower than in the surrounding peat. Our results suggest the existence of small "watersheds" to the pools with water flowing in during wet and out during dry periods. Localized patterns emerge from the vegetation-hydrology-water chemistry interactions, with pools influencing the persistence of trees in the central part of an ombrotrophic bog.

TI Particles and Aeration at Mire-Stream Interfaces Cause Selective Removal

AB Peatlands are dominant sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to boreal inland waters and play important roles in the aquatic carbon cycle. Yet before peat-derived DOM enters aquatic networks, it needs to pass through peat-stream interfaces that are often characterized by transitions from anoxic or hypoxic to oxic conditions. Aeration at these interfaces may trigger processes that impact the DOM pool, and its fate downstream. Here we experimentally assessed how the aeration of iron- and organic-rich mire-waters influences biodegradation, particle-formation, and modification of DOM. In addition, we investigated how suspended peat-derived particles from mires may influence these processes. We found that within 5 days of aeration, 20% of the DOM transformed into particulate organic matter (POM). This removal was likely due to combination of mechanisms including coprecipitation with oxidized iron, aggregation, and DOM-adsorption onto peat-derived particles. Peat-derived particles promoted microbial activity, but biodegradation was a minor loss mechanism of DOM removal. Interestingly, microbial respiration accounted for only half of the oxygen loss, suggesting substantial nonrespiratory oxygen consumption. The differences observed in DOM characteristics between anoxic and aerated treatments suggest that hydrophilic, aromatic DOM coprecipitated with iron oxides in aerated samples, and the corresponding C:N analysis of generated POM revealed that these organic species were nitrogen-poor. Meanwhile, POM formed via adsorption onto peat-derived particles generated from nonaromatic DOM and more nitrogen-rich species. Hence, selective removal of DOM, dissolved iron, and thus oxygen may be important and overlooked processes in mire-dominated headwater systems.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange was studied at flark (minerotrophic hollow), lawn and hummock microsites in an oligotrophic boreal pine fen. Statistical response functions were constructed for the microsites in order to reconstruct the annual CO2 exchange balance from climate data. Carbon accumulation was estimated from the annual net CO2 exchange, methane (CH4) emissions and leaching of carbon. Due to high water tables in the year 1993, the average carbon accumulation at the flark, Eriophorum lawn, Carex lawn and hummock microsites was high, 2.91, 6.08, 2.83 and 2.66 mol C m(-2) respectively, and for the whole peatland it was 5.66 mol m(-2) year(-1). During the maximum primary production period in midsummer, hummocks with low water tables emitted less methane than predicted from the average net ecosystem exchange (NEE), while the Carer lawns emitted slightly more. CH4 release during that period corresponded to 16% of the contemporary NEE. Annual C accumulation rate did not correlate with annual CH4 release in the microsites studied, but the total community CO2 release seemed to be related to CH4 emissions in the wet microsites, again excluding the hummocks. The dependence of CO2 exchange dynamics on weather events suggests that daily balances in C accumulation are labile and can change from net carbon uptake to net release, primarily in high hummocks on fens under warmer, drier climatic conditions.

AB Matsumi-ike Bog is a swampy bog that has attained the climax stage of limnological succession. The dynamics of bacterioplankton were studied in relation to the influence of environment factors. The water temperature was shown primarily affect bacterial dynamics as a limiting factor throughout the year. The second most profound factor on the dynamics was the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) when dead phytoplankton were the major DOC source in the bog, whereas phosphate concentration was most important in the periods when the dead emergent plants were responsible for the DOC supply.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic substances (HS), polysaccharides (PS) and low molecular weight acids (LMWA) were characterized in water from the dystrophic Lake Gro sse Fuchskuhle over a period of seven months. In addition, porewater from an adjacent fen was investigated in order to obtain information about the DOC in the catchment area. Size-exclusion-chromatography combined with UV- and organic carbon (IR)-detection was used to quantify DOC and its fractions. The lake had previously been divided into four separate sections by large sheets of plastic, and the DOC composition differed markedly between the four compartments. Spatial variations in HS and PS concentrations were greater than seasonal variations. The high amounts of HS (up to 58%) in the western sections of the lake, indicated influence by subsurface water from the fen, whereas the eastern sections were dominated by PS (up to 35%) of algal origin. These differences could be explained by hydrological conditions, indicating that completely different catchment areas influenced the water chemistry in the separate compartments. By characterizing the HS by their average molecular weight and their aromaticity, three different groups of HS could be distinguished depending on their origin and fate. Microbial degradation of DOC and its fractions differed between two of the compartments during incubation studies over a period of six weeks.

AB Mires in boreal area had proved to be an important dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reserve for the sensitivity to climate change and human interfering. The study was focused on the temporal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of DOC in a seasonally-waterlogged mire (SLM) and perennially-waterlogged mire (PLM) in the Sanjiang Plain, Northest China. In the two mires, DOC concentrations in both surface water and upper soil strata experienced pronounced seasonal variation. DOC concentrations in the surface waters were the greatest and averagely was 47.82 in SLM and 34.84 mg/L and PLM, whereas that in soil water at 0.3-m depth had little difference (20.25 mg/L in SLM and 26.51 mg/L in PLM). Results revealed that DOC concentrations declined 5-8 times vertically from the surface down to groundwater. DOC in the groundwater only was in a very small part with the average concentration of 5.18 mg/L. In relation to the surface water, DOC concentrations varied positively with temperature just before 8 August, and only in early spring and later autumn DOC concentrations exhibited identifiable spatial trends along with standing water depths in PLM. It was supposed that the influences from standing water depth took effect only in conditions of low temperature, and temperature should be the most powerful factor controlling DOC dynamics in the mires. Redox potential (Red) showed negative relationship with DOC values while total nitrogen (TN) and the majority of free ions in the soil solution exhibited no relationship. High soil TOC/TN ratio and low redox potentials also led to DOC accumulation in the mires in the Sanjiang Plain.

AB A year-long field survey was carried out at a valley-bottom riparian peatland site in North Wales, UK from January 2002 to December 2002 to examine the seasonal variation of decomposition processes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Peat temperature, physicochernistry, organic carbon pools, basal CO2 respiration and extracellular enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, phosphatase, sulphatase and phenol oxidase) were monitored monthly. The results of a principle component eigenanalysis of field data show that concentrations of basal CO2 respiration, soil solution DOC and phenolics were positively correlated to soil temperature (P < 0.01, F=12.25; P < 0.001, F=59.8; P < 0.001, F=141.27) with Q(10) responses of 2.29, 6.42 and 14.42, respectively. Extracellular enzyme activities, however, were more strongly associated with seasonal changes in ion concentrations and did not correspond significantly to temperature alone suggesting limitations attributable to a combination of continuous anaerobiosis and/or the suppressive compounds. Restraints on soil enzyme activities may limit the loss of CO2 from the microbial community that is dependent on soil enzyme activities for nutrient availability. The seasonal effect of temperature on DOC may be explained by increased plant rhizodeposition and microbial activity. These results do not imply that the long-term increasing trend in DOC export is explainable by temperature increase but suggest that temperature may be a key factor regulating the seasonal variation in DOC concentrations. Thus, seasonal temperature effects on DOC may represent an important component of long-term models of DOC export. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The postglacial development of peatland systems has had a strong influence on the global carbon cycle. Peatland effects on carbon cycling involve changes in both large-scale structure and community composition. The rate of C sequestration declines as a peat deposit grows, and methane emission increases as wet microhabitats expand in area. We examine the theoretical basis, underlying assumptions, and empirical evidence for two highly influential models of peatland form and development: Clymo's bog growth model (BGM) and Ingram's groundwater mound hypothesis (GMH). Our detailed theoretical analysis reveals previously unrecognized consequences of the models and, for the BGM, unrealistically stringent conditions for application. Our review of model assumptions and empirical evidence identifies the principal limitations of these models: they ignore spatial heterogeneity in peatland structure and function, fast processes occurring near the peatland surface, and interactions between peat accumulation and hydrological conditions. As a result, these models are unable to predict the effects of bog growth on hydrological conditions or peat-forming processes.
   We introduce five conceptual models of peatland development that differ in how bog size and shape change over time, and we examine the consequences of each model for hydrological conditions. This exercise shows how bog height growth and lateral expansion change the boundary conditions constraining peatland dynamics, and so determine the direction of ecosystem development. We link peatland properties to the four general properties of ''complex adaptive systems'' (CAS): spatial heterogeneity, localized flows, self-organizing structure and nonlinearity. We also present a framework for modeling peatlands as CAS. In this framework, the system is disaggregated, both vertically and horizontally, into a set of components that interact locally through flows of energy and resources. Both internal dynamics and external forcing drive changes in hydrological conditions and microhabitat pattern, and these autogenic and allogenic changes in peatland structure affect hydrological processes, which, in turn, constrain peatland development and carbon cycling. We conclude by outlining four areas in which further empirical research is urgently needed.

AB Understanding how the concentration and chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies in soils is critical because DOM influences an array of biological, chemical, and physical processes. We used PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy, specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate the chemical quality of DOM in soil water collected from 25 cm piezometers in four different wetland and forest soils: bog, forested wetland, fen and upland forest. There were significant differences in soil solution concentrations of dissolved organic C, N, and P, DOC:DON ratios, SUVA(254) and BDOC among the four soil types. Throughout the sampling period, average DOC concentrations in the four soil types ranged from 9-32 mg C l(-1) and between 23-42% of the DOC was biodegradable. Seasonal patterns in dissolved nutrient concentrations and BDOC were observed in the three wetland types suggesting strong biotic controls over DOM concentrations in wetland soils. PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy showed that protein-like fluorescence was positively correlated (r(2) = 0.82; P < 0.001) with BDOC for all soil types taken together. This finding indicates that PARAFAC modeling may substantially improve the ability to predict BDOC in natural environments. Coincident measurements of DOM concentrations, BDOC and PARAFAC modeling confirmed that the four soil types contain DOM with distinct chemical properties and have unique fluorescent fingerprints. DOM inputs to streams from the four soil types therefore have the potential to alter stream biogeochemical processes differently by influencing temporal patterns in stream heterotrophic productivity.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in freshwater ecosystem functioning. The main sources of DOM in lakes are allochthonous inputs from the catchment and autochthonous in-lake production. This study focused on the role of catchment characteristics on the qualitative and quantitative properties of DOM in small temperate lakes along a gradient of alkalinity. We examined DOM properties based on the optical absorbance and fluorescence measurements of water from 34 Estonian lakes. The content and composition of DOM were highly diverse in the lakes studied, e.g. the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied from 3.2 to 53.0 mg L-1. Land cover, soil, and catchment hydrology and geology had substantial effects on DOM in lakes. Stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the catchment and water exchange rate (a descriptor of catchment hydrology, reciprocal of water residence time) had major positive effects on DOC concentrations. The aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM, i.e. the relative abundance of humic substances, and the dominance of allochthonous DOM increased with the drainage ratio (catchment area/lake area) and the percentages of bogs, and Dystric and Fibric Histosols (peat soils in transitional mires and bogs, respectively) in the catchments. Dominance of non-humic over humic substances and autochthonous over allochthonous DOM in lakes corresponded to calcareous catchments and higher percentages of Gleyic Rendzinas (thin soils on calcareous rock), Sapric Histosols (peat soils in mires) and open spaces (areas with little vegetation). Our results showed that soil variables had in general a greater effect than land cover and were more informative for describing the role of catchment characteristics on DOM in lakes. Patterns in DOM quantity and quality found in our study were similar to patterns found in other temperate lakes; therefore, our results have important implications for understanding catchment-lake interactions across the temperate region.

AB Most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported from catchments is transported during storm events. Accurate assessments of DOC fluxes are essential to understand long-term trends in the transport of DOC from terrestrial to aquatic systems, and also the toss of carbon from peatlands to determine changes in the source/sink status of peatland carbon stores. However, many long-term monitoring programmes collect water samples at a frequency (e.g. weekly/monthly) less than the time period of a typical storm event (typically < 1-2 days). As widespread observations in catchments dominated by organo-mineral soils have shown that both concentration and flux of DOC increases during storm events, lower frequency monitoring could result in substantial underestimation of DOC flux as the most dynamic periods of transport are missed. However, our intensive monitoring study in a UK upland peatland catchment showed a contrasting response to these previous studies. Our results showed that (i) DOC concentrations decreased during autumn storm events and showed a poor relationship with flow during other seasons; and that (ii) this decrease in concentrations during autumn storms caused DOC flux estimates based on weekly monitoring data to be over-estimated, rather than under-estimated, because of over rather than under estimation of the flow-weighted mean concentration used in flux calculations. However, as DOC flux is ultimately controlled by discharge volume, and therefore rainfall, and the magnitude of change in discharge was greater than the magnitude of decline in concentrations, DOC flux increased during individual storm events. The implications for long-term DOC trends are therefore contradictory, as increased rainfall could increase flux but cause an overall decrease in DOC concentrations from peatland streams. Care needs to be taken when interpreting tong-term trends in DOC flux rather than concentration; as flux is calculated from discharge estimates, and discharge is controlled by rainfall, DOC flux and rainfall/discharge will always be well correlated.

AB Testate amoebae contribute significantly to belowground ecological processes like nutrient cycling, but a decline in their nutrient cycling functions in peatlands is expected due to global climate warming. We studied the dynamics of testate amoebae communities in relation to soil environmental variables in a permafrost peatland that experienced in situ experimental warming for a 7-yr period. Experimental warming reduced testate amoebae biomass by 41%. Redundancy analyses showed that testate amoebae community structure was correlated with water table depth and soil temperature (these explained 10% of the variance in community structure) and dissolved organic carbon (which explained 2.2% of the variance). Our results demonstrated that warming-induced changes to the water table depth affected the testate amoebae community in peatland, which could have consequences for the stability of the microbial food web and carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems.

AB Peatlands, which store one third of the terrestrial carbon (C), are subject to large disturbances under a changing climate. It is crucial to understand how microbial and physiochemical factors affect the vulnerability of these large C stores to predict climate-induced greenhouse gas fluxes. Here, we used a combination of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy techniques, to understand sequential biotic and abiotic degradation pathways of Sphagnum fallax leachate in an anaerobic incubation experiment, in the presence and absence of microorganisms. Removal of microorganisms was carried out by passing aqueous samples through 0.2-mu m filters. Our results revealed that S. fallax leachate degradation by abiotic reactions is a significant contributor to CO2 production. Further, abiotic factors, such as low pH, are responsible for partial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) degradation that produces bioavailable compounds that shift microbial metabolic pathways and stimulate respiration in peat bogs. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of Sphagnum- produced glycosides can provide the microbial communities with glucose and stimulate microbial respiration of DOC to CO2. These results, while unique to peatlands, demonstrate the importance and underscore the complexity of sequential abiotic and biotic processes on C cycling in peat bogs. It is therefore crucial to incorporate abiotic degradation and sequential below-ground biotic and abiotic interactions into climate models for a better prediction of the influence of climate change on DOC stability in peatlands. These findings might not be representative of other ecosystems with different environmental conditions including mineral-rich peatlands and plant matter in surface peat horizons that comprise discrete microbial populations, and DOC composition.

AB Warming and water table drawdown greatly reshape peatland carbon cycle, especially when considering the old carbon stored under the peatland subsurface. However, little is known about the effects of warming, oxidizing by drying or their combination on carbon decomposition at different depths (0-100 cm) of peat. In this research, soil of different depths from Zoige Plateau was incubated in four scenarios (8 degrees C-anaerobic, 8 degrees C-aerobic, 18 degrees C-anaerobic and 18 degrees C-aerobic) to detect the exported carbon. Our result showed that soil respiration (Rs) increased obviously with enhanced temperature and oxygen. The total CO2 fluxes of 2400.22 +/- 57.69 mg m(-2) d(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition increased by 73.6%, 40.7% and 176.5% with warming, oxidizing and their combined effect, respectively. The average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was 74.90 +/- 8.09 mg kg(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition, but increased by 53.5%, 44% and 159.4%, respectively under the condition of warming, oxidizing and their combination. Rs and its variation underwarming and oxidization differed significantly among different depths, probably caused by the differences of soil substrate, especially the variation in distribution of soil microbes and enzymes among depths of peatlands. By classifying the source of Rs as young soil (YS: 0-20 cm) and old soil (OS: 21-100 cm), this reseaerch found that OS accounted for a huge part of total Rs under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition (CO2: 74.2%; DOC: 60.7%). Such relative contribution of OS to total Rs did not change obviously with warming or oxidizing. Though YS and OS responded equally to warming and oxidizing, OS was responsible for a larger proportion of total increase in Rs. Compared with other studies, we concluded that peatlands soil in our field of mid-latitude and high altitude is less sensitive to warming and oxidizing than peatlands of higher latitude, but that OS of this peatlands is more critical in predicting regional carbon cycle.

AB The natural recovery of vegetation on abandoned peat extraction areas lasts for decades and the result of restoration succession can be unpredictable. The aim of the study was to specify environmental factors that affect the formation of the pioneer stages of mire communities and, therefore, be helpful in the prediction of the resulting ecosystem properties. We used the national inventory data from 64 milled peatlands in Estonia, distributed over the region of 300x200km. This is the first national-scale statistical evaluation of abandoned extracted peatlands. During surveys, vascular plants, bryophytes, and residual peat properties were recorded on three microtopographic forms: flats, ditch margins, and ditches. The microtopography was the main factor distinguishing the composition of plant communities on flats and ditches, while ditch margins resembled flats. The extracted indicator species suggested two successional pathways, toward fen or raised bog community. A single indicator traitthe depth of residual peat, which combines the information about peat properties (e.g. pH, ash content, and trophicity status), predicted the plant community succession in microtopographic habitats. We suggest that peatland management plans about the cost-efficient restoration of abandoned peat mining areas should consider properties of residual peat layer as the baseline indicator: milled peatfields with thin (<2.3m) and well-decomposed residual peat should be restored toward fen vegetation types, whereas sites with thick (>2.3m) and less decomposed residual peat layer should be restored toward transitional mires or raised bogs. Specific methodological suggestions are provided.

AB This study considers three long records of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux from two catchments with peat-covered headwaters. The catchments vary in size from 11 to 818 km(2) and the records are at least 12 years old, with one record going back to 1965. The study compares both annual and monthly DOC flux records with a range of hydroclimatic indicators in order to test which component of droughts may contribute to increasing DOC flux. The study found that: (1) there was no significant correlation between any of the proposed drought variables and DOC flux in any of the study catchments over periods of up to 34 years; (2) the most important variable for explaining the DOC flux was the runoff from the catchments overlying a seasonal cycle and an underlying upward trend was present in some records; (3) the residual time-series, after removal of the best-fit models, showed no evidence of increased production after times of severe drought. The lack of any evidence for any additional biogeochemical reactions associated with drought supports evidence that DOC loss from peat is limited by its solubility and that its production is fast on the time-scale of runoff events.

AB Peatland catchments store vast amounts of carbon. Humic lakes and pools are the primary receptacles for terrigenous carbon in these meta-ecosystems, representing sequestration hotspots; boreal lakes alone store ca. 120 similar to Pg C. But little is known about the mechanisms that preserve aquatic carbon stocks. Here, we determined the regulatory pathway of decomposition in relation to traditional limitations, namely anoxia, decay inhibiting compounds, low nutrients and acidity, using in vitro manipulation, mesocosms and natural gradients. We show that anoxia represents a powerful hierarchical preservation mechanism affecting all major limitations on decomposition and recapturing carbon that would otherwise escape from peatlands. Oxygen constraints on microbial synthesis of oxidases and nutrient-cycling enzymes, prevents the decay of organic matter to CO2, CH4 and N2O by allowing inhibitor accumulation and lowering nutrients. However, this pathway is sensitive to direct nutrient inputs and therefore eutrophication could initiate catastrophic feedback to global warming via dramatically increased greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying these process-specific limitations should inform better management and conservation of these vital systems.

AB [1] The rise in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades has been taken as indicative of increased turnover of terrestrial carbon and in particular in the vital reserve of peat. Hypotheses for this rise have been hotly debated in the literature. This study proposes that, although trends in concentration have been the main focus of attention, it is trends in DOC flux that need to be examined to understand changes in terrestrial carbon storage. This study uses data from 208 rivers over the period 1975 - 2003 to calculate the trend of DOC flux from Great Britain. The DOC flux peaks at 1.68 Mt C/yr, or an export of 6.6 tonnes C/km(2)/ yr. The trend in flux is inconsistent with the pattern of atmospheric deposition, but regression analysis shows that the major control is hydrological throughput followed by an underlying upward, linear temporal trend. There is a small but significant effect ascribable to drought and storage effects. This suggests that there is additional biogeochemical production as a result of drought but that the overwhelming control in DOC flux is controlled by hydrological throughput overprinting an underlying increase in trend in DOC production. The underlying trend is consistent with increases in air temperature and or atmospheric CO2.

AB The interactions between bacteria and heterotrophic protists are essential for the ecosystem ecology of peatlands. We tested the hypothesis that fertility of a habitat may significantly influence the diurnal dynamics of the abundance of individual components of the microbial loop, as well as the number and intensity of correlations between bacteria and heterotrophic protists. Samples were taken in raised and carbonate peat bogs in three seasons, four times a day: at dawn, at noon, at dusk and at night. The results indicate that microbial community responses to physical and chemical parameters are complex but dependent on peatlands' type and variable among microbes. Concentrations of nutrients may significantly influence the diurnal dynamics of the microbial communities. The most significant correlations occurred in the afternoon. At that time, the number and biomass of metabolically active bacteria correlated to the highest degree with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, while in the evening, a clearly positive correlation between the abundance of bacteria and protists was observed. In a carbonate fen, the correlations were significantly weaker. Such knowledge will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implication of chemical disturbance on microbial functions in relation with nutrient and carbon dynamics.

AB The composition and biodegradability of streamwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies with source material and degree of transformation. We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds.

AB The importance of soil storage in global carbon cycling is well recognised and factors leading to increased losses from this pool may act as a positive feedback mechanism in global warming. Upland peat soils are usually assumed to serve as carbon sinks, there is however increasing evidence of carbon loss from upland peat soils, and DOC concentrations in UK rivers have increased markedly over the past three decades. A number of drivers for increasing DOC release from peat soils have been proposed although many of these would not explain fine-scale variations in DOC release observed in many catchments.
   We examined the effect of land use and management on DOC production in upland peat catchments at two spatial scales within the UK. DOC concentration was measured in streams draining 50 small-scale catchments (< 3 km(2)) in three discrete regions of the south Pennines and one area in the North Yorkshire Moors. Annual mean DOC concentration was also derived from water colour data recorded at water treatment works for seven larger scale catchments (1.5-20 km(2)) in the south Pennines. Soil type and land use/management in all catchments were characterised from NSRI digital soil data and ortho-corrected colour aerial imagery.
   Of the factors assessed, representing all combinations of soil type and land use together with catchment slope and area, the proportion of exposed peat surface resulting from new heather burning was consistently identified as the most significant predictor of variation in DOC concentration. This relationship held across all blanket peat catchments and scales.
   We propose that management activities are driving changes in edaphic conditions in upland peat to those more favourable for aerobic microbial activity and thus enhance peat decomposition leading to increased losses of carbon from these environments. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands, and peatlands in particular, are important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) to susceptible downstream ecosystems and organisms, but very little work has addressed MeHg production and export from peatland-dominated watersheds during the spring snowmelt. Through intensive sampling, hydrograph separation, and mass balance, this study investigated the total mercury (THg) and MeHg fluxes from two upland-peatland watersheds in Minnesota, USA during the 2005 spring snowmelt and proportionally attributed these fluxes to either peatland runoff or upland runoff. Between 26% and 39% of the annual THg flux and 22-23% of the annual MeHg flux occurred during the 12-days snowmelt study period, demonstrating the importance of large hydrological inputs to the annual mercury flux from these watersheds. Upland and peatland runoff were both important sources of THg in watershed export. In contrast to other research, our data show that peatland pore waters were the principal source of MeHg to watershed export during snowmelt. Thus, despite cold and mostly frozen surface conditions during the snowmelt period, peatland pore waters continued to be an important source of MeHg to downstream ecosystems.

AB Oxidizable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is regularly measured in environmental samples using a colorimetric method with Mn(III)-pyrophosphate as the oxidizing agent. It is simpler to use and has a much higher throughput than the commonly used dichromate oxidation and combustion methods. Here, we demonstrate that the method often leads to an underestimation or overestimation of the concentration of common organic compounds in solutions. To our knowledge, no published study has taken this fact into account when analyzing DOC data. Hence, we compared Mn(III)-pyrophosphate-based results with measurements performed with a total organic carbon combustion analyzer for samples of organic and mineral soil horizons of two temperate deciduous forests, of organic soil horizon of a primary-growth hemlock stand, and of a peatland located in New England, USA. The Mn(III)-pyrophosphate method consistently underestimated DOC concentration in soil extracts. We present correction factors for the different types of soil studied. By employing correction factors, we find the method can be an inexpensive, accurate, and high throughput tool to measure DOC in environmental samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ditch blocking in blanket peatlands is common as part of peatland restoration. The effects of ditch blocking on flow regimes and nearby water tables were examined in a field trial. After an initial 6-month monitoring period, eight ditches had peat dams installed 10m apart along their entire length (dammed), four of these ditches were also partially infilled through bank reprofiling (reprofiled). Four ditches were left open with no dams or reprofiling (open). These 12 ditches and the surrounding peat were monitored for 4more years. An initial five-fold reduction in discharge occurred in the dammed and the reprofiled ditches with the displaced water being diverted to overland flow and pathways away from the ditches. However, there was a gradual change over time in ditch flow regime in subsequent years, with the overall volume of water leaving the dammed and the reprofiled ditches increasing per unit of rainfall to around twice that which occurred in the first year after blocking. Hence, monitoring for greater than one year is important for understanding hydrological impacts of peatland restoration. Overland flow and flow in the upper similar to 4cm of peat was common and occurred in the inter-ditch areas for over half of the time after ditch blocking. There was strong evidence that topographic boundaries of small ditch catchments, despite being defined using a high-resolution Light Detection And Ranging-based terrain model, were not always equivalent to actual catchment areas. Hence, caution is needed when upscaling area-based fluxes, such as aquatic carbon fluxes, from smaller scale studies including those using ditches and small streams. The effect of ditch blocking on local water tables was spatially highly variable but small overall (time-weighted mean effect <2cm). Practitioners seeking to raise water tables through peatland restoration should first be informed either by prior measurement of water tables or by spatial modelling to show whether the peatland already has shallow water tables or whether there are locations that could potentially undergo large water-table recoveries.

AB The effect of severe drought on the biogeochemistry of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production has been proposed as a possible explanation of the widespread observed increase in the flux and concentration of DOC in sub-boreal catchments across the northern hemisphere. It compares the pattern and extent of DOC increases to the pattern and extent of severe droughts. It also considers the effect of the two most severe droughts during the period of the available DOC records and includes DOC records from 97 sites. This study derives five different drought severity indices and compares these to the observed increase in DOC over the 4-year period after each severe drought. The results show no visual correlation between drought indices and trends in either DOC concentration or flux. Decreasing DOC fluxes and concentrations were observed in the areas that had experienced severe droughts, even in peat-covered catchments. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regressions, no consistent or significant pattern of DOC increase after severe drought could be distinguished. This study does not exclude a role for drought in causing the observed DOC increases, but it suggests that the role of drought in DOC is limited to some individual catchments or some peat-covered headwaters.

AB Nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations during a summer storm for a forested catchment in the Adirondack Mountains displayed a clear separation in trajectories and timing of maximum values. Nitrate concentrations peaked early on the rising limb of the hydrograph, whereas DOC concentrations gradually increased through the rising limb with maximum concentrations following the discharge peak. Solute data from precipitation, throughfall, soilwater, and ground/till water indicated till water and near-surface soil waters as the controlling end members for stream NO3- and DOC concentrations respectively. Streamflow concentrations of major base cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), which were assumed to represent water originating from deep flow paths, matched the NO3- trajectory. These data suggest that streamflow NO3- concentrations are derived from till groundwater and that DOC is derived from near-surface soil waters. We attributed the early expression of NO3- to the displacement of till waters by infiltrating precipitation. In contrast, we hypothesized that the delayed DOC concentrations occurred with surface and near-surface runoff from near-stream wetlands/peatlands and isolated saturated areas that became connected only under conditions of maximum water content in the catchment.

AB Indicators suggest that the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in natural waters may be increasing. Climate change has been proposed as a potential contributor to the trend, and under such a mechanism, the phenolic content of DOC may also be increasing. This study explores the assessment of the phenolic character of DOC using multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy as a more convenient alternative to traditional wet chemistry methods. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is applied to fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) of humic samples to analyze inherent phenolic content. The PARAFAC results are correlated with phenol concentrations derived from the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent-based method. The reagent-based method reveals that the phenolic content of five International Humic Substance Society (IHSS) samples varies from approximately 5.2 to 22 ppm Tannic Acid Equivalents (TAE). A four-component PARAFAC fit is applied to the EEMs of the IHSS sample dataset and it is determined by PARAFAC score correlations with phenol concentrations from the reagent-based method that components C2, C3, and C4 have the highest probability of containing phenolic groups. The results show the potential for PARAFAC analysis of multidimensional fluorescence data for monitoring the phenolic content of DOC.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important in a wide variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes in surface waters. We examined the relationship between DOC flux and soil C:N ratio on a biome basis. DOC fluxes for 164 rivers were subdivided into 15 biome types including tropical rain forest, coniferous forests, peatland, deciduous forests, mixed forests, and grasslands. A database of soil C:N ratios was constructed and subdivided into biome types. At a global scale, mean soil C:N ratio of a biome accounts for 99.2% of the variance in annual riverine DOC flux among biomes, The relationship between soil C:N ratio and DOC flux at the biome scale was used to predict annual riverine DOC flux at the watershed scale for three test watersheds not included in the original model. Predicted flux of each watershed was within 4.5% of the actual DOC flux. Using the C:N model, we estimated the total export of carbon from land to the oceans to be 3.6 x 10(14) g yr(-1). This empirical model should be useful in predicting changes in DOC flux under changing climatic conditions.

AB Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were monitored in rewetted peatlands planted to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. The effect of N fertilization was examined with a rate trial (0, 80, and 160 kg N ha(-1)). Static chambers and C-13-CO2 pulse labeling at reproductive growth and grain-filling stages when maximum CH4 emission is anticipated were used to quantify the contribution of rice plants to soil C pools. Soil CH4 and N2O emissions were not affected by N fertilization and ranged from 66 to 123 kg CH4 ha(-1) and 1.2 to 3.7 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively. There was no stimulating effect of N fertilization on vegetative production, root biomass, or grain yield, indicating the existence of a large N pool in the rewetted peat soils. Nitrogen fertilization increased the contribution of rice C inputs to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool at the highest rate, but not to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pore water CH4 (CH4-pore), or emitted CH4. Across treatments, plant-derived C contributed up to 27% of emitted CH4, up to 9.1% of the DOC, and 13 to 78% of DIC. Negative N2O emissions were frequently observed during the growing season with a maximal consumption of -0.51 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1), which was not affected by N fertilization. These results demonstrate that N fertilization at rates up to 160 kg N ha(-1) in rewetted degraded peat soils does not affect annual CH4 and N2O emissions.

AB Four samples of ombrotrophic peat were collected from each of 10 upland locations in a transect from the southern Pennines to the Highland Boundary Fault, a total distance of ca. 400 km. Bulk compositions and other properties were determined. Total contents of Al and heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) were determined following digestion with hydrofluoric acid, and concentrations of metals extractable with dilute nitric acid were also measured. Supernatants obtained from aqueous extractions of the peat samples were analysed for pH, major cations and anions, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved metals, and concentrations of free metal ions (Al3+, Ni2+, etc.) were estimated by applying a chemical speciation model. Both total and HNO3-extractable metal concentrations varied along the transect, the highest values being found at locations close to industrial and former mining areas. The HNO3-extractable soil metal contents of Ni, Cu and Cd were appreciably lower than lowest-observed-effectconcentrations (LOEC) for toxicity towards microorganisms in acid, organic rich soils. However, the contents of Zn at two locations, and of Pb at five locations exceeded LOECs, suggesting that they may be exerting toxic effects in the peats. Soil solution concentrations of free heavy metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+) were substantially lower than LOECs for toxicity towards vascular plants, whereas concentrations of Al3+ were near to toxic levels at two locations.

AB The effect of two various forms of DOC on the Gonyostomum semen recruitment from sediments was conducted under experimental laboratory conditions. We tested the hypothesis that DOC is a factor enhancing spring recruitment of the species by exposing sediments from a humic lake with a 17-year bloom history, to three various DOC additions (two solutions of glucose and one solution of a peat extract). Sediments and lake water were incubated for 14 days at 16A degrees C, in 14:10 h light:dark cycle, with germling and adult cell abundance ascertained in the water every third day, and water parameters every seventh day. Our important findings were that (1) Gonyostomum recruitment was uneven and the period of germination was relatively short; (2) all treatments significantly affected germling occurrence; however, sugar-derived DOC seemed to suppress the recruitment, whereas peat extract improved it. Due to the additional phosphorus load in peat treatment (against phosphorus-free sugar treatments), it is likely that it played a major role in the observed differences, however, our results did not exclude the potential role of peat-derived DOC forms. In conclusion, we proposed that Gonyostomum expansion is supported by enhanced recruitment from sediment seed banks related to water chemistry alterations, driven by the climate change.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been shown to be important for peatland carbon budgets. The objective of this Study was to determine how net production and export of DOC from a northern peatland may be affected by disturbance Such as drainage and climate change.
   The study was conducted at a poor fen containing several pool-ridge complexes: (1) control site-no water table manipulation; (2) experimental site-monitored for one season in a natural state and then subjected to a water table drawdown for 3 years: (3) drained site-subjected to a water table drawdown 9 years prior to monitoring. The DOC concentration was measured in pore water along a microtopographic gradient at each site (hummock, lawn and hollow), in standing water in pools, and in discharge from the experimental and drained sites. The initial water table drawdown released similar to 3 g of carbon per square metre in the form of DOC, providing a large pulse of DOC to downstream ecosystems. This Value, however, represents only 1-9% of ecosystem respiration at this site. Seasonal losses of DOC following drainage were 8-11 g of carbon per square metre, representing similar to 17% of the total carbon exchange at (lie experimental Study site. Immediately following water table drawdown. DOC concentrations were elevated in pore water and open water pools. In subsequent seasons, DOC concentration in the pool declined, but remained higher than the control site even 11 years after water-table drawdown. This suggests continued elevated net DOC production Under lower water table conditions likely related to an increase in vegetation biomass and larger water table fluctuations at the experimental and drained sites. However, the increase in concentration was limited to initially wet microforms (lawns and hollows) reflecting differences in vegetation community changes, watertable and soil subsidence along the microtopographic gradient.

AB Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. The effects of a field-scale summer drought manipulation on extracellular litter and soil phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic compounds and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were examined for an upland Calluna heathland on a peaty podsol in North Wales. Litter and organic soil phenol oxidase activity was found to be positively correlated with moisture content. Thus in shallow organic soils, which are sensitive to drying during periods of low rainfall, drought may inhibit soil phenol oxidase activity as a result of water limitations. The release of soluble phenolic compounds and DOC from the droughted plots was found to be lowered during the drought period and elevated outside of the drought period. It is hypothesized that these changes may be a result of the reduced ability of extracellular phenol oxidases to process recalcitrant polyphenolic material under drought conditions. A drying incubation carried out with litter and soil cores from the same site suggests that extracellular phenol oxidase activity displays an optimal moisture level. This reconciled the observed water limitation of phenol oxidase activity at the heathland experimental site with previously observed stimulation of phenol oxidase activity by water table drawdown in deeper peats.

AB Organic soils are the most important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water. To date, most studies have focused on natural and re -wetted peatlands, but in Central Europe a large proportion of organic soils are drained and under agricultural use. Furthermore, measures such as deep ploughing or sand addition have been conducted to improve trafficability and have resulted in topsoil horizons consisting of a peat -sand mixture. Very little is known about DOC losses" from such soils. Moreover, peat soils frequently feature both mobile zones, characterised by active water and solute transport, and immobile zones, which.exchange solutes with the mobile zone by diffusion. Surprisingly, however, the effects of this dual porosity on DOC transport have not yet been explored. This study investigated the physicochemical controls on DOC concentrations in a peat -sand mixture by means of a saturated column experiment with undisturbed columns. The soil came from a former bog in northern Germany where peat layers remaining after peat extraction were mixed with the underlying mineral soil by ploughing. Three pumping rates and two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) were applied. The transport properties of the soil were obtained by analysing breakthrough curves of potassium bromide using the transport model STANMOD, which is based on the two -region non -equilibrium concept. The results of the column study were compared to DOC concentrations measured bi-weekly for two years at the field site from where the columns were taken. Despite a similar texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the fraction of the mobile zone in the columns varied between 51% and 100% of total porosity. Thus even heavily degraded organic soils mixed with sand still showed a dual porosity comparable to degraded peat soils. Percolating the columns with the high EC solution caused low pH values, probably due to ion exchange and cation bridging. The combination of high EC and low pH greatly decreased DOC concentrations at the outlet of the columns. DOC concentrations decreased and fluxes increased as the pumping rates increased. Taking pore water velocity in the mobile zone into account could help to explain the differences between the columns. Overall, transport of DOC did not seem to be limited by production of DOC, but by rate -limited exchange processes. In contrast to the column experiment, field concentrations of DOC were much higher and were not related to pH, but increased with higher electrical conductivity. These higher concentrations could be explained by low pore water velocities and the slightly higher SOC content in the field. This first experiment on DOC transport in peat -sand mixtures taking the dual -porosity nature of organic soils into account clearly demonstrated the importance of pore water velocity and thus the residence time for DOC concentrations. While hydrochemical conditions are frequently addressed in laboratory studies, there is a need for improved understanding of their interaction with hydrology and soil physical properties, especially when attempting to interpret DOC data on different spatial and temporal scales.(C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Impacts of hydrological conditions on peatland soil enzyme activities and phenolic concentrations were investigated using peat cores from two typical peatlands, the forest swamp and the marsh in North-east China, under water level manipulation in the laboratory. The results indicated varied impacts of dry and waterlogged conditions on soil enzyme activities, depending on the confounding factors including the peatland types and the variation frequency of hydrological conditions. Carbon-related enzyme activities, phenol oxidase and beta-glucosidase, were much higher in the marsh than in the forest swamp. On the contrary, phenolic concentration was measured to be much higher in the latter. Soil enzyme activities and phenolic concentrations were found to vary between the two peatlands, much more remarkably than within the individual peatlands caused by the changes in the water level. The negative relationship or inconspicuous correlation between phenolics and phenol oxidase was found to vary with specific soil conditions. These results implied that the enzyme activities and phenolic concentrations might be related to the developmental stages or the types of wetlands more than to hydrological conditions.

TI Net ecosystem productivity and peat accumulation in a Siberian Aapa mire

AB Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was studied in a bog located in the middle taiga of Siberia using two approaches, the accumulation of peat above the hypocotyl of pine trees, and the eddy covariance flux methodology. NEP was 0.84 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using the peat accumulation method; it was 0.43-0.62 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using eddy covariance over three growing seasons. These data were compared with NEP of the surrounding forest, which was 0.6 tC +/- 1.1 hat yr(-1). The trees growing on the bog reached a total height of about 3 m and an age of 80-120 yr when peat accumulation reached 0.5-0.6 m. At that stage the growth rate of the oldest trees declined. This indicates that there is a maximum age that can be reached by trees growing on hummocks (<150 yr), depending on conditions. The data show that the determination of NEP in bogs by using the peat accumulation above the hypocotyl is a useful method which can be applied on a wide range of bog types, but it may systematically overestimate NEP. The total sink capacity for carbon assimilation of bogs is comparable to that of forest, although methane emissions and losses of dissolved organic carbon must be taken into account when assessing the regional carbon cycle.

AB Riparian buffer zone areas (BZAs) effectively reduce sediment transport and are considered as the most important water protection method in forest drainage sites in Finland. However, it has been questioned whether BZAs are a significant source of nutrients and other dissolved constituents to water-courses. At seven locations in south-central Finland a buffer zone was created below a drainage site and the effects on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved P, Fe and Al in through-flow were studied for 4-7 years. The effect of the two smallest BZAs (< 0.1% of watershed area) on through-flow quality was negligible. The three medium-sized BZAs (0.15%-0.23% of watershed area) either had no effect on through-flow quality or slightly increased solute concentrations (3%-30%). At the two largest BZAs (> 1% of watershed area) the concentrations of Fe either increased or decreased and the concentrations of DOC, Al and P were either unaffected or decreased (15%-27%). It was concluded that, although increased leaching may occur from some individual sites, BZAs are unlikely to act as a general source of P, Al, Fe, or DOC to water courses.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters is influenced by natural and anthropogenic allochthonous sources in the catchment and by autochthonous production and degradation processes. An objective differentiation procedure, a principal component analysis, has been used to answer the question: Is it possible to classify different water types using only DOC-patterns, and how do seasonal variations influence such a classification? Organic compounds from various sources and river systems were analyzed by means of automated size-exclusion chromatography. Four different DOC fractions (humic substances, polysaccharides, low molecular weight acids and low weight substances) were separated on the basis of their molecular weight characteristics and quantified on the basis of their UV absorbance. Significant differences in the quality and quantity of organic compounds were found. These were related to the character of the catchment area and to autochthonous processes. It was possible to classify peat-influenced ditch waters, peat-influenced surface waters, mineral soil-influenced and anthropogenically-influenced surface waters, and waters from small and large lake-river systems. The characterization of DOC patterns combined with principal component analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing allochthonous and autochthonous DOC sources in surface waters, especially if seasonal variations are taken into account.

AB We combined 13 months of daily isotope measurements in stream water with daily DOC and 15 min FDOM (fluorescent component of dissolved organic matter) data at three nested scales to identify how riparian peatlands generate runoff and influence DOC dynamics in streams. We investigated how runoff generation processes in a small, riparian peatland-dominated headwater catchment (0.65 km(2)) propagate to larger scales (3.2 km(2) and 31 km(2)) with decreasing percentage of riparian peatland coverage. Isotope damping was most pronounced in the 0.65 km(2) headwater catchment due to high water storage in the organic soils encouraging tracer mixing. At the largest scale, stream flow and water isotope dynamics showed a more flashy response. The isotopic difference between the sites was most pronounced in the summer months when stream water signatures were enriched. During the winter months, the inter site difference reduced. The isotopes also revealed evaporative fractionation in the peatland dominated catchment, in particular during summer low flows, which implied high hydrological connectivity in the form of constant seepage from the peatlands sustaining high baseflows at the headwater scale. This connectivity resulted in high DOC concentrations at the peatland site during baseflow (similar to 5 mg l(-1)). In contrast, at the larger scales, DOC was minimal during low flows (similar to 2 mgl(-1)) due to increased ground-water influence and the disconnection between DOC sources and the stream. High frequency data also revealed diel variability during low flows. Insights into event dynamics through the analysis of hysteresis loops showed slight dilution on the rising limb, the strong influence of dry antecedent conditions and a quick recovery between events at the riparian peatland site. Again, these dynamics are driven by the tight coupling and high connectivity of the landscape to the stream. At larger scales, the disconnection between the landscape units increases and the variable connectivity controls runoff generation and DOC dynamics. The results presented here suggest that the processes occurring in riparian peatlands in headwater catchments are less evident at larger scales which may have implications for the larger scale impact of peatland restoration projects.

AB Physical and chemical, and pore-scale to field-scale properties of peat soil affect the migration of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) and dissolved-phase solutes in contaminated peatlands in a way not anticipated based on the current understanding derived from their behavior in mineral soil systems. Peat pore surface wettability, which is determined by pore surface chemistry, has strong hysteresis and shows hydrophilic and hydrophobic behaviors during water drainage from and water imbibition into pore spaces. This leads to high residual NAPL saturation in pore spaces. Systematic reduction of pore radius size with depth associated with greater peat decomposition in a typical peat profile leads to an increase in NAPL-entry capillary pressure and a reduction in peat permeability with increasing depth. The former leads to stronger capillarity in deeper peat horizons, causing resistance to NAPL percolation compared to that in shallow ones; along with decreased permeability with depth, this results in higher NAPL mobility in shallower peat. The cumulative effect is preferential horizontal migration of NAPL in shallow less decomposed peat horizons. Occupation of peat macro-pores by NAPL dramatically decreases the effective water permeability and leads to lower rates of water infiltration and groundwater discharge in the contaminated area. With respect to dissolved-phase hydrocarbons, the dual porosity structure of peat soil, which exhibits larger pores and higher effective porosity near the surface, also favours preferential transport in the surface peat layer, and leads to increasing solute retardation with depth. In addition, adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto natural dissolved organic carbon present in peat pore water influences the effective adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto peat by reducing the apparent adsorption partitioning coefficient. The concepts and evidence presented in this manuscript suggest both free-phase and dissolved-phase hydrocarbon have restricted mobility in peatlands. On this basis, in large peatlands where ecological function is not notably impacted, a case can be made for allowing natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon, rather than the common response of digging up and disposing of contaminated soils, which destroys the ecosystem function.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, amounting to approximately 455 Pg. Carbon builds up in these water-saturated environments owing to the presence of phenolic compounds-which inhibit microbial activity and therefore prevent the breakdown of organic matter. Anoxic conditions limit the activity of phenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of phenolic compounds. Droughts introduce oxygen into these systems, and the frequency of these events is rising. Here, we combine in vitro manipulations, mesocosm experiments and field observations to examine the impact of drought on peatland carbon loss. We show that drought stimulates bacterial growth and phenol oxidase activity, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat. This further stimulates microbial growth, causing the breakdown of organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide in a biogeochemical cascade. We further show that re-wetting the peat accelerates carbon losses to the atmosphere and receiving waters, owing to drought-induced increases in nutrient and labile carbon levels, which raise pH and stimulate anaerobic decomposition. We suggest that severe drought, and subsequent re-wetting, could destabilize peatland carbon stocks; understanding this process could aid understanding of interactions between peatlands and other environmental trends, and lead to the development of strategies for increasing carbon stocks.

AB A series of severe droughts during the course of a long-term, atmospheric sulfate-deposition experiment in a boreal peatland in northern Minnesota created a unique opportunity to study how methylmercury (MeHg) production responds to drying and rewetting events in peatlands under variable levels of sulfate loading. Peat oxidation during extended dry periods mobilized sulfate, MeHg, and total mercury (Hg-T) to peatland pore waters during rewetting events. Pore water sulfate concentrations were inversely related to antecedent moisture conditions and proportional to past and current levels of atmospheric sulfate deposition. Severe drying events caused oxidative release of MeHg to pore waters and resulted in increased net MeHg production likely because available sulfate stimulated the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, an important group of Hg-methylating bacteria in peatlands. Rewetting events led to increased MeHg concentrations across the peatland, but concentrations were highest in peat receiving elevated atmospheric sulfate deposition. Dissolved Hg-T concentrations also increased in peatland pore waters following drought but were not affected by sulfate loading and did not appear to be directly controlled by dissolved organic carbon mobilization to peatland pore waters. Peatlands are often considered to be sinks for sulfate and Hg-T in the landscape and sources of MeHg. Hydrologic fluctuations not only serve to release previously sequestered sulfate and Hg-T from peatlands but may also increase the strength of peatlands as sources of MeHg to downstream aquatic systems, particularly in regions that have experienced elevated levels of atmospheric sulfate deposition.

AB Peatlands characteristically accumulate organic matter due to low decomposition rates, but peatland disturbance alters local physicochemical conditions often resulting in loss of soil organic matter and emission of CO2. Restoration may reduce peat oxidation, but traditional measurements of decomposition are time-consuming. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) is a simple, standardized method to measure decomposition rates in soils. We used the TBI to measure decomposition rate at four restored peatland sites across Canada that were used for peat extraction or disturbed by oil extraction (former well-sites), comparing to undisturbed and unrestored sites. We measured environmental conditions including soil temperature, water table position and peat pH from May to August 2016. Litter bags were buried for one year alongside tea bags at one site for a direct comparison of decomposition rates between the methods. There were no significant differences for TBI decay constant (k(TBI)) between treatments of restored, unrestored or undisturbed sites across the whole data set, but some differences were found among treatments within the same peatland site for sections restored at different times in the past. Soil temperature, pH, and water table were not significantly related to k(TBI), but were negatively correlated with the stabilization factor (S). The k(TBI) and litter bag k were significantly different but positively correlated. The TBI is not easily comparable to traditional litter bags, but is less costly in both time and money, and may be used in conjunction with additional parameters to determine decomposition patterns with potential for use as a metric for evaluating restoration outcomes.

AB Dissolved organic C (DOC) transfer from the landscape to coastal margins is a key component of regional C cycles. Hydropedology provides a conceptual and observational framework for linking soil hydrologic function to landscape C cycling. We used hydropedology to quantify the export of DOC from the terrestrial landscape and understand how soil temperature and water table fluctuations regulate DOC losses in the C-rich, perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) of Alaska. Land cover in the region is dominated by three major hydropedologic units: poor fen, forested wetland, and upland. We instrumented soils and streams in nine hydropedologic units to quantify DOC fluxes. Stream-water DOC concentrations varied from 5.7 to 16.7 mg C L-1. Mean area-weighted DOC fluxes were 24.8, 29.9, and 10.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from the poor fens, forested wetlands, and uplands, respectively. We found that increased soil temperature and frequent fluctuations of soil water tables promoted the export of large quantities of DOC from poor fen and forested wetland units and relatively high amounts of DOC from upland units. The DOC export from the hydropedologic units in the PCTR is among the highest in the world and highlights the importance of terrestrial to aquatic fluxes of DOC as a pathway for C loss in the region.

AB Soil and plant tissues were used to examine the effect on the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of rinsing over time at two temperatures and under oxic and anoxic conditions in a laboratory incubation. The release of DOC over 60 days of incubation ranged from 0.5 to 189 mg DOC g(-1) oven-dry material and was correlated inversely with the degree of decomposition of the material: fresh maple leaves > old maple leaves > Sphagnum moss > fibric peat > hemic peat sapric peat > Inceptisol A horizon. Rates of DOC release were similar through the duration of the experiment, except for the fresh maple leaves, where release rates fell after 3 day. Rinsing, by the replacement of water in the incubating samples after 20 day, produced slower rates of DOC release, except in the Inceptisol A and sapric peat samples. There was no significant difference between DOC release under oxic and anoxic conditions, except for the Inceptisol A soil, where DOC release was greater under anoxic than under oxic conditions. The rate of DOC release at 22 degreesC was an average of 2.4 times greater than at 4 degreesC, translating into Q(10) values of about 1.6. At 22 degreesC under oxic conditions, DOC production accounted for 14 to 58% (average 24%) of the total C released as DOC + CO2, with the highest proportion in the maple leaves. Under anoxic conditions, DOC production accounted for 63 to 95% (average 82%) of the total C released as DOC + CO2 + CH4. Production of CH4 under anoxic conditions was minor, accounting for <1% of the total C released. Under oxic conditions at 22 <degrees>C, the incubations released between 2 and 107% of the organic C contained in the samples, the largest proportion of which was released from the plant tissues. Microbial utilization of DOC meant that some C was double-counted, both as DOC and as subsequently emitted CO2 Under anoxic conditions, 0.0 to 49% of the sample organic C was mineralized. The release of DOC represents the balance between production, adsorption, and desorption and microbial utilization. This release differs clearly among samples and among treatment effects.

AB Formulated sediments are recommended for use in toxicity tests to achieve standardized evaluations. However, the organic matter used in formulated sediments may differ qualitatively from that in natural sediments, which may lead to different chemical partition patterns and, hence, different toxicity effects. By deriving partition coefficients for organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (KOC and KDOC, respectively) for eight pyrethroid insecticides from three formulated and five natural sediments, the authors characterized the differences between formulated and natural sediments in pesticide sorption. For all pyrethroids, the mean values of KOC and KDOC of formulated sediments were two to three, and three to 10 times smaller than those of natural sediments, respectively. The two formulated sediments containing -cellulose or Manitoba peat showed significantly (p<0.0001) smaller KOC and KDOC values than natural sediments based on statistical analyses, while the difference was not significant for the formulated sediment containing New Brunswick peat. The KOC values were closely correlated (p<0.001) with soot carbon content, while the amount of carboxylic or phenolic functional groups may have affected KDOC. Therefore, the source and quality of organic matter are likely the most important factors in formulated sediments and must be standardized to provide consistency in sediment toxicity tests. Environ.

AB Global change, like droughts, can destabilize the carbon sink function of peatlands, either directly or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. While the effects of drought and plant community composition on individual carbon (C) related processes are well understood, their effect on multiple C-related processes simultaneouslymultifunctionality-is poorly known. We studied the effect of drought on four C-related processes (net and gross CO2 exchange, methane fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon content) in a plant removal experiment. Plant functional type (PFT) removal (graminoids, herbs, Polytrichum spp., incl. combinations) negatively affected multifunctionality; most markedly when all PFTswere removed. Our results corroborate a negative drought effect on C-related multifunctionality. Drought reduced multifunctionality, and this reduction was again largest when all PFTs were removed. Our data further indicate that much of these negative drought effects were carried over and maintained from the initial removal treatment. These results suggest that while a high diversity in plant functional types is associated to high C-related multifunctionality, plant community assembly does not drive the ability of peatlands to withstand the negative impacts of drought on multifunctionality. Hence, to safeguard the carbon cycling function in intact peatlands, the effects of climate change on the functional composition of the peatland plant community needs to be minimized.

AB Peatlands store an immense pool of soil carbon vulnerable to microbial oxidation due to drought and intentional draining. We used amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to (i) examine how fungi are influenced by depth in the peat profile, water table and plant functional group at the onset of a multiyear mesocosm experiment, and (ii) test if fungi are correlated with abiotic variables of peat and pore water. We hypothesized that each factor influenced fungi, but that depth would have the strongest effect early in the experiment. We found that (i) communities were strongly depth stratified; fungi were four times more abundant in the upper (10-20 cm) than the lower (30-40 cm) depth, and dominance shifted from ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophs and endophytes with increasing depth; (ii) the influence of plant functional group was depth dependent, with Ericaceae structuring the community in the upper peat only; (iii) water table had minor influences; and (iv) communities strongly covaried with abiotic variables, including indices of peat and pore water carbon quality. Our results highlight the importance of vertical stratification to peatland fungi, and the depth dependency of plant functional group effects, which must be considered when elucidating the role of fungi in peatland carbon dynamics.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sorption isotherms were, determined for 48 soil samples derived from Humaquepts, Inceptisols, and Spodosols using a DOC solution derived from a swamp peat (Hemist). Forty-six of the samples had DOC sorption adequately represented. by the linear initial mass isotherm, with initial DOC concentrations up to 81 mg L-1. Null-point DOC concentrations (DOC(np)), where there is zero net DOC sorption, ranged from 6.7 to 85.4 mg L-1, with an average regression coefficient of 0.45. Distribution coefficients (K(d)) averaged 1.00 x 10(-2) m3 kg-1, suggesting that DOC sorption by soils is of moderate strength compared with anions such as Cl-, NO3- , PO43- and SO42-.
   DOC(np) values were strongly related to contents of soil organic C (positive) and oxalate-extractable Al and dithionite-extractable Fe (both negative) using partial regression analysis (R 2 = 0.41-0.61, P < 0.001). A multiple regression with these three variables explained 70% of the variance in DOC(np). The sorption regression coefficient and reactive soil pool for DOC were also positively related to soil organic C content, with an average of 3.2% of the organic C in the soil being Dart of the DOC reactive pool.

AB Globally, peatlands provide an important sink of carbon in their near natural state but potentially act as a source of gaseous and dissolved carbon emission if not in good condition. There is a pressing need to remotely identify peatland sites requiring improvement and to monitor progress following restoration. A medium resolution model was developed based on a training dataset of peatland habitat condition and environmental covariates, such as morphological features, against information derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), covering Scotland (UK). The initial, unrestricted, model provided the probability of a site being in favourable condition. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves for restricted training data, limited to those located on a peat soil map, resulted in an accuracy of 0.915. The kappa statistic was 0.8151, suggesting good model fit. The derived map of predicted peatland condition at the suggested 0.56 threshold was corroborated by data from other sources, including known restoration sites, areas under known non-peatland land cover and previous vegetation survey data mapped onto inferred condition categories. The resulting locations of the areas of peatland modelled to be in favourable ecological condition were largely confined to the North and West of the country, which not only coincides with prior land use intensity but with published predictions of future retraction of the bioclimatic space for peatlands. The model is limited by a lack of spatially appropriate ground observations, and a lack of verification of peat depth at training site locations, hence future efforts to remotely assess peatland condition will require more appropriate ground-based monitoring. If appropriate ground-based observations could be collected, using remote sensing could be considered a cost-efficient means to provide data on changes in peatland habitat condition.

AB Hydrological monitoring in an eroded South Pennine peatland shows that persistent and frequent water table drawdowns occur at gully edge locations, defining a deeper and thicker acrotelm than is observed in intact peatlands (an erosional acrotelm). Antecedent water table elevation is a key control on the hydrological response to precipitation events, in particular runoff percent, the timing of peak discharges and maximum water table elevations. Significant discharge is generated whilst water table elevations are relatively tow at gully edge locations, and this has a strong influence on flow pathways. Four characteristics of runoff response are recognised: (i) the rapid development of macropore/pipe flow at the start of the storm; (ii) peat rewetting, water table elevation increase and continued macropore/pipe flow; (iii) maximum water table elevations and peak stream discharge with throughflow occurring within the erosional acrotelm and rapid flow through the subsurface macropore/pipe network; (iv) rapidly declining water table elevations and stream flow following the cessation of rainfall. Gully edge peats provide a key linkage between the hillslope hydrological system and channel flow so that their influence on the hydrological functioning of the peatlands is disproportionate to their aerial. extent within the catchment. Future climate change may lead to further degradation of the bogs and a reinforcement of the importance of erosion gullies to runoff generation and water quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient in many peatland ecosystems. Enhanced N deposition, a major component of global climate change, affects ecosystem carbon (C) balance and alters soil C storage by changing plant and soil properties. However, the effects of enhanced N deposition on peatland ecosystems are poorly understood. We conducted a two-year N additions field experiment in a peatland dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum in the Da Xing'an Mountains, Northeast China. Four levels of N treatments were applied: (1) CK (no N added), (2) N1 (6 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), (3) N2 (12 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), and (4) N3 (24 gN m(-2) yr(-1)). Plant and soil material was harvested at the end of the Second growing season. N additions increased litter N and phosphorus (P) content, as well as S-glucosidase, invertase, and acid-phosphatase activity, but decreased litter C:N and C:P ratios. Litter carbon content remained unchanged. N additions increased available NH4+-N and NO3--N as well as total Gram-positive (Gram+), Gram-negative (Gram-), and total bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in shallow soil (0-15 cm depth). An increase in these PLFAs was accompanied by a decrease in soil labile organic C (microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon), and appeared to accelerate decomposition and reduce the stability of the soil C pool. Invertase and urease activity in shallow soils and acid-phosphatase activity in deep soils (15-30 cm depth) was inhibited by N additions. Together, these findings suggest that an increase in N deposition in peatlands could accelerate litter decomposition and the loss of labile C, as well as alter microbial biomass and function.

AB A chemical model (constructed in the ORCHESTRA modeling framework) of an organic soil horizon was used to describe soil solution data (10 cm depth) and assess if seasonal variations in soil solution dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could be explained by purely abiotic (geochemical controls) mechanisms or whether factors related to biological activity are needed. The NICA-Donnan equation is used to describe the competitive binding of protons and cations and the charge on soil organic matter. Controls on organic matter solubility are surface charge and a parameter, gamma, that accounts for the distribution of humic molecules between hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions. Calculations show that the variations in solute chemistry alone are not sufficient to account for the observed variations of DOC, but factors that alter gamma, such as biological activity, are. Assuming that DOC in organic soils is derived from soluble humic material and that gamma is modified seasonally due to biological activity (with monthly soil temperature used as a surrogate for biological activity) we are able to model the observed seasonality of soil solution DOC over a 10-year period. Furthermore, with modeled DOC coupled to other geochemical processes we also model soil Solution pH and Al concentrations.

AB The retention of peatland carbon (C) and the ability to continue to draw down and store C from the atmosphere is not only important for the UK terrestrial carbon inventory, but also for a range of ecosystem services, the landscape value and the ecology and hydrology of similar to 15% of the land area of the UK. Here we review the current state of knowledge on the C balance of UK peatlands using several studies which highlight not only the importance of making good flux measurements, but also the spatial and temporal variability of different flux terms that characterise a landscape affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic processes and threats. Our data emphasise the importance of measuring (or accurately estimating) all components of the peatland C budget. We highlight the role of the aquatic pathway and suggest that fluxes are higher than previously thought. We also compare the contemporary C balance of several UK peatlands with historical rates of C accumulation measured using peat cores, thus providing a long-term context for present-day measurements and their natural year-on-year variability. Contemporary measurements from 2 sites suggest that current accumulation rates (-56 to -72 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) are at the lower end of those seen over the last 150 yr in peat cores (-35 to -209 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Finally, we highlight significant current gaps in knowledge and identify where levels of uncertainty are high, as well as emphasise the research challenges that need to be addressed if we are to improve the measurement and prediction of change in the peatland C balance over future decades.

TI Patterns and trends in lake concentrations of dissolved organic carbon
   in a landscape recovering from environmental degradation and widespread
   acidification
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE Dissolved organic carbon; Lakes; Acidity; Wetlands; Recovery
AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in lakes throughout North America and Europe over the last three decades. Recovery from acid deposition and climate change have both been postulated as the primary mechanisms for the increase in DOC. To provide a clearer insight into the mechanisms responsible for increasing DOC we evaluated changes in lake and peat porewater chemistry collected in an area of approximately 33,000 km(2) surrounding Sudbury, Ontario, a region undergoing dramatic recovery from acidic deposition. DOC concentrations varied considerably among the 44 lakes and over time (samples annually from 1981 to 2018), but the Sens Slope value showed a strong increase in lake DOC concentration over time, at 0.05 mg/L y-1 (p < 0.001) that was related to increasing pH [0.03 units y(-1), p < 0.001] and decreasing lake SO4 concentration [-0.24 mg/L y(-1); p< 0.001], but showed no relationshipwith temperature or precipitation. Similar strong relationships between DOC and pH(positive) and SO4 (negative) were observed in 18 peatlands sampled in the region. In a spatial analysis of 82 lakes sampled in 2018, concentrations of DOC in lakes were highest in flatter catchments with a greater wetland area, suggesting thatwetlands are amajor source of DOC in lakes. Optical properties of DOC obtained from extracts of wetland and upland soils at 6 catchments could be distinguished, primarily due to upland litter extracts having distinct optical properties from mineral soils or wetland soils. Optical properties of DOC in lakes however were inconsistent with those measured in soil extracts indicating that they are not useful for distinguishing DOC sources in these lakes. A predictivemodel was developed to explain DOC trends within Sudbury lakes using a stepwise linear regression combined with hierarchical partitioning to confirm themost influential processes on DOC. Almost 50% of the variability in DOC change in the 44 lakes was explained by the magnitude in lake pH change, catchment size and catchment sparse tree cover showing that recovery from acidic deposition is overwhelmingly responsible for increasing DOC in Sudbury lakes.

AB The application of stable isotopes is an approach to identify pathways of methanogenesis, methane (CH4) oxidation and transport in peatlands. We measured the stable C isotopic characteristics (delta C-13) of CH4 in peat profiles below hummocks, lawns and hollows of a Finnish mire to study the patterns of CH4 turnover. Porewater CH4 concentrations ([CH4]; at 0.5-2 m) increased with depth below all microforms. Emissions of CH4 from hummocks were the lowest, and increased with the increasing water-saturated zone, being similar to 10 times higher from hollows. Thus, the microtopography of the peatland did not affect the porewater [CH4] in the water-saturated part of the peat profile, but the CH4 emissions were affected due to differences in the oxidative potential of the microforms. There was a decrease in delta C-13-CH4 with depth below all microforms indicating dominance of CO2-reduction over acetate cleavage pathway of methanogenesis at deep peat layers. However, estimated potential portions of transported CH4 comprised 50%-70% of the delta C-13-CH4 enrichment on microforms at the 0.5-m depth, hereby masking the acetate cleavage pathway of methanogenesis. Stable C composition (delta C-13) of CH4 proved to be a suitable (but not sufficient) tool to differentiate between types of methanogenesis in continuously water-saturated layers below microforms of a peatland. Combined flux-based and multi-isotopic approaches are needed to better understand the CH4 turnover process.

AB Long-term trends in ion concentrations of bulk precipitation, throughfall, forest floor leachate (humus water) and shallow and deep soil water were assessed at two Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) stands-one on an Atlantic peat bog in the west of Ireland (Cloosh), the other on the east coast on a peaty podzol (Roundwood). Deposition at Cloosh was dominated by marine ions (sodium, [Na+], chloride [Cl-], and magnesium [Mg2+]), whereas bulk precipitation and throughfall at Roundwood was characterized by inputs of non-marine sulphate (nmSO(4) (2-)), acidity and inorganic nitrogen (NH4 (+), NO3 (-)). Significant declines in concentrations of nmSO(4) (2-) and acidity in bulk precipitation and throughfall were observed at both sites. The decline in throughfall nmSO(4) (2-) was significantly related to reductions in European sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. At Roundwood, SO4 (2-) declined significantly in humus, shallow and deep soil water. In deep soil water this was accompanied by a long-term increase in pH and a reduction in total aluminum (Al-tot). The recovery from acidification was delayed by high concentrations of NO3 (-), which strongly influenced acidity and Al-tot concentrations. At Cloosh, there was a significant decline in SO4 (2-) in humus water but long-term trends were not evident in shallow or deep soil water; SO4 (2-) concentrations at these depths fluctuated in response to drought-events. Marine ions strongly influenced soil water chemistry at both sites; at Cloosh soil water acidity was strongly related to Na+ and Cl-, while at Roundwood, Na+, Cl- and Mg2+ influenced Al-tot concentrations. Dissolved organic carbon increased significantly in humus and soil water at Roundwood, where it was associated with declining acidity. Soil water at both sites was influenced by a combination of anthropogenic sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition, drought and sea-salt events. The study highlights the value of long-term monitoring in assessing the response of forest soils to S and N deposition against a background of climate influences on soil water through drought and sea-salt events.

AB 1. Two acidic peatland upland streams in north-east Scotland draining catchments of 1.3 and 41.4 km(2) were sampled each season for 2 years to investigate diurnal variations in dissolved and gaseous forms of carbon. Stream metabolism, alkalinity, discharge, pH, air and water temperatures were measured to aid data interpretation.
   2. Free CO2 showed marked diurnal variation with lowest concentrations during the period from late morning to early afternoon and highest during the hours of darkness. Although alkalinity and pH also showed some diurnal fluctuations, in comparison with other more productive alkaline systems, variation was small. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed no significant diurnal pattern. However, significant changes in stream discharge influenced DOC concentrations, as well as over-riding diurnal patterns of free CO2, alkalinity and pH.
   3. The highest diurnal ratios (maximum concentration/minimum concentration) in CO2, gross primary productivity (GPP) and community respiration (CR) occurred in spring and summer and the lowest in autumn and winter. Variation in biotic in-stream processes caused changes in CO2 concentrations and temperature affected both the solubility Of CO2 and changes in up-stream CO2 inputs. There was no significant difference in diurnal fluctuations between the two orders of stream studied.
   4. The mean GPP (as CO2) was 0.81 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and mean CR 2.67 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1). The mean primary production/respiration (P/R) ratio was 0.26 +/- 0.09 and 0.33 +/- 0.15 in the first and second order streams, respectively. These values are low compared with published data because these heterotrophic headwater streams are dominated by benthic respiration and upstream allochthonous inputs with little autotrophic metabolism, particularly during the colder autumn and winter months.
   5. The results have implications for the calculation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes in streamwater. Samples taken during daylight hours tend to have lower concentrations of free CO2 and HCO3- than samples taken during darkness. During spring, concentrations of free CO2 were measured up to 2.4 (annual mean 1.8) times higher at night than during the day at a similar discharge. It is suggested that fluxes based on daytime measurements alone will under-estimate the annual flux of these determinands in streamwater by as much as 40%.

AB Globally, peatlands store a large quantity of soil carbon that can be subsequently modified by hydrologic alterations from land-use change and climate change. However, there are many uncertainties in predicting how carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions are altered by long-term changes in hydrology. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify how multi-decadal manipulations of water table (WT) levels affected carbon cycling (plant production and net ecosystem exchange from three eddy covariance towers) in a peatland complex modified by levee construction, which created a wetter area up-gradient of the levee (mean WT was 12.1 cm below the surface), a dry area below the levee (36.8 cm), and an adjacent reference site not affected by the levee (21.6 cm). We found that mean total plant production was greatest in the reference site (311.9 g C m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the dry site (290.5 g C m(-2) y(-1)), and lowest in the wet site (227.1 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange during the growing season was negative for all sites (sink), with the wet site having the greatest sink and the dry site having the lowest sink. Ecosystem respiration increased and CH4 emissions decreased with a decreasing WT level. This research demonstrates that human alteration of peatland WT levels can have long-term (> 50 years) consequences on peatland carbon cycling.

AB & nbsp;It is increasingly clear that increases in dissolved organic carbon in upland waters in recent decades have often been dominated by acid deposition, but reasons for substantial variation in rates of change remain unclear. This paper focuses on the extent to which spatial properties, such as variation in soil properties, atmospheric deposition and climate, affect the sensitivity of DOC concentrations in soil water. The purpose is to i) examine evidence for differences in site average concentrations and trends in soil water DOC between sites with contrasting ecosystem properties, i.e. vegetation cover and soil type, and ii) identify the wider combination of site characteristics that best explain variation in these DOC metrics between sites. We collated soil water and deposition chemistry, soil chemistry and meteorological data from 15 long-term UK monitoring sites (1992 & ndash;2010) covering a range of soils, vegetation, climate and acid deposition levels. Mineral soils under forests showed the greatest range of long-term mean DOC concentrations and trends. Regression analysis indicated that acid and sea-salt deposition, and soil sensitivity to acidification were the factors most strongly associated with spatial variation in mean DOC concentrations. Spatial variation in DOC trends were best explained by Al saturation and water flux. Overall, the sensitivity of DOC release from soil to changes in pollutant deposition could be related to the type of vegetation cover and soils chemistry properties, such as Al saturation, divalent base cation content and hydrological regime. The identification of the ecosystem properties that appear most influential in modifying & nbsp;DOC production and responses to long-term drivers, helps elucidate potential mechanistic explanations for differences in DOC dynamics across seemingly similar ecosystems, and points to the importance of DOC mobility in regulating its dynamics.

AB Peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth's land surface but boreal and subarctic peatlands store about 15-30% of the world's soil carbon ( C) as peat. Despite their potential for large positive feedbacks to the climate system through sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases, peatlands are not explicitly included in global climate models and therefore in predictions of future climate change. In April 2007 a symposium was held in Wageningen, the Netherlands, to advance our understanding of peatland C cycling. This paper synthesizes the main findings of the symposium, focusing on (i) small-scale processes, (ii) C fluxes at the landscape scale, and (iii) peatlands in the context of climate change.
   The main drivers controlling most are related to some aspects of hydrology. Despite high spatial and annual variability in Net Ecosystem Exchange ( NEE), the differences in cumulative annual NEE are more a function of broad scale geographic location and physical setting than internal factors, suggesting the existence of strong feedbacks. In contrast, trace gas emissions seem mainly controlled by local factors.
   Key uncertainties remain concerning the existence of perturbation thresholds, the relative strengths of the CO2 and CH4 feedback, the links among peatland surface climate, hydrology, ecosystem structure and function, and trace gas biogeochemistry as well as the similarity of process rates across peatland types and climatic zones. Progress on these research areas can only be realized by stronger co-operation between disciplines that address different spatial and temporal scales.

AB Overwhelming evidence reveals that concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in streams which brings negative environmental impacts. DOC in stream flow is mainly originated from soil-water solutions of watershed. Wetlands prove to be the most sensitive areas as an important DOC reserve between terrestrial and fluvial biogeosystems. This reported study was focused on the distribution characteristics and the controlling factors of DOC in soil-water solutions of annular wetland, i.e., a dishing wetland and a forest wetland together, in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. The results indicate that DOC concentrations in soil-water solutions decreased and then increased with increasing soil depth in the annular wetland. In the upper soil layers of 0-10 cm. and 10-20 cm, DOC concentrations in soil-water solutions linearly increased from edge to center of the annular wetland (R-2 = 0.3122 and R-2 = 0.443). The distribution variations were intimately linked to DOC production and utilization and DOC transport processes in annular wetland soil-water solutions. The concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total carbon (TC) and Fe(II), DOC mobility and continuous vertical and lateral flow affected the distribution variations of DOC in soil-water solutions. The correlation coefficients between DOC concentrations and TOC, TC and Fe(II) were 0.974, 0.813 and 0.753 respectively. These distribution characteristics suggested a systematic response of the distribution variations of DOC in annular wetland soil-water solutions to the geometry of closed depressions on a scale of small catchments. However, the DOC in soil pore water of the annular wetland may be the potential source of DOC to stream flow on watershed scale. These observations also implied the fragmentation of wetland landscape could bring the spatial-temporal variations of DOC distribution and exports, which would bring negative environmental impacts in watersheds of the Sanjiang Plain.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams is critically important for aquatic ecosystems and human water use, and is affected by changes in land use and climate. The effects of land use change (e.g. forest harvest) on DOC are not fully understood. Past studies of the effects of forestry on DOC have found mixed results, and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences. DOC is typically highest during storm events, and detailed time-resolved measurements of DOC over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors. In this paper, we investigated high frequency measurements of DOC concentration in headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge, British Columbia. We found base flow DOC concentration to be lower in the clear-cut stream (Clear cut: 2.26 +/- 0.43 mg/L; Forested: 4.30 +/- 0.83 mg/L). This may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter, although the difference in drainage area, slope, and the presence of a bog lake in the forested catchment may also account for some of the observed difference. We found the DOC response to storms to be larger and faster at the clear-cut site (mean increase DOC: Clear-cut: 2.42 mg/L, Forested: 1.99 mg/L; mean rate of change DOC: Clear-cut: 0.16 mg/L/h, Forested: 0.11 mg/L/h). Elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting. We found low antecedent flow and greater storm intensity to significantly predict elevated DOC storm response. This is important in the context of future climate scenarios, which predict lower summer flows and more intense storms in this region. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the intersection between effects of land use change and climate on water quality, with a focus on drinking water treatment implications.

AB We examined the aqueous and solid-phase biogeochemistry of three different types of northern peattand sediments (oligotrophic bog, beaver pond, and transition site) along a peatland transect in Ontario. Canada. Pore water concentrations (PH, Fe2+, Fe3+, SO42-. H2S, CH4. CO2 and fatty acids) were monitored seasonally, solid phase profiles (Fe(II), Fe(III), reduced inorganic sulfur) measured, and potential rates of CO2, CH4, Fe2+, and H2S production determined in slurries of peat. Dissolved CO2 (up to 6 mmol/L) and CH4 (up to 1 mmol/L) were the predominant species at all sites. In the acidic bog acetate (up to I mmol/L) and smaller quantities of propionate and butyrate were present in the pore water. Dissolved Fe2+ (<5-150 mumol/L), SO42-(10-50 mumol/L), and H,S (0 to lOpmoUL) concentrations were much lower in comparison. The Fe(II) production rates (0.6-7.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were small compared to production rates of CO2 (38-46 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) and CH4 (14-29 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Low concentrations of reactive Fe(III) (5-75 mumol/g) suggested that the Fe(II) reduction rate was limited by reactive Fe(III). In slurries amended with sulfate (0.5 mM) the potential for sulfate reduction was substantial and rates of CH4 production decreased by 48-86%. The in situ accumulation of acetate, propionate and butyrate in the acidic bog was consistent with a lack of stimulation of CO, and CH4 production during anaerobic incubation amended with acetate. Despite differences between sites Fe reduction was overall of little significance for the carbon flow. Sulfate reduction might have been more important based on the results from the incubations. In the bog, the accumulation of acetate and propionate confirmed the decoupling of anaerobic metabolic processes and the important role of fatty acid dynamics in the carbon cycle of acidic northern peatlands.

AB In three Scandinavian peatlands we studied to what extent plant and microbial community compositions are governed by local-scale microhabitat, with a special interest in the effect of aspect (i.e. exposition of slopes). Despite differences in solar irradiance between the south- and north-facing slopes, maximum temperature was elevated in the south-facing slopes at the most northern site only. Pore-water nutrient concentrations were not affected by aspect, yet dissolved organic carbon concentrations were higher in the south-facing microhabitats. This was likely caused by higher vascular plant biomass. Plant and microbial community composition clearly differed among sites. In all three sites, microhabitat (i.e. prevailing water-table depth) affected the plant and microbial community compositions. Aspect, however, did not affect community composition, even though microclimate significantly differed between the south- and the north-facing aspects at the northernmost site. Our results highlight the complex link between plant community composition, microbial community and environmental conditions, which deserves much more attention than currently in order to fully understand the effects of climate change on peatland ecosystem function.

AB The mixing behaviour of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated in two U.K. estuaries with peatland derived river inputs (Tyne and Tweed). under varying discharge regimes and in different seasons. DOC removal (i.e. non-conservative) was common to both estuaries at low salinities, but DOC addition also occurred in the Tyne at higher salinities due to inputs from a large sewage treatment works and polluted urban rivers. DOC in freshwater endmembers was in the range 608.1-2326.5 mu M (mean 1229.6 mu M, n = 7) for the Tyne and was 226.1 and 668.2 mu M on two occasions in the Tweed; the high DOC concentrations reflecting the peatland nature of the catchments and high river discharge. DOC removal in the Tyne estuary was in the range 0-58% (n = 7) (one transect exhibits 0% removal as pollution sources of DOC dominate medium to high salinity samples so it was not possible to extrapolate a conservative mixing line back to low salinities). Highest percent removals were at highest river flows and correspondingly high turbidity and DOC concentrations in the Tyne estuary. In contrast, DOC removal in the Tweed estuary was consistently 6% (n = 2), and appeared independent of river flow, turbidity and DOC concentration on the two transects conducted. Both estuaries exhibited a strong correlation between the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)) and DOC which was seasonally robust; Tweed (r(2) = 0.98, p < 0.001, n = 20), Tyne (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.001, n = 87) and Tyne without potentially anthropogenic or sedimentary derived DOM source samples (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.001, n = 74). The robust nature of these relationships implies that remotely sensed CDOM characteristics have the potential to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of estuarine DOC. This study highlights the variation in estuarine removal of peatland derived DOC between the two estuaries and in the Tyne estuary it shows how differences in river regime can result in significant changes in DOC removal at low salinities. Our findings demonstrate the need to conduct DOM sampling under varying seasons and hydrological regimes to accurately quantify the removal of terrigenous DOM in estuaries and its subsequent flux to the oceans.

AB Previous work has shown that the photo-oxidation rate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exposed to solar radiation was significantly enhanced in acidic stream waters and that the average photo-oxidative loss of DOC in the UVA region was more than 60%. This study examined the effect of pH on photobleaching and the photo-oxidative loss of DOC and the degree of photo-oxidative loss by hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-&BULL;) over the pH range 4-9 in a coloured, softwater stream. Binding iron with NaF lowered the photo-oxidation rate constant by about 50% at pH 4 and by 10-20% at pH 4.6 and 4.9. Hence, iron plays an important role in the photo-oxidative loss of DOC at pH 4 with declining importance as the pH increases. The importance of (OH)-O-&BULL; in photo-oxidative loss of stream DOC was evaluated by adding KI to quench (OH)-O-&BULL;. After 69 hours of artificial irradiation without KI, DOC loss decreased as pH increased from pH 4 to 9 whereas the minimum loss of absorbance at 300 nm occurred at pH 7. KI significantly reduced loss of DOC at pH 4, 5 and 7 but not at pH 9 with the fraction of DOC lost by non-(OH)-O-&BULL; mechanisms gradually increasing from 58% to 75% between pH 4 and 7, and 100% at pH 9. Since many northern freshwater lakes on the Precambrian Shield receive large fluxes of UV-labile humic matter from peatlands and have pH &LT; 7.5, photo-oxidative loss of DOC by both non-(OH)-O-&BULL; and (OH)-O-&BULL; mechanisms is important in C dynamics in northern freshwaters but with photo-oxidative loss dominated by non-(OH)-O-&BULL; mechanisms likely operating in the UVA region.

AB The decomposition of deep peat deposits controls the long-term carbon balance of peatlands but is poorly understood with respect to rates and controls. To rectify this deficiency, we estimated in situ dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4) production rates from a beaver pond to a central bog dome and related them to organic matter properties, Gibbs free energies of respiration, and delta C-13 values of DIC and CH4. DIC and CH4 production decreased from maxima of similar to 10 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) near the water table to values <0.1 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) at depths > 1 m, and there was little differentiation among sites. Deeper into the peat, we measured an accumulation of DIC, CH4, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) enriched in aromatic and phenolic moieties, which resulted from the slowness of diffusive vertical pore-water movement. Lack of transport may have slowed decomposition in two ways: (1) Aromatic and phenolic DOM moieties accumulated, while the release of carbohydrate-rich DOM from peat was apparently impeded. (2) The accumulation of DIC and CH4 reduced Gibbs free energy of acetoclastic methanogenesis toward a critical threshold value of -25 to -20 kJ mol(-1) CH4. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was energetically more favorable and generally dominated according to an isotopic fractionation between CO2 and CH4 of 1.053 to 1.076, but it was apparently impeded by some other factor. We conclude that lateral homogeneity and slowness of decomposition in geologically sealed deep peat deposits are assisted by a lack of solute transport, which facilitates the formation of deep peat deposits over millennia.

AB Wetlands comprise 14% of the land area of Canada. They have considerable impact on water storage and runoff, water quality, atmospheric exchanges of carbon, and important elements such as nitrogen. In less remote parts of Canada, wetlands have suffered from reclamation, exploitation, contamination and degradation, which have seriously impaired their ecological function. Public recognition of their environmental significance has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the hydrological processes, to better plan and manage wetland areas, restore degraded systems, and predict responses to global change. This paper reviews current hydrological research in all types of Canadian wetlands. The scope of hydrological processes discussed herein includes runoff, surface and groundwater flows, evaporation, microclimate, water balance, geochemical and solute transport phenomenon, carbon dynamics, isotope studies, exploitation and restoration.

AB Although methane (CH4) dynamics are known to differ at broad scales among peatland types and with climate, there is limited understanding of the variability associated with anaerobic carbon (C) cycling, and, the mechanisms that control that variability, among low pH, Sphagnum moss-dominated peatlands within a geographical region with similar climate. This is important because upscaling of CH4 emissions to regional and global scales often considers peatlands as a single, or at most two, ecosystem type(s). Here, we report the results from two studies exploring the controls of CH4 cycling in peatlands from the Upper Midwest (USA). Potential CH4 production and resultant CO2:CH4 ratios varied by several orders-of-magnitude among these soils. These differences were only partially explained by pH and fiber content (a measure of degree of decomposition in peat), suggesting other, more complicated controls may drive CH4 cycling in ombrotrophic peat soils. Based in part on the results from this survey, we more intensively examined CH4 dynamics in three bog-like, acidic, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in northern Minnesota that differed in their degree of ombrotrophy. Net CH4 flux was lowest in the peatland with well-developed hummocks, and the isotopic composition of the CH4 along with methanotroph gene expression indicated a strong role for CH4 oxidation in controlling net CH4 flux. There were limited differences in porewater chemistry (CH4 and dissolved inorganic C concentrations) or microbial community composition among sites, and potential CH4 production was also similar among the sites. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that high variation in CH4 cycling in seemingly similar peatlands within a single geographical region is common. We suggest a one peatland represents all approach is inappropriate-even among Sphagnum-dominated peatlands-and caution must be used when extrapolating data from a single site to the landscape scale, even for outwardly very similar peatlands. Instead, the macroscale development of peatlands, and concomitantly their microtopography as expressed in the proportion of hummocks, hollows, lawns and pools, need to be considered as central controls over CH4 emissions.

AB Increasing salinity has important impacts on biogeochemical processes in estuary wetlands, with the potential to influence the soil respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial population. However, it is unclear how soil respiration is related to changes in the DOC and microbial community composition with increasing salinity. In this study, soil cores were sampled from a brackish wetland in the Liaohe River estuary and treated by salinity solutions at four levels (fresh water, 3%, 5%., and 10%). Samples of gas, water and soil were collected to determine the respiration rates and microbial community structure of the soil and the DOC leaching from the soil. Compared to the low-salinity treatments (fresh water and 3%), the high-salinity treatments (5% and 10%) decreased the soil respiration rates by 45-57% and decreased the DOC concentrations by 47-55%. However, no significant differences were observed within the low-salinity treatments nor the high-salinity treatments. There is a positive correlation between the soil respiration rates and DOC concentrations in all treatments, but it does not indicate a genetic cause-effect relationship between them. The microbial community structure varied with the salinity level, with higher (beta- and delta-Proteobacteria abundance, as well as higher Anaerolineae, and lower Clostridia abundance in the high-salinity treatments. The respiration rates were slightly negatively related to the richness of Proteobacteria and positively related to the richness of Clostridia. This study suggests that there may be a salinity threshold (3-10%) impacting the organic carbon loss from estuarine brackish wetlands. In addition, the response of soil respiration to increasing salinity may be mainly linked to changes in the microbial community composition rather than changes in the DOC quantity.

AB Peatlands cover approximately 2.84% of global land area while storing one third to one half of the world's soil carbon. While peat erosion is a natural process it has been enhanced by human mismanagement in many places worldwide. Enhanced peat erosion is a serious ecological and environmental problem that can have severe on site and off-site impacts. A 2007 monograph by Evans and Warburton synthesized our understanding of peatland erosion at the time and here we provide an update covering: i) peat erosion processes across different scales; ii) techniques used to measure peat erosion; iii) factors affecting peat erosion; and iv) meta-analyses of reported peat erosion rates. We found that over the last decade there has been significant progress in studying the causes and effects of peat erosion and some progress in modelling peat erosion. However, there has been little progress in developing our understanding of the erosion processes. Despite the application of new peat surveying techniques there has been a lack of their use to specifically understand spatial and temporal peat erosion dynamics or processes in a range of peatland environments. Improved process understanding and more data on rates of erosion at different scales are urgently needed in order to improve model development and enable better predictions of future peat erosion under climate change and land management practices. We identify where further research is required on basic peat erosion processes, application of new and integrated measurement of different variables and the impact of drivers or mitigation techniques that may affect peat erosion.

AB In the UK, drainage for agricultural reclamation during the 19th and 20th centuries is responsible for an alteration of the ecological and hydrological functioning of peatlands, in turn, affecting a whole suite of ecosystem services. Today, initiatives are in place throughout the UK to reinstate this eco-hydrological functioning by blocking drainage ditches. Effects on ecosystem services remain unclear, as does the overlapping impact of climate change on peatland recovery. This article uses a conceptual model to present the effects of restoration on ecosystem services, that is, water provision and quality, carbon storage, biodiversity, food and fibre provision and cultural services, both immediately after ditch blocking and in the few years post-restoration. The model is then applied in the context of Exmoor National Park, in South West England and used to perform a costbenefit analysis of the restoration and monitoring programme, as these shallow peatlands are located in geographically marginal areas, and therefore more sensitive to climate change. Past research indicates that some processes tend to return progressively to their predisturbance state, but whether the complete recovery of peatlands to functioning mires occurs after restoration remains unclear, partly due to the difference between the temporal and spatial scale at which processes occur (i.e. up to decadal) and are monitored (typically a few years). Overall, on Exmoor, the long-term benefit of peatland restoration to some ecosystem services, such as a reduction in carbon losses and improvement of water storage and quality, has the potential to balance high financial investment. Synthesis and applications. Gaining a better understanding of the effects of peatland restoration on ecosystem services provided is essential to assess the potential value of restoration projects. Using the case of the shallow peatlands of Exmoor National Park, located in geographically marginal areas in the UK and therefore more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, we find that there is potential for both the value of carbon storage and water provision to offset the costs of restoration in the long-term. Our results from Exmoor can provide ecological analogues of impending change further north.

AB Forest landscapes represent the major land-cover type for the watersheds of the East River, which is the source of water for 40 million people in South China. Forest soils with high levels of organic carbon are a potential terrestrial source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the East River. DOC is of great concern, since it can form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. In this study, soils from three altitudes (200, 450 and 900 m) in the Xiangtou Mountain Nature Reserve in South China, representing soils from evergreen moon forest, transitional evergreen broadleaf forest, and evergreen broadleaf forest, respectively, were evaluated for their potential contributions of DBP precursors into the East River. The water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in three forest soils was physically and chemically fractionated into particulate organic carbon (1.2-0.45 mm), colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.22 mu m), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (<0.22 mu m), hydrophobic acid (HPOA), transphilic acid and hydrophilic acid and were analysed for the formation potentials of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and chloral hydrate (CHD). Also, soils were incubated at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C for 14 d in darkness to examine the impact of temperature effects on the availability and characteristics of WEOC. The extraction study showed that the amount of WEOC was proportional to soil organic carbon content, of which about 1% was water extractable. Regardless of soil type, DOC and HPOA were the most reactive fractions in forming THMs, CHD, and HANs. Production of DOC and HPOA in WEOC increased over 14 d incubation as incubation temperature increased, but the temperature did not alter the distribution of physical and chemical fractions and their reactivity in DBP formation. Results suggest higher inputs of DOC and DBP precursors from forest watersheds into source water may result in a warmer environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange within saline boreal fens, appropriate natural analogs for landscape reclamation in areas affected by salinization in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, can provide insights into the biogeochemical and carbon sink functioning of constructed wetlands under saline conditions. Hence, this study aims to assess net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) of peatland and open-water areas within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) to determine environmental controls on CO(2)fluxes using community-scale CO(2)measurements along a salinity gradient. Strong positive correlations between NEE, GEP, leaf area index within peatland, and between GEP and vegetation density within open-water areas (ponds) were observed, demonstrating the importance of vegetation properties for carbon uptake. Strong negative correlations were found between NEE, GEP, R and water table depth and electrical conductivity within peatland. In contrast, GEP and R were positively correlated with phosphate concentrations in ponds, and electrical conductivity had no effect on CO(2)fluxes within ponds. In peatlands, links between CO(2)exchange and environmental factors were influenced by microtopography, and complex relationships between NEE, GEP, R and environmental variables were observed within depressions.

AB Heat was used as a natural tracer to characterize shallow ground water flow beneath a complex wetland system. Hydrogeologic data were combined with measured vertical temperature profiles to constrain a series of two-dimensional, transient simulations of ground water flow and heat transport using the model code SUTRA (Voss 1990). The measured seasonal temperature signal reached depths of 2.7 m beneath the pond. Hydraulic conductivity was varied in each of the layers in the model in a systematic manual calibration of the two-dimensional.model to obtain the best fit to the measured temperature and hydraulic head. Results of a series of representative best-fit simulations represent a range in hydraulic conductivity values that had the best agreement between simulated and observed temperatures and that resulted in simulated pond seepage values within 1 order of magnitude of pond seepage estimated from the water budget. Resulting estimates of ground water discharge to an adjacent agricultural drainage ditch were used to estimate potential dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loads resulting from the restored wetland. Estimated DOC loads ranged from 45 to 1340 g C/(m(2) year), which is higher than estimated DOC loads from surface water. In spite of the complexity in characterizing ground water flow in peat soils, using heat as a tracer provided a constrained estimate of subsurface flow from the pond to the agricultural drainage ditch.

AB Temperate wetlands have been undergoing increased nitrogen (N) inputs in the past decades, yet its influence on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics is still elusive in these ecosystems. Here, using a field multi-level N addition (0, 6,12, and 24 g N m(-2) year(-1)) experiment, we investigated the changes in aboveground plant biomass, DOC production from plant litters, DOC biodegradation, and DOC concentration in surface water and soil pore water (0-15 cm depth) following 10 years of N addition in a freshwater marsh of Northeast China. We observed that, irrespective of N addition levels, N addition caused an increase in DOC production from plant litters under both non-flooded and flooded conditions. Conversely, DOC biodegradation was inhibited by N addition in both surface water and soil pore water. Because of enhanced DOC production from plant litters and declined DOC biodegradation, N addition elevated DOC concentration in surface water and soil pore water across the growing season. In addition, long-term N addition increased aboveground plant biomass, but decreased species richness. Our results suggest that long-term N enrichment promotes DOC accumulation through the contrasting effects on litter-derived DOC production and microbial decomposition of DOC in temperate wetlands.

AB Northern peatlands are increasingly threatened by climate change and industrial activities. This study examined the impact of simulated droughts on pore water chemistry at six peatlands in Sudbury, Ontario, that differ in copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) contamination, including a site that had been previously limed. All sites responded similarly to simulated drought: pore water pH declined significantly following the 30 day drought and the decline was greater following the 60 day drought treatment. The decline in pore water pH was due to increasing sulphate concentrations, whereas nitrate increased more in the 60 day drought treatment. Decreases in pH were accompanied by large increases in Ni and Co that greatly exceeded provincial water quality guidelines. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased significantly following drought, along with concentrations of Cu and Al, which are strongly complexed by organic acids.

AB Dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) fluxes at eight headwater basins in south-central Ontario were strongly related to seasonal streamflow, and extreme events contributed to both interannual and intercatchment variability. Six catchments with high stream DOC and greater peatland coverage exhibited a different seasonal pattern of DOC concentration compared with two catchments with low DOC and less wetland influence. In wetland-dominated catchments, DOC concentrations decreased during fall wet-up and spring melt, and because of the dominance of the spring melt period in annual budgets, variations in spring flow explained 39%-48% of the intervariability in DOC concentration. Significant increases in average DOC concentration between 1980 and 2001 at all six wetland-dominated catchments were driven by relatively high DOC concentrations in the latter years of record, consistent with low spring flow in these years, and were not translated into greater DOC export to downstream lakes. Localized rainstorms in summer and fall resulted in differences in DOC export among adjacent catchments, and a single fall storm in September 1998 was only detected at one of six catchments draining into Harp Lake but accounted for one-quarter of the annual tributary DOC load to the lake.

AB Given the continuing concern about rising concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water leaving peat-covered catchments, this study has considered the impact of managed burning or cutting of Calluna vulgaris, a dominant vegetation cover in many UK peatlands. Pristine mature Calluna stands were compared with those that had been subject to cutting and or managed burning up to 5years after intervention. The study measured the DOC concentration of both soil and surface runoff water over a period of 12months in comparison with water table depth, conductivity, and pH. The results show the following: The depth to the water table decreases upon both burnt and cut sites relative to controls in line with a change in evapotranspiration due to loss of vegetation. The DOC concentration of surface runoff water was not significantly different (P<0.05) between any of the treatments and the control. The DOC concentration in soil water significantly (P<0.05) decreased with both burning and cutting, but these differences could be explained by differences in water table and changes in flowpath through the soil profile. The study suggests that declines in soil water DOC concentration are brought about as different levels in the peat profile become the dominant source of water due to changes in the depth to water table. Changes in the depth to water table were brought about by changes in evapotranspiration that result from the loss of vegetation. The changes in water table mean that this mechanism may explain other observations of DOC concentration change with management. Cutting and burning may represent a management intervention that could be effective at reversing the current trends in DOC transfers from peat-covered catchments.

AB Permafrost peatlands are hydrological and biogeochemical hotspots in the discontinuous permafrost zone. Non-intrusive geophysical methods offer a possibility to map current permafrost spatial distributions in these environments. In this study, we estimate the depths to the permafrost table and base across a peatland in northern Sweden, using ground penetrating radar and electrical resistivity tomography. Seasonal thaw frost tables (at similar to 0.5 m depth), taliks (2.1-6.7 m deep), and the permafrost base (at similar to 16 m depth) could be detected. Higher occurrences of taliks were discovered at locations with a lower relative height of permafrost landforms, which is indicative of lower ground ice content at these locations. These results highlight the added value of combining geophysical techniques for assessing spatial distributions of permafrost within the rapidly changing sporadic permafrost zone. For example, based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation for the site considered here, we estimated that the permafrost could thaw completely within the next 3 centuries. Thus there is a clear need to benchmark current permafrost distributions and characteristics, particularly in under studied regions of the pan-Arctic.

AB Streams draining upland catchments carry large quantities of carbon from terrestrial stocks to downstream freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here it either enters long-term storage in sediments or enters the atmosphere as gaseous carbon through a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. There are, however, increasing concerns over the long-term stability of terrestrial carbon stores in blanket peatland catchments as a result of anthropogenic pressures and climate change. We analysed sub-annual and interannual changes in river water colour (a reliable proxy measurement of dissolved organic carbon; DOC) using 6 years of weekly data, from 2011 to 2016. This time-series dataset was gathered from three contiguous river sub-catchments, the Black, the Glenamong and the Srahrevagh, in a blanket peatland catchment system in western Ireland, and it was used to identify the drivers that best explained observed temporal change in river colour. The data were also used to estimate annual DOC loads from each catchment. General additive mixed modelling was used to identify the principle environmental drivers of water colour in the rivers, while wavelet cross-correlation analysis was used to identify common frequencies in correlations. At 130 mg Pt Co L-1, the mean colour levels in the Srahrevagh (the sub-catchment with lowest rainfall and higher forest cover) were almost 50% higher than those from the Black and Glenamong, at 95 and 84 mg Pt Co L-1 respectively. The decomposition of the colour datasets revealed similar multi-annual, annual and event-based (random component) trends, illustrating that environmental drivers operated synchronously at each of these temporal scales. For both the Black and its nested Srahrevagh catchment, three variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit, SMD, and the weekly North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) combined to explain 54% and 58% of the deviance in colour respectively. In the Glenamong, which had steeper topography and a higher percentage of peat intersected by streams, soil temperature, the log of stream discharge and the NAO explained 66% of the colour concentrations. Crosswavelet time-series analysis between river colour and each environmental driver revealed a significant high common power relationship at an annual time step. Each relationship however, varied in phase, further highlighting the complexity of the mechanisms driving river colour in the subcatchments. The estimated mean annual DOC loads for the Black and Glenamong rivers to Lough Feeagh were similar at 15.0 and 14.7 t C km(-2) yr(-1) respectively. The important role of past and current precipitation and, in particular, temperature emphasises the vulnerability of blanket peatland carbon stores to projected climate change and highlights the interaction of local and regional climate in controlling aquatic carbon export. Our results show that water colour (and hence DOC) concentrations can vary considerably between neighbouring catchments and also that regional-scale climatic drivers control the trends in intra-and inter-annual flux of DOC through the system. The combination of locally determined concentrations and regionally controlled fluxes produces aquatic DOC loads that vary over both the annual cycle and over multiple years.

We have determined the share of biologically accessible organic carbon in the value of total organic carbon in the course of biofiltration. It has been shown that the generation of biologically accessible organic carbon on oxidized carbon begins earlier than on unoxidized one and results in a larger dynamic adsorption capacity of carbon in terms of fulvic acids.

AB We examined the chemical composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) from two pristine and two polluted cedar bog wetlands across three seasons. Pristine and polluted wetlands differed in DOC and DON concentrations, chemical characteristics, and bioavailability. DOC and DON concentrations were higher in the polluted than in the pristine wetlands. In contrast, a higher percentage of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) was more aromatic in the pristine (54% +/- 19) than in the polluted (27% +/- 4) wetlands. A higher percentage of DOC was bioavailable in the pristine (22% +/- 9) than the polluted (12% +/- 4) wetlands. A similar percentage of DON was consumed in both the pristine (33% +/- 25) and polluted (28% +/- 25) wetlands. Seasonally, the bioavailability of DOC and DON varied and differed between the pristine and polluted wetlands. The availability of phosphate appeared to affect the amount of DOC incorporated into bacterial biomass, whereas inorganic nutrient availability did not affect the assimilation of DON. Bioavailable DOC primarily fueled bacterial respiration, whereas DON supported bacterial growth. Overall, our results demonstrate that anthropogenic activities and season affect the quantity and quality of wetland DOM exported to rivers and that different factors control the utilization and fate of DOC and DON within the bacterial community.

AB The production and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat soils is thought to be sensitive to changes in climate, specifically changes in temperature and rainfall. However, little is known about the actual rates of net DOC production in response to temperature and water table draw-down, particularly in comparison to carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fluxes. To explore these relationships, we carried out a laboratory experiment on intact peat soil cores under controlled temperature and water table conditions to determine the impact and interaction of each of these climatic factors on net DOC production. We found a significant interaction (P < 0.001) between temperature, water table draw-down and net DOC production across the whole soil core (0 to -55 cm depth). This corresponded to an increase in the Q(10) (i.e. rise in the rate of net DOC production over a 10 degrees C range) from 1.84 under high water tables and anaerobic conditions to 3.53 under water table draw-down and aerobic conditions between -10 and - 40 cm depth. However, increases in net DOC production were only seen after water tables recovered to the surface as secondary changes in soil water chemistry driven by sulphur redox reactions decreased DOC solubility, and therefore DOC concentrations, during periods of water table draw-down. Furthermore, net microbial consumption of DOC was also apparent at - 1 cm depth and was an additional cause of declining DOC concentrations during dry periods. Therefore, although increased temperature and decreased rainfall could have a significant effect on net DOC release from peatlands, these climatic effects could be masked by other factors controlling the biological consumption of DOC in addition to soil water chemistry and DOC solubility. These findings highlight both the sensitivity of DOC release from ombrotrophic peat to episodic changes in water table draw-down, and the need to disentangle complex and interacting controls on DOC dynamics to fully understand the impact of environmental change on this system.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas accounting for 60% of the total greenhouse effect. Soil is a major source for atmospheric CO2. In the event of growing threats of global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, reducing CO2 emission by sequestering C in the soil is of prime importance. Soil management practices like increasing soil organic carbon content, reduced tillage, manuring, residue incorporation, improving soil biodiversity, micro-aggregation and mulching can play an important role in sequestering C in soil.

AB There is emerging concern over the impact of extreme events such as heavy rainfall on the quality of water entering the drinking water supply from aboveground sources, as such events are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency in response to climate change. We compared the impact of rainfall events on streamwater quality in four contrasting upland (peatland and mineral soil) and lowland agricultural catchments used to supply drinking water in France (Brittany) and the United Kingdom (North Wales) by analyzing water samples collected before, during, and after specific events. At all four streams, heavy rainfall led to a considerable rise in organic matter concentration ranging from 48 to 158%. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quality, as determined using specific ultraviolet absorbance, changed consistently at all sites during rainfall events, with a greater proportion of aromatic and higher molecular weight compounds following the onset of rainfall. However, the change in DOC quality and quantity did not significantly alter the trihalomethane formation potential. We observed small increases in trihalomethane (THM) generation only at the Welsh peatland and agricultural sites and a small decrease at the Brittany agricultural site. The proportion of brominated THMs in chlorinated waters was positively correlated with bromide/DOC ratio in raw waters for all sites and hydrological conditions. These results provide a first indication of the potential implications for surface-based drinking water resources resulting from expected future increases in rainfall event intensity and extension of dry periods with climate changes.

AB A series of samples taken during a rain storm from two streams feeding into a small lake were analysed for major ions and radiocaesium. Changes in Cs-137 content in both streams showed no relationship to ammonia or dissolved organic carbon concentrations, suggesting that neither competition at illitic frayed-edge sites nor chelation of radiocaesium were important remobilization processes. One stream contained significantly higher dissolved radiocaesium concentrations than the other. In the former stream, peaks and troughs in radiocaesium concentrations corresponded with changes in calcium, pH and alkalinity. However the pH was related directly with the radiocaesium, whereas the proposed mechanism of humic mediated sorption to solids would infer an inverse relationship with pH. The positive Ca and pH relationships with radiocaesium implied that, in the flooded fibrous-peat soils (peat bogs) encountered in its subcatchment, radiocaesium was sorbed to the soils by simple ion exchange processes.

AB A small peatland catchment in eastern Finland was monitored for runoff and export of dissolved organic carbon. To exemplify the response of a peatland under years of different meteorological conditions, data from one very dry and one wet growing season are presented. Runoff was 194 and 387 mm, and DOC export was 4.2 and 11.3 gC m(-2) in the dry and wet year respectively. Analysis of the hydrographs showed that in both years most runoff and DOC export was generated during peak flow events, with low baseflow in the intermediate periods. Runoff response to rain events was strongest under a high water table in the spring and autumn, with a summer runoff minimum. The effect of drought on runoff occurred only after mid June when the effects of snowmelt had dissipated. Snowmelt therefore dominated DOC export in the dry year (61%) but contributed much less (29%) in the wet year. The relationship between runoff and the water table was highly similar in both years. Any variation that was observed herein was potentially related to a superficial subsidence of the peat surface under drier summer conditions and to raised spring water levels, causing restricted drainage due to flooding. The observed variation of DOC concentrations in both years generally had a limited impact on DOC export. During peak runoff events, concentrations dropped proportionally to the magnitude Of the events. This decrease in available DOC is argued to be caused by a dominance of leaching over supply and production and by the specific hydraulic characteristics of the peatland surface. DOC concentrations were some 25% higher under drought conditions. These elevated concentrations were dispelled by spring snowmelt of the next year, demonstrating that a winter snowpack in boreal regions may be instrumental in limiting the longer term hydrological and biochemical effects of a drought.

AB in order to investigate the relation between water chemistry and functional landscape elements, spatial data sets of characteristics for 68 small (0.2-1.5 km(2)) boreal forest catchments in western central Sweden were analysed in a geographical information system (GIS). The geographic data used were extracted from official topographic maps. Water sampled four times at different flow situations was analysed chemically. This paper focuses on one phenomenon that has an important influence on headwater quality in boreal, coniferous forest streams: generation and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). It is known that wetland cover (bogs and fens) in the catchment is a major source of DOC. In this study, a comparison was made between a large number of headwater catchments with varying spatial locations and areas of wetlands. How this variation, together with a number of other spatial variables, influences the DOC flux in the streamwater was analysed by statistical methods. There were significant, but not strong, correlations between the total percentages of wetland area and DOC flux measured at a medium flow situation, but not at high flow. Neither were there any significant correlations between the percentage of wetland area connected to streams, nor the percentage of wetland area within a zone 50 m from the stream and the DOC flux. There were, however, correlations between catchment mean slope and the DOC flux in all but one flow situations. This study showed that, considering geographical data retrieved from official sources, the topography of a catchment better explains the variation in DOC flux than the percentage and locations of distinct wetland areas. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution elevation models accurate enough to reveal the sources of DOC found in headwater streams. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Trihalomethanes (THMs) are conditionally carcinogenic compounds formed during chlorine disinfection in water treatment processes around the world. THMs occur especially when source waters are subject to marine influences, high and-or regular precipitation, and elevated levels of organic matter. THMs formation is then rooted in geographic, operational and climatic factors, the relative importance of which can only be derived from large datasets and may change in the future. Ninety three full-scale Scottish water treatment plants (WTPs) were assessed from Jan 2011 to Jan 2013 to identify factors that promote THMs formation. Correlation analysis showed that ambient temperature was the primary THMs formation predictor in potable water (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.05) and water distribution systems (r(2) = 0.43, p = 0.04), while dissolved organic carbon (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.001) and chloride (indicating marine influence; r(2) = 0.41, p < 0.001) also affected THMs formation. GIS mapping of median THMs levels indicated brominated THMs were most prevalent in coastal areas and on islands. This real-world dataset confirms both geographic and climatic factors are key to THMs formation. If ambient temperatures increase, THMs control will become more challenging, substantiating concerns about the impact of global warming on water quality.

ID STATE C-13 NMR; DECOMPOSITION; ORIGIN
AB A wetland restoration demonstration project examined the effects of a permanently Hooded wetland on subsidence of peat soils. The project, started in 1997, was done on Twitchell Island, in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Conversion of agricultural land to a wetland has changed many of the biogeochemical processes controlling dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release from the peat soils, relative to the previous land use. Dissolved organic C in delta waters is a concern because it reacts with chlorine, added as a disinfectant in municipal drinking waters, to form carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs), including trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). This study explores the effects of peat soil, biogeochemistry on DOC and DBP release under agricultural and wetland management. Results indicate that organic matter source, extent of soil organic matter decomposition, and decomposition pathways all are factors in THM formation. The results show that historical management practices dominate the release of DOC and THM precursors. However, within-site differences indicate that recent management decisions can contribute to changes in DOC quality and THM precursor formation. Not all aromatic forms of carbon are highly reactive and certain environmental conditions produce the specific carbon structures that form THMs. Both HAA and THM precursors are elevated in the DOC released under wetland conditions. The findings of this study emphasize the need to further investigate the roles of organic matter sources, microbial decomposition pathways, and decomposition status of soil organic matter in the release of DOC and DBP precursors from delta soils under varying land-use practices.

AB The fruticose lichens Cladina stellaris and Cladina rangiferina, form thick mats that can cover large areas of northern peatlands (above c. 50 degrees latitude), including the extensive peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) in Canada, where lichens may cover up to 50% of the landscape. Despite the abundance of lichens in northern peatlands, our understanding of their role within peatland ecosystems, and peat accumulation in particular, is limited. We investigate the potential effect of these mat-forming lichens on peat production and decomposition processes, using field data from an ombrogenous bog in the HBL and laboratory analyses. We hypothesize that (a) production in lichen-shrub hummocks is less than in Sphagnum-shrub hummocks; (b) the decay of lichen litter is faster than that of Sphagnum moss, so the mass litter input to the peat profile is reduced; and (c) faster decomposition of the underlying peat is stimulated by lichen leachates, resulting in greater mass loss. We found that thick lichen mats alter vegetation composition in peatlands, reducing Sphagnum cover and inhibiting the growth of small shrubs. Coupled with low lichen productivity that is constrained by moisture conditions, production for lichen-shrub hummocks is significantly smaller than for Sphagnum-shrub hummocks, confirming hypothesis (a). Our data also support hypothesis (b), with chemical analyses of lichen mats and leachates from lichen mats indicating faster decay of lichens compared to Sphagnum moss, and therefore reduced mass litter input to the peat profile in lichen-dominated hummocks. Although we found no evidence to suggest leachates from lichens enhance decomposition processes in peatlands (hypothesis c), larger dry bulk densities for peat under lichen mats indicate a loss of structural integrity and potential collapse of the peat column.Synthesis. As production of new material added to the peat column is less in lichen-dominated hummocks, local peat accumulation slows or ceases, representing a potential temporary limit to peat growth. Our results highlight the importance of lichens as a vegetation feedback in peatland development, with thick mats probably constraining or reducing hummock height relative to adjacent, lichen-free hollows.

AB Three categories of digital wetland maps widely available in the United States were used to develop models relating wetlands to DOC: (1) wetlands mapped by the U.S. National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) (2) wetland vegetation cover mapped by the U.S. National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), and (3) maps of hydric soils. Data extracted from these maps for 27 headwater catchments of the Ontonagon River in northern Michigan, USA were used with DOC concentrations measured in catchment streams to develop stepwise multiple regressions based on wetland area and type. The catchments of the 27 tributaries ranged in area from 2 to 66 km(2) and wetlands constituted 10 to 53% of their area. Although all three databases provided regressions that were highly significant (p<0.001), the variance explained was greater for NWI maps (R-2=0.75) than for NLCD (R-2=0.61) or soil maps (R-2=0.60). Wetland-stream relationships were strongest during September 2002, but were significant for nine out of ten dates sampled during subsequent seasons. The individual wetland type most highly correlated (r>0.62) with stream DOC concentrations was conifer peatland, represented on the NWI maps as Palustrine Needle-leaved Forest, the NLCD maps as woody wetland, and the soil maps as organic soils. For the NWI dataset, DOC was negatively correlated with area of palustrine emergent wetlands (i.e., sedge meadows and graminoid fens) and bog shrubs, inferring that these wetland types may be sinks for DOC. Because of the different effects of wetland vegetation types on DOC, a GIS data source such as the NWI which depicts those wetland types is superior for predicting landscape contributions to stream DOC concentrations.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) turnover in aquatic environments is modulated by the presence of other key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The ratio of these nutrients directly affects the rates of microbial growth and nutrient processing in the natural environment. The aim of this study was to investigate how labile DOC metabolism responds to changes in nutrient stoichiometry using C-14 tracers in conjunction with untargeted analysis of the primary metabolome in upland peat river sediments. N addition led to an increase in C-14-glucose uptake, indicating that the sediments were likely to be primarily N limited. The mineralisation of glucose to (CO2)-C-14 reduced following N addition, indicating that nutrient addition induced shifts in internal carbon (C) partitioning and microbial C use efficiency (CUE). This is directly supported by the metabolomic profile data which identified significant differences in 22 known metabolites (34% of the total) and 30 unknown metabolites (16% of the total) upon the addition of either N or P. C-14-glucose addition increased the production of organic acids known to be involved in mineral P dissolution (e.g. gluconic acid, malic acid). Conversely, when N was not added, the addition of glucose led to the production of the sugar alcohols, mannitol and sorbitol, which are well known microbial C storage compounds. P addition resulted in increased levels of several amino acids (e.g. alanine, glycine) which may reflect greater rates of microbial growth or the P requirement for coenzymes required for amino acid synthesis. We conclude that inorganic nutrient enrichment in addition to labile C inputs has the potential to substantially alter in-stream biogeochemical cycling in oligotrophic freshwaters.

AB Anthropogenic landscape alterations have increased global carbon transported by rivers to oceans since preindustrial times. Few suitable observational data sets exist to distinguish different drivers of carbon increase, given that alterations only reveal their impact on fluvial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over long time periods. We use the world's longest record of DOC concentrations (130years) to identify key drivers of DOC change in the Thames basin (UK). We show that 90% of the long-term rise in fluvial DOC is explained by increased urbanization, which released to the river 671kt C over the entire period. This source of carbon is linked to rising population, due to increased sewage effluent. Soil disturbance from land use change explained shorter-term fluvial responses. The largest land use disturbance was during the Second World War, when almost half the grassland area in the catchment was converted into arable land, which released 45kt C from soils to the river. Carbon that had built up in soils over decades was released to the river in only a few years. Our work suggests that widespread population growth may have a greater influence on fluvial DOC trends than previously thought.

AB Many peatlands have a recent history of being degraded by extraction, drainage, burning, overgrazing and atmospheric pollution often leading to erosion and loss of peat mass. Restoration schemes have been implemented aimed at rewetting peatlands, encouraging revegetation of bare peat or shifting the present vegetation assemblage to an alternative. Here we demonstrate the use of palaeoecological techniques that allow reconstruction of the historical development of a blanket peatland and provide a historical context from which legitimate restoration targets can be determined and supported. We demonstrate the applicability of simple stratigraphic techniques to provide a catchment-wide peatland development history and reinforce this with a detailed macrofossil reconstruction from a central core. Analysis at Keighley Moor Reservoir Catchment in northern England showed that the present vegetation state was 'atypical' and has been characteristic for only the last c. 100 years. Sphagnum moss was an important historic contributor to the vegetation cover between 1500 years ago and the early 1900s. Until the early 1900s Sphagnum occurrence fluctuated with evidence of fire, routinely returning after fire demonstrating good resilience of the ecosystem. However, from the turn of the 20th century, Sphagnum levels declined severely, coincident initially with a wildfire event but remaining extremely diminished as the site regularly underwent managed burning to support grouse moor gun sports where practitioners prefer a dominant cover of heather. It is suggested that any intention to alter land management at the site to raise water tables and encourage greater Sphagnum abundance is in line with peatland development at the site over the past 1500 years. Similar palaeoecological studies providing historical context could provide support for restoration targets and changes to peatland management practice for sites globally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nutrient exports from soils have important implications for long-term patterns of nutrient limitation on land and resource delivery to aquatic environments. While plant-soil systems are notably efficient at retaining limiting nutrients, spatial and temporal mismatches in resource supply and demand may create opportunities for hydrologic losses to occur. Spatial mismatches may be particularly important in peat-forming landscapes, where the development of a two-layer vertical structure can isolate plant communities on the surface from resource pools that accumulate at depth. Our objectives were to test this idea in northern Sweden, where nitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial plants is widespread, and where peat-forming, mire ecosystems are dominant features of the landscape. We quantified vertical patterns of N chemistry in a minerogenic mire, estimated the seasonal and annual hydrologic export of organic and inorganic N from this system, and evaluated the broader influence of mire cover on N chemistry across a stream network. Relatively high concentrations of ammonium (up to 2 mg l(-1)) were observed in groundwater several meters below the peat surface, and N was routed to the outlet stream along deep, preferential flowpaths. Areal estimates of inorganic N export from the mire were several times greater than from an adjacent, forested catchment, with markedly higher loss rates during the growing season, when plant N demand is ostensibly greatest. At broader scales, mire cover was positively correlated with long-term concentrations of inorganic and organic N in streams across the drainage network. This study provides an example of how mire formation and peat accumulation can create broad-scale heterogeneity in nutrient supply and demand across boreal landscapes. This mismatch allows for hydrologic losses of reactive N that are independent of annual plant demand and potentially important to receiving lakes and streams.

AB This study uses long-term water chemistry records for a circum-neutral peat stream to reconstruct a 7-year record of dissolved CO2 and DIC flux from the catchment. Combining catchment flux with a knowledge of in-stream metabolism and gas evasion from the stream surface enables an estimate of the dissolved CO2 content of water emerging from the peat profile to be made; furthermore, these can be used to estimate soil CO2 respiration. In this way multi-annual records of CO2 production can be reconstructed, and therefore inter-annual controls on production examined. The results suggest that:
   (i) Stream evasion Of CO2 within the catchment varied between 80 and 220 g C/m of stream/yr, while in-stream metabolism produces between 1.0 and 2.9 g C/m of stream/yr;
   (ii) Export of dissolved CO2 emerging from the soil profile, above that expected at equilibrium with the atmosphere, varies between 9.6 and 25.6 tonnes, C/km(2)/yr; and
   (iii) The export of dissolved CO2 implies a soil respiration rate of between 64.2 and 94.9 tonnes C/km(2)/yr.
   The inter-annual variation in both dissolved CO2 flux and Soil CO2 respiration Suggests that severe drought has no long-term effect on CO2 production and that temperature-based models Of Soil CO2 respiration will be adequate in all but the severest of summer droughts. The inter-annual variation in CO2 flux shows that CO2 production is decoupled from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production. The decoupling of DOC and dissolved CO2 production shows that enzymatic-latch production of DOC is an anaerobic process and will not increase Soil CO2 respiration.

AB Peatlands are a major natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Emissions from Sphagnum-dominated mires are lower than those measured from other mire types. This observation may partly be due to methanotrophic (i.e., methane-consuming) bacteria associated with Sphagnum. Twenty-three of the 41 Sphagnum species in Finland can be found in the peatland at Lakkasuo. To better understand the Sphagnum-methanotroph system, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) all these Sphagnum species support methanotrophic bacteria; (2) water level is the key environmental determinant for differences in methanotrophy across habitats; (3) under dry conditions, Sphagnum species will not host methanotrophic bacteria; and (4) methanotrophs can move from one Sphagnum shoot to another in an aquatic environment. To address hypotheses 1 and 2, we measured the water table and CH4 oxidation for all Sphagnum species at Lakkasuo in 1-5 replicates for each species. Using this systematic approach, we included Sphagnum spp. with narrow and broad ecological tolerances. To estimate the potential contribution of CH4 to moss carbon, we measured the uptake of delta C-13 supplied as CH4 or as carbon dioxide dissolved in water. To test hypotheses 2-4, we transplanted inactive moss patches to active sites and measured their methanotroph communities before and after transplantation. All 23 Sphagnum species showed methanotrophic activity, confirming hypothesis 1. We found that water level was the key environmental factor regulating methanotrophy in Sphagnum (hypothesis 2). Mosses that previously exhibited no CH4 oxidation became active when transplanted to an environment in which the microbes in the control mosses were actively oxidizing CH4 (hypothesis 4). Newly active transplants possessed a Methylocystis signature also found in the control Sphagnum spp. Inactive transplants also supported a Methylocystis signature in common with active transplants and control mosses, which rejects hypothesis 3. Our results imply a loose symbiosis between Sphagnum spp. and methanotrophic bacteria that accounts for potentially 10-30% of Sphagnum carbon.

AB Prior studies have shown that silicon (Si) increases the dissolution of iron (Fe) phosphates, releasing phosphorus (P) into the soil solution of fen peat and thereby changing the composition of organic matter (OM). We formulated three questions on the occurring processes: [i] Does high Si concentration cause a mobilization of Fe phosphates? [ii] Does this mobilization result in a higher concentration of P, Fe, and dissolved organic carbon? [iii] Are there changes in the composition of organic matter?
   To this end, we conducted a laboratory experiment adding amorphous silica to fen peat and analyzed Fe mineralogy and carbon quality of the peat material by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
   Under high Si concentration, significantly higher concentrations of P and Fe were found in soil solution. Moreover, XAS data indicated a dissolution of Fe (II) phosphates and a change in the composition of OM available to microbes with decreasing contributions of carboxylic groups and quinones.
   We propose to explain the effects as follows: under high Si concentration Fe (II) phosphates dissolve and OM rich in carboxylic groups are mobilized. As the nutrient concentration in the soil solution increased, the degradation of oxidized components of the OM, such as quinones and carboxylic groups is enhanced.

AB Climate change projections show that temperature and precipitation increases can alter the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and high latitude landscapes, including their freshwaters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, but the impact of catchment productivity on DOC release to subarctic waters remains poorly known, especially at regional scales. We test the hypothesis that increased terrestrial productivity, as indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), generates higher stream DOC concentrations in the Stordalen catchment in subarctic Sweden. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the degree to which other generic catchment properties (elevation, slope) explain DOC concentration, and whether or not land cover variables representing the local vegetation type (e.g., mire, forest) need to be included to obtain adequate predictive models for DOC delivered into rivers. We show that the land cover type, especially the proportion of mire, played a dominant role in the catchment's release of DOC, while NDVI, slope, and elevation were supporting predictor variables. The NDVI as a single predictor showed weak and inconsistent relationships to DOC concentrations in recipient waters, yet NDVI was a significant positive regulator of DOC in multiple regression models that included land cover variables. Our study illustrates that vegetation type exerts primary control in DOC regulation in Stordalen, while productivity (NDVI) is of secondary importance. Thus, predictive multiple linear regression models for DOC can be utilized combining these different types of explanatory variables.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the major drinking water source for 23 million California residents. Consequently, many studies have examined disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in relation to Delta dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. However, DOC characteristics within the Delta are not the same as those entering downstream water treatment facilities. As water is transferred to Southern California through the California Aqueduct, a 714.5 km-open channel, it is exposed to sunlight, potentially altering DBP precursors. We collected water from three sites within the Delta and one near the California Aqueduct, representing different DOC sources, and irradiated them in a solar simulator at a dose equivalent to that received during four days conveyance in the aqueduct. Photolytic changes in DOC were assessed by measuring CO(2) and organic acid production, fluorescence, and ultraviolet absorbance over time. Trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) formation potentials, as well as the distribution of hydrophobic, transphilic, and hydrophilic acid fractions were determined at exposures equivalent to one and four days. Solar irradiation significantly decreased ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence intensity, produced organic acids, and increased the hydrophilic fraction of waters. These changes in DOC caused a shift in bromine incorporation among the THM and HAA species. Our results are the first to demonstrate the importance of sunlight in altering DOC with respect to DBP formation.

AB Considerable fractions of the Hg content of lake and river systems in Scandinavia are discharged from the soil of the catchments. An important soil type in Scandinavia is the iron-humus podzol. The sorption characteristics of this soil type for inorganic Hg(II) and monomethyl mercury were investigated by batch experiments. The solubility of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ in the soil horizons containing organic matter increases with increasing pH of the soil solution by favoring the formation of solute organic matter-mercury complexes. While the solubility of Hg2+ is strongly dependent on complexation to dissolved organic matter, the solubility of CH3Hg+ is more dependent on ion exchange. The concentration of solute inorganic Hg(II) increased with increasing temperature probably because of an increase in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon. There was no effect of temperature on the concentration of solute CH2Hg+. A pH values were inorganic mercury-hydroxo complexes are formed, inorganic Hg(II) is efficiently sorbed to the metal oxides of the mineral soil. The soil-water distributions of inorganic Hg(II) in the different soil horizons were described by Freundlich isotherms or linear isotherms for common and contaminated mercury contents in the soils.

AB Shredder residues of end-of-life vehicles and white goods are a complex waste stream, which nowadays most often is disposed of at industrial landfills. This paper describes the most important findings concerning the complex composition of the landfill leachate and its on-site, year-round treatment under cold-climate conditions. A 3-year investigation has confirmed that concentrations of different types of pollutants, most of them at low initial concentrations, can be simultaneously reduced in vertical-flow biofilters consisting of a mixture of peat and carbon-containing ash. For metals such as Mn, Cu, Sn, Cd, Pb, Fe and Ni the average removal was 73, 72, 66, 60, 55, 55 and 37%, respectively. An average reduction of NH(4)-N (45%), N(tot) (25%), total organic carbon (30%), dissolved organic carbon (28%) and suspended solids (38%) was also obtained. A good reduction was achieved for phenols (between 75 and 95%), polychlorinated biphenyls (between 22 and 99%), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry amenable pollutants, considered at initial concentration above 50 mu g L(-1) (between 80 and 100%). The performance of the biofilter system was good in spite of large variations of inlet concentration during the considered period.

AB Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on northern peatland biogeochemistry was studied in a short-term experiment. Eight intact soil cores (11-cm diameter x 40-cm depth) with Juncus and Festuca spp. were collected from a calcareous fen in north Wales. Half of the cores were incubated under 350 ppm CO2 concentration, whilst the other four cores were maintained at 700 ppm CO2. After a 4-month incubation, significantly higher biomass (root + shoot + algal mat) was determined under elevated CO2 conditions. Higher emissions of N2O and CO2 and higher concentration of pore-water DOC (dissolved organic carbon) were also observed under elevated CO2. However, no significant differences were found in CH4 emission or soil enzyme activities (beta -glucosidase, phosphatase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase) in the bulk soil. Overall, the results suggest that elevated CO2 would increase the primary productivity of the fen vegetation, and stimulate N2O and CO2 emissions as a consequence of an enhanced DOC supply from the vegetation to the soil microbes.

AB We studied in 2013 and 2014 the spring carbon dynamics in a Boreal landscape consisting of a lake and 15 inflowing streams and an outlet. The first year had weather and a hydrological regime typical of past years with a distinct spring freshet connected with the thaw of the average snowpack. The latter year had higher air temperatures which did not permit snow accumulation, despite similar winter precipitation. As such, there was hardly any spring freshet in 2014, and stream discharge peaked in January, i.e., the conditions resembled those predicted in the future climate. Despite the hydrological differences between the years, there were only small interannual differences in the stream CO2 and DOC concentrations. The relationship between the concentrations and discharge was stronger in the typical year. CO2 concentrations in medium-sized streams correlated negatively with the discharge, indicating dilution effect of melting snowpacks, while in large-sized streams the correlation was positive, suggesting stronger groundwater influence. The DOC pathway to these streams was through the subsurface soil layers, not the groundwater. The total amount of carbon transported into the lake was ca. 1.5-fold higher in the typical year than in the year with warm winter. In 2013, most of the lateral inputs took place during spring freshet. In 2014, the majority of inputs occurred earlier, during the winter months. The lateral CO2 signal was visible in the lake at 1.5 m depth. DOC dominated the carbon transport, and in both years, 12% of the input C was in inorganic form.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate how three vascular plant species (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum) colonising an abandoned cutover peatland affect fluxes of recent photosynthate to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil and plant respiration and shoot biomass. We used in situ (13)CO(2) pulse labelling to trace carbon (C) throughout a 65 day pulse chase period. Between 16 and 35% of the pulse of (13)C remained in shoot biomass after 65 days with significant differences between C. vulgaris and E. angustifolium (P = 0.009) and between C. vulgaris and E. vaginatum (P= 0.04). A maximum of 29% was detected in DOC beneath labelled plants and losses of (13)C from peat respiration never exceeded 0.16% of the original pulse, showing that little newly fixed C was allocated to this pool. There were no significant differences between the different plant species with respect to (13)C recovered from DOC or via peat respiration. More C was lost via shoot respiration; although amounts varied between the three plant species, with 4.94-27.33% of the (13)C pulse respired by the end of the experiment. Significant differences in (13)C recovered from shoot respiration were found between C. vulgaris and E. angustifolium (P = 0.001) and between E. angustifolium and E. vaginaturn (P = 0.032). Analysis of delta(13)C of microbial biomass indicated that recently assimilated C was allocated to this pool within 1 day of pulse labelling but there were no significant differences in the (13)C enrichment of the microbial biomass associated with the different plant species. The data suggest that peat respiration represents a small flux of. recent assimilate compared to other fluxes and pools and that different vascular plant species show considerable variation in the quantities and dynamics of C allocated to DOC.

AB Spatial and temporal variability in surface water chemistry, organic soil chemistry and hydrologic indicators were investigated at three poor-fen complexes in two boreal catchments in Northern Alberta to provide insight into the dominant controls on surface water chemistry. Improved understanding of these controls is required to enable prediction of runoff chemistry in the region under changing atmospheric deposition conditions. Surface water chemistry exhibited considerable variability; within each fen conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Cl(-) tended to decrease and pH tended to increase with increasing distance from the lake edge. Variations in evaporative isotopic enrichment in (2)H and (18)O, expressed as deuterium excess, were used to distinguish between throughflow waters and those that were more evaporatively enriched. Throughflow surface waters were more acidic primarily due to higher concentrations of DOC and NO(3)(-). Exchangeable base saturation and pH of organic soils were strongly related to surface water chemistry at two of the fen complexes, demonstrating the capacity for cation exchange to influence surface water chemistry. Fen surface water concentrations of most elements and DOC increased during the summer period (between June and August), while pH of water decreased. Evaporative concentration of the surface waters was a dominant driver, with surface water temperature increasing at both catchments. Localized groundwater discharge was an important contributor of base cations to the fens, while the organic soils are sinks for atmospherically deposited SO(4)(2-), N and Cl(-).

AB Anthropogenically deposited lead (Pb) binds efficiently to soil organic matter, which can be mobilized through hydrologically mediated mechanisms, with implications for ecological and potable quality of receiving waters. Lead isotopic (Pb-206/Pb-207) ratios change down peat profiles as a consequence of long-term temporal variation in depositional sources each with, distinctive isotopic signatures. This study characterizes differential Pb transport mechanisms from deposition to streams at two small catchments with contrasting soil types in upland Wales, U.K., by determining Pb concentrations and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios from soil core profiles, interstitial pore waters, and stream water. Hydrological characteristics of soils are instrumental in determining the location in soil profiles of exported Pb and hence concentration and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in surface waters. The highest Pb concentrations from near-surface soils are mobilized, concomitant with high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from hydrologically responsive peat soils with, preferential shallow subsurface flows, leading to increased Pb concentrations in stream water and isotopic signatures more closely resembling recently deposited Pb. In more minerogenic soils, percolation of water allows Pb, bound to DOC, to be retained in mineral horizons and combined with other groundwater sources, resulting in Pb being transported from throughout the profile with a more geogenic isotopic signature. This study shows that Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios can enhance our understanding of the provenances and transport mechanisms of Pb and potentially organic matter within upland soils.

AB Peatland streams have repeatedly been shown to be highly supersaturated in both CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, and in combination with dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) represent a potentially important pathway for catchment greenhouse gas (GHG) and carbon (C) losses. The aim of this study was to create a complete C and GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) budget for Auchencorth Moss, an ombrotrophic peatland in southern Scotland, by combining flux tower, static chamber and aquatic flux measurements from 2 consecutive years. The sink/source strength of the catchment in terms of both C and GHGs was compared to assess the relative importance of the aquatic pathway. During the study period (2007-2008) the catchment functioned as a net sink for GHGs (352 g CO2-Eq m-2 yr-1) and C (69.5 g C m-2 yr-1). The greatest flux in both the GHG and C budget was net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Terrestrial emissions of CH4 and N2O combined returned only 4% of CO2 equivalents captured by NEE to the atmosphere, whereas evasion of GHGs from the stream surface returned 12%. DOC represented a loss of 24% of NEE C uptake, which if processed and evaded downstream, outside of the catchment, may lead to a significant underestimation of the actual catchment-derived GHG losses. The budgets clearly show the importance of aquatic fluxes at Auchencorth Moss and highlight the need to consider both the C and GHG budgets simultaneously.

AB Relationships were determined between methane (CH4) production and in situ conditions within the permafrost active layer during a single melt season at Stordalen, Sweden, with a specific emphasis on temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis. In situ temperature, moisture, pH, dissolved organic carbon, and CH4 concentration data were measured at three contrasting active layer sites (sedge mire, Sphagnum mire, and ombrotrophic bog), and laboratory incubations of active layer material were subsequently employed to determine the sensitivity of CH4 production to temperature. Q(10) values, describing the CH4 production response of peat to a temperature change of 10 degrees C, ranged from 1.9 to 3.5 and 2.4 to 5.8 for the sedge and Sphagnum mire sites, respectively. A wider review of the literature on Q(10) responses of methanogenesis in northern peatlands shows similar features to the temperature response of CH4 production in the active layer at Stordalen. In general, Q(10) to values are not significantly different in Arctic permafrost wetlands than non-Arctic northern wetlands; however, Sphagnum sites display Q(10) responses (mean Q(10) = 8) that are notably greater than that of wetter minerotrophic-sedge environments (mean Q(10) = 4.3). This finding has implications for the parameterization of Q(10) factors in numerical carbon cycling models, and suggests that the use of spatially variable Q(10) values could be a useful approach for more accurate modeling of CH4 fluxes front northern wetlands under different climatic change scenarios.

AB This study considers long-term records of the nature of water colour and coincident water quality and quantity in order to test hypotheses about increases in release of dissolved organic carbon from peat soils across the northern hemisphere. The study focuses upon the treatment ratio, e. the ratio of the amount of coagulant dose required to the water colour of the incoming water, and compares this ratio to possible explanatory variables: pH, conductivity, water temperature, river flow and alkalinity. The study shows that:
   (i) The annual average increase in treatment ratio is just less than 6.5% over a six year period.
   (ii) There is a long-term increase in the treatment ratio that is independent of changes in riverflow, pH, conductivity, water temperature and alkalinity and so a real change in DOC composition is occurring.
   (iii) There is a seasonal cycle in treatment ratio that is also independent of the available water and climate variables.
   (iv) The upward trend in treatment ratio is declining with time over the study period.
   The observed trends in DOC composition are consistent with an explanation of increasing DOC concentration and flux based upon changes in flow and temperature but is not consistent with present explanations based upon changes in atmospheric deposition or upon drought unless the effect of the drought are short-lived (1-2 years).

AB Peatland pipes are large natural macropores that contribute significantly to streamflow and represent a potentially important transport pathway between terrestrial and aquatic/atmospheric systems. Our study aimed to estimate the contribution of pipe flow to catchment-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) losses (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in a British peatland using a combination of fortnightly spot and continuous sensor measurements. Interpipe variability was high for all GHGs. Mean pipe water concentrations ranged from 0.70 to 6.51 mg C L-1, 0.90 to 897 mu g C L-1, and 0.36 to 1.36 mu g N L-1 for CO2, CH4, and N2O, respectively. High-resolution CO2 data showed temporal changes in the connectivity between pipes and the surrounding peat, with connectivity greatest when water table was high and lowest at low water table depths when discharge was associated with deeper, CO2-enriched sources. Total downstream export from the eight studied pipes represented 3%, 38%, and 3% of CO2, CH4, and N2O export at the catchment outlet, while contributing only similar to 2% of total catchment runoff. Direct degassing of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere was evident from an intensively monitored pipe outlet. Upscaling evasion estimates from the pipe outlets gave conservative catchment-scale emission rates of 7.08 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1) and 50.2 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1) for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Although the catchment-scale estimates contain significant uncertainty, they highlight the potential importance of pipes as a pathway for the release of terrestrially produced GHGs to the atmosphere.

AB According to recent studies, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in rivers throughout the boreal zone are increasing. However, the mechanistic explanation of this phenomenon is not yet well known. We studied how the short and long-term changes in precipitation, soil temperature, soil water content, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) are reflected to DOC concentrations and runoff DOC fluxes in two small forested upland catchments in Southern Finland. We used continuous eddy covariance measurements above the forest and runoff flow measurements from the catchment areas conducted over a 15 year long time period to study the correlation between NEE, gross photosynthetic production, total ecosystem respiration, litter production, and runoff DOC. In addition, we looked for the most important environmental variables in explaining the interannual changes in runoff DOC by using multiple linear regression. Finally, we studied the temporal connection between runoff DOC concentrations, precipitation, soil water content, and NEE by using wavelet coherence analysis technique. Our results indicate that the DOC concentrations have increased over the last 15 years. The DOC flux was to a large extent determined by the amount of precipitation, but the previous year's NEE and litter production had also a small but significant effect on runoff DOC fluxes.

AB Hydrological disturbances could increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports through changes in runoff and leaching, which reduces the potential carbon sink function of peatlands. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of hydrological restoration on hydrological processes and DOC dynamics in a rehabilitated Sphagnum-dominated peatland. A conceptual hydrological model calibrated on the water table and coupled with a biogeochemical module was applied to La Guette peatland (France), which experienced a rewetting initiative on February 2014. The model (eight calibrated parameters) reproduced water-table (0 : 1 < NS < 0 : 61) and pore-water DOC concentrations (2 < RMSE < 11 mg L-1) in a time series (1 April 2014 to 15 December 2017) in two contrasting locations (rewetted and control) in the peatland. Hydrological restoration was found to impact the water balance through a decrease in slow deep drainage and an increase in fast superficial runoff. Observed DOC concentrations were higher in summer in the rewetted location compared to the control area and were linked to a difference in dissolved organic matter composition analyzed by fluorescence. Hydrological conditions, especially the severity of the water-table drawdown in summer, were identified as the major factor controlling DOC-concentration dynamics. The results of the simulation suggest that the hydrological restoration did not affect DOC loads, at least in a short-term period (3 years). However, it impacted the temporal dynamics of DOC exports, which were the most episodic and were mainly transported through fast surface runoff in the area affected by the restoration, while slow deep drainage dominated DOC exports in the control area. In relation to dominant hydrological processes, exported DOC is expected to be derived from more recent organic matter in the top peat layer in the rewetted area, compared to the control area. Since it is calibrated on water-table and DOC concentration, the model presented in this study proved to be a relevant tool in identifying the main hydrological processes and factors controlling DOC dynamics in different areas of the same peatland. It is also a suitable alternative to a discharge-calibrated catchment model when the outlet is not easy to identify or to monitor.

AB There is evidence that damaged peatlands can negatively affect the delivery of water related ecosystem services. There is interest in peatland restoration to meet different regulatory targets, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD). A comprehensive assessment of the economic benefits of restoration is missing. This paper synthesises hydrological and bio-geochemical knowledge on peatland restoration, as well as insights in the monetary valuation of water quality improvements in freshwater systems. This is used to identify challenges in valuing water quality related benefits from peatland restoration. The paper concludes that there is strong evidence for rapid ecological responses to peatland restoration related to reduced suspended sediment loads, and sufficient evidence that re-wetting will prevent further decline in water quality. Two main challenges arise for valuation: (1) incomplete evidence of effects of restoration on final ecosystem services and benefits, and (2) the spatial and temporal differences in peatlands' responses. We suggest developing valuation scenarios on a case-by-case basis, using best available evidence of the changes associated with restoration described by a categorization of peatland status similar to the ecological status ladders developed for the WFD. These would need to be tested with the public and should include an element of uncertainty in services provision. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The export of total organic carbon (particulate and dissolved) from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems has important implications for water quality and the global carbon cycle. However, most research to date has focused on DOC losses from either forested or peaty catchments, with only limited studies examining the controls and rates of total fluvial carbon losses from agricultural catchments, particularly during storm events. This study examined the controls and fluxes of total suspended sediment (SS), total particulate (TPC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from two adjacent catchments with contrasting intensive agricultural and semi-natural land-use. Data from 35 individual storm events showed that the agricultural catchment exported significantly higher SS concentrations on a storm-by-storm basis than the semi-natural catchment, with peak discharge exerting a greater control over SS, TPC and DOC concentrations. Baseflow DOC concentrations in the agricultural catchment were significantly higher. DOC quality monitored during one simultaneous rainfall event differed between the two study catchments, with more humic, higher molecular weight compounds prevailing in the agricultural catchment and lower molecular weight compounds prevailing in the semi-natural catchment. During an eight month period for which a comparable continuous turbidity record was available, the estimated SS yields from the agricultural catchment were higher than from the semi-natural catchment. Further, the agricultural catchment exported proportionally more TPC and a comparable amount of DOC, despite a lower total soil carbon pool. These results suggest that altered hydrological and biogeochemical processes within the agricultural catchment, including accelerated soil erosion and soil organic matter turnover, contributed to an enhanced fluvial SS and carbon export. Thus, we argue that enhancing semi-natural vegetation within intensively farmed catchments could reduce sediment and carbon losses from these areas and increase their resilience to more extreme hydrological events, anticipated as a result of climate change.

AB Fire has been used for centuries to generate and manage some of the UK's cultural landscapes. Despite its complex role in the ecology of UK peatlands and moorlands, there has been a trend of simplifying the narrative around burning to present it as an only ecologically damaging practice. That fire modifies peatland characteristics at a range of scales is clearly understood. Whether these changes are perceived as positive or negative depends upon how trade-offs are made between ecosystem services and the spatial and temporal scales of concern. Here we explore the complex interactions and trade-offs in peatland fire management, evaluating the benefits and costs of managed fire as they are currently understood. We highlight the need for (i) distinguishing between the impacts of fires occurring with differing severity and frequency, and (ii) improved characterization of ecosystem health that incorporates the response and recovery of peatlands to fire. We also explore how recent research has been contextualized within both scientific publications and the wider media and how this can influence non-specialist perceptions. We emphasize the need for an informed, unbiased debate on fire as an ecological management tool that is separated from other aspects of moorland management and from political and economic opinions.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.

AB Temporary water reservoirs built upon peat soil may exhibit water quality impairment from elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Microbiological decay of the organic carbon in the bed with subsequent release produces "tea" colored water which may require treatment prior to use. This paper describes laboratory experiments designed to obtain data on the release process of DOC from soils containing 0.65%, 10% and 19% carbon. Parallel experiments with and without sodium azide treatment clearly distinguished the initial release of a porewater residual fraction and the microbial produced fraction. A one to two day quick-release DOC fraction, which ranges from 28% to 50%, first emerged from the bed, Step-1. This was followed by a constant rate of DOC production over four weeks, Step-2. The Step-2 average production rates were 3.4, 12, and 31 mg DOC/kg(dry)/day for the respective soils and increased as soil carbon content increased. The inorganic carbon (IC) behaved oppositely; its rate of production decreased with increasing soil carbon. A consistent and simple rate equation described the Step-2 DOC production process. This and other evidence obtained provided the basis for developing a mathematical, model that couples both steps of the bed-to-water DOC release chemodynamics. The model,is presented in a companion paper (Part-2). (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial-mediated iron (Fe) oxidation and reduction greatly contribute to the biogeochemistry and mineralogy of ecosystems. However, knowledge regarding the composition and distribution patterns of iron redox cycling bacteria in peatlands remains limited. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we compared biogeographic patterns and assemblies of the iron redox cycling bacterial community between soil and water samples obtained from different types of peatland across four regions in Northeast China. A total of 48 phylotypes were identified as potential iron redox bacteria, which had greater than 97% similarity with Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB). Among them, Rhodoferax, Clostridium, Geothrix, Sideroxydans, Geobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Leptothrix could be used as bioindicators in peatlands for characterizing different hydrological conditions and nutrient demands. Across all samples, bacterial communities associated with iron redox cycling were mainly affected by pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Fe2+. Distance-decay relationship (DDR) analysis indicated that iron redox cycling bacterial communities in soil, but not in water, were highly correlated with geographic distance. Additionally, null model analysis revealed that stochastic processes substituted deterministic processes from minerotrophic fens to ombrotrophic bogs in soils, whereas deterministic processes were dominant in water. Overall, these observations suggest that bacteria involved in iron redox cycling are widespread in diverse habitats and exhibit distinct patterns of distribution and community assembly mechanisms between soil and water in peatlands.

AB Recent evidence indicates that our current soil C stores may be already changing from carbon sinks to sources, with reported increasing C losses in both gaseous (soil respiration) and aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC forms) across large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Current debates have mainly focused on climatic variables; however, accounting for the abiotic and biotic interactions is required to enable better quantifications of C dynamics. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature, moisture and dominant mesofauna (enchytraeids) changes on C losses by incubating root-free sieved soil samples from a peatland soil during 13 weeks at two temperature (14 and 19 C) and two moisture (85 and 60% WHC) treatments under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that neither temperature nor moisture and invertebrates had a significant effect on respiration rates. In contrast, under favourable moisture conditions, the temperature induced changes in enchytraeid population numbers resulted in more DOC being released from these soils, possibly linked to the positive effects of animal activities on iron mobilisation and buffering the pH of the soil solution. Our results also confirmed that moisture contents of 60% WHC could severely affect their population numbers in these organic soils and hence, the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems. Importantly, in agreement with previous studies, availability of easily accessible C sources seems to be a critical factor in the progressive declines of soil respiration and DOC production rates over time. Taken these findings together it is possible to conclude that the combined action of abiotic factors and their influence on soil fauna populations plays a key role in controlling SOM decomposition rates of these peatland soils.

AB Tundra soils account for 50% of global stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and it is expected that the amplified climate warming in high latitude could cause loss of this SOC through decomposition. Decomposed SOC could become hydrologically accessible, which increase downstream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and subsequent carbon release to the atmosphere, constituting a positive feedback to climate warming. However, DOC export is often neglected in ecosystem models. In this paper, we incorporate processes related to DOC production, mineralization, diffusion, sorption-desorption, and leaching into a customized arctic version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS in order to mechanistically model catchment DOC export, and to link this flux to other ecosystem processes. The extended LPJ-GUESS is compared to observed DOC export at Stordalen catchment in northern Sweden. Vegetation communities include flood-tolerant graminoids (Eriophorum) and Sphagnum moss, birch forest and dwarf shrub communities. The processes, sorption-desorption and microbial decomposition (DOC production and mineralization) are found to contribute most to the variance in DOC export based on a detailed variance-based Sobol sensitivity analysis (SA) at grid cell-level. Catchment-level SA shows that the highest mean DOC exports come from the Eriophorum peatland (fen). A comparison with observations shows that the model captures the seasonality of DOC fluxes. Two catchment simulations, one without water lateral routing and one without peatland processes, were compared with the catchment simulations with all processes. The comparison showed that the current implementation of catchment lateral flow and peatland processes in LPJ-GUESS are essential to capture catchment-level DOC dynamics and indicate the model is at an appropriate level of complexity to represent the main mechanism of DOC dynamics in soils. The extended model provides a new tool to investigate potential interactions among climate change, vegetation dynamics, soil hydrology and DOC dynamics at both stand-alone to catchment scales.

AB Regular features of ground and surface waters affected by drainage from mine waste include their acidity and elevated concentrations of dissolved metals, with their attendant negative effects on drinking water quality and aquatic life. One parameter that aids in buffering these waters against acidity and sustains aquatic life is dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). In this study, the chemical and isotopic (delta C-13) composition of primary calcite and DIC (delta C-13(DIC)) in groundwater and surface waters within and downstream, respectively, of abandoned Cu-W-F skarn tailings at Yxsjoberg, Sweden, were used to trace the biogeochemical processes controlling their respective delta(13)C(DIC)signatures. In addition, the delta C-13 signatures of the inorganic (carbonate) fractions of the tailings were used to verify the formation of secondary carbonates within the tailings. Lower average delta C-13 values of the carbonate fractions (delta C-13(carb)= -2.7 parts per thousand) relative to those of the primary calcite (delta C-13 = +0.1 parts per thousand) from the orebodies from which the tailings originated pointed to the precipitation of secondary carbonates. These lower delta(13)Ccarb signatures were assumed to represent mixed-source C signals involving isotopically light CO(2)from the atmosphere, the degradation of organic matter in the upper part of the tailings and HCO(3)(-)from calcite dissolution. The groundwater delta(13)C(DIC)values (-12.6 parts per thousand to -4.4 parts per thousand) were far lower than the hypothetical range of values (-4.6 parts per thousand to +0.7 parts per thousand) for primary calcite and secondary carbonate dissolution. These signatures were attributed to carbonate (calcite and secondary carbonate) dissolution and the degradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from various organic sources such as peat underneath the tailings and the surrounding forests. Downstream surface water samples collected in May had low delta(13)C(DIC)values (-16 parts per thousand) and high DOC (14 mg C/L) compared to the groundwater samples. These signatures represented the oxidation of the DOC from the wash out of the mires and forests during the snowmelt and spring flood. The DOC and delta(13)C(DIC)values of the surface waters from June to September ranged from 6-15 mg center dot C/L and -25 parts per thousand to -8.6 parts per thousand, respectively. These signatures were interpreted to reflect mixed C sources, including carbonate dehydration by acidity from Fe(3+)hydrolysis due to the mixing of groundwater with surface waters and the subsequent diffusive loss of CO2 (g), aquatic photosynthesis, photooxidation, DOC degradation, as well as microbial respiration. Although the(13)C(DIC)signatures of the downstream surface waters seemed to be seasonally controlled and influenced by variable groundwater contributions, the lack of data with respect to DIC concentrations, coupled with multiple potential biogeochemical processes that could influence the DIC pool and(13)C(DIC)values, made it difficult to identify the major regulating process of the(13)C(DIC)signatures. Therefore, other complimentary isotopes and elemental concentrations are recommended in order to decipher the dominant biogeochemical process.

AB Northern forests and peatlands are globally significant elements in carbon (C) cycling. Recent research has also highlighted the role of aquatic ecosystems in landscape C budgets. We measured contemporary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange, lateral C transfer (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4), and long-term C accumulation in a peatland-stream-lake-continuum in north boreal Finland. On an annual scale the peatland, a rich fen, was a relatively strong C sink (27 g Cm-2 a(-1)). The stream that traversed through the fen had high CO2 and CH4 effluxes (on average 480 and 12 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively) to the atmosphere, while the small oligotrophic lake was a small C gas source per unit area (15 g C m(-2) a(-1)). A catchment C budget was compiled by supplementing these measured values with literature values for the forests. The aquatic C fluxes equaled similar to 13% of the net C input by the forest and peatlands in the catchment, and the largest component was the downstream transfer of DOC. This study supports the proposition that ignoring the aquatic component would result in an overestimated regional C uptake. The contemporary net C input estimate for the fen, after accounting for the C transfer, was larger than the long-term C accumulation rate based on peat cores (22 versus 6.3-16.0 g C m(-2) a(-1)). This study provides reference values for both the contemporary C exchange and long-term C accumulation history, and the terrestrial-aquatic linkage from the boreal-subarctic ecotone, which is vulnerable to ongoing climatic change.

AB We measured the concentrations and isotopic values (Delta(14)C and delta(13)C) of dissolved inorganic, dissolved organic, and particulate organic carbon (DIC, DOC, and POC, respectively) in the Parker River watershed and estuary in Massachusetts, USA, to determine the age of carbon (C) entering the estuary and how estuarine processing affects the quantity and apparent age of C transported to the Gulf of Maine. The watershed measurements indicated the transport of Delta(14)C-enriched modern DIC and DOC and variably aged POC from the watershed to the estuary. The transport of organic matter from the watershed was dominated by DOC transport, with POC making up less than 10% of the total. Surveys within the watershed aimed at determining which land-use type dominated the DOC export indicated that wetlands, although they made up only around 20% of the land use, could be responsible for approximately 75% of the DOC export. We therefore conclude that the wetland land uses of the Parker River watershed are exporting mainly Delta(14)C-enriched modem DOC. DIC isotopes indicate that the source of DIC in the Parker River watershed is dominated by the weathering of noncarbonate parent material by Delta(14)C-enriched carbon dioxide (CO2) originating from the respiration of young organic matter in soils. Transects in the estuary displayed net additions of all C species. For DOC and DIC, the export of this internally added DOC and DIC was approximately equal to the amount being exported from the watershed, showing the importance of focusing on estuaries when estimating the export of C to the coastal ocean. With respect to DIC, the total input is even larger when the atmospheric exchange of excess PCO2 is calculated. The Delta(14)C -DOC and Delta(14)C-DIC transects indicate that the internally added DOC and DIC is Delta(14)C-enriched modern material. The source of this material is the fringing marshes and estuarine phytoplankton, with the relative importance of these two sources changing over time. Taken together, the bulk C and Delta(14)C measurements show that the estuary is adding significant quantities of young DOC despite the presence of vast quantities of old marsh peat flanking the entire estuary. Furthermore, the DIC data indicate that Delta(14)C-enriched modern material is what is fueling the majority of heterotrophic respiration within the system.

AB The effects of peat bog harvesting and restoration on dissolved organic matter (DOM) are poorly known although DOM represents the most mobile part of organic matter in peat. The aims of our study were: (i) to determine concentrations and properties of DOM in a series of natural, harvested, and restored peatlands in eastern Quebec and (ii) to relate DOM to CO2 efflux from these bogs. We sampled pore waters at eight peat bogs and determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, humification indices derived from synchronous fluorescence spectra (humification index (HIX), ratio of intensities at 470 and 400 nm), specific absorption at 280 nm, and the humic acid (HA) content. DOC concentrations ranged from 35 to 625 mg C l(-1). The highest values were observed at a block-cut (BC) site where the ditches had been closed to stimulate restoration. This resulted in limited external drainage, DOM accumulation in deeper horizons, and an enrichment of the poorly biodegradable humic acids to about 60% of the bulk DOM. DOC concentrations increased immediately during harvesting up to 188 mg C l(-1) as a result of this ecosystem disturbance. Afterwards, DOC concentrations decreased which might be due to a low content of potential DOM of the remaining little oxidised peat. The enhanced decomposition of the remaining peat during the restoration process seems to be important for a new build-up of potential DOM, which is indicated by reincreasing DOC concentration during the restoration process. We could not relate spectroscopic properties of DOM to peat harvesting and restoration. The portion of humic acids was inversely related to CO2 efflux, indicating low substrate quality of humic acids in pore waters. The seasonal average humification indices of DOM where humic acids had been removed were positively correlated with the seasonal CO2 efflux. from the eight sites, indicating that high respiration results in an enrichment of more aromatic and complex DOM molecules. The relationships suggest that DOM composition affects CO2 efflux from peat bogs and is also driven by respiration and CO2 efflux. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Kinetics of peat soil dissolved organic carbon release to surface water.
   Part 2. A chemodynamic process model
SO CHEMOSPHERE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEDIMENT; FLUXES
AB Temporary water reservoirs built upon peat soil may exhibit water quality impairment from elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Microbiological decay of the organic carbon in the bed with subsequent release produces "tea" colored water which may require treatment prior to use. This paper contains a process-based mathematical model that quantifies the DOC release from the bed and its build-up in the water column. The model elements are based on microbial DOC production rates and bed sediment transport kinetics describing its' release from the organic soil systems. It relies on laboratory data obtained from an experimental study, Part 1, designed to simulate the DOC chemodynamics of aquatic reservoirs built upon peat soils. A two-step DOC release process was structured based on the experimental findings. The model mechanism assumes a quick release fraction that characterizes the upper soil surface layers as a "tea bag" type release process. This is followed by a fraction that is continuously produced and then released at a constant rate overtime by on-going microbial processes within the upper soil layers. The depth of the active layer, selected as h* = 0.3 cm, is the single adjustable parameter in the model. Concentration predictions of the are consistent with the laboratory simulations and field observations. Measured vs. model-calculated DOC concentrations for both in the microcosm bed and water column are used to test critical features of the proposed model. As conceived and structured it appears to be a realistic first step in quantifying the DOC release consequences for the water column of a reservoir sited upon a peat-soil bed. The development ends with an application to a hypothetical reservoir in order to illustrate model strengths and uncertainties. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the functional role of enchytraeid worms (Oligochaeta) in organic upland soils experimentally, because that role of these animals is little known. We made microcosms of intact soil cores cut from two depths, 0-4 cm and 4-8 cm, of a Cambic Stagnohumic Gley from the Moor House National Nature Reserve (UK). Enchytraeids were added to half of the microcosms, resulting in four treatments: litter (L), litter + enchytraeids (L + E), soil (S) and soil + enchytraeids (S + E). Triplicates of each treatment were established, and all microcosms (60) were then incubated in the dark at 15 degrees C, arranged in a fully randomized design. The experiment ran over 110 days, with five destructive harvests at days 10, 25, 50, 75 and 110, when microbial measurements (soil respiration and biomass C) as well as measures of decomposition (nutrient concentration in leachates) were made. Enchytraeids almost doubled the availability of organic carbon (measured as dissolved organic carbon in soil leachates) in the surface (0-4 cm) microcosms only. There were no effects of enchytraeids on the release of inorganic N or P from either soil horizon, although the release of ammonium and phosphate was correlated with the number of enchytraeids in the microcosms. The depth from which the soil was taken exerted a strong influence on nutrient leaching, with almost six times more ammonium and four times more carbon being leached from the surface (0-4 cm) layer than from the more decomposed (4-8 cm) horizon. There was little nitrate leaching from any of the treatments, with only one-quarter as much nitrate leached from the surface (0-4 cm) as from the subsurface (4-8 cm) horizon. Enchytraeids had no detectable effect on microbial biomass, but they increased microbial respiration by 35% in the surface (0-4 cm) horizon. Because they enhanced microbial activity in this horizon we suggest that enchytraeids indirectly drive the processes of decomposition and nutrient mineralization in organic upland soils.

AB Global climate change and in particular sea level rise have resulted in water table level rise in the coastal wetland, which may alter the magnitude and direction of carbon flux. However, the degree to which different water table level affects soil CO2 and CH4 emissions remains uncertain in coastal wetland. Here, a soil microcosm experiment with five water table levels (similar to 40, similar to 30, similar to 20, similar to 10, 0 cm) was conducted in the Yellow River Delta, China. The water table level was controlled by manual. The soil CO2 and CH4 emissions of each water table levels were measured during 150-days incubation in 2018. Our results showed that water table level rise decreased soil CO2 emissions, while increased soil CH4 emissions. However, there was no significant difference in soil CO2 and CH4 emissions from similar to 20 to similar to 40 water table levels, respectively. In addition, water table level rise significant alter soil physical and chemical properties in the uppermost soil layer (0-10 cm) in coastal wetland, in particular soil moisture and salinity, which probably jointly affected soil CO2 and CH4 emissions. Furthermore, cumulative soil CH4 emission was positively significantly correlated to soil organic carbon and total carbon, suggesting that carbon component can supply energy and nutrients and benefit for soil CH4 production. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between cumulative soil CO2 emission and dissolved organic carbon, which indicated that CO2 was mainly contributed from dissolved organic carbon. Cumulative soil CO2 emission was significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass carbon, suggesting that microbial activity played an important role in CO2 emissions in coastal wetlands. Our results also indicate that water table level rise caused by sea level rise may contribute to the storage of soil organic carbon and produces a lower global warming potentials of CH4 and CO2 in the further climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the effect of hydrological, especially water table level on carbon cycles in coastal wetland when evaluating the climateecarbon feedback scenarios.

AB Mowing is a common management technique employed in Europe and North America to manage seral wetland plant communities to: (a) prevent development to late succession, (b) minimise internal eutrophication and (c) conserve biodiversity. However, little is known about the effect mowing has on water quality, and the duration of any effects. Therefore, mowing treatments were applied in two abandoned fen plant communities: a Schoenus nigricans-Juncus subnodulosus (SN) community (hand-cutting) and a Cladio-Molinietum (CM) community (machine mowing). Mowing took place once in each community across three sites in North Wales, U.K. Effects on water chemistry were followed for two years post mowing.

AB Wetland ecosystems are a major natural source of the important greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Among these ecosystems, fens have been shown to release high quantities of CH4. Data on CH4 emissions from alpine fens are scarce and mainly limited to the United States and China. Therefore, static chambers were used to quantify CH4 emissions from 14 fens located in the Swiss Alps. The aims of this study were to determine the spatial variability of the emissions and to identify potential key factors which influence CH4 turnover. The fens were located at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,600 m a.s.l., the pore water varied from acidic to slightly acidic (pH 4.5-6.4) and the vegetation was dominated by plants of the genus Carex. In addition, the underlying bedrock was either siliceous or calcareous. Methane emissions ranged from 74 +/- A 43 to 711 +/- A 212 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). The type of bedrock, the plant biomass above the water table and the CH4 pore water concentrations at depths from 0 to 20 cm were the main factors influencing CH4 emissions. Detailed measurements in three selected fens suggested that more than 98 % of the total CH4 emissions are due to plant-mediated transport.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have increased in many sites in Europe and North America in recent decades. High DOC concentrations can damage the structure and functions of aquatic ecosystems by influencing water chemistry. This study investigated the spatial and seasonal variation of DOC concentrations in Irish streams across 55 sites at seven time occasions over 1 year (2006/2007). The DOC concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 25.9 mg/L with a mean value of 6.8 and a median value of 5.7 mg/L and varied significantly over the course of the year. The DOC concentrations from late winter (February: 5.2 +/- A 3.0 mg/L across 55 sites) and early spring (April: 4.5 +/- A 3.5 mg/L) had significantly lower DOC concentrations than autumn (October: mean 8.3 +/- A 5.6 mg/L) and early winter (December: 8.3 +/- A 5.1 mg/L). The DOC production sources (e.g., litterfall) or the accumulation of DOC over dry periods might be the driving factor of seasonal change in Irish stream DOC concentrations. Analysis of data using stepwise multiple linear regression techniques identified the topographic index (TI, an indication of saturation-excess runoff potential) and soil conditions (organic carbon content and soil drainage characteristics) as key factors in controlling DOC spatial variation in different seasons. The TI and soil carbon content (e.g., soil organic carbon; peat occurrence) are positively related to DOC concentrations, while well-drained soils are negatively related to DOC concentrations. The knowledge of spatial and seasonal variation of DOC concentrations in streams and their drivers are essential for optimum riverine water resources management.

AB Spatiotemporal variations in microbial gene abundances were investigated to identify potential zones of methanotroph and methanogen biomass in a peat bog in Sarobetsu-genya wetland. The abundances of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, pmoA, and mcrA were 10(7)-10(9), 10(7)-10(8), 10(4)-10(6), and 10(4)-10(7) copies g(-1) dry peat, respectively. Correlation analysis based on microbial gene abundances and environmental factors showed that the spatiotemporal distributions of the abundances of the four microbial genes in peat layers were similar. The mcrA abundance showed a significant negative correlation with the dissolved organic carbon content and a significant positive correlation with the peat temperature. The pmoA abundance was not detectable during the spring thaw when the lowest peat temperature at a depth of 50 cm was recorded. At a depth of 200 cm, the peat temperature exceeded 6A degrees C throughout the year, and the mcrA abundance exceeded 10(4) copies g(-1) dry peat. These results indicate that the seasonal microbial activity related to methane should be evaluated in not only the shallow but also the deep peat layers in order to elucidate the methane dynamics in boreal wetlands.

AB We explore 3 years of pore water profile data from a New Hampshire wetland to determine the rates of methane production and oxidation occurring in the water-saturated peat, and how these rates evolve over seasonal and annual timescales. For this study, pore water was collected and analyzed for the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon and the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. These data are used, in conjunction with a 1-D model that simulates reaction and transport, to calculate the rates of methane production and oxidation necessary to recreate pore water profiles measured over seasonal and annual cycles from 2005 through 2007. We find column-integrated methane production rates to vary between 0 and 30 mu mol cm(-2) month(-1), averaging 6 mu mol cm(-2) month(-1) during the summer. The seasonal pattern in the depth-integrated methane production rates is observed to positively correlate with temperature change. Despite large differences in the water table depths over the years studied, we see no difference in mean methane production rates between years. Results from three different stations, each characterized by different local vegetation, do not find plant-mediated transport to be an important mechanism for methane removal from the saturated peat, although we did find evidence supporting possible oxygen leakage from roots. Significant differences were observed in subsurface respiration between the stations. We observed several instances of non-diffusive transport in both the subsurface methane and carbon dioxide pools, particularly during the early spring and late fall and hypothesize that rainfall events may contribute to significant degassing from the uppermost 40-60 cm of saturated peat. Supporting findings by an earlier study, these isotope-constrained methane production rates can only account for a fraction (between 0% and 21%) of the methane emissions from this site, indicating a source of methane at or above the pore water surface. Seasonal patterns indicate peak methanogenesis may be associated with the oxic-anoxic boundary. It remains uncertain as to whether the saturated peat should remain a focus for studies of wetland methane cycling, with this work indicating it plays only a small role in bulk methane fluxes from this site.

AB Surface waters in the Florida Everglades contain high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds. delta(13)C values of DOC samples collected from the northern Everglades indicate that less than about 23% of the DOC was derived from sugarcane (the dominant agricultural crop in the area), and the amount of DOC from sugarcane was greater during the dry period. Most of the DOC (>50%) in the northern Everglades was in the low molecular weight (< 1000 Dalton) fraction (LMW-DOC). The relative amount of high molecular weight DOC (HMW-DOC) was higher in the wet period than in the dry period. Radiocarbon ages of the DOC ranged from "> modern" to about 2400 years B.P., indicating that DOC was derived from both historic peat deposits and modern vegetation. At each site, the HMW-DOC had older radiocarbon ages than the LMW-DOC, and therefore contained a greater fraction of DOC derived from the historic peat deposits. It appears that at least some of the old DOC compounds from the historic peat deposits were decomposed during their residence in the surface water system in the northern Everglades, and the LMW-DOC was more microbially labile than the HMW-DOC. Our analysis suggests that accelerated decomposition of organic matter in the historic peat deposits (due to land-use change) could be a significant source of DOC and nutrients in the northern Everglades. Our data also suggest that the radiocarbon signature of DOC could be used as a sensitive indicator of the overall effectiveness of a wetland restoration project.

AB Elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) promote browning of lakes, which alters the physicochemical properties of water and ecosystem functioning. However, browning-induced changes in basal production of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the n-3 and n-6 families (n-3 and n-6 PUFA) in lakes are not fully understood. The concentrations of PUFA, which are micronutrients required to maintain growth and reproduction of consumers, have been suggested to either rise or decline in seston as a response to lake browning. Elevated DOC concentrations may also promote bacterial biomass and production and thus potentially increase the concentration of bacterial fatty acids (BAFA) in seston. We analyzed phytoplankton, bacteria and heterotroph biomasses, the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton, and the concentrations and mass fractions of bioseston PUFA, BAFA, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids in ten boreal lakes in eastern Finland, with DOC concentration ranging from 2.8 to 18.7 mg/L. Our results showed that the abundance of PUFA in seston depended on the responses of phytoplankton biomass and community composition to lake browning. Lake browning increased seston PUFA and BAFA concentrations (expressed as mu g/L) but not the contents (expressed as mu g/mg bioseston C). Although low DOC lakes had a favorable phytoplankton community (in terms of PUFA content), the phytoplankton biomass in these oligotrophic lakes was so low that the concentration of PUFA remained low compared to high DOC lakes. The increasing concentration of PUFA in bioseston along the DOC gradient was mainly due to the increasing biomass of nuisance algaGonyostomum semen. However,Gonyostomummay be too large for small-sized zooplankton to ingest, and thus, the trophic transfer of PUFA may be impaired. The trajectories for lake browning and the basal production of PUFA also may depend on the source of carbon and associated nutrient loading; DOC and nutrient loading from agricultural areas may promote cyanobacteria dominance and decrease PUFA availability in lakes, while DOC runoff from more acidic and nutrient-poor peatlands may promoteGonyostomumdominance and increase seston PUFA concentration.

AB Measurements of the spatial variability of methane (CH4) emissions, net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and dissolved carbon (CH4, CO2, and DOC) were made in a boreal patterned peatland in northern Sweden in the summers (May to September) of 1992 and 1993. Carbon balance terms were measured and the carbon balance inferred at different peatland surface topography features (e.g. ridges, lawns, and pools) and at different positions within the peatland (e.g. plateau, margin). Combining these data permits a comparison of the carbon balance at the peatland scale for the two field seasons.
   Trends in the spatial variability of the net carbon storage, as determined by the difference between inputs and outputs, suggest that carbon storage decreased in lawns from the margin of the peatland to the central plateau, while the reverse trend occurred in ridges. This indicates a difference in carbon exchange processes between sites with different surface topography due to differences in soil moisture and temperature.
   Total carbon storage for the peatland, weighted for topographic variability, indicates that the peatland gained carbon in 1992 (2.0 g C m(-2)), but lost carbon in 1993 (-7.6 g C m(-2)). There was little variation in mean seasonal air temperature and total precipitation between the two years suggesting that the timing and magnitude of temperature and precipitation variation within the growing season are important for the season carbon balance. Because the carbon storage differences were small relative to the potential errors we conclude that the peatland was neither a net sink nor source of atmospheric carbon. This research demonstrates the importance of position in a peatland for the inference of long-term carbon accumulation and the assessment of contemporary exchange rates.

Therefore, understanding the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from rivers in the permafrost zone is important in the context of climate change. This study investigated the dynamics of DOC export from the wetlands of the Kandu River catchment located in a cold temperate region in northeast China during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012. Our findings indicated that subsurface flow was the primary runoff pathway that transports DOC from wetland soil to stream discharge. The organic-mineral soil structure resulted in substantial differences in water sources, as well as in DOC resources, between the flood and base flow volume during the growing seasons. The active layer depth is key, as it affects runoff generation and the DOC concentration and chemical characteristics of stream discharge. The DOC flux from our study area was estimated to be up to 1039.66 t during the growing season, which represents more than one third of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in wetlands. Given the expected increase in air temperature and precipitation, our results indicate that there will be an increase in the total DOC flux for the study region in the future as a result of increased DOC concentration.

AB Increasing DOC concentrations in surface waters have been observed across parts of Europe and North America over the past few decades Most proposed explanations for these widespread trends invoke climate change or reductions in sulphate deposition However these factors do not seem apposite to explain either the fine-scale (within kilometres) or regional-scale spatial variation in DOC concentrations observed across the UK
   We have reconstructed DOC concentrations and land use for one North Pennine and five South Pennine catchments (UK) located in three discrete areas over the last four decades Rainfall temperature and sulphate deposition data where available were also collated and the potential influence of these factors on surface water DOC concentrations was assessed
   Four of the six catchments examined showed highly significant (p<0 001) increases (53-92%) in humic coloured DOC (hDOC) concentrations in drainage waters over the period 1990-2005 Changes in temperature and sulphate deposition may explain 20-30% of this trend in these four catchments However the rapid expansion of new moorland burn on blanket peat can explain a far greater degree (>80%) of the change in hDOC Far smaller increases in hDOC (10-18%) were identified for the two remaining catchments These two sites experienced similar changes in sulphur deposition and temperature to those that had seen largest increases in DOC but contained little or no moorland burn management on blanket peat
   This study shows that regional-scale factors undoubtedly underlie some of the recent observed increases in drainage humic coloured DOC However changes in land management in this case the extensive use of fire management on blanket peat are a far more important driver of increased hDOC release from upland catchments in some parts of the UK It suggests that the recent rapid increase in the use of burning on blanket peat moorland has implications for ecosystem services and carbon budgets (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB A study (August 1990 to July 1991) of profiles of dissolved CH4 concentrations, diffusive flux of CH4, and CH4 production rates of 45 sites in the Lake Agassiz Peatlands in northern Minnesota shows that dissolved CH4 deep in the peat (> 1 m depth) mobilized easily to the vadose zone. During August 1990 the dissolved CH4 concentrations at some depths at some sites were supersaturated with respect to one atmosphere partial pressure of CH4. At one site (2.5 m depth) the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore-water was 140 mg L(-1). In July 1991, at no site did the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore water exceed 40 mg L(-1) in the peat profile. The average calculated diffusive flux of CH4 decreased from 95 to 45 mg m(-2) d(-1) between 1990 and 1991. Gaseous CH4 was more in evidence in 1990 than in 1991. In 1990, CH4 at many depths bubbled vigorously when pear pore water was sampled. At some sites there was sufficient pore pressure to eject slugs of water forcibly from piezometers. Similarly, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) consisting of H2CO3, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- decreased between the sampling times from an average for both bogs and fens in 1990 of 62 mg C L(-1) to 38 mg C L(-1) in 1991. A dynamic mechanism must exist which traps CH4 deep in the peat column allowing gaseous CH4 to build up, increasing dissolved CH4. Other times, CH4 passes freely from deep peat to the vadose zone. We suggest as a hypothesis that a confining layer of trapped CH4 bubbles forms at depth in the peat, trapping gaseous CH4. The duration of the ''bubble confining layer'' is uncertain. We propose two hypotheses. (1) The confining layer is usually present and deteriorates after a major climatic event such as a drought, or (2) the confining layer forms and collapses seasonally with seasonal variations in the water table elevation.

AB Understanding of the processes that control CO2 concentrations in the aquatic environment has been hampered by the absence of a direct method to make continuous measurements over both short- and long-term time intervals. We describe an in situ method in which a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor is enclosed in a water impermeable, gas permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and deployed in a freshwater environment. This allows measurements of CO2 concentration to be made directly at a specific depth in the water column without the need for pumps or reagents. We demonstrate the potential of the method using examples from different aquatic environments characterized by a range of CO2 concentrations (0-5-8.0 mg CO2-C l(-1), equivalent to ca 40-650 eta mnol CO2 l(-1)). These comprise streams and ponds from tropical, temperate and boreal regions. Data derived front the sensor was compared with direct measurements of CO2 concentrations using headspace analysis. Sensor performance following long-term (>6 months) field deployment conformed to manufacturers' specifications, with no drift detected. We conclude that the sensor-based method is a robust. accurate and responsive method. with a wide range of potential applications, particularly when combined with other in situ sensor-based measurements of related variables.

AB Different acid compositions (HNO3, H(2)O2, HF and HClO4) and low pressure microwave digestion were applied to the microwave assisted dissolution of ancient peats. The digests were evaluated with respect to the decomposition of the inorganic and organic fraction of peats and to an optimised determination of Pb by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). Addition of hydrofluoric acid was necessary to achieve a complete dissolution of the resistant inorganic phase of the pear and to obtain the total Pb concentration. Addition of perchloric acid decreased the concentration of dissolved organic carbon significantly, enabling reliable voltammetric signals for Pb determinations with satisfying peak shape, baseline, sensitivity, and precision. The limit of detection for Pb in peats was 1 ng/mL in the acid digest, equivalent to 0.2 mu g/g in solid peat. This allowed the determination of low, pre-industrial concentrations of Pb in peat bogs from various locations (Europe and SE Asia). A chelation column used to isolate the metals from the complex matrix to further improve the detection limits failed to provide good recoveries for the peats and plants.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dominates the chemistry of porewaters in many peatland soils. Yet modeling its contribution to acid-base chemistry and to anionic charge has not been attempted for peatland porewaters. Using 3 yr of field data, we investigated the effectiveness of four analog organic acid models in describing the acid-base chemistry of DOC in porewaters from two acidic (mean pH approximate to 4.0-4.2), high-DOC (mean DOC approximate to 4.2-5.4 mmol CL-1) peatlands in southern Michigan. Although developed for dilute lake waters, we applied these models to porewaters of peatland soils. All sites exhibited a targe deficit in anionic charge (mean = 229 mu mol(c) L-1), which was strongly correlated with DOC (r(2) = 0.82) and accounted for 70 to 80% of the fatal anionic charge. We, therefore, used charge balance to evaluate the models. The four models varied in effectiveness; variations in model organic anion accounted for between 50 and 84% of the variation in anion deficit. Representing organic acid anions with a triprotic acid analog model yielded the best results (r(2) = 0.84, slope = 0.96), while a monoprotic acid model was least effective (r(2) = 0.50, slope = 0.91). Mean charge densities of the DOC pool (44-52 mu mol(c) mmol(-1) DOC) varied little with differences in site characteristics (i.e., water levels and emergent plant communities) and were consistent with other studies. The triprotic acid model appears to be an effective analog for the acid-base and ionic charge-contributions of DOG in porewaters of acidic peatland soils.

AB Freshwater peatlands represent an important component of global biogeochemistry through their role in carbon sequestration. Threats to carbon storage in freshwater peat include climate-related increases in rates of oxidation and methanogenesis, increased wildfires, drainage, and dissolved organic carbon export from runoff. This paper discusses the potential impact of sea level rise on carbon fluxes from coastal peatlands, an issue not addressed by previous studies describing threats to peatlands from global climate change. We estimate carbon stocks and potential emissions from a coastal freshwater peatland located in North Carolina, United States. Four scenarios for inundation were modeled using Hadley-CM3 scenarios (including the effects of collapsed barrier islands) with a lidar-derived digital elevation model. Monte Carlo analysis was used to address model uncertainty and sensitivity of carbon emission parameters for three scenarios. Total existing carbon storage (peat and vegetation) on the Peninsula (5671 km 2) was estimated to range between 155.5 and 201.0 TgC (95% confidence intervals). Sea level projections ranged from 0.35 to 1.38 m by the end of the century and were estimated to inundate between 1260 and 3020 km 2 of the Peninsula. Carbon emissions from inundation of peat and vegetation ranged from 4.7-20.9 TgC (assuming inundation preserved peat deposits) to 99.4-128.0 TgC (assuming 100% emissions of inundated peat). While considerable uncertainty exists regarding the fate of carbon fluxes, we identify 150,000 km 2 of freshwater peatlands worldwide below 5-m elevation and vulnerable to sea level rise. Our study suggests that future sea level rise may contribute a positive feedback to the global carbon cycle.

AB Cedar Bog Nature Preserve, located near Urbana, OH, encompasses several wetland types including an alkaline fen. in this fen, groundwater emerges in quicksand-like discharge zones consisting of porous Ca/Mg carbonates mixed with organic detritus. This study evaluates seasonal changes in the heterotrophic sediment microbial communities, their response to nutrient amendment, and in the groundwater chemistry from a fen discharge zone at Cedar Bog. The hypothesis that the microbial community in this fen upwelling is nutrient limited throughout the year, particularly by C and P, was tested. The activity of the heterotrophic bacterial community in the sediment compartment was measured. A series of single factor experiments were conducted to study organic and inorganic nutrient regulation of these communities and to determine what nutrients, if any, were limiting. Activities were based on H-3-thymidine incorporation into DNA by control and nutrient amended sediment slurries and verified with C-14-leucine incorporation into protein. Bacterial cell abundance was determined using Acridine Orange direct counts. Samples amended with carbon showed significant increases in activity in three of four seasons tested. Bog extract also stimulated activity above that of the control for the winter microcosm. The site bacterial activity also appears to be limited by inorganic nitrogen and possibly phosphorus in summer.

AB Reactive iron and organic carbon are intimately associated in soils and sediments. However, to date, the organic compounds involved are uncharacterized on the molecular level. At redox interfaces in peatlands, where the biogeochemical cycles of iron and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are coupled, this issue can readily be studied. We found that precipitation of iron hydroxides at the oxic surface layer of two rewetted fens removed a large fraction of DOM via coagulation. On aeration of anoxic fen pore waters, >90% of dissolved iron and 27 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) of dissolved organic carbon were rapidly (within 24 h) removed. Using ultra-high-resolution MS, we show that vascular plant-derived aromatic and pyrogenic compounds were preferentially retained, whereas the majority of carboxyl-rich aliphatic acids remained in solution. We propose that redox interfaces, which are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial settings, are selective yet intermediate barriers that limit the flux of land-derived DOM to oceanic waters.

The concns. of CO2 in spring draining porous Quaternary rocks were higher than that in soil waters and water in solid rocks of Cretaceous aquifer, which are drained to the spring and the Gielczew river. The anal. of C-13 isotope showed a high CO2 concn. in the spring water because of biogenic processes in peats and/or fossil soils. The enrichment of water in CO2 took place during infiltration below the level of soil.

AB Regions within the discontinuous permafrost zone of the southern Northwest Territories (Canada) are experiencing accelerated thaw of permafrost as a result of recent warming We used remotely-sensed imagery (1947-2012) to track changes in the extent of peat plateau collapse around two study lakes: KAK-1 and TAH-7. Subfossil diatoms were analyzed from sediment cores to reconstruct limnological changes over the past similar to 300 years and assess whether peatland subsidence affected lake ecology. Extensive peat plateau collapse was evident in catchments between 1970 and present day. In TAH-7, diatom assemblages indicated a substantial increase in coloured dissolved organic carbon coincident with the time of peat collapse, suggesting that permafrost thaw has resulted in increased transport of terrestrial organic matter to the lake. At KAK-1, while also tracking changes linked to climate warming, no changes in diatom assemblages could be linked to peat plateau collapse. Using our combined approaches, we conclude that collapsing peat plateaus may significantly alter aquatic ecosystems, but the impacts of permafrost thaw on aquatic ecosystems in the sporadic discontinuous permafrost zone are complex.

AB Results from recent studies of peatland biogeochemistry suggest that appropriate soil water sampling techniques are required in order to advance our understanding of peatland soil systems. In a comparative field experiment, concentrations of inorganic solutes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in soil water extracted at a depth of 10 cm beneath the surface of deep peat by three techniques: zero-tension (z-t) lysimeters, PTFE suction samplers, and polysulfone suction samplers. The majority of solute concentrations were broadly similar, but mean concentrations of silicon, DOC, iron and aluminium in water extracted by z-t lysimeters and PTFE samplers were in ratios of 1 : 5; 1 : 2; 1 : 5 and 1 : 3 respectively. Mean conductivity and concentrations of chloride and hydrogen ion were significantly larger in the z-t lysimeter samples, which had sodium, potassium and magnesium to chloride ratios that were very similar to local rainfall. The z-t lysimeters appeared to sample macropores preferentially, while the suction samplers collected micropore water.

AB Aims This study assesses the relative effects of hydrology and colonization by vascular plants on belowground C and N mobilization, and emission of CO2 and CH4 in an extracted bog under restoration in Alberta (Canada). Methods A wet (high water table) and dry (low water table) area were identified at the site and plots with cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) or bare peat were established in each area. Plant growth, peat and porewater dissolved C (DOC) and N (TDN), microbial biomass and the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were monitored at the plots throughout the growing season. Results The largest concentrations of DOC were measured in dry and bare sites. Lower E2:E3 ratios suggested a higher aromaticity of the DOC at these sites that were net sources of CO2 and CH4. The concentration of TDN was greater in plots with cottongrass and high water table, supporting a more abundant microbial biomass. Cottongrass dominated plots also had larger gas emissions as compared to bare plots even though they were net C sinks due to their high photosynthetic rates. Conclusion Maintaining a high water table is key to reducing peatland C losses. While vascular plant presence seems to prime the release of N and greenhouse gases, the inputs of C exceeded the losses and recovered the C sink function of the peatland ecosystem in the short term. Carbon inputs are maximized under high water table and plant presence.

AB The use of treated wastewaters (TWW) in agriculture is widening in areas suffering drought, such as southern Europe, to preserve freshwater supply for human consumption. The composition of TWW, especially concerning their organic carbon (OC) content, has been demonstrated to influence the processes governing the behavior of non-ionic pesticides in soils. Three OC-poor agricultural soils (SV, RM1 and RM3) from the province of Granada (Spain) were chosen for the assessment of the adsorption and desorption of the herbicide dimethenamid (DIM) and the fungicide fenarimol (FEN). TWW and sewage sludge extracts at different dissolved OC (DOC) concentrations (30, 90 and 300 mg L-1) were considered to evaluate their effect on pesticide adsorption-desorption. As expected by their properties, DIM and FEN were weakly and moderately adsorbed to the soils, respectively. Soil OC seemed to be the major factor controlling FEN adsorption, whereas the mineral fraction played a key role in DIM adsorption, especially in RM1 with high clay:OC ratio. Although TWW did not significantly modify the adsorption of pesticides, it enhanced DIM desorption from the three soils. Adsorption of FEN to SV and RM3 was directly related to the concentration of DOC, possibly due to co-sorption phenomena. Hysteretic desorption was found in all cases, indicating partially reversible adsorption. While FEN desorption was not altered by the solutions, the use of sludge extracts at the highest DOC concentration (300 mg L-1) enhanced DIM desorption as occurred with TWW. Interactions with DOC in solution seemed to predominate for this less hydrophobic compound, thus increasing the risk of natural waters contamination if TWIN will be used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aims The association of organic matter with iron (Fe-OM associations) is recognized as an important stabilization mechanism for soil organic matter. Our objective was to assess the factors regulating stabilization of soil organic matter by iron in various plant-dominated peatlands, and the role of laccase in the formation of Fe-OM associations. Methods We investigated Fe-bound OC content and related physicochemical and biochemical parameters in four plots with different successional vegetation, and a set of simulations was conducted to investigate the association of Fe and peat-derived dissolved organic carbon catalysed by laccase. Results Our results indicate Fe-bound OC content varies regularly with the succession gradients, and a significant positive relationship between laccase activities and Fe-bound OC content was found (R = 0.77, P < 0.05). Although laccase degradation of recalcitrant polyphenolics is related with the CO2 release from peat soils (R = 0.697; P < 0.05), the simulation results confirmed laccase can significantly promote the formation of Fe-OM association. Conclusions We propose that laccase plays a unique multifunctional role in the peatland carbon cycle. That is, while laccase degrades refractory organic matter such as lignin, it may enhance carbon sequestration by promoting the formation of Fe-OM association, which is particularly effective in acidic peat environments containing abundant iron and laccase-producing fungi.

AB Vertical profiles of concentration and C-isotopic composition of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide were observed over 26 months in the catotelm of a deep (6.5 m) peat bog in Switzerland. The dissolved concentrations of these gases increase with depth while CO2 predominates over CH4 (CO2 ca. 5 times CH4). This pattern can be reproduced by a reaction-advection-ebullition model, where CO2 and CH4 are formed in a ratio of 1:1. The less soluble methane is preferentially lost via outgassing (bubbles). The isotopic fractionation between CO2 and CH4 also increases with depth, with alpha(C) values ranging from 1.045 to 1.075. The isotopic composition of the gases traces the passage of respiration-derived CO2 (from the near surface) through a shallow zone with methanogenesis of low isotopic fractionation (splitting of fermentation-derived acetate). This solution then moves through the catotelm, where methanogenesis occurs by CO2 reduction (large isotopic fractionation). In the upper part of the catotelm the C-13-depleted respiration-derived CO2 pool buffers the isotopic composition of CO2; the delta C-13 of CO2 increases only slowly. At the same time strongly depleted CH4 is formed as CO2 reduction consumes the depleted CO2. In the lower part of the catotelm, the respiration-derived CO2 and shallow CH4 become less important and CO, reduction is the dominant source Of CO2 and CH4. Now, the delta C-13 Values of both gases increase until equilibrium is reached with respect to the isotopic composition of the substrate. Thus, the delta C-13 values of methane reach a minimum at intermediate depth, and the deep methane has delta C-13 values comparable to shallow methane. A simple mixing model for the isotopic evolution is suggested. Only minor changes of the observed patterns of methanogenesis (in terms of concentration and isotopic composition) occur over the seasons. The most pronounced of these is a slightly higher rate of acetate splitting in spring. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic covers are increasingly used to control the generation of contaminated mine drainage from tailings impoundment facilities. Their efficiency in controlling the mobility of contaminants in the underlying tailings depends on their biogeochemical and hydrogeological properties. In the present study, fibric peat, an easily accessible material at northern gold mine sites, was evaluated as organic cover to potentially reclaim desulfurized tailings under controlled conditions. Three column testing scenarios were set up: a control of 30 cm tailings (C1), and two of tailings (30 cm) covered with compacted (C2) and non-compacted (C3) peat (100 cm). The columns were rinsed with 2 L of deionized water, in wetting-drying monthly cycles, for 12 months. Results showed that the tailings leached As in the drainage water (0.01-24 mg/L), mainly originating from arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and accessory l <spacing diaeresis>ollingite (FeAs2). Non-compacted peat cover increased the concentrations of total As (by 3-88%) and As (III) (by 91-99%) in the leachate despite low dissolved organic carbon concentrations (36-74 mg/L). Compacted peat first increased total As leaching similar to non-compacted peat cover. Then, As concentration decreased to as low as 11 mu g/L after 6 months. A slight decrease of pH (<= 6) and an increase of redox potential (>200 mV) promoted As stability with the use of a compacted peat cover, As (V) being the dominant species in the leachates. Under compacted peat, mineralogical analysis of the tailings showed that As was associated with Fe-oxides, and parallel extraction confirmed that As was bound to crystalline Fe-oxides. These results highlighted the uncertainty associated with the use of peat covers to reclaim neutral mine tailings bearing As. Biochemical and hydrogeological properties of organic materials are variable and evolve over time. Slight changes proved to have high impacts on mine drainage quality.

AB Reservoirs are sources of greenhouses gases to the atmosphere, primarily due to organic carbon mineralization in flooded plants and soils to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Floating peat islands are common in reservoirs that inundated peatlands. These islands can decompose on mass, or small pieces of peat can erode from islands to decompose in the water column or on the bottom of reservoirs. Here we used large 450 liter sealed enclosures to measure mineralization rates of small peat pieces and larger peat blocks collected from floating peat islands. Mineralization rates were calculated by quantifying dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4 accumulation within the water and headspace of the enclosures over time. We found that peat did decompose under water, but rates of mineralization of peat pieces were not different than rates of mineralization of larger peat blocks. Mineralization rates ranged between 59 and 140 mug C g(-1) d(-1). Peat pieces acidified the water, shifting the bicarbonate equilibrium to almost exclusively dissolved CO2, which was then readily able to flux to the atmosphere. We estimated that 2.4-5.6% of peat carbon was mineralized annually, suggesting that fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from reservoirs that flood peatlands could last at minimum 18-42 years from this carbon source alone.

AB Removal of natural organic matter (NOM) is increasingly important in production and distribution of drinking water complying with health and aesthetic guidelines. The impact of treatment is often investigated using the resulting dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and trihalomethane formation potential. Water treatment processes of ferric and alum coagulation with and without pre-oxidation by ozone and permanganate were scanned for their ability to treat synthetic raw water from peat extract. To compare the efficiency of the treatment methods the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chlorine decay and trihalomethane (THM) formation tests the important parameters needed in practice were used. A high level of DOC removal (>80%) was achieved with all the treatments. A significant difference was observed in chlorine decay rates and THM production. Pre-oxidation with 2 mg/L of O-3 and coagulation with 45 mg/L of ferric sulphate produced the most chlorine stable water followed by water treated with 80 mg/L of ferric sulphate. Chlorine decay test was found to be a more sensitive indicator of a successful treatment than DOC. The optimisation of the ozone dose is likely to identify the best water quality and chemical cost combination which is not likely achievable by the coagulation alone.

AB Many antibiotics, including sulfonamides, are being frequently detected in soil and groundwater. Livestock waste is an important source of antibiotic pollution, and sulfonamides may be present along with organic-rich substances. This study aims to investigate the sorption reaction of two sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and sulfapyridine (SPY) in two organic-rich sorbents: a commercial peat soil (38.41% carbon content) and a composted manure (24.33% carbon content). Batch reactions were conducted to evaluate the impacts of pH (4.5-9.5) and background ions (0.001 M-0.1 M CaCl2) on their sorption. Both linear partitioning and Freundlich sorption isotherms fit the reaction well. The n values of Freundlich isotherm were close to 1 in most conditions suggesting that the hydrophobic partition is the major adsorption mechanism. In terms of SMZ, K-d declined with increases in the pH. SPY has a pyridine group that is responsible for adsorption at high pH values, and thus, no significant trend between Kd and pH was observed. At high pH ranges, SPY sorption deviated significantly from linear partitioning. The results suggested the sorption mechanism of these two sulfonamide antibiotics tended to be hydrophobic partitioning under most of the experimental conditions, especially at pH values lower than their corresponding pK(a2), The fluorescence excitation emission matrix and dissolved organic carbon leaching test suggested composted manure has higher fulvic acid organics and that peat soil has higher humus like organics. Small organic molecules showed stronger affinity toward sulfonamide antibiotics and cause the composted manure to exhibit higher sorption capacity. Overall, this study suggests that the chemical structure and properties of sulfonamides antibiotics and the type of organic matter in soils will greatly influence the fate and transport of these contaminants into the environment.

AB We showed that sandy subsoils beneath peat near Ramsey Lake, MI, contained 7.5 to 8.0 kg organic C (OC) m(-2) to a depth of 70 cm, compared with 1.6 to 3.6 kg m(-2) in adjacent forest soils, from which the peatland had evolved through paludification. Compared with the soils beneath the forest, those beneath the peat contained similar amounts of oxalate-extractable Al (Al-0) and less Fe, owing to loss of Fe under reduced leached conditions beneath the peat. Most of the extractable Al in the mineral horizons beneath peat was organically bound. Atomic pyrophosphate-extractable (Fe-p + Al-p) Fe + Al/C ratios were smaller (<0.2:1) in the mineral horizons beneath peat than in the forest mineral subsoils (generally >0.2:1), indicating larger inputs and retention in the mineral subsoils beneath peat. Concentration of OC in subsoil samples was strongly (r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.001) related to the subsoil Al, null-point dissolved organic C (DOC) and clay concentrations. A DOC sorption study using peat pore water ranging from 0 to 117 mg DOC L-1 revealed null-point DOC (DOCnp) concentrations (at which there is neither gain nor loss of OC by the soil) varied from <1 to 417 mg DOC L-1 and was primarily related to Fe,, (negatively), Al,, (negatively), and C (positively). We suggest that the increase in mineral subsoil OC beneath peat is related to the sorption of DOC carried by pore water percolating through the mineral subsoil, combined with slow rates of mineralization of sorbed DOC under anoxic conditions.

AB The relationship between stream water DOC concentrations and soil organic C pools was investigated at a range of spatial scales in subcatchments of the River Dee system in north-east Scotland. Catchment percentage peat cover and soil C pools, calculated using local, national and international soils databases, were related to mean DOC concentrations in streams draining small- (<5 km(2)), medium- (12-38 km(2)) and large-scale (56-150 km(2)) catchments. The results show that, whilst soil C pool is a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration at all three scales, the strongest relationships were found in the small-scale catchments. In addition, in both the small- and large-scale catchments, percentage peat cover was as a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration as catchment soil C pool. The data also showed that, for a given soil C pool, streams draining lowland (< 700 m) catchments had higher DOC concentrations than those draining upland (> 700 m) catchments, suggesting that disturbance and land use may have a small effect on DOC concentration. Our results therefore suggest that the relationship between stream water DOC concentration and catchment soil C pools exists at a range of spatial scales and this relationship appears to be sufficiently robust to be used to predict the effects of changes in catchment soil C storage on stream water DOC concentration.

AB Spilled crude petroleum from oil wells contains numerous hydrocarbons, some of which are toxic and threaten life. We have studied the mobility and persistence of hydrocarbons in waterlogged soils that contain large proportions of fermented organic matter (Histosols) and large concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the State of Tabasco, Mexico. We sampled soil and phreatic water at sites polluted by oil spills for several decades, as well as at sites that had only recently (few weeks) been polluted, and compared their hydrocarbon contents with those of unaffected sites in the same area. Samples were analyzed for 16 non-alkylated polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and n-alkanes from nC9 to nC34.
   The spilled hydrocarbons had remained predominantly in the organic surface horizons of the soil where spillage occurred; there was little evidence of movement within the soil. The fraction of low molecular weight compounds was larger at sites of recent spills than where spills happened several decades ago. Nevertheless, sites of old spills still contained large concentrations of hydrocarbons, among which those of low molecular weight represented from 30 to 49% of total PAHs and from 50 to 84% of total n-alkanes, indicating that volatilization or microbial degradation is slow in these soils. In the peat horizons the measured organic carbon partition coefficients (K,,)for the higher molecular weight PAHs were consistently smaller than those estimated by empirical equations by up to two orders of magnitude. The dissolved organic carbon of these peat soils seems to influence this behavior. At sites of old spills, partition coefficients for the PAHs were larger than at sites of recent spills.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs in southern Patagonia have been examined with regard to paleoclimatic and geochemical research questions but knowledge about organic matter decomposition in these bogs is limited. Therefore, we examined peat humification with depth by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) measurements of solid peat, C/N ratio, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope measurements in three bog sites. Peat decomposition generally increased with depth but distinct small scale variation occurred, reflecting fluctuations in factors controlling decomposition. C/N ratios varied mostly between 40 and 120 and were significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.55, p < 0.01) with FTIR-derived humification indices. The degree of decomposition was lowest at a site presently dominated by Sphagnum mosses. The peat was most strongly decomposed at the driest site, where currently peat-forming vegetation produced less refractory organic material, possibly due to fertilizing effects of high sea spray deposition. Decomposition of peat was also advanced near ash layers, suggesting a stimulation of decomposition by ash deposition. Values of delta C-13 were 26.5 +/- 2 parts per thousand in the peat and partly related to decomposition indices, while delta N-15 in the peat varied around zero and did not consistently relate to any decomposition index. Concentrations of DOM partly related to C/N ratios, partly to FTIR derived indices. They were not conclusively linked to the decomposition degree of the peat. DOM was enriched in C-13 and in N-15 relative to the solid phase probably due to multiple microbial modifications and recycling of N in these N-poor environments. In summary, the depth profiles of C/N ratios, delta C-13 values, and FTIR spectra seemed to reflect changes in environmental conditions affecting decomposition, such as bog wetness, but were dominated by site specific factors, and are further influenced by ash deposition and possibly by sea spray input.

AB Increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in lakes, rivers and streams in northern mid latitudes have been widely reported during the last two decades, but relatively few studies have dealt with trends in DOC export. We studied the export of DOC from Finnish rivers to the Baltic Sea between 1975 and 2010, and estimated trends in DOC fluxes (both flow normalised and non-normalised). The study encompassed the whole Finnish Baltic Sea catchment area (301,000 km(2)) covering major land use patterns in the boreal zone. Finnish rivers exported annually over 900,000 t DOC to the Baltic Sea, and the mean area specific export was 3.5 t km(-2). The highest export (7.3 t km(-2)) was measured in peat dominated catchments, whereas catchments rich in lakes had the lowest export (2.2 t km(-2)). Inter-annual variation in DOC export was high and controlled mainly by hydrology. There was no overall trend in the annual water flow, although winter flow increased in northern Finland over 36 years. Despite the numerous studies showing increases in DOC concentrations in streams and rivers in the northern hemisphere, we could not find any evidence of increases in DOC export to the northern Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments since 1975.

AB Mechanical dewatering of wet mined peat produced peat mining process water (PMPW) with low pH (5.49) and high total suspended solids (TSS 432 mg L-1), Al (1.39 mg L-1), Fe (4.36 mg L-1), Hg (37.1 ng L-1), MeHg (0.485 ng L-1), Zn (55 mu g L-1), total nitrogen (TN 7.92 mg L-1), total phosphorus (TP 303 mu g L-1) and true colour (532 TCU). High removal efficiencies were calculated for acrotelm peat filters (mesocosms) used to treat PMPW (TSS 45-83%; particulate organic carbon (POC) 47-89%; metals 53-100%; TN 85%; TP 81%), though final mesocosm leachate concentrations did not all achieve Canadian Water Quality Guidelines. In one study, mesocosm leachate had higher colour and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations than PMPW. Our mesocosm studies suggest an initial reduction in PMPW solids be considered by industry before peatlands are used as treatment systems.

AB Distribution patterns of pH and concentrations of chemical components were studied in Mizorogaike, a pond with a floating-mat bog, which is naturally acidified by the Sphagnum community. Considering the distribution of pH, sampling sites were selected on the floating mat (two sites), beneath the floating mat (one site), in the open water around the floating mat (two sites), and at the mouths of inflows (two sites). Monthly observations from April 1994 through March 1995 revealed that the distribution patterns of chemical components could be classified into three groups according to their pH dependence: (1) concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, organic phosphorus, aluminum, iron, and manganese increase with decrease in pH; (2) concentrations of dissolved orthophosphate and silicon increase with increase in pH; (3) concentrations of suspended particulate aluminum, iron, manganese, phosphorus, and silicon do not depend on the pH. Thus in Mizorogaike, the distribution of dissolved components depends on the pH.

AB Controlled laboratory experiments were combined with field measurements to better understand the interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and reduced iron in organic-rich peatlands. Addition of peat-derived humic acid extract (HA) to Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES-1 liquid cultures led to higher cell numbers and up to 1.4 times higher Fe(II) oxidation rates compared to chemical controls. This effect was positively correlated with increasing HA concentrations. Similar Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide mineralogies were formed both abiotically and biotically irrespective of HA amendment, but minerals formed in the presence of ES-1 and HA were smaller. ES-1 growth with HA promoted aggregation of Fe(III) products in agarose-stabilized gradient tubes as shown by voltammetric profiling. In situ voltammetry in an acidic, iron-rich peatland revealed a gap between oxygen penetration and iron reduction that may reflect active Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms. The highest abundance of Fe(II)oxidizers Sideroxydans (4.9 x 10(7) gene copies gww(-1)) and Gallionella (1.5 x 10(7) gene copies gww(-1)) in the upper peat layer coincided with small-sized minerals resembling nanoparticulate ferrihydrite or goethite. Our results suggest that microbially mediated Fe(II) oxidation dominates in the presence of DOM leading to the formation of nano-sized biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides that might be readily bioavailable and likely important to iron and carbon cycling.

AB Factors controlling dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) production in degraded fen peatlands remains largely equivocal. Thus, the purpose of this research was to determine whether short-term changes in DOC and DON content and microbial properties are related to variations in weather conditions, soil properties and human activity. The study was conducted in May and September 2017 & ndash;2019 to determine the seasonal variations in the abovementioned parameters in soil layers (0 & ndash;30 cm) of a long-term agricultural peatland additionally affected by open-pit mining. We found that the most critical environmental factors that shape microbial community structure and activity are air temperature and precipitation, which explained 59.9% of the variability. Air temperature was also the most important explanatory factors for DOC and DON variation, which explained 18.9% of the total variability. Moreover, in the case of DOC and DON production, significant positive correlations with soil organic carbon content (DOC r = 0.46, p < 0.01; DON r = 0.54, p < 0.001) was found. The potential impact of open-pit mines on the DOC and DON production was not confirmed, as there was no significant difference between sites located in the depression cones (caused by lignite mining) and those sites affected exclusively by agriculture drainage. This work hopes to contribute towards a deeper understanding of the variables and dependencies that affect the production of labile organic forms in degraded fen peatland soils in the temperate climate zone.& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Ombrotrophic raised bogs are nutrient poor acidic peatlands accumulating organic matter. They are widely spread on northern latitudes and are substantial sources of methane emissions to the atmosphere being of great concern from a climate change perspective. We investigated the methanogen community composition along microtopographic gradients within three bogs in Scandinavia, receiving different amounts of nitrogen precipitation. Methanogenic community analyses by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the mcrA gene showed different profiles among the three sites, while no influence of the rnicrotopographic gradients was observed. Peat temperature and dissolved organic carbon were the major edaphic variables explaining 38% of the variation of the methanogenic community diversity among the bogs. The family Methanoregulaceae (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) showed the largest relative proportion and highest activity in all three sites. Quantitative PCR of the mcrA gene and transcripts showed that the most northern site, receiving the lowest atmospheric nitrogen load, had significantly lower abundance and activity of methanogens (4.7 x 10(6) and 2.4 x 10(4) mcrA copies per gram of soil, respectively), compared to the most southern site (8.2 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(5) mcrA copies per gram of soil, respectively), receiving the highest nitrogen load. No patterns of the mcrA gene and transcript abundances were observed along the microtopography. The results indicated that the difference in occurrence of methanogens is mainly due to geoclirnatological conditions rather than site intrinsic microtopographic variation. The study further suggests that environmental changes on the site intrinsic topography will not affect the methanogenic activity, while increasing average temperatures in Scandinavian ombrotrophic raised bogs might contribute to an increase of the methanogenic archaeal activity resulting in an increase of methane production.

AB This study examines the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from upland peat during the period of the autumn flushing. Hydroclimatic conditions were monitored in conjunction with measurements of absorbance and the E4/E6 ratio of the stream draining an 11.4 km(2) upland peat catchment in northern England. During two months of monitoring the effects of 67 separate rainfall events were examined showing that:
   1. The peat behaves hydrologically as if it were a two end-member system consisting of old, interevent, and new, event, water. Runoff is initiated by percolation excess of new water at the acrotelm-catotelm interface.
   2. The discharge of dissolved organic matter behaves like a three end-member system with the between-event water being low in DOC and storm events being characterized by two types of water. Initial runoff being characterized by new water rich in DOC that gives way to new water depleted in DOC. This transition can be ascribed to the runoff progressing from throughflow within the acrotelm progressing to saturation-excess overland flow.
   3. Depletion of DOC during storm events is accompanied by a change in the character of the DOC as the E4/E6 ratio changes. This suggests that the decrease in DOC during events is the result of exhaustion of reserves rather than changes in the flowpaths being utilized by runoff.
   4. The amount of carbon released in any event is critically dependent upon the time between events during which oxidation processes generate a reservoir of available carbon. Production of available carbon in the catchment is as high as 4.5 g C per day per m(3) of peat, suggesting a turnover rate of peat of the order of 42 years. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The burning of heather and grass to maintain a mosaic of different aged vegetation stands is a widespread management practice in the uplands of the UK. However, there is concern that burning also releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into drinking water supplies. This study was based on a long term experiment examining different rotational burning cycles and grazing intensities on upland vegetation. The study aimed to understand the effect these management practices have on water quality both in the long term and in the short term following a managed burn. The study has found that:
   1. At the end of a burn cycle, DOC concentrations in soil water or runoff water are not significantly affected by burning treatment. However colour (absorbance at 400 nm) was found to be significantly lower on 20 year burn plots than unburnt controls.
   2. In the weeks following the burn there were peaks in DOC concentration and colour in the soil water of burnt plots compared to unburnt controls but these peaks were short lived and neither DOC concentrations nor colour were significantly elevated I year after burning.
   3. The composition of the DOC in soil water and runoff water is not affected by burning treatment; rather, the variation in data is controlled by time of sampling and season.
   4. Values for three carbon parameters (absorbance at 400 nm, DOC concentration and specific absorbance) are significantly lower in runoff water than soil water.
   5. Grazing does not significantly affect carbon parameters in soil water at the end of a burn cycle however grazing effects can be seen in runoff water at the end of a 10-year burn cycle. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Undisturbed peatlands represent long-term net sinks of carbon; however, peat extraction converts these systems into large and persistent sources of greenhouse gases. Although rewetting and restoration following peat extraction have taken place over the last several decades, very few studies have investigated the longer term impact of this restoration on peatland carbon balance. We determined the annual carbon balance of a former horticulturally-extracted peatland restored 10 yr prior to the study and compared these values to the carbon balance measured at neighboring unrestored and natural sites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the chamber technique biweekly during the growing season from May to October 2010 and three times over the winter period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export was measured from remnant ditches in the unrestored and restored sites. During the growing season the restored site had greater uptake of CO2 than the natural site when photon flux density was greater than 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), while the unrestored site remained a source of CO2. Ecosystem respiration was similar between natural and restored sites, which were both significantly lower than the unrestored site. Methane flux remained low at the restored site except from open water pools, created as part of restoration, and remnant ditches. Export of DOC during the growing season was 5.0 and 28.8 gm(-2) from the restored and unrestored sites, respectively. Due to dry conditions during the study year all sites acted as net carbon sources with annual balance of the natural, restored and unrestored sites of 250.7, 148.0 and 546.6 gCm(-2), respectively. Although hydrological conditions and vegetation community at the restored site remained intermediate between natural and unrestored conditions, peatland restoration resulted in a large reduction in annual carbon loss from the system resulting in a carbon balance more similar to a natural peatland.

AB Peatland restoration in North America (NA) was initiated approximately 25years ago on peat-extracted bogs. Recent advances in peatland restoration in NA have expanded the original concepts and methodology. Restoration efforts in NA now include restoring peatlands from many diverse types of disturbances (e.g. roads, agriculture, grazing, erosion, forestry, and petrol industry infrastructure impacts) and occur in a greater array of peatland types (e.g. fens and swamps). Because fens are groundwater and surface flow driven, techniques to restore the hydrology of fens are generally more complicated than bogs. Restoring a greater variety of peatland types on a large-scale basis (> 10ha) commands new techniques for reestablishing a broader array of plants other than Sphagnum spp., including non-Sphagnum mosses, sedges, nonericaceous shrubs, and trees. The rationale for restoring peatlands has expanded to include legal requirements, wetland mitigation and banking, climate mitigation, water quality, and as part of responsible ecosystem management for industry or society. In the past 25 years, peatland restoration in NA has evolved from (1) trial and error to a more empirically based scientific approach, (2) small site-specific experiments to landscape-scale restoration (e.g. hydrological connectivity, ecological fragmentation), and (3) individual stakeholder (academic) to multiple stakeholders across jurisdictional boundaries (private, local, and regional governmental agencies, NGOs, and so on). However, many research gaps still exist that must be addressed to enhance our ability to restore peatlands successfully.

AB Boreal peatlands contain a large portion of the Earth's terrestrial organic carbon and may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Temperatures in boreal regions are predicted to increase during the twenty-first century which may accelerate changes in soil microbial processes and plant community dynamics. In particular, climate-driven changes in plant community composition might affect the pathways and rates of methanogenesis, the plant-mediated emission of methane, and the scavenging of methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Climate change may also affect methane cycling through changes in pore water chemistry. To date, these feedbacks have not been incorporated into the carbon cycling components of climate models. We investigated the effects of soil warming and water table manipulations on methane cycling in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and fen received infrared warming treatments crossed with water table treatments for 6 years. In years 5 and 6, concentrations, fluxes, and isotopic compositions of methane were measured along with aboveground and belowground net primary productivity and pore water concentrations of acetate, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. Water table level was the dominant control over methane flux in the fen mesocosms, likely through its effect on methane oxidation rates. However, pore water chemistry and plant productivity were important secondary factors in explaining methane flux in the fen mesocosms, and these factors appeared to be the predominant controls over methane flux in the bog mesocosms. The water table and IR treatments had large effects on pore water chemistry and plant productivity, so the indirect effects of climate change appear to be just as important as the direct effects of changing temperature and water table level in controlling future methane fluxes from northern peatlands. Pore water sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and acetate had a relatively consistent negative relationship with methane emissions, pore water DOC had a positive relationship with methane emissions, and BNPP had mixed effects. The bog mesocosms had much higher methane emissions and pore water methane concentrations than the fen mesocosms, despite a much lower average water table level and peat that is a poor substrate for methanogenesis. We suggest that the relatively high methane fluxes in the bog mesocosms can be explained through their low concentrations of inhibitory pore water compounds, high concentrations of DOC, and high plant productivity. Stable isotopic data from pore water support acetate fermentation as the principal pathway of methanogenesis in bog mesocosms (mean delta(13) CH4 = -41.0%, mean delta D-CH4 = -190%). Fen mesocosms had lower pore water concentrations and emissions of methane than bog mesocosms, despite much higher methane production potentials in fen peat. The methane from the fen mesocosms was isotopically heavy (mean delta(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, mean delta D-CH4 = -140%), suggesting a strong oxidative sink. This is likely related to the dominance of graminoid vegetation and the associated oxygen transport into the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change.

AB The carbon sink function of peatlands is primarily driven by a higher production than decomposition of the litter Sphagnum mosses. The observed increase of vascular plants in peatlands could alter the decomposition rate and the carbon (C) cycle through a litter mixing effect, which is still poorly studied. Here, we examine the litter mixing effect of a peat moss (Sphagnum fallax) and two vascular plants (Pinus uncinata and Eriophorum vaginatum) in the field and laboratory-based experiment.
   During the laboratory incubation, mass loss, CO2 production, and dissolved organic carbon concentration were periodically monitored during 51 days. The collected data were then processed in a C dynamics model. The calculated enzymatic activity was correlated to the measured beta-glucosidase activity in the litter. In the field experiment, mass loss and CO2 production from litter bags were annually measured for 3 years.
   Both laboratory and field experiments clearly show that the litter mixture, i.e., Sphagnum-Pinus-Eriophorum, had a synergistic effect on decomposition by enhancing the mass loss. Such enhanced mass loss increased the water extractable C and CO2 production in the litter mixture during the laboratory experiment. The synergistic effect was mainly controlled by the Sphagnum-Eriophorum mixture that significantly enhanced both mass loss and CO2 production. Although the beta-glucosidase activity is often considered as a major driver of decomposition, mixing the litters did not cause any increase of the activity of this exo-enzyme in the laboratory experiment suggesting that other enzymes can play an important role in the observed effect.
   Mixing litters of graminoid and Sphagnum species led to a synergistic effect on litter decomposition. In a context of vegetation dynamics in response to environmental change, such a mixing effect could alter the C dynamics at a larger scale. Identifying the key mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effect on litter decomposition, with a specific focus on the enzymatic activities, is crucial to better predict the capacity of peatlands to act as C sinks.

AB Foliar litter is the main input of organic carbon to many soils, and thus litter decomposition processes are integral to our understanding of carbon dynamics in soil systems. Despite the short duration of the leaching phase of decomposition, a considerable amount of mass loss can occur providing a valuable energy source for microbes, and influencing leaf litter chemistry for subsequent microbial decomposition. At the same time, differences in plant species and their functional traits play a role in decomposition dynamics, particularly in consideration of shifting plant communities or changes in leaf chemistry under climate change. Here we investigate the short-term leaching decomposition dynamics of three boreal peatland plant species (Carex magellanica, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Sphagnum magellanicum) grown under ambient and elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. Litter chemistry was significantly different among all three plant species. In addition, plant tissues grown under elevated CO2 showed lower total C and total N than plants grown under ambient CO2. After leaching, however litter from plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions were not significantly different in total C values compared to plants grown under ambient CO2 conditions. Mass loss corresponded with the total dissolved organic carbon release across all species and was greatest in Chamaedaphne, a woody shrub; measures of carbon lability (SUVA(254)) were significantly greater in vascular plant species compared to Sphagnum moss. Mass loss was reduced in plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions, suggesting allocation to more non-soluble structural compounds. Placing our results within a climate change scenario where peatland plant community compositional shifts from mosses to graminoids and woody shrubs have been observed, we suggest that greater amounts of more labile carbon released from vascular plant species indicates a shift to more decomposable litters with the potential to stimulate microbial growth and activity.

AB The fate of the vast stocks of organic carbon stored in permafrost of the Western Siberian Lowland, the world's largest peat-land, is uncertain. Specifically, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from rivers in the region is unknown. Here we present estimates of annual CO2 emissions from 58 rivers across all permafrost zones of the Western Siberian Lowland, between 56 and 67 degrees N. We find that emissions peak at the permafrost boundary, and decrease where permafrost is more prevalent and in colder climatic conditions. River CO2 emissions were high, and on average two times greater than downstream carbon export. We suggest that high emissions and emission/export ratios are a result of warm temperatures and the long transit times of river water. We show that rivers in the Western Siberian Lowland play an important role in the carbon cycle by degassing terrestrial carbon before its transport to the Arctic Ocean, and suggest that changes in both temperature and precipitation are important for understanding and predicting high-latitude river CO2 emissions in a changing climate.

AB In-situ oil extraction activities impact the vast mosaic of boreal wetlands and uplands. Peatland restoration in these regions aims at reestablishing crucial peatland functions, such as peat accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration. In order to assess the success of fen restoration, we evaluated the biogeochemical conditions, the seasonal carbon balances via carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and methane (CH4) emissions, and addressed the global warming potential following different restoration techniques at two restored in-situ oil sands well pads, during two consecutive growing seasons. Restoration work involved: 1) the partial or complete removal of introduced well pad construction materials, and spontaneous revegetation, or 2) the partial removal of foreign clay, in addition to reintroduction of typical fen plant species such as Larix laricina, Salix lutea and Carex aquatilis. Comparisons were done with regional reference ecosystems (REF) consisting of three peatlands: a wooded bog, a wooded rich fen and a wooded extreme-rich fen. While the average electric conductivity of restored sectors (946 mu S cm(-1)) was higher compared to REF (360 mu S cm(-1)), the pH was quite similar (pH 5.8 REF, pH 6 restored). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was lower in all restored sectors (5-11 mg L-1 restored sectors, 15-35 mg L-1 REF), presumably due to the still incomplete recovery of vegetation and lower organic matter content associated with remnant well pad material. Re-establishment of shrub and brown moss species improved significantly the C uptake. However, the active introduction of plant species was no crucial restoration step, in order to return species beneficial for C uptake. Restoration treatments that were leveled closest to the surrounding REF showed the most similar seasonal C balance to REF. In shallow open water areas resulting from the complete removal of all construction materials, we measured the highest methane emissions making these flooded sites net C sources to the atmosphere with elevated global warming potential. The partial removal of the well pad's mineral soil to near the water table level and the surface elevation of the surrounding ecosystem seems to be the most effective site management method to sequester carbon efficiently. However, further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of this restoration method for the recovery of biodiversity and possible impacts of residual foreign materials on fen ecosystems.

AB The impact of climate change on the greenhouse gas balance of peatlands is debated as they function both as sinks of carbon and significant sources of methane. To study redox transformations influencing methane production, we incubated two intact soil monoliths from a northern temperate fen and compared a permanently wet treatment to a treatment undergoing an experimentally induced drought for 50 days. Net turnover of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4) and electron acceptors in the saturated zone was calculated using a mass balance approach, and sulfate gross reduction rates were determined using a S-35 radiotracer. Thermodynamic energy yield of different electron accepting processes was calculated and related to the observed respiration patterns. Permanently wet conditions lead to a depletion of electron acceptors within 50 days and onset of methanogenic conditions. During drought, electron acceptors were renewed and methanogenesis was temporarily suppressed in most of the peat for another 20-50 days after rewetting. Methanogenesis began, however, apparently locally before electron acceptors were fully depleted in the remainder of the peat, and iron and sulfate reduction occurred simultaneously. Anaerobic production of DIC could mostly but not fully be explained by reduction of nitrate, sulfate and ferric iron. Sulfate gross reduction rates of up to similar to 450 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) determined with S-35-SO4 and potentially explained the surplus of 50-60 mmol m(-2) of DIC production in one treatment; however, the sulfate pools were too small to sustain such rates beyond some hours to days. Furthermore, anaerobic DIC production proceeded at constant rates after depletion of dissolved inorganic electron acceptors, although not being balanced by methane production. An unknown electron acceptor was thus consumed, and sulfate and potentially other electron acceptors recycled, either by humic substances, by aerenchymatic oxygen transport, or by oxygen in the capillary fringe at low levels of air filled porosity.

AB We studied the long-term changes in groundwater composition in the context of peat restoration at a degraded water-table managed peatland site typical for many agriculturally used fen areas in the northern hemisphere. At the study site, peatland rewetting with groundwater control and pumped canal water was carried out in two periods: from 1997 to 2002 and from 2011 to 2013. The site was not managed between 2002 and 2011, which led to an unstable groundwater table that had declined in part The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of rewetting and desiccation on groundwater chemistry. We pursued a multivariate approach using nonlinear principal component analysis (Isomap) to identify the prevailing processes that control the groundwater quality in this system.
   Sixteen years after peatland restoration, the groundwater quality had significantly improved. Principal component analysis revealed that hydrological processes had a major impact on groundwater quality, i.e. fluctuations between upwelling of local, salt-influenced groundwater and downwelling of surface and rainwater (first principal component) as well as upwelling of regional groundwater from deeper layers (second principal component) which originated from the catchment. In particular, the upwelling of regional deep groundwater had a strong positive impact on the groundwater quality of upper layers at the Biesenbrow site. Another major impact on groundwater quality was nutrient withdrawal by macrophytes and incorporation into organic matter. In the upper groundwater layer, peat mineralization processes resulted in substantially increased SO4 concentrations.
   We concluded that potential matter release after rewetting is buffered by hydrological barriers, and seems to be marginal with little impact on adjacent environments in the long term. The ecosystem is sustainably stabilized, and therefore has no negative impact on groundwater quality during periods of water shortage. Due to the strong influence of regional groundwater, management measures in the catchment are very important for maintaining and improving groundwater quality in peatlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Radiocarbon isotopes are increasingly being used to investigate the age and source of carbon released from peatlands. Here we use combined C-14 and delta C-13 measurements to determine the isotopic composition of soil and soil decomposition products [dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2 and CH4] in a peatland-riparian-stream transect, to establish the isotopic signature and potential connectivity between carbon pools. Sampling was conducted during two time periods in 2012 to investigate processes under different temperature, hydrological and flux conditions. Isotopic differences existed in the peatland and riparian zone soil organic matter as a result of the riparian depositional formation. The peatland had a mean radiocarbon age of 551 +/- A 133 years BP, with age increasing with depth, and delta C-13 values consistent with C3 plant material as the primary source. In contrast the riparian zone had a much older radiocarbon age of 1,055 +/- A 107 years BP and showed no age/depth relationship; delta C-13 in the riparian zone was also consistent with C3 plant material. With the exception of DOC in September, soil decomposition products were predominately > 100 %modern with C-14 values consistent with derivation from organic matter fixed in the previous 5 years. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the soil surface were also modern. In contrast, CO2 and CH4 evaded from the stream surface was older (CH4: 310-537 years BP, CO2: 36 years BP to modern) and contained a more complex mix of sources combining soil organic matter and geogenic carbon. The results suggest considerable vertical transport of modern carbon to depth within the soil profile. The importance of modern recently fixed carbon and the differences between riparian and stream isotopic signatures suggests that the peatland (not the riparian zone) is the most important source of carbon to stream water.

AB Climate change studies foresee substantial changes in precipitation patterns in northern temperate regions, including an increased frequency of drought and intense rain events. To elucidate the impact of drying and rewetting on redox processes in peatlands we conducted a field scale manipulation experiment, tracing the below ground dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4), and electron acceptors in a minerotrophic fen. On three treatment plots, a drought phase of similar to 4 weeks was initiated by means of a drainage system and a mountable roof. Subsequently we simulated a heavy rainfall by irrigation, which raised the water table by 20-35 cm. Three plots served as control. Solute electron acceptor concentrations increased during drought and decreased after rewetting, consistent with treatment and weather. Changes in solid phase electron acceptor contents were not detected. Drought induced aeration regenerated electron acceptors and suppressed methanogenic activity. This suppressive effect persisted during and some 1-4weeks after rewetting, dependent on depth. Hydrogen- and acetate-dependent iron and sulfate reduction were thermodynamically viable processes in the peat as their energy gain exceeded the threshold for microbial metabolism of -23 kJ mol(-1). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was apparently thermodynamically inhibited in most of the peat, but proceeded presumably in microenvironments. In the uppermost peat layers, partly above the water table level, iron and sulfate reduction and occasionally methanogenesis overlapped and aeration was limited. Thus, in these layers reductive processes could partly proceed even during drought As all processes, including methanogenesis, responded quickly to wetting events, the microbial community seemed to be well adapted to fluctuating redox conditions. This study demonstrated that the dense and highly decomposed material could still provide anaerobic habitats for microorganisms during drought and the depth distribution of redox processes was quite insensitive towards the water table manipulations, presumably due to formation of microenvironments.

AB In a field experiment to investigate potential impacts of climatic change, a small area of flush wetland in Wales was subjected to three successive years of simulated summer drought/rewetting (autumn-spring) cycles (1992-94). Drought was simulated achieved by diverting stream water around the experimental wetland during the summer, so that the wetland received only precipitation inputs during that time. The effects on peat-water chemistry in the rhizosphere were monitored at regular intervals until spring 1996, and comparisons made with a control. Simulated summer drought decreased, significantly, the natural summer peaks in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron, whilst subsequently increasing the natural autumn-winter peaks in sulphate concentrations and acidity in the peat water. The effects of simulated drought on SO4 concentrations in the peat water compared favourably with subsequent events monitored following a natural summer drought in 1995. Autumn-winter peaks in SO4 concentrations in the control wetland following the natural drought were of similar magnitude to those induced by the drought simulated in the experimental wetland in the previous three years.

AB Boreal ecosystems ill northwest Saskatchewan may he threatened by acidification as day area is downwind of atmospheric emissions sources from regional oil sands mining operations. To evaluate the status of lakes in this region, a survey of 259 headwater lakes was conducted during 2007-2008 within similar to 300 km of Fort McMurray, Alberta Acid sensitivity by ecoregion increased from Mod-Boreal Upland to Churchill River Upland to Athabasca Plain, with 60% of lakes classified as seasitive (50 200 peg acid neutralizing capacity (ANC)). and 8% as very sensitive (<50 mu eg L-1 ANC) to acid deposition, Organic anions dominated the acidity balance in most lakes. but non-marine sulphate varied positively with lake elevation and % upland cover (r(2) = 0.24). Base cation concentrations (Ca. Mg. K. Na) were correlated with % deciduous forest in the catchment area (r(2) = 0.33), while dissolved organic carbon (DOG,) was related most strongly to % bog and lake flushing variables (r(2)= 0.53). Variation in runoff coefficients derived by isotope mays balance corresponded with catchment area attributes that proxy controls on exaporation. infiltration and storage, and showed some ecoregional differences. The findings have implications for assignment of runoff values required to calculate critical loads of acidity. Although acidification appears not to be significantly advanced many dilute oligotrophic lakes with pH 6.0 to pH 6.5 are vulnerable to acid deposition.

AB Subarctic peatlands are rich sources of organic carbon for freshwater ecosystems. Where those peatlands are underlain by permafrost, permafrost thaw may cause an initial release of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to surrounding freshwaters. In this study, we measured icebound and potentially leachable (extracted) DOC quantities and indices of DOC quality in active layer and permafrost layers from two subarctic peat mires, Stord-alen and Storflaket. Most of the permafrost layers did not contain more organic matter or exportable DOC (as g kg(-1) dry soil) than the overlying active layer, and there was no difference in aromaticity, molecular weight, or the ratio between labile and recalcitrant DOC extracted from the permafrost and active layer. However, DOC held in segregated ice of the near-surface permafrost had relatively low aromaticity compared to extracted DOC from the same depth. Total icebound and potentially leachable DOC in the Stordalen mire permafrost that is predicted to experience active layer deepening during each of the next 50 years corresponded to about 0.1% of the current annual aquatic export of DOC from the mire. We conclude that the pool of potentially leachable DOC currently stored in permafrost layers is small. We also highlight differences in permafrost organic material between the two studied mire systems, which has an effect on the pool and properties of leachable DOC that is potentially available for export during thaw. Moreover, the geomorphological form of permafrost thaw will influence future hydrological connectedness and DOC production, in turn determining future DOC export from the mires.

AB The heterotrophic mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) controls the CO2 flux from the inland waters to the atmosphere, especially in the boreal waters, although the mechanisms of this process and the fate of trace metals associated with DOM remain poorly understood. We studied the interaction of culturable aquatic (Pseudomonas saponiphila) and soil (Pseudomonas aureofaciens) Gammaproteobacteria with seven different organic substrates collected in subarctic settings. These included peat leachate, pine crown throughfall, fen, humic lake, stream, river, and oligotrophic lake with variable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (from 4 to 60 mg L-1). The highest removal of DOC over 4 days of reaction was observed in the presence of P. aureofaciens (33 +/- 5%, 43 +/- 3% and 53 +/- 7% of the initial amount in fen water, humic lake and stream, respectively). P. saponiphila degraded only 5% of DOC in fen water but did not affect all other substrates. Trace elements (TE) were essentially controlled by short-term (0-1 h) adsorption on the surface of cells. Regardless of the nature of organic substrate and the identity of bacteria, the degree of adsorption ranged from 20 to 60% for iron (Fe3+), 15 to 55% for aluminum (Al), 10 to 60% for manganese (Mn), 10 to 70% for nickel (Ni), 20 to 70% for copper (Cu), 10 to 60% for yttrium (Y), 30 to 80% for rare earth elements (REE), and 15 to 50% for uranium (U-VI). Rapid adsorption of organic and organo-mineral colloids on bacterial cell surfaces is novel and potentially important process, which deserves special investigation. The long-term removal of dissolved Fe and Al was generally consistent with solution supersaturation degree with respect to Fe and Al hydroxides, calculated by visual Minteq model. Overall, the biomass-normalized biodegradability of various allochthonous substrates by culturable bacteria is much lower than that of boreal DOM by natural microbial consortia.

AB This study examines a natural, rapid, fivefold increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in a temperate shallow lake, describing the processes by which increased DOC resulted in anoxic conditions and altered existing carbon cycling pathways. High precipitation for two consecutive years led to rising water levels and the flooding of adjacent degraded peatlands. Leaching from the flooded soils provided an initial increase in DOC concentrations (from a 2010 mean of 12 +/- 1 mg L-1 to a maximum concentration of 53 mg L-1 by June 2012). Increasing water levels, DOC, and phytoplankton concentrations reduced light reaching the sediment surface, eliminating most benthic primary production and promoting anoxia in the hypolimnion. From January to June 2012 there was a sudden increase in total phosphorus (from 57 mg L-1 to 216 mg L-1), DOC (from 24.6 mg L-1 to 53 mg L-1), and iron (from 0.12 mg L-1 to 1.07 mg L-1) concentrations, without any further large fluxes in water levels. We suggest that anoxic conditions at the sediment surface and flooded soils produced a dramatic release of these chemicals that exacerbated brownification and eutrophication, creating anoxic conditions that persisted roughly 6 months below a water depth of 1 m and extended periodically to the water surface. This brownification-anoxia feedback loop resulted in a near-complete loss of macroinvertebrate and fish populations, and increased surface carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by an order of magnitude relative to previous years.

AB Halogens are strongly enriched in peat and peatlands and such they are one of their largest active terrestrial reservoir. The enrichment of halogens in peat is mainly attributed to the formation of organohalogens and climatically controlled humification processes. However, little is known about release of halogens from the peat substrate and the distribution of halogens in the peat pore water. In this study we have investigated the distribution of chlorine, bromine and iodine in pore water of three pristine peat bogs located in the Magellanic Moorlands, southern Chile. Peat pore waters were collected using a sipping technique, which allows in situ sampling down to a depth greater than 6 m. Halogens and halogen species in pore water were determined by ion-chromatography (IC) (chlorine) and IC-ICPMS (bromine and iodine). Results show that halogen concentrations in pore water are 15-30 times higher than in rainwater. Mean concentrations of chlorine, bromine and iodine in pore water were 7-15 mg l(-1), 56-123 g l(-1), and 10-20 g l(-1), which correspond to mean proportions of 10-15%, 1-2.3% and 0.5-2.2% of total concentrations in peat, respectively. Organobromine and organoiodine were the predominant species in pore waters, whereas chlorine in pore water was mostly chloride. Advection and diffusion of halogens were found to be generally low and halogen concentrations appear to reflect release from the peat substrate. Release of bromine and iodine from peat depend on the degree of peat degradation, whereas this relationship is weak for chlorine. Relatively higher release of bromine and iodine was observed in less degraded peat sections, where the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was also the most intensive. It has been concluded that the release of halogenated dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the predominant mechanism of iodine and bromine release from peat.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest biologically available sources of organic C in aquatic ecosystems, and its dynamics have implications for local and global C cycling. Usually, DOC biodegradation is assessed in laboratory incubations using native microbial communities as inoculum. The use of native inocula might hamper the comparability of biodegradation rates across systems and obstructs the identification of other controls on DOC biodegradation. Here, we propose the use of the Standardized Bacterial Inoculum (SBI) in experiments of freshwater DOC degradation that would allow for the assessment of the potential degradability of DOC and identification of the drivers of degradation without interferences from the diverse metabolic capabilities of native communities. The SBI is composed of six bacterial strains that grow easily under laboratory conditions and showed better DOC degradation performance than the single strains separately. The SBI performance was tested on simple C sources, humic acids, and natural organic matter from a range of freshwater ecosystems. The fraction and rates of C-substrates degradation by the SBI was consistently replicated under oxic and anoxic conditions. Moreover, DOC degradation rates by the SBI were equivalent to those of the native communities. Finally, the SBI consumed up to 31% of natural DOC from a variety of lakes, rivers, and peatlands over a 28-d period. Overall, the use of the SBI in future DOC degradation experiments will improve comparability among studies and will allow for the separation of effects caused by intrinsic DOC properties from those caused by heterogeneous microbial assemblages.

AB The assessment of riverine fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and metals in surface waters of permafrost-affected regions is crucially important for constraining adequate models of ecosystem functioning under various climate change scenarios. In this regard, the largest permafrost peatland territory on the Earth, the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL) presents a unique opportunity of studying possible future changes in biogeochemical cycles because it lies within a south-north gradient of climate, vegetation, and permafrost that ranges from the permafrost-free boreal to the Arctic tundra with continuous permafrost at otherwise similar relief and bedrocks. By applying a "substituting space for time" scenario, the WSL south-north gradient may serve as a model for future changes due to permafrost boundary shift and climate warming. Here we measured export fluxes (yields) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), major cations, macro- and micro- nutrients, and trace elements in 32 rivers, draining the WSL across a latitudinal transect from the permafrost-free to the continuous permafrost zone. We aimed at quantifying the impact of climate warming (water temperature rise and permafrost boundary shift) on DOC, nutrient and metal in rivers using a "substituting space for time" approach. We demonstrate that, contrary to common expectations, the climate warming and permafrost thaw in the WSL will likely decrease the riverine export of organic C and many elements. Based on the latitudinal pattern of riverine export, in the case of a northward shift in the permafrost zones, the DOC, P, N, Si, Fe, divalent heavy metals, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates are likely to decrease the yields by a factor of 2-5. The DIC, Ca, SO4, Sr, Ba, Mo, and U are likely to increase their yields by a factor of 2-3. Moreover, B, Li, K, Rb, Cs, N-NO3, Mg, Zn, As, Sb, Rb, and Cs may be weakly affected by the permafrost boundary migration (change of yield by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0). We conclude that modeling of C and element cycle in the Arctic and subarctic should be region-specific and that neglecting huge areas of permafrost peatlands might produce sizeable bias in our predictions of climate change impact.

AB Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a very important role in the cycling of organic carbon in aquatic systems. Increasing release of photoactive nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano TiO2) into surface water may impact this process. The present study employed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to examine the molecular transformation of natural DOM (peat DOM, DOMp) and anthropogenic DOM (sludge-derived DOM, DOMs) under photo-irradiation as affected by nano TiO2. Differences in molecular components between DOMp and DOMs were observed. DOMs contained more heteroatom formulas (76%) with low aromaticity and low carbon oxidation state than did DOMp (22%). The presence of nano TiO2 resulted in significant decreases in both DOM content and molecular diversity under photo-irradiation. Consistent alterations were observed between DOMp and DOMs such that high molecular weight compounds, high aromaticity and/or heteroatom S-containing compounds were more easily photodegraded in the presence of nano TiO2; whereas the average carbon oxidation state decreased in DOMp but increased in DOMS, likely due to the significant differences in 0 abundance, especially in the contents of carboxyl moieties, between DOMp and DOMs. The findings of the present study suggest that the release of nano TiO2 into aquatic environment will accelerate the consumption of dissolved organic carbon and the attenuation of molecular diversity for both DOM in waters.

AB We developed and tested a new method to separate CO(2) and CH(4) from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes a zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO(2) and CH(4) of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO(2) and CH(4) collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO(2) and CH(4) components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from similar to 0-300 BP at 0.25 m to similar to 4000 BP at 4 m. CH(4) was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO(2), with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH(4) was older by 430-615 yr. The delta(13)C values of CO(2) increased with depth from -12.4 parts per thousand and -8.0 parts per thousand at 0.25 m to + 6.9 parts per thousand and + 8.3 parts per thousand at 4 m, whereas the delta(13)C of CH(4) stayed in the range -58.4 parts per thousand to -70.6 parts per thousand. The (14)C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. (14)C ages for the CO(2) component were younger compared to CH(4), within the shallower depths of the peat bog (<= 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO(2) into the catotelm.

AB To improve understanding and prediction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and fluxes in northern peat-dominated catchments, we present the development and application of a parsimonious tracer-aided rainfall-runoff model coupled with a biogeochemistry subroutine able to concurrently simulate streamflow and DOC dynamics. The modeling approach which included quantitative assessment of associated uncertainties was conditioned by geochemical tracers which discriminate dominant water sources. Integration of DOC was predicated on statistical time series models which identified air temperature and streamflow as the key proxies that capture DOC supply and transport processes in two upland catchments in Scotland, UK. Conceptualizing the nonlinear partitioning of quick near-surface and slower groundwater runoff sources in combination with a DOC mass balance resulted in a coupled, low-parameter mechanistic model. Model tests showed mostly sensitive parameters and reasonable simulation results with seasonally controlled DOC supply and event-based DOC transport. Transport is facilitated even for smaller events by overland flow from saturated histosols connected to the stream network. However, during prolonged dry periods, near-surface runoff switches off and stream DOC is dominated by low concentration groundwaters. Furthermore, the model was able to explain subtle differences in DOC dynamics between the two catchments mainly reflecting the distribution of saturated soils and available storage. We conclude that tracers and statistical time series models can successfully guide the development of parsimonious yet structurally consistent water quality models. Parsimonious models provide tools for estimating DOC dynamics and loads with reduced uncertainty and potentially greater transferability.

AB [1] Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and export were quantified in 56 streams within the Dee Valley, Scotland. Percentage land cover was calculated for each of the watersheds. For a subset of 21 watersheds, organic and mineral soil layers were collected for carbon and nitrogen analysis. Peat cover derived from land cover data was a good predictor of annual DOC export for the selected 21 upland watersheds but not for the set of 56 watersheds. Using DOC values and mean watershed C: N ratio, we produced an empirical predictive model for estimation of annual DOC export for the 21 watersheds as well as a model of weekly fluxes in two of the larger watersheds to meet the needs of watershed managers. Annual exports for the 56 streams in the Dee Valley ranged from 1700 to 10,500 kg km(-2) yr(-1). Land cover was not related to annual DOC export for the 56 streams, but by season, arable land and grassland were both correlated to spring DOC export ( R = - 0.39 arable land and R = - 0.33 grassland p < 0.01). Summertime DOC export was correlated to heather, montane, and conifer land cover ( R = - 0.029 heather, R = - 0.39 montane, and R = 0.33 conifer, p < 0.05). Autumn and winter DOC export was best described by peat ( R = 0.29 and 0.39, respectively, p < 0.05). In the subset of 21 watersheds with soil information, watershed soil organic matter C: N ratio and peat had a higher correlation with annual DOC concentrations and export than any other land cover class. Source of peat distribution data may impact the relationship between DOC and peat cover, and this issue is examined. Modeled weekly DOC load compared well with observed DOC load in a time series evaluation.

AB The dominant inorganic anions and cations, and dissolved organic carbon have been measured in the pore waters expressed from peat cores taken from two Sphagnum bogs in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland:  Etang de la Gruyere (EGr) consists of > 6 m of peat representing more than 12,000 yr of peat formation while at La Tourbiere de Genevez (TGe) approximately 1.5 m of peat have accumulated over the past 5,000 yr.
   The pore-water analyses of the core taken at EGr show that the first 100 cm of the core are influenced only by atmospheric inputs.  The pH of the pore waters is constant (3.9 +/- 0.1) with depth.  Relative to the average composition of rainwater in this area, Na+ is enriched throughout the pore-water profile, K+ is neither enriched nor depleted, Mg2+ is significantly depleted in the deeper pore waters and Ca2+ strongly depleted throughout the profile.  The dominant process affecting the cations in these waters is ion exchange, with the peats behaving like a simple cation exchanger with ion preference decreasing in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > H+ > K+ much-greater-than Na+.
   In contrast, at TGe the pH increases from pH approximately 4 at the surface to pH 5 at 80 cm.  The Cl- and K+ concentrations are up to 10 times higher than rainwater values because of mixing of the bog pore water with nearby groundwaters.  The Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations increase with depth to concentrations up to 10 times higher than rainwater values, mainly because of the increasing importance of mineral dissolution within the profile.

AB Data from 13 catchments with no arable land in Northern Scotland were used to develop empirical linear regression models of average monthly NO3- concentrations and average summer and winter concentrations for NH4+, dissolved organic N ( DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a function of catchment characteristics. All catchments displayed a pronounced seasonal NO3- cycle. Variation in monthly mean NO3- concentration within and between catchments could be predicted from mean monthly air temperature using separate regression equations for temperatures < and >= 5 degrees C. Soil type, climate and land use influenced NH4+ concentrations. In summer, concentrations of NH4+ were largest in catchments with extensive areas of brown forest soils, which are less acidic and more base-rich than other upland soils. However, concentrations declined with increasing conifer cover and summer rainfall. In winter, however, % conifer cover had a positive effect, while higher temperature and higher humus iron podzol cover had negative influences. DON concentration decreased with increasing catchment elevation in both summer and winter. Surprisingly, concentrations of DON only displayed a positive relationship with percentage peat cover in the summer. The most important factor controlling DOC concentration was soil type, with a positive relationship being observed between DOC and peat and humus iron podzol coverage. Elevation was also important, but only in the winter when concentrations were negatively correlated with maximum catchment elevation. Overall, multivariate regression equations explained the spatial and seasonal variability in N species concentrations over a range of catchments within Northern Scotland.

We investigated the microbial decomposition of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in one-stage and two-stage flow-through cultures (chemostats) in the absence and presence of growing phytoplankton as phytoplankton-derived organic matter might facilitate the mineralization of more refractory terrestrial compounds. Peat water and soil leachate were used as terrestrial substrates, and only slight DOC decomposition was observed in the absence of phytoplankton for both substrates. A priming effect was revealed via C-14 data. Priming was more pronounced for the peat water substrate than for the soil leachate. The total DOC concentrations increased for both substrates in the presence of phytoplankton due to exudation and cell lysis. Samples from the soil leachate experiments were analyzed using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Predominantly, the same saturated, aliphatic molecules with H/C ratios > 1.5 were completely decomposed in the absence and in the presence of phytoplankton. The decomposition of more stable molecules differed in their intensity. Oxidized and unsaturated molecules with H/C ratios < 1.0 and O/C ratios > 0.4 were more strongly decomposed in phytoplankton presence (i.e., under priming). We conclude that an aquatic priming effect is not easily detectable via net concentration changes alone, and that qualitative investigations of the DOC processed by bacterial decomposition are necessary to detect aquatic priming.

AB High nitrate concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents and aquifers can challenge sequential biofiltration systems in preventing nitrite and gas formation in the sand bed, as well as to achieve the regulated limit value for nitrate in potable water reuse applications. This study investigates the introduction of electron donors in the form of organic fixed bed materials as an in-situ anoxic zone into sequential biofiltration systems. Laboratory batch and column tests with straw, soft wood, peat, polylactic acid (PLA), and polycaprolacton (PCL) revealed incomplete denitrification with a hydraulic retention time below 10 h, high organic carbon leaching, especially during the first three months, and gas accumulation within the filter bed. Therefore, ex-situ denitrification prior to oxic biofilters or in a defined side-stream treatment is recommended. No enhanced transformation of trace organic chemicals was observed under nitrate reducing conditions. Peat revealed a sorption potential for 5-methyl-benzotriazole, carbamazepine, benzotriazole, and metoprolol.

AB Headwater streams are typically closely connected with the surrounding watershed landscape, making them sensitive to local watershed conditions. Headwater streams of the Kenai Lowlands in Alaska provide important rearing habitat for juvenile salmon and other biota, and understanding the connections between surrounding landscapes and stream conditions will improve management capabilities. We conducted field evaluations of 30 headwater stream sites on the Kenai Lowlands of Alaska, stratified across watersheds and wetland types, and combined these results with GIS analysis of 12 landscape metrics. Flow-weighted slope (FWS), which is an indicator of the combined influence of percentage cover and topographic position of wetlands, was the best predictor of stream chemistry. Our results revealed distinct differences in water chemistry among headwaters that are largely driven by topography and the amount of wetland in the upstream drainage area. Streams with a high FWS (higher gradient, low wetness) had higher dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (mostly nitrate-N), and lower temperatures. Lower FWS streams (low gradient, high wetness) had higher dissolved organic carbon, temperatures, and ammonium and lower dissolved oxygen, all of which were consistent with strong connections between wetlands in watershed and headwater streams. The flow-weighted slope metric is a landscape feature that can be easily derived from GIS, and can be used as a spatially explicit approach for predicting landscape connections to headwater streams on the Kenai Lowlands.

AB This study examined the suitability of organic coagulants for treatment of typically humic peat extraction runoff water by comparing their performance with that of ferric sulphate (FS). The influence of coagulant type on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fractions removed was analysed in detail using LC-OCD-OND (size exclusion liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detection) fractionation techniques. In general, lower coagulant dosage was needed under acidic (pH 4.5) than neutral (pH 6.5) conditions. Chitosan (Chit) and poly (diallyldimethyl) ammonium chloride (pDMAC) required significantly lower dosage (40-55%) than FS for acceptable purification, while a tannin-based coagulant (Tan2) required substantially higher dosage (55-75%) independent of water pH. FS demonstrated the best removal of DOC (<81%) and phosphorus (<93%) followed by pDMAC, while Chit and Tan2 achieved the highest removal of suspended solids (SS) (<58%), with flocs formed by Tan2 presenting the best settling properties. Higher molecular weight (MW) DOC fractions were more efficiently removed by all coagulants, with FS being the most efficient (biopolymers 69% and humic substances 91%), followed by Tan2. FS also displayed satisfactory removal of lower MW fractions (building blocks similar to 46% and low MW neutrals 62%). Overall, FS was the best performing coagulant. Nevertheless, the organic polymers demonstrated satisfactory overall performance, achieving purification rates mostly inside the requirements set by Finnish environmental authorities.

AB Northern peatlands represent a globally important stock of soil carbon and have acted as a net sink of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Holocene. Disturbance for horticultural peat extraction disrupts ecosystem function and converts these ecosystems to large, persistent sources of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the effect of ecosystem-scale restoration on growing season CO2 exchange in a peatland by comparing a restored site to a neighboring nonrestored section for 1 year prerestoration (1999) and 3 years postrestoration (2000-2002). Prior to restoration, less than 23% of the site was vegetated, and it was a source of 245 g C m(-2) to the atmosphere during the growing season (May to early October). Following restoration, the water table remained deep, and soil moisture was significantly higher than the nonrestored section. By the third year postrestoration, vegetation covered 50% of the restored peatland. Moss covered 90% of this vegetated area. Vegetation productivity at the restored site was also enhanced with gross ecosystem photosynthesis under full light conditions significantly higher at the restored site at both moss and herbaceous plots by 2002. While this increase in vegetation productivity provided fresh substrate and resulted in higher CO2 production potential for restored site peat, ecosystem respiration was similar to or lower than that at the nonrestored site for both bare peat and vegetated areas because of the generally wetter site conditions resulting from restoration. By upscaling chamber CO2 exchange measurements to the ecosystem level, on the basis of the relative proportion of each surface cover type, we determined the site was a net sink of similar to 20 +/- 5 g C m(-2) during the growing season only 2 years postrestoration. Combining our results with previous work on CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon export, we suggest that this degraded peatland ecosystem will likely return to a net carbon sink in 6 to 10 years postrestoration.

AB Climate warming is resulting in increases in the frequency and intensity of summer droughts in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region (Ontario, Canada), raising concerns for the fate of C stores. We hypothesized that deeper peat historically existing beneath the water table would produce significant CO2 efflux during summer droughts. To test this hypothesis, we collected saturated peat cores, partitioned them into depth intervals, incubated the peat under conditions that resulted in peat drying, and monitored daily CO2 production together with potential drivers of CO2 production, including peat quality, microbial biomass, and microbial extracellular enzyme activity. Peat CO2 production (mu mol CO2 min(-1) g(-1) dry soil) was highest in the top 30 cm of the peat profile, with the highest production at intermediate volumetric water content (VWC). Peat substrates fuelling CO2 production had quotients of C to N of <20 and were characterized by more labile forms of C. Microbial biomass C (mg C g(-1) dry soil) and most microbial extracellular enzymes (nmol g(-1) h(-1)) were also highest in the top 30 cm of the peat profile. Activities of microbial extracellular enzymes shifted in their contribution to CO2 production as the peat dried, with hydrolases positively related to CO2 under dry conditions (5-35%) and negatively under wet conditions (65 and 85%), with phenol oxidase showing the opposite pattern. Currently, the relatively poor quality (i.e., high C/N) of peat in catotelm limits rapid release of CO2 with water table declines. However, this substantial C store may be vulnerable to decomposition if constraints on quality are alleviated.

AB Northern peatlands contain up to 25% of the world's soil carbon (C) and have an estimated annual exchange of CO2-C with the atmosphere of 0.1-0.5 Pg yr(-1) and of CH4-C of 10-25 Tg yr(-1). Despite this overall importance to the global C cycle, there have been few, if any, complete multiyear annual C balances for these ecosystems. We report a 6-year balance computed from continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), regular instantaneous measurements of methane (CH4) emissions, and export of dissolved organic C (DOC) from a northern ombrotrophic bog. From these observations, we have constructed complete seasonal and annual C balances, examined their seasonal and interannual variability, and compared the mean 6-year contemporary C exchange with the apparent C accumulation for the last 3000 years obtained from C density and age-depth profiles from two peat cores. The 6-year mean NEE-C and CH4-C exchange, and net DOC loss are -40.2 +/- 40.5 (+/- 1 SD), 3.7 +/- 0.5, and 14.9 +/- 3.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), giving a 6-year mean balance of -21.5 +/- 39.0 g m(-2) yr(-1) (where positive exchange is a loss of C from the ecosystem). NEE had the largest magnitude and variability of the components of the C balance, but DOC and CH4 had similar proportional variabilities and their inclusion is essential to resolve the C balance. There are large interseasonal and interannual ranges to the exchanges due to variations in climatic conditions. We estimate from the largest and smallest seasonal exchanges, quasi-maximum limits of the annual C balance between 50 and -105 g m(-2) yr(-1). The net C accumulation rate obtained from the two peatland cores for the interval 400-3000 bp (samples from the anoxic layer only) were 21.9 +/- 2.8 and 14.0 +/- 37.6 g m(-2) yr(-1), which are not significantly different from the 6-year mean contemporary exchange.

AB The Little River (LR) in southern Georgia, U.S., has experienced lengthening droughts since monitoring began in 1972. We evaluated the impacts of drought on riverine carbon cycling using a 9year data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) coupled with laboratory experiments in the LR, as well as long-term data sets in three additional rivers within the Suwannee River basin. Longer drought periods reduced downstream DOC export but also led to higher DOC concentrations in the following hydroperiod. Within a hydroperiod, DOC concentration was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with river discharge but also negatively correlated with total discharge during the previous hydroperiod. Among hydroperiods, DOC concentration was more strongly correlated with antecedent hydrological conditions than with current hydrological conditions across broad spatial scales: in three additional rivers within the Suwannee River basin (Alapaha, Withlacoochee, and Okapilco) and in headwater and downstream reaches of the LR. Microbial DOC consumption and CO2 production were elevated when DOC concentration was high. Despite dramatic hydrologic changes, DOC composition appeared stable, with optical analyses suggesting that LR DOC is primarily composed of three terrestrial humic-like fluorescence groups. If the current climatic trend of intensifying droughts, elevated temperatures and decreased discharge continue, our results suggest the net effect may be for a more localized riverine carbon cycle with reduced downstream transport of DOC, but higher local mineralization rates due to elevated DOC concentrations.

AB We report measurements of pore-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen, total dissolved carbohydrates, dissolved free mono saccharides, and ammonium in recovered deep-sea sediments from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP), Northeast Atlantic. There were distinct maxima close to the sediment-water interface of these constituents at all times of the year. The very high diffusive effluxes calculated from these pore-water distributions were not compatible with simultaneous sediment trap measurements of particulate organic carbon, nitrogen, and carbohydrate fluxes toward the seafloor. Effluxes calculated from pore-water DOC distributions in recovered cores from another Atlantic deep-sea site, showing almost identical maxima as those at PAP, were more than an order of magnitude greater than simultaneous in situ chamber DOC flux measurements. We suggest that the dissolved organic matter maxima are predominantly artifacts induced by lysis of, or leakage from, mainly bacterial biomass resulting from decompression and/or warming during recovery of the sediment cores from the abyssal seafloor. Temperature elevation during core recovery from the abyss gives a N-2 saturation of about 150%, and the combined effect of warming and decompression results in a CO2 saturation of about 135%, which together plausibly are associated with bubble formation creating cell bursting. Previous estimates of microbial biomass in abyssal sediments may be underestimates because of the difficulty of counting lysed bacterial cells. Since exoenzymes are inducible, previous measurements of their activities in recovered abyssal sediments may be overestimates.

AB Although lakes are important sources of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere contributing to global warming, their CH4 and CO2 emissions are rarely assessed. In particular, increasing inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may affect gas dynamics and alter seasonal changes in gas production. Here, we analysed variations in CH4 and CO2 dynamics in sub-basins of an acidic bog lake, which was artificially divided into four quarters three decades ago, leading to divergence in water chemistry and biology. In the divided lake, only the south-west basin (SW) received DOC inputs from an adjacent peat bog, while the north-east basin (NE) was hydrologically disconnected. A year-long determination of CH4 and CO2 production and emission patterns in the two contrasting basins exposed the indirect mechanisms by which DOC supply exercised control on greenhouse gas dynamics in this shallow lake. In both basins, dissolved CH4 was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (O-2) through the water column, suggesting that aerobic methanotrophy is an important regulator of CH4 emissions in this lake. In contrast, the amount of CO2 stored in oxic and anoxic layers was not significantly different between the basins, suggesting that O-2 is not the most important driver of dissolved CO2. Estimated total CH4 and CO2 emissions were 2.1 and 1.7 times lower in the NE basin than in the SW basin, with major CH4 and CO2 emissions occurring during the fall turnover. The differences in CH4 and CO2 emissions suggest that the hydro-physical properties, namely seasonal temperature, the duration of stratification and O-2 availability, are the main drivers of CH4 and CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from small shallow lakes under the influence of DOC inputs under global warming pressure.

AB Coastal freshwater and brackish wetlands are exposed to pulses of saltwater during times of reduced freshwater flows (i.e., dry seasons, droughts), periodic storm surges, and increased tidal extent associated with rising seas. The effects of saltwater pulses on belowground processing rates of detrital organic matter as mediated by microbial activities are uncertain. Our objectives were to quantify whether and how pulses of saltwater (i) change soil porewater physicochemistry, (ii) change soil microbial extracellular enzyme activities, and (iii) change root litter breakdown over time in freshwater and brackish marshes. From 2014 to 2016, we simulated saltwater intrusion as monthly in situ pulsed additions of artificial seawater in experimental dosing chambers (1.4 m diameter) within freshwater and brackish marshes of Everglades National Park. At monthly intervals, we collected soil porewater chemistry, and measured microbial extracellular enzymes, elemental stoichiometric ratios, and breakdown rates (k) of incubated (0-30 cm depth) root litter and compared these responses over time. Saltwater pulses increased sulfate and nitrogen concentrations in porewater at the freshwater site. However, saltwater pulses generally decreased porewater constituents (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus species) at the brackish site. One saltwater pulse increased root litter k by 1.25-fold in the brackish marsh. However, long-term (740 days) k in brackish wetlands, and both short- and long-term k in freshwater wetlands, were not affected by 24 monthly pulses of saltwater. Enzyme activities fluctuated with time and did not respond to multiple saltwater pulses. Our results suggest that detrital organic matter stocks and associated soil microbial activities are relatively resistant to single and multiple (n = 24) pulses of saltwater.

AB Litter materials from forested watersheds can be a significant source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to surface waters that can contribute to the formation of carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) during drinking-water chlorination. This study characterized the reactivity of DOM from litter leachates of representative vegetation in oak woodlands, a major plant community in the Foothill Region of California. Leachates from fresh and decomposed litter (duff) from two oak species, pine, and annual grasses were collected for an entire rainy season to evaluate their reactivity to form DBPs on chlorination. Relationships among specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence index (FI), specific differential ultraviolet absorbance (S Delta UVA), specific chlorine demand (SCD), and the dissolved organic carbon: dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC:DON) ratio to the specific DBP formation potential (SDBP-FP) were examined. The DOM derived from litter materials had considerable reactivity in forming trihalomethanes (THMs) (1.80-3.49 mmol mol(-1)), haloacetic acid (HAAs) (1.62-2.76 mmol mol(-1)), haloacetonitriles (HANs) (0.12-0.37 mmol mol(-1)), and chloral hydrate (CHD) (0.16-0.28 mmol mol(-1)). These values are comparable to other identified watershed sources of DBP precursors reported for the California Delta, such as wetlands and organic soils. Vegetation type and litter decomposition stage (fresh litter versus 1-5 yr-old duff) were key factors that determined characteristics of DOM and their reactivity to form DBPs. Pine litter had significantly lower specific THM formation potential compared with oak and grass, and decomposed duff had a greater DON content, which is a precursor of HANs and other nitrogenous DBPs. The SUVA and SDBP-FP were temporally variable and dependent on vegetation type, degree of decomposition, and environmental conditions. Among the optical properties of DOM, S Delta UVA was the only parameter that was consistently correlated with SDBP-FP.

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; PEAT; SULFUR; IRON
AB The reduction in wetland water table height that could be anticipated from current climate change models was simulated within the laboratory using cores of peat-soil from a riparian wetland. The manipulation increased the rate of release of many solutes including nitrate (1250%), sulphate (116%), dissolved organic carbon (37%), sodium (66%), chloride (65%), iron (168%) and magnesium (16%). Calcium was the only solute to show a lower rate of release following the simulation (-26%). These changes have major implications for the use of constructed wetlands in ameliorating water quality. The study suggests that without suitable design safeguards, wetlands may only represent a temporary solution to water quality problems. In the future, climatic change could reverse their beneficial effects.

AB Filters with a pore size of 0.45 mu m have been arbitrarily used for isolating dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in natural waters. This operationally defined DOC fraction often contains heterogeneous organic carbon compounds that may lead to inconsistent results when evaluating trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). A finer pore size filter provides more homogeneous DOC properties and enables a better characterization of organic matter. In this study, we examined the effects of filter pore size (1.2, 0.45, 0.1 and 0.025 mu m) on characterizing total organic carbon, ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and THMFP of water extracts from a mineral and organic soil in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. Results showed that the majority of water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) from these soils was smaller than 0.025 pm, 85% and 57% in organic and mineral soils, respectively. A high proportion of colloidal organic carbon (COC) in mineral soil extracts caused water turbidity and resulted in an abnormally high UV254 in 1.2 and 0.45 mu m filtrates. The reactivity of organic carbon fractions in forming THM was similar for the two soils, except that COC from the mineral soil was about half that of others. To obtain a more homogeneous solution for characterizing THM precursors, we recommend a 0.1 mu m or smaller pore-size filter, especially for samples with high colloid concentrations.

AB Altitudinal gradients are useful to study the potential effects of climate change on ecosystems. Historically, studies on elevation gradients have primarily focused on macro-organisms and ecosystem processes, while microorganisms have been mostly ignored despite their ubiquity and functional importance. We studied the temporal (about every two months from June 2008 until May 2009) variation of testate amoeba communities in four Sphagnum-dominated peatlands along a 1300 to elevation gradient in the Swiss Mountains (580-1880 m) in relation to water table depth and hydrochemistry with special focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a useful proxy for changes in C-cycling in peatlands.
   The lowest site had significantly (P < 0.01) lowest testate amoeba density, species richness. The highest site had highest testate amoeba density (38 ind mg(-1) dry mass of Sphagnum). Seasonal fluctuations in testate amoeba species richness and diversity were not consistent among sites but density tended to peak in spring at all sites, autumn in the three highest sites and mid-winter in the upper two sites. In a redundancy analysis (RDA) community structure was more strongly correlated to altitude (33.8% of variance explained in living community) than to soil hydrological and hydro-chemical variables (together explaining 16.2% of variance). In a partial RDA with altitude used as covariable, the four sites were separated by DOP, DOC, DON, pH and average depth to water table.
   The abundance of high trophic level testate amoeba species (shell-aperture over their body size >0.20; i.e. primarily predators of protists and micro-metazoa) as well as the community size structure increased from lowest to highest elevation (respectively by 3.7x and 6x) and followed the seasonal patterns of total density, while DOC, DON, and DOC/DON decreased with elevation.
   These results agree with previously reported alteration of peatland microbial food chains in response to experimental warming, suggesting that climate-induced changes in microbial community structure (here a shortening of microbial food chains) represent a mechanism controlling the carbon balance of peatlands.

AB Forest clear-cutting followed by soil preparation means disturbance for soil microorganisms and disruption of N and C cycles. We measured fluxes of N2O and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in upland soil (podzol) and adjacent peat within a clear-cut forest catchment. Both soil types behaved in a similar way, showing net uptake of N2O in the first year after the clear-cutting, and turning to net release in the second. The N2O flux dynamics were similar to those of N content in logging residues, as reported from a nearby site. As organic matter is used in the food web of the decomposers, we attempted to explain the dynamics of N2O uptake and release by measuring the concurrent dynamics of the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction and the aromaticity of DOC in a soil solution. The labile and most readily available LMW fractions of DOC were nearly absent in the year following the clear-cutting, but rose after two years. The more refractory high molecular weight (HMW) fraction of DOC decreased two years after the clear-cutting. The first year's net uptake of N2O could be accounted for by the growth of decomposer biomass in the logging residues and detritus from the degenerating ground vegetation, resulting in immobilization of nitrogen. Simultaneously, the labile, LMW fraction of DOC became almost completely exhausted. The low availability of the LMW fraction could retard the growth and cause the accumulated decomposer biomass to collapse. During the following winter and summer the fraction of LMW clearly increased, followed by increased N2O emissions. The presence of LMW DOC fractions, not the concentration of DOC, seems to be an important controller for N2O liberation after a major disturbance such as clear-cutting and site preparation. The complex connection between DOC characteristics, nitrification or denitrification merits further studies.

AB The application of biochar for plant growth and yield is of great importance. A combination of biochar and potent plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) may contribute extensively to crop production. The present investigation revealed the role of phosphate solubilizing bacteria and different biochars produced from tea leaves (Camellia sinensis L.). Biochar was prepared at 350 degrees C (B1) and 600 degrees C (B2) temperatures by using the pyrolysis tank. Seven bacterial strains were isolated from various types of soil collected from Mansehra, Pakistan. On the basis of phosphate solubilization and indole acetic acid production, one strain (Bacillus cereus) was applied with biochar. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate biochar as carriers for inoculant on mung bean (Vigna mungo) plant by comparing it with peat moss. Plastic pots of 15 x 18 cm(2) were filled with 1:3 of sand and autoclaved garden soil. Results revealed that biochar produced at a higher temperature (B2) showed greater shelf life as compared to peat. Among bacterial inoculation of Bacillus cereus with biochar at 600 degrees C improved soil properties i.e., soil organic carbon (14%), dissolved organic carbon (17%), total nitrogen (39%), Olsen phosphorus (36%) with enhanced microbial biomass (C-mic (17%), N-mic (36%), and P-mic (56%)), enzyme activity (urease (12%), dehydrogenase (40%), and phosphatase (49%)), crop growth and N-2-fixation (54%) over control (peat). Additionally, high-temperature biochar inoculated with Bacillus cereus (B2 + BC) significantly (P <= .05) enhanced the Proteobacteria (11%), Firmicutes (46%), Actinobacteria (20%), and Cyanobacteria (33%) community as compared to peat alone. It is concluded that biochar formulated at high temperature and its co-inoculation with bacteria (Bacillus cereus) may enhance soil fertility, growth, and yield of mung bean.

AB Surface fires occur naturally or anthropogenically and can raise the temperature at the soil surface up to 600 degrees C. The heat derived from the surface fire can be subsequently transferred into CO2-enriched subsoils. As a result, the chemical compositions of soil organic matter (SOM) may be altered in fire-impacted anaerobic environments, indirectly influencing the redox transformations of pollutants, such as Cr(VI). In this study, a peat soil was heated up to 600 degrees C with limited air flow to simulate the effects of heat on the SOM during surface fire events. Then, Cr (VI) removal, including reduction and sorption, by the heat-treated peat soils was determined in relation to changes in the soil organic components. The results showed that the amount of O-containing functional groups, -CH2/-CH(3 )units of aliphatic groups, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the SOM gradually decreased with an increase in the heating temperature. The removal of 0.1932 mM Cr(VI) did not exhibit a consistent decline along with the changes in these soil components. The heating temperatures of 200 and 250 degrees C were the thresholds that led to the decomposition of temperature-sensitive soil organic components such as lignin and other labile SOM. Such newly released organic fragments synergized lignin-like substances and carboxyl groups, resulting in up to 99% removal of the initially added Cr(VI). As the heating temperatures were increased from 300 to 600 degrees C, Cr(VI) reduction decreased from 66% to 20%. The black carbon-like materials and/or aromatic-containing moieties were the major components responsible for Cr(VI) reduction in 600 degrees C-treated peat soils.

ID NORTHERN MINNESOTA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON; GROUNDWATER; ECOSYSTEM;
   WATER; PEATLANDS; NITROGEN; LAKES; ACIDIFICATION
AB Most Precambrian Shield forested catchments have some wetland component. Even small riparian wetlands are important modifiers of stream chemistry. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most important products exported by wetlands in streams. Stratigraphic control of hydraulic conductivity generally leads to decreasing conductivity with depth. Thus important flowpaths occur in the uppermost organic rich layers and are reflected in chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Accumulation of DOC in peat porewaters is the net effect of production, consumption and transport. DOC profiles vary with degree of interaction with the surrounding upland catchment and distance from the edge of the wetland as well as internal processes within the wetland. In wetlands, DOM production is offset by flushing resulting in decreasing DOC concentrations with increasing flows. Despite old carbon (2,000 to 3,000 years) at relatively shallow depths, (14)C activity in DOC exported from wetlands is mostly modem (recent carbon), consistent with shallow flowpaths and export of DOM from shallow organic rich horizons. In contrast, the source area for DOM in upland catchments with developed B horizon soils increases with antecedent soil moisture conditions resulting in increasing DOC concentrations with higher stream flows. Activity of 14C in stream DOC from upland catchments span a range from low activities (older carbon) similar to B horizon soil water during dry moisture conditions to values slightly less than modern (more recent carbon) during high moisture conditions. The more modern carbon activities reflect the increased contribution of the organic rich litter and A horizon soil layers in the area immediately bordering the stream under wet antecedent moisture conditions. Reduced hydrologic export or loss of wetlands under drier climatic conditions may result in in larger fluctuations in stream DOC concentrations and reduced DOM loads to lakes.

AB Groundwater organic matter is processed within aquifers through transformations such as the adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to minerals and biodegradation. The molecular character of DOM varies according to its source and this can impact its bioavailability and reactivity. Whilst the character of DOM in riverine and oceanic environments is increasingly well understood, the sources, character and ultimately the fate of groundwater DOM remains unclear. Here we examine groundwater DOM from contrasting hydrogeological settings in New South Wales, Australia. For the first time, we identify the distinct molecular composition of three groundwater DOM end-members including a modern terrestrial input, an aged sedimentary peat source, and an aged stable by-product pool. We also identify and characterise the processing pathway of DOM in semi-arid, low sedimentary organic carbon (OC) environments. Based on size exclusion chromatography, ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), isotopic analyses (C-13, C-14 and H-3) and principle component analysis (PCA), we show that in higher rainfall temperate coastal peatland environments, large amounts of aged sedimentary organic carbon can leach into groundwater resulting in higher molecular weight (500 g mol(-1) < molecular weight > 1000 g mol(-1)) and highly aromatic groundwater DOM with high O/C ratios and low H/C ratios. We show that in semi-arid environments with low rainfall rates and high groundwater residence times, groundwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is processed into increasingly low molecular weight (<350 g mol(-1)), low aromaticity DOM with low O/C ratios and high H/C ratios by subsurface processing mechanisms such as biodegradation and adsorption. We provide the first comprehensive study of groundwater DOM characterisation based on multiple analytical techniques, and highlight the impact of source inputs and processing on groundwater DOM composition at a molecular level.

AB The aim of this study was to identify the differences in the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil dependent on both land use and soil depth. Soil solutions of six differently used sites in a German fen area were sampled using ceramic suction cups at three depths (25, 55 and 95 cm) and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over a 2 1/2-year period. Studies on DOM composition included UV and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as a fractionation in hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. The DOC concentration was affected by land use in topsoil only. Degraded peatlands had a high intensity of land use and therefore a low soil carbon content and low DOC concentrations. The DOC concentrations decreased significantly with increasing soil depth. The DOM retention through adsorption or decomposition was much higher at intact peatlands than at degraded peatlands. The degraded peatlands soil DOM had a higher specific absorption at 285 nm and a higher humification index derived from fluorescence spectra than DOM of intact peatlands (low intensity of land use) down to the subsoil. The higher DOM humification was related to strong peat decay. The DOM of degraded peatlands preserved its higher degree of aromaticity and polycondensation down to the subsoil, although highly condensed and substituted aromatic compounds were retained preferentially with increasing soil depth. Therefore, effects of land use on the soil DOM composition are stronger than the effects dependent on increasing soil depth. The DOM fractionation in hydrophobic and hydrophilic components was not sensitive enough to detect the small differences in DOM composition caused by land use and depth.

AB [1] We measured CO2 and CH4 exchange from the center of a Sphagnum-dominated permafrost collapse, through an aquatic moat, and into a recently burned black spruce forest on the Tanana River floodplain in interior Alaska. In the anomalously dry growing season of 2004, both the collapse and the surrounding burned area were net sinks for CO2, with a mean daytime net ecosystem exchange of - 1.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), while the moat was a CH4 source with a mean flux of 0.013 mu mol CH4 m(-2) s(-1). Regression analyses identified temperature as the dominant factor affecting intragrowing season variation in CO2 exchange and soil moisture as the primary control influencing CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions during the wettest portion of the growing season were four times higher than during the driest periods. If temperatures continue to warm, peatland vegetation will likely expand with permafrost degradation, resulting in greater carbon accumulation and methane emissions for the landscape as a whole.

AB Many peatlands have been subjected to wildfire or prescribed burning, but it is not known how these fires influence near-surface hydrological processes. Macropores are important flowpaths in the upper layers of blanket peat and were investigated through the use of tension disc infiltrometers, which also provide data on saturated hydraulic conductivity. Measurements were performed on unburnt peat (U), where prescribed burning had taken place 2years (B2), 4years (B4) and >15 (B15+) years prior to sampling, and where a wildfire (W) had taken place 4months prior to sampling. Where there had been recent burning (B2, B4 and W), saturated hydraulic conductivity was approximately three times lower than where there was no burning (U) or where burning was last conducted >15years ago (B15+). Similarly, the contribution of macropore flow to overall infiltration was significantly lower (between 12% and 25% less) in the recently burnt treatments compared to B15+ and U. There were no significant differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity or macropore flow between peat that had been subject to recent wildfire (W) and those that had undergone recent prescribed burning (B2 and B4). The results suggest that fire influences the near-surface hydrological functioning of peatlands but that recovery in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macropore flow may be possible within two decades if there are no further fires.

AB Stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations display high spatial and temporal variation in boreal catchments. Understanding and predicting these patterns is a challenge with great implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates. Although several biogeochemical models have been used to estimate stream water DOC dynamics, model biases common during both rain and snowmelt-driven events. The parsimonious DOC-model, K-DOC, with 10 calibrated parameters, uses a nonlinear discharge and catchment water storage relationship including soil temperature dependencies of DOC release and consumption. K-DOC was used to estimate the stream water DOC concentrations over 5 years for eighteen nested boreal catchments having total area of 68 km(2) (varying from 0.04 to 67.9 km(2)). The model successfully simulated DOC concentrations during base flow conditions, as well as, hydrological events in catchments dominated by organic and mineral soils reaching NSEs from 0.46 to 0.76. Our semimechanistic model was parsimonious enough to have all parameters estimated using statistical methods. We did not find any clear differences between forest and mire-dominated catchments that could be explained by soil type or tree species composition. However, parameters controlling slow release and consumption of DOC from soil water behaved differently for small head-water catchments (less than 2 km(2)) than for those that integrate larger areas of different ecosystem types (1068 km(2)). Our results emphasize that it is important to account for nonlinear dependencies of both, soil temperature, and catchment water storage, when simulating DOC dynamics of boreal catchments.

AB At the ecosystem scale, peatlands can be extremely resilient to perturbations. Yet, they are very sensitive to local disturbances, especially mechanical perturbations (e.g. trampling). The effects of these disturbances on vegetation, and potential effects on hydrochemical conditions along the peat surface, however, are largely unknown.
   We used three research tracks (paths researchers use to access their study sites) differing in time of abandonment to investigate the impact of local disturbance (trampling) on the vegetation and its short-term (<= 2 year) recovery in a flagship research blanket peatland. Additionally, we examined the effects of local disturbance on fluvial runoff events and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in runoff water.
   Local disturbance heavily impacted peat vegetation, resulting in large areas of scarred and churned peat. Recovery of vascular plants along abandoned tracks was slow, but a functional Sphagnum layer re-established after just one year.
   The absence of vegetation elicited an increase in the number of runoff events along the tracks, by which POC runoff from the tracks increased. POC concentrations were highest in the surface water from the recently abandoned track, while they were low in the runoff water from the track abandoned longest and the undisturbed control track. We attribute this to the relatively fast recovery of the Sphagnum vegetation. DOC concentrations did not differ significantly either spatially or temporally in surface runoff or soil solution waters. While at an ecosystem scale local disturbances may be negligible in terms of carbon loss, our data points to the need for further research on the potential long-term effects of local disturbance on the vegetation, and significant effects on local scale carbon fluxes. Moreover, the effects of disturbances could be long-lasting and their role on ecosystem processes should not be underestimated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The mobilization of mercury and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during snowmelt often accounts for a major fraction of the annual loads. We studied the role of hydrological connectivity of riparian wetlands and upland/wetland transition zones to surface waters on the mobilization of Hg and DOC in Fishing Brook, a headwater of the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Stream water total mercury (THg) concentrations varied strongly (mean = 2.25 +/- 0.5 ng L (1)), and the two snowmelt seasons contributed 40% (2007) and 48% (2008) of the annual load. Methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations ranged up to 0.26 ng L (1), and showed an inverse log relationship with discharge. TOPMODEL-simulated saturated area corresponded well with wetland areas, and the application of a flow algorithm based elevation-above-creek approach suggests that most wetlands become well connected during high flow. The dynamics of simulated saturated area and soil storage deficit were able to explain a large part of the variation of THg concentrations (r(2) = 0.53 to 0.72). In contrast, the simulations were not able to explain DOC variations and DOC and THg concentrations were not correlated. These results indicate that all three constituents, THg, MeHg, and DOC, follow different patterns at the outlet: (1) the mobilization of THg is primarily controlled by the saturation state of the catchment, (2) the dilution of MeHg suggests flushing from a supply limited pool, and (3) DOC dynamics follow a pattern different from THg dynamics, which likely results from differing gain and/or loss processes for THg and/or DOC within the Fishing Brook catchment.

There was a decline in DOC production during the incubation, with initial rates averaging 0.03-0.06 mg DOC g(-1) soil C day(-1), falling to averages of 0.01 mg g(-1) soil C day(-1); the rate of decline was not strongly related to temperature. Cumulative DOC production rates over the 395 days ranged from less than 0.01 to 0.12 mg g(-1) soil C day(-1) (0.5-47.6 mg g(-1) soil C), with an average of 0.021 mg g(-1) soil C day(-1) (8.2 mg g(-1) soil C). DOC production rate was weakly related to temperature, equivalent to Q(10) values of 0.9 to 1.2 for mineral samples and 1.2 to 1.9 for organic samples. Rates of DOC production in the organic samples were correlated with cellulose (positively) and lignin (negatively) proportion in the organic matter, whereas in the mineral samples C and nitrogen (N) provided positive correlations. The partitioning of C released into CO(2)-C and DOC showed a quotient (CO(2)-C:DOC) that varied widely among the samples, from 1 to 146. The regression coefficient of CO(2)-C:DOC production (log(10) transformed) ranged from 0.3 to 0.7, all significantly less than 1. At high rates of DOC production, a smaller proportion of CO(2) is produced. The CO(2)-C:DOC quotient was dependent on incubation temperature: in the organic soil samples, the CO(2)-C:DOC quotient rose from an average of 6 at 3 to 16 at 22 degrees C and in the mineral samples the rise was from 7 to 27. The CO(2)-C:DOC quotient was related to soil pH in the organic samples and C and N forms in the mineral samples.

AB Phenol oxidase is associated with the carbon cycle and its presence in soil environments is important to the formation of humic substances. Little effort has been made to integrate the response of phenol oxidases with soil management. We investigated phenol oxidase activity on a Maury silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Paleudalfs) soil after 33 years of imposed tillage and N fertilization treatments. Particle size fractions were investigated independently to help identify the location of the enzyme. Phenol oxidase activity was 1.7 times greater (P < 0.01) in no-tillage (NT) compared with moldboard plow (MP) in the control treatment (0 kg N ha(-1)), consistent with the known effects of tillage. The phenol oxidase was located primarily in the silt fraction, followed by the clay and sand in the NT. In NT, N fertilization (336 kg N ha(-1)) had a marked negative effect on soil phenol oxidase activity, showing a 38% decrease (P < 0.01) despite the increase in soil organic carbon (SOC). In contrast, MP plots were relatively insensitive to applied N rate. Phenol oxidase activity was related negatively to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (r = -0.49, P < 0.1), SOC (r = -0.49, P < 0.1) and dissolved organic carbon (r = -0.51, P < 0.1) in NT. This research provides new information about the response of phenol oxidase enzymes to long-term N fertilization in NT and MP systems. These findings suggest that manipulating the application rates of fertilizer N in soils under NT will make it possible to impact phenol oxidase activity.

AB We used a mechanistic physical model to examine the effect of variability in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations on the physical properties of small temperate lakes. The model was validated on eight small (6 X 10(-4) to 3.8 X 10(-2) km(2)) lakes in Wisconsin and Michigan, with a standard error < 1 degrees C for seven of eight lakes. Attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) in these lakes was regulated by DOC concentrations and was important in the vertical structuring of water temperatures. Heat exchange below the surface mixed layer was near the molecular rate, increasing the importance of water clarity as a control on the heat content of deeper waters. To understand the thermal effects of changing DOC concentrations, we applied scenarios of a 50% increase and 50% decrease in DOC concentrations for one lake (Trout Bog) and found water temperatures to vary in response, with the seasonally averaged temperatures in the increased DOC scenario being > 2 degrees C colder than the reduced scenario. We found a nonlinear relationship between DOC and temperature, with clearer (lower DOC) simulations being more sensitive to climate variability, suggesting that DOC may act as a buffer against a warming climate. Our model showed that DOC also influenced epilimnetic depths, as nocturnal mixing (related to the vertical partitioning of heat) was more important than wind-driven mixing. Small lakes are globally important regulators of biogeochemical cycles and are structurally different from larger lakes. Important feedbacks to physical processes must be accounted for when understanding the effects of changing DOC and climate on small lakes.

AB During the last decades, various renaturation programmes have been initialized to recover nutrient sink and ecological functions of peatlands by rewetting. Rewetting, however, often results in the formation of hotspots for methane (CH4) emissions and in temporal dieback of local vegetation. The present study aimed at quantifying changes of CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a peatland currently under continuous rewetting conditions. Emissions where studied at a permanently flooded site and a non-flooded peat site with fluctuating water tables by using common closed chamber method. The permanently flooded site revealed extremely high CH4 emissions (up to 1195 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) which were positively correlated with temperature, nutrient content, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentration of the peat soil water. In contrast, the non-flooded peat site, with lower and fluctuating water tables (WT), showed significantly lower CH4 emissions and an increasing trend of CH4 release associated with a generally increasing WT caused by the progressing rewetting process. Lower N2O emissions (< 24 A mu g N m(-2) d(-1)) were observed at the flooded site. By contrast, the non-flooded peat site with fluctuating WT showed significantly higher N2O emissions (up to 4178 A mu g N m(-2) d(-1)), in particular at high temperatures during summer time. The present results indicate that permanently flooded conditions during rewetting processes might cause higher CH4 emissions compared to fluctuating WT which in contrast might enhance N2O emissions. In total, however, no decreasing trend for CH4 emissions throughout the five-year renaturation period could be found. At least for N2O we observed a decreasing trend during rewetting.

AB Peatlands are found around the world and cover similar to 3.4% of the Earth's surface. In the UK, peatlands cover 17.2% or similar to 1.58 Mha of the land surface and occur mainly in upland areas covering the headwaters of most major British rivers. However, large areas are now subject to prescribed vegetation burning despite policy guidance that recommends a strong presumption against burning on deep blanket peat. Wildfires occur sporadically but are forecast to increase in frequency in the future. This paper provides a synthesis of current knowledge about how UK peatland-dominated river catchments respond to fires caused by prescribed vegetation burning and uncontrolled wildfire. We provide insight into the effects of fire on the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biota of peatland river ecosystems, and the peatland-soil-driven controls on these effects at the catchment scale. Burning increases the depth to water table and water-table variability, although some small-scale studies indicate shallower water table in some places. More work is needed on fire effects on peatland river flow, but recent results suggest a complex response with smaller flow peaks for burned systems associated with most rainfall events, but enhanced peaks compared to unburned systems for the top quintile of rainfall events with the largest total rain. Evidence from biogeochemical studies suggests that fire leads to increased dissolved organic C concentrations in rivers. River biota responses primarily include significant reductions in the density of grazing mayflies but increases among detritivores including Chironomidae and Baetis mayflies. We provide a conceptual synthesis that links the main responses of terrestrial and aquatic systems to fire, and we summarize some major research gaps that should be prioritized to inform future policy around peatland management.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, serving as both the largest terrestrial soil carbon pool and a significant source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). In Sphagnum moss-dominated wetlands, anaerobic decomposition, and in particular the production of CH4, is highly variable and controlling factors are poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to determine if leachates of Sphagnum can explain differences in anaerobic decomposition and CH4 production from three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.
   Soils from each peatland were incubated anaerobically for 40 days with Sphagnum-derived organic matter (S-DOM) extracted using distilled water at 25 or 60 degrees C in a fully-crossed experimental design. S-DOM extracted at 25 degrees C had a minimal effect on decomposition, but S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C increased CO2 production in all soils. The magnitude of the increased CO2 production in response to S-DOM depended on the source site of the S-DOM. The response of CH4 production to additions of S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C was more complex. Soils from one peatland produced no CH4 during the incubation, regardless of S-DOM source. The same S-DOM additions led to an increase in CH4 production in a second soil, but a decrease in CH4 production in the third soil. Stable isotopic evidence suggests that these patterns were driven by the selective inhibition or stimulation of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest S-DOM alone does not explain differences in anaerobic decomposition in peatlands, but may play a role in regulating CO2 and CH4 production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding how P enrichment alters the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important, because of their role in regulating the C cycle. Here, we established a four-level P addition experiment (0, 1.2,4.8, and 9.6 g Pm-2 year(-1)) in a N-limited freshwater wetland in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of eight years of P addition on DOC concentration, SUVA(254) (Abs(254)/DOC concentration, indicating the aromaticity of DOC), C:C ratio (Abs(400)/DOC concentration, indicating the proportion of colored humic substances in DOC), and E4:E6 ratio (Abs(465)/Abs(665), indicating the molecular size of humic substances) in surface water and soil pore water (0-15 cm depth) during the growing season (June through September). Our results showed similar changing trends in concentration and optical properties of DOC following eight years of P addition in the both surface water and soil pore water across the sampling dates. Generally, P addition decreased DOC concentration, SUVA254, and C:C ratio, and increased E4:E6 ratio, irrespective of P addition levels. These altered optical properties of DOC indicated that P addition decreased the molecular weight and aromaticity of DOC, and thus increased the quality of DOC. These results suggest P enrichment substantially reduces the quantity of DOC in N-limited temperate freshwater wetlands, and imply that increased DOC quality following P addition can further provide a positive feedback to decreased DOC pool.

AB In this paper, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to determine the metal concentration in different size fractions of a bog lake water. Two methods were applied: (a) preparative SEC with off-line metal concentration analysis and (b) direct coupling of an analytical SEC system on-line with an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). In the preparative SEC measurements, maximum concentrations were found for different metal ions in different size fractions of the natural organic matter (NOM). Normalization of metal concentrations to dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) yielded two maxima in the high and in the very low molecular-weight fractions. Whereas good recoveries were found for AI, Fe, and Ni, only 40 % were obtained for Pb. This indicates that Pb formed labile complexes with NOM, and hence could strongly interact with the column material. In the experiments with the analytical SEC-ICP-MS system, the same trends were observed, but with even lower recoveries than in the preparative system.
   Sample preconcentration and storage were also investigated with respect to decrease in metal concentration. During the ultrafiltration preconcentration step AI and Fe were removed only to a small extent, whereas about half of the initial Pb was lost. This indicates that AI and Fe were mainly bound to high molecular-weight fractions of NOM. In contrast to that, AI and in particular Fe were removed from solution more than proportionally with respect to DOC because of aggregation of the NOM during storage, whereas Pb and Ni were concentrated relative to the DOC.

AB Geomorphic disturbances to surrounding terrain induced by thermal degradation of permafrost often lead to surface ponding or soil saturation. However, interactions between soil moisture and temperature on belowground carbon processes are not fully understood. We conducted batch incubation for three temperature treatments [constant freezing (CF), constant thawing (CT), and fluctuating temperatures (FTC)] and two soil moisture conditions (ponded and unsaturated). Extracellular enzyme activity was higher under ponded conditions than under unsaturated conditions, resulting in higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels for ponded conditions. More CO2 and less CH4 were emitted under unsaturated conditions than under ponded conditions. Carbon dioxide emission was similar for CT and FTC treatments regardless of moisture conditions. However, CH4 emission was higher under ponded conditions than under unsaturated conditions for CT treatments, but was very low for FTC treatments regardless of moisture conditions. Little CO2 and CH4 were produced in CF treatments. Despite similar CO2 and CH4 emission levels for CT and FTC treatments, lower DOC levels were observed in the latter, indicating slower soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition. Similar DOC variation patterns between CT and CF treatments indicated that SOC decomposition was considerable and further degradation to CO2 or CH4 was negligible even for CF treatments. The SOC decomposition and CO2 and CH4 emissions were considerable for FTC treatments. Our results suggest that labile-C produced during SOC decomposition in seasonally frozen soils and permafrost may provide supplemental substrates that would enhance the positive feedback to climate change with rising temperatures and wetter conditions.

AB A series of papers have suggested that freshwater discharge, including a large amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM), has increased since the middle of the 20th century. In this study, a semi-analytical algorithm for estimating light absorption coefficients of the colored fraction of DOM (CDOM) was developed for southern Beaufort Sea waters using remote sensing reflectance at six wavelengths in the visible spectral domain corresponding to MODIS ocean color sensor. This algorithm allows the separation of colored detrital matter (CDM) into CDOM and non-algal particles (NAP) through the determination of NAP absorption using an empirical relationship between NAP absorption and particle backscattering coefficients. Evaluation using independent datasets, which were not used for developing the algorithm, showed that CDOM absorption can be estimated accurately to within an uncertainty of 35% and 50% for oceanic and coastal waters, respectively. A previous paper (Matsuoka et al., 2012) showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were tightly correlated with CDOM absorption in our study area (r(2) = 0.97). By combining the CDOM absorption algorithm together with the DOC versus CDOM relationship, it is now possible to estimate DOC concentrations in the near-surface layer of the southern Beaufort Sea using satellite ocean color data. DOC concentrations in the sur-face waters were estimated using MODIS ocean color data, and the estimates showed reasonable values compared to in situ measurements. We propose a routine and near real-time method for deriving DOC concentrations from space, which may open the way to an estimate of DOC budgets for Arctic coastal waters.

AB Downstream mineralization and sedimentation of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) render lakes important for landscape carbon cycling in the boreal region. The chemical composition of terrestrial DOC, the downstream delivery of terrestrial DOC and its processing within aquatic ecosystem may all be influenced by climate change, including increased occurrence of wildfire. Here, we assessed composition and lability (during both dark-and UV incubations) of DOC from peatland groundwater and mineral soil groundwater, and from shallow lakes within a peatland-rich region on the Boreal Plains of western Canada that was recently affected by wildfire. Wildfire was found to increase aromaticity of DOC in peat pore water above the water table, but had no effect on the concentrations or composition of peatland groundwater DOC or mineral soil DOC. Using a mixing model we estimated that on average 98 and 78% of terrestrial DOC inputs to the lakes in fine-and coarse-textured settings, respectively, originated from peatland groundwater sources. Accordingly, lake DOC composition reflected primarily a mixing of peatland and mineral soil groundwater sources, with no detectable influence of the recent wildfire. Lake and peatland DOC had low biodegradability, lower than that of mineral soil DOC. However, both mineralization and sedimentation of peatland DOC increased substantially during UV incubations through selective removal of aromatic humic and fulvic acids. Similar shifts in DOC composition as observed during the UV incubations were also observed across lakes with longer water residence times. The mixing model estimated that on average 54% (95% confidence interval: 36-64%) of terrestrial DOC had been removed in lakes as a result of mineralization and sedimentation. Meanwhile, the reduction in absorbance at 254 nm was 71% (58-76%), which suggests selective removal of aromatic DOC. Hence, incubation results, patterns of DOC composition among lakes and mixing model results were consistent with significant within-lake removal of terrestrial DOC through UV-mediated processes. Selective removal of highly aromatic DOC through UV-mediated processes implies that organic sources that are considered stabile in terrestrial ecosystems can be readily mineralized once entering aquatic ecosystems. Together, our results suggest that regional characteristics (climate, surface geology and lake morphometry) can prevent wildfire from causing pulse perturbations to the linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling and also regulate the processes that dominate within-lake removal of terrestrial DOC.

AB Rotational burning of heather to improve grazing and grouse breeding is a common management practice for upland catchments in the UK. However, the effects of such practices on hydrology and water quality are not well understood because the timescale of burning rotation is typically between 7 and 20 years thus requiring long-term experiments in order to resolve the effects. Furthermore, land management, such as changes in burning or grazing practices, has been proposed as a possible strategy for the remediation of the widespread increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) observed across the northern hemisphere. This study is based on a long-term experiment on the effect of different rotational burning cycles and grazing intensities on upland vegetation and aims to understand the effects of these management strategies on hydrology and water quality. The main outcomes are:
   (i) The depth to water table in the soil showed significant differences between different burning rotations and grazing intensities. Depth to water table was greatest on plots where burning did not occur or for longer burning cycles where livestock had been excluded.
   (ii) The pH and conductivity of sampled soil water showed no significant difference between grazing treatments, with the presence of burning being the most important factor (frequency of the burning cycle was not important).
   (iii) The DOC content showed no significant difference between grazing treatments but showed a significant decrease with the presence of burning, though no direct relationship with the depth to water table could be found.
   (iv) Burn management explains only a small proportion of the variance in the composition of the DOC, rather the variation is dominated by the differences between days of sampling and seasonal variation. Therefore, this study suggests that land management controls hydrology and water quality through controlling the development of vegetation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study we used a new passive sampler to measure the radiocarbon (C-14) and stable carbon (delta C-13) isotopic composition of dissolved CO2 for the first time in a peatland stream throughout a complete year (May 2010-June 2011). The in-stream sampling system collected time-integrated samples of CO2 continuously over approximately 1 month periods. The rate of CO2 trapping was proportional to independently measured streamwater CO2 concentrations, demonstrating that passive samplers can be used to estimate the time-averaged dissolved CO2 concentration of streamwater. While there was little variation and no clear trend in delta(CO2)-C-13 values (suggesting a consistent CO2 source), we found a clear temporal pattern in the C-14 concentration of dissolved CO2. The C-14 age of CO2 varied from 707 +/- 35 to 1210 +/- 39 years BP, with the youngest CO2 in the autumn and oldest in spring/early summer. Mean stream discharge and C-14 content of dissolved CO2 were positively correlated. We suggest that the observed pattern in the C-14 content of dissolved CO2 reflects changes in its origin, with older carbon derived from deeper parts of the peat profile contributing proportionally more gaseous carbon during periods of low stream flow.

AB Based on theories of mire development and responses to a changing climate, the current role of mires as a net carbon sink has been questioned. A rigorous evaluation of the current net C-exchange in mires requires measurements of all relevant fluxes. Estimates of annual total carbon budgets in mires are still very limited. Here, we present a full carbon budget over 2 years for a boreal minerogenic oligotrophic mire in northern Sweden (64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E). Data on the following fluxes were collected: land-atmosphere CO2 exchange (continuous Eddy covariance measurements) and CH4 exchange (static chambers during the snow free period); TOC (total organic carbon) in precipitation; loss of TOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 through stream water runoff (continuous discharge measurements and regular C-concentration measurements). The mire constituted a net sink of 27 +/- 3.4 (+/- SD) g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 20 +/- 3.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. This could be partitioned into an annual surface-atmosphere CO2 net uptake of 55 +/- 1.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 48 +/- 1.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. The annual NEE was further separated into a net uptake season, with an uptake of 92 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 86 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005, and a net loss season with a loss of 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. Of the annual net CO2-C uptake, 37% and 31% was lost through runoff (with runoff TOC > DIC >> CH4) and 16% and 29% through methane emission during 2004 and 2005, respectively. This mire is still a significant C-sink, with carbon accumulation rates comparable to the long-term Holocene C-accumulation, and higher than the C-accumulation during the late Holocene in the region.

AB Wetlands have important filter functions in landscapes but are considered to be the biggest unknowns regarding their element dynamics under global climate change. Information on sink and source function of sulphur, nitrogen, organic matter and acidity in wetlands is crucial for freshwater regeneration. Recent results indicate that redox processes are not completely controlled by the sequential reduction chain (that is electron acceptor availability) but that electron donor availability may be an important regulator. Our hypothesis was that only sites which are limited in their electron donor availability low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) follow the concept of the sequential reduction chain.
   We compared the results of two freshwater wetland systems: 1) three forested fens within a boreal spruce catchment in a low mountain range in southern Germany (high DOC regime) and 2) three floodplain soils within a groundwater enrichment area in the Rhein valley in northwest Switzerland (low DOC regime).
   Micro scale investigations (a few cm) with dialyse chambers as well as soil solution and groundwater concentrations at the forested fens (high DOC regime) indicated simultaneous consumption of nitrate and sulphate with release of iron, manganese and methane (CH4) as well as an enrichment in stable sulphur isotopes indicating a co-existence of processes attributed to different redox gradients. Soil and aquifer gas measurements down to 4.6 m at the groundwater enrichment site (low DOC regime and carbon limitation) showed extreme high rates of metabolism with carbon dioxide (CO2), dinitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 concentrations reaching fifty, thirty and three times atmospheric concentrations, respectively. Simultaneously, groundwater oxygen (O-2) saturation was between 50 and 95%. We concluded that independent of DOC regime the sequential reduction chain was not a suitable concept in our systems. Instead of electron acceptor or donor availability micro site variability might explain the co-existence of redox processes within our sites. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands in mid-high latitude regions play a vital role in climate change, due to their high organic carbon density. Nonetheless, the stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions in these regions is largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to examine the changes in SOC and its fractions along a latitudinal gradient and to analyze the influencing factors in the southern margin of the permafrost region on the Eurasian continent. Topsoil (0-20 cm) was collected from five wetlands along a latitudinal gradient in Northeast China. We analyzed SOC and some labile fractions. Our results demonstrated that wetland SOC and its labile fractions concentration declined with decreasing latitude. The Permafrost regions had greater organic carbon content than the regions with seasonally frozen ground. The light fraction organic carbon and particulate organic carbon accounted for 5-83% and 21-32%, respectively, of the SOC and were particularly enriched in the permafrost region. Microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon showed a similar decreasing trend to that of SOC. At the same latitude, vegetation affected SOC stock and the dynamics of its labile fractions. Therefore, wetlands in mid-high latitudes contain a large carbon pool, and carbon stock varies with latitude. Although the labile fractions were higher in the permafrost region, their activities were lower, due to low temperature and poor nutrient status. Under global warming, the labile carbon pool may be mobilized and contribute to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, vegetation differences should be considered in obtaining an accurate carbon calculation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Boreal ecosystems contain a large fraction of the world's soil carbon and are warming rapidly, prompting efforts to understand the role of freshwaters in carbon export from these regions. We examined geomorphic controls on the magnitude of stream CO2 emissions and sources of stream dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) across a heterogeneous river basin in SW Alaska. We found that watershed slope and precipitation interact to control gaseous carbon fluxes from streams, with the highest flux from low-gradient watersheds following rainstorms. Watershed slope influences C loading and stream CO2 fluxes by controlling carbon accumulation in watersheds and to a lesser extent by determining gas transfer velocity across the stream air-water interface. Low gas transfer velocity in flat streams offsets some of the effects of higher terrestrial C loading at those sites, resulting in lower than expected vertical CO2 fluxes. While the isotopic composition of stream DIC (Delta C-14 and delta C-13) was highly variable across space and time, shifts toward contemporary, terrestrial sources after precipitation were most pronounced in flat watersheds. At base flow DIC was a mixture of modern and aged sources of biogenic and geologic origin (Delta C-14, -198.3 parts per thousand to 27.9 parts per thousand, n=23). Aged (Delta C-14-depleted) C sources contributed to food webs via a pathway from DIC to algae to invertebrate grazers. We observed coherent changes in stream carbon chemistry after large rainstorms despite considerable physical heterogeneity among watersheds. These patterns provide a way to extrapolate across boreal landscapes by constraining CO2 concentration and flux estimates by local geomorphic features.

AB Global change models normally do not include interaction effects between different pools of recalcitrant humic organic carbon which can alter carbon cycling via their influence on biological activities. This issue is especially important in northern regions where lakes receive high inputs of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the extensive surrounding peatlands. We investigated the threshold of added labile DOC necessary to promote a priming effect (PE); i.e. stimulation of bacterial metabolism with a subsequent increase in the mineralization of recalcitrant DOC and the accompanying changes in microbial community structure and function. Our study was carried out in a small highly humic lake (Mekkojarvi, southern Finland), physically divided by a plastic curtain into two experimental basins, one where fish were present (+FISH) and one that was fishless (-FISH). In each basin, we performed a factorial mesocosm experiment in which different amounts of labile DOC were supplied as cane sugar (control +6, +9, +12 mg C L-1). Our results showed no priming effect in any carbon treatment, either in +FISH or in -FISH basins, despite a decreasing trend in total DOC concentration. Bacterial abundance and production did not increase as a response to carbon additions, while mixotrophic algae increased their abundance over time. In our experiments, the organisms that benefitted most after addition of labile DOC were mixotrophic algae, which can transform carbon into biomass by obtaining inorganic nutrients through phagotrophy. This appears most likely due to strong bacterial N limitation and dependence on resource availability and stoichiometry.

AB Although lateral carbon (C) export from terrestrial to aquatic systems is known to be an important component in landscape C balances, most existing global studies are lacking empirical data on the soil C export. In this study, the concentration, character, and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were studied during 2years in two hemiboreal headwater streams draining catchments with different soil characteristics (mineral versus peat soils). The streams exposed surprisingly similar strong air temperature controls on the temporal variability in DOC concentration in spite of draining such different catchments. The temporal variability in DOC character (determined by absorbance metrics, specific ultraviolet absorbance 254 (SUVA(254)) as a proxy for aromaticity and a254/a365 ratio as a proxy for mean molecular weight) was more complex but related to stream discharge. While the two streams showed similar ranges and patterns in SUVA(254), we found a significant difference in median a254/a354, suggesting differences in the DOC character. Both streams responded similarly to hydrological changes with higher a254/a365 at higher discharge, although with rather small differences in a254/a365 between base flow and high flow (<0.3). The DOC exports (9.6-25.2gCm(-2)yr(-1)) were among the highest reported so far for Scandinavia and displayed large interannual and intraannual variability mainly driven by irregular precipitation/discharge patterns. Our results show that air temperature and discharge affect the temporal variability in DOC quantity and character in different ways. This will have implications for the design of representative sampling programs, which in turn will affect the reliability of future estimates of landscape C budgets.

AB The estimation of flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the terrestrial biosphere has been of concern because of its importance for the status of carbon storage in soils and the potential impact on atmospheric CO2 levels. However, these studies have tended to focus on the flux at the tidal limit and from organic soils, without considering the losses at the soil source or processing within the watershed. This study constructs a database of 194 catchments where DOC export was predicted as a function of soil, land-use and hydrological characteristics of each catchment. By comparing across catchments of differing sizes while accounting for the effects of differences in soil and land use this study can estimate the export of DOC at the soil source and the net removal across the watershed. The study can show that although the dominant source of DOC was organic soils, there was significant DOC export from urban and grazed land on mineral and organo-mineral soils, but not from arable land. The average export at source from peat soils was 40 +/- 4 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. The average estimated annual DOC flux between 2001 and 2007 from the UK was 909 +/- 354 ktonnes C/yr which was within the error of previous estimates. The study was able to estimate the loss of DOC at the soil source as between 3100 and 4000 ktonnes C/yr, with a net watershed loss of DOC between 2200 and 3100 ktonnes C/yr, equivalent to between 9.0 and 12.7 tonnes C/km(2) of UK land area/yr.

AB Here, we describe and evaluate two low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) designed to remotely monitor wetland hydrochemical dynamics over time scales ranging from minutes to decades. Each WSN (one student-built and one commercial) has multiple nodes to monitor water level, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, and major solutes at user-defined time intervals. Both WSNs can be configured to report data in near real time via the internet. Based on deployments in two isolated wetlands, we report highly resolved water budgets, transient reversals of flow path, rates of transpiration from peatlands and the dynamics of chromophoric-dissolved organic matter and bulk ionic solutes (specific conductivity)-all on daily or subdaily time scales. Initial results indicate that direct precipitation and evapotranspiration dominate the hydrologic budget of both study wetlands, despite their relatively flat geomorphology and proximity to elevated uplands. Rates of transpiration from peatland sites were typically greater than evaporation from open waters but were more challenging to integrate spatially. Due to the high specific yield of peat, the hydrologic gradient between peatland and open water varied with precipitation events and intervening periods of dry out. The resultant flow path reversals implied that the flux of solutes across the riparian boundary varied over daily time scales. We conclude that WSNs can be deployed in remote wetland-dominated ecosystems at relatively low cost to assess the hydrochemical impacts of weather, climate, and other perturbations.

TI Riparian soil temperature modification of the relationship between flow

AB Discharge is often strongly correlated to the temporal variability of dissolved organic carbon concentrations ([DOC]) in watercourses. One recently proposed way to model this is the riparian flow-concentration integration model (RIM) concept that accounts for the role of flow pathway control on [DOC] dynamics in streams. However, in boreal systems, there is also commonly a seasonal pattern, which cannot be explained by variability in discharge alone. The objectives with this study were to (1) demonstrate RIM as a tool for studying variability in stream water chemistry, (2) investigate factors related to stream water DOC variability, and (3) modify RIM to account for these factors. RIM was used with 14 years of daily discharge and almost 500 stream measurements of [DOC] from a forested boreal headwater stream. We used the calibrated RIM to account for discharge influences and then investigated variables that could be related to DOC variability (air and soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation, antecedent flow and stream sulfate). Five alternative formulations of RIM, with temporally varying soil concentration profiles based on the variability in soil temperature and/or antecedent flow, were evaluated. The model where only the effects of riparian soil temperature on dynamics in DOC depth profiles were included performed best overall. This dynamic RIM improved the Nash-Sutcliffe to 0.58 compared to 0.42 for the flow-only formulation and reduced the median absolute error from 3.0 to 2.1 mg L (-1). This study demonstrates that RIM is a simple way of modeling stream DOC and exploring controls on stream water chemistry.

AB Many articles published in the last few years start with the assumption that the past decades have seen an increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the rivers and lakes of the Northern Hemisphere. This study analyses whether the existing evidence supports this claim. With this aim, we have collected published studies where long series of organic carbon concentrations (i.e., longer than 10 years) were analyzed for existing trends and have carefully evaluated the 63 articles found. Information has been collated in a comprehensive and comparable way, allowing readers to easily access it. The two main aspects considered in our analysis have been the analytical methods used and the data treatment methods applied. Both are sensitive issues because, on the one hand, the difficulties associated with correctly determining organic carbon concentrations in surface waters are well known, while, on the other, dealing with real environmental data (i.e., lack of normality, censoring, missing values, etc.) is an extremely intricate matter. Other issues such as data reporting and the geographical location of the systems studied are also discussed. In conclusion, it is clear that organic carbon concentrations have increased in some surface waters in the Northern Hemisphere since the 1990s. However, due to a lack of data in many parts of the world, it is not known whether this phenomenon is general and, more importantly, in the areas for which such data do exist, the reporting and methodological problems in the published studies prevent any conclusion on the existence of a general temporal behavior of organic carbon from being drawn.

AB Only little is known about the long-term carbon dynamics related to peatland restoration. We studied CO 2 and CH 4 dynamics of spontaneously regenerated peat trenches five decades after peat harvesting had ceased. We used non-linear regression models and interpolation for simulating gas exchange of four regenerating plant communities during two growing seasons and one winter. The studied communities all acted as seasonal (June-September) sinks of CO 2 between 14 and 118 g C m(-2), while the emissions of CH4 ranged from -4.9 to -28.8 g C m(-2). When the winter time losses of carbon and the estimated leaching were subtracted, the balance was very low or negative: between -67 and 31 g C m(-2). The low or even negative annual carbon balance in all communities may suggest a decrease in carbon sink strength in the advanced regeneration after the previously observed strong sink in the first regeneration stages caused by mass colonization by Eriophorum.

AB Possible interactions between soil enzymes and the biogeochemistry of wetlands were investigated during a field-based drought simulation. Under control (waterlogged) conditions, correlations were found between the activity of the enzyme B-glucosidase and two properties associated with carbon cycling, namely i) CH4 release (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and )dissolved organic carbon concentration (r = -0.81, p < 0.01). In contrast, the transition to drought conditions resulted in correlations between a-glucosidase activity and certain mineralisation processes, namely the release of mg and Ca (r = 0.72, p < 0.05). Sulphatase activity correlated with changes in sulphate concentration during the drought simulation (r = 0.73, p < 0.05). Further support for the suggested enzymic involvement in biogeochemical processes was found in laboratory studies. These experiments indicated that increasing the abundance of B-glucosidase could stimulate trace gas emissions (p < 0.001) and increase the concentration of magnesium and calcium (p < 0.05). Increased sulphatase abundance caused a suppression of methane emissions (p = 0.053).

AB As a phenomenon integrating climate conditions and hydrological control of the connection between streams and terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources, groundwater dynamics control patterns of stream DOC characteristics (concentrations and fluxes). Influence of intra-annual variations in groundwater level, discharge and climatic factors on DOC concentrations and fluxes were assessed over 13 years at the headwater watershed of Kervidy-Naizin (5 km(2)) in western France. Four seasonal periods were delineated within each year according to groundwater fluctuations (A: rewetting, B: high flow, C: recession, and D: drought). Annual and seasonal base flow versus stormflow DOC concentrations were defined based on daily hydrograph readings. High interannual variability of annual DOC fluxes (5.4-39.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) indicates that several years of data are required to encompass variations in water flux to evaluate the actual DOC export capacity of a watershed. Interannual variability of mean annual DOC concentrations was much lower (4.9-7.5 mg CL-1), with concentrations decreasing within each year from ca. 9.2 mg CL-1 in A to ca. 3.0 mg CL-1 in C. This indicates an intra-annual pattern of stream DOC concentrations controlled by DOC source characteristics and groundwater dynamics very similar across years. Partial least squares regressions combined with multiple linear regressions showed that the dry season characteristics (length and draw-down) determine the mean annual DOC concentration while annual runoff determines the annual flux. Antagonistic mechanisms of production-accumulation and dilution-depletion combined with an unlimited DOC supply from riparian wetland soils can mitigate the response of stream concentrations to global changes and climatic variations.

AB Acidity is well known to influence stream biota, but the less well-studied spatial and temporal distributions of acidity are likely to play a larger ecological role than average values. We present data on spatial variability of chemical parameters contributing to acidity during winter baseflow and spring flood periods in Krycklan, a fourth-order boreal stream network in northern Sweden. Fifteen stream sites were monitored in subcatchments spanning 3 orders of magnitude in size and representing a wide range of percent wetland. At baseflow, pH ranged from 3.9 to 6.5 at the different sites. Baseflow dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration varied by an order of magnitude and was positively correlated with subcatchment percent wetland, resulting in high spatial variability in dissociated organic acids (OA(-)). During spring flood, DOC and OA(-) increased in forested sites and decreased in wetland sites, resulting in reduced spatial variability in their concentrations. In contrast, base cations and strong acid anions diluted throughout the stream network, resulting in decreased acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) at all sites. The spatial variability of base cations increased slightly with high flow. As a result of the changes in OA(-) and ANC, pH dropped at all but the most acidic site, giving a slightly narrowed pH range during spring flood (4.2-6.1). The transition from winter to spring flood stream chemistry could largely be explained by: (1) a shift from mineral to upper riparian organic soil flow paths in forested catchments and (2) dilution of peat water with snowmelt in wetland catchments.

AB We combined high-frequency dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) data with stable isotope observations to identify the sources and ages of runoff that cause temporal variability in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within a peat-dominated Scottish catchment. FDOM was strongly correlated (r(2) similar to 0.8) with DOC, allowing inference of a 15 min time series. We captured 34 events over a range of hydrological conditions. Along with marked seasonality, different event responses were observed during summer depending on dry or wet antecedent conditions. The majority of events exhibited anticlockwise hysteresis as a result of the expansion of the riparian saturation zone, mobilizing previously unconnected DOC sources. Water ages from the main runoff sources were extracted from a tracer-aided hydrological model. Particularly useful were ages of overland flow, which were negatively correlated with DOC concentration. Overland flow age, which ranged between 0.2 and 360 days, reflected antecedent conditions, with younger water generally mobilizing the highest DOC concentrations in summer events. During small events with dry antecedent conditions, DOC response was proportionally higher due to the displacement and mixing of small volumes of previously unconnected highly concentrated riparian soil waters by new precipitation. During large events with wet antecedent conditions, the riparian saturation zone expands to organic layers on the hillslopes causing peaks in DOC. However, these peaks were limited by dilution and supply. This study highlights the utility of linking high-frequency DOC measurements with other tracers, allowing the effects of hydrologic connectivity and antecedent conditions on delivery of DOC to streams to be assessed.

AB Coastal zones connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems forming a unique environment that is under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise.

AB This study measured the effects of land use on organic matter released to surface waters in a boreal peat catchment using radiocarbon dating of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC), DOC concentration, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition, and optical measurements. Undisturbed sites invariably released modern DOC and POC (<20 years old), and seasonal forcing had little impact on the age distribution. Released of pre-1950 carbon was detected at peat extraction, agricultural and peat extraction areas throughout the seasons. Convention; mean DOC ages reached 3,100 (+/- 122) years before collection. On average, DOC concentrations were up to 38% higher at impacted sites compared to natural areas, but there was no significant effect of land use on surface water DOC concentrations. the study indicated that the extent of land use impacts is not necessarily detectible through changes in DOC concentration alone. Radiocarbon dating was essential to show that leaching of old soil organic matter at modified sites had replaced, rather than supplemented, the modern DOM that is usually released from pristine peatlands. Relationships between the specific fluorescence intensity of DOM and its radiocarbon age were identified, indicating that optical technique may provide a method for the detection of changes in DOM age.

AB Effects of Boreal forest harvest on mercury (Hg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) soil pools and export by stream runoff were quantified by comparing 10 reference watersheds (REFs) covered by >80year old Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) forests with 10 similar watersheds subjected to clear-cutting (CCs). While total Hg soil storage did not change, MeHg pools increased seven times (p=0.006) in the organic topsoil 2 years after clear-cutting. In undulating terrain, situated above the postglacial marine limit (ML) of the ancient Baltic Sea, the mass ratio between flux-weighted MeHg and dissolved organic carbon (MeHg/DOC) in stream runoff increased 1.8 times (p<0.004) as a consequence of forest harvest. When recalculated to 100% clear-cutting of the watershed, the annual MeHg stream export increased 3.8 times (p=0.047). Below the ML, where the terrain was flatter, neither the MeHg/DOC ratio nor the annual export of MeHg differed between REFs and CCs, likely because of the larger contribution of MeHg exported from peaty soils and small wetlands. The most robust measure, MeHg/DOC, was used to calculate MeHg loadings to Boreal headwaters. If the forest harvest effect lasts 10years, clear-cutting increases MeHg runoff by 12-20% in Sweden and 2% in the Boreal zone as a whole. In Sweden, having intensely managed forests, 37% and 56% of MeHg are exported from peatlands and forest soils, respectively, and forest clear-cutting is adding another 6.6%. In the Boreal zone as a whole peatlands and forests soils contribute with 53% and 46%, respectively, and clear-cutting is estimated to add another 1.0%. An expected rapid increase in Boreal forest harvest and disturbance urge for inclusion of land use effects in mercury biogeochemical cycling models at different scales.

AB The current paradigm in peatland ecology is that the organic matter inputs from plant photosynthesis (e.g. moss litter) exceed that of decomposition, tipping the metabolic balance in favour of carbon (C) storage. Here, we investigated an alternative hypothesis, whereby exudates released by microalgae can actually accelerate C losses from the surface waters of northern peatlands by stimulating dissolved organic C (DOC) decomposition in a warmer environment expected with climate change. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the biodegradability of fen DOC in a factorial design with and without algal DOC in both ambient (15 degrees C) and elevated (20 degrees C) water temperatures during a laboratory bioassay. When DOC sources were evaluated separately, decomposition rates were higher in treatments with algal DOC only than with fen DOC only, indicating that the quality of the organic matter influenced degradability. A mixture of substrates (1/2 algal DOC + 1/2 fen DOC) exceeded the expected level of biodegradation (i.e. the average of the individual substrate responses) by as much as 10%, and the magnitude of this effect increased to more than 15% with warming. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), a proxy for aromatic content, was also significantly higher (i.e. more humic) in the mixture treatment than expected from SUVA(254) values in single substrate treatments. Accelerated decomposition in the presence of algal DOC was coupled with an increase in bacterial biomass, demonstrating that enhanced metabolism was associated with a more abundant microbial community. These results present an alternative energy pathway for heterotrophic consumers to breakdown organic matter in northern peatlands. Since decomposition in northern peatlands is often limited by the availability of labile organic matter, this mechanism could become increasingly important as a pathway for decomposition in the surface waters of northern peatlands where algae are expected to be more abundant in conditions associated with ongoing climate change.

AB Mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and related trace elements (TEs) from the frozen peat to surface waters in the permafrost zone is expected to enhance under ongoing permafrost thaw and active layer thickness (ALT) deepening in high-latitude regions. The interstitial soil solutions are efficient tracers of ongoing bio-geochemical processes in the critical zone and can help to decipher the intensity of carbon and metals migration from the soil to the rivers and further to the ocean. To this end, we collected, across a 640 km latitudinal transect of the sporadic to continuous permafrost zone of western Siberia peatlands, soil porewaters from 30 cm depth using suction cups and we analyzed DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and 40 major elements and TEs in 0.45 mu m filtered fraction of 80 soil porewaters.
   Despite an expected decrease in the intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from the soil and vegetation litter to the interstitial fluids with the increase in the permafrost coverage and a decrease in the annual temperature and ALT, the DOC and many major and trace elements did not exhibit any distinct decrease in concentration along the latitudinal transect from 62.2 to 67.4 degrees N. The DOC demonstrated a maximum of concentration at 66 degrees N, on the border of the discontinuous/continuous permafrost zone, whereas the DOC concentration in peat soil solutions from the continuous permafrost zone was equal to or higher than that in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone. Moreover, a number of major (Ca, Mg) and trace (Al, Ti, Sr, Ga, rare earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th) elements exhibited an increasing, not decreasing, northward concentration trend. We hypothesize that the effects of temperature and thickness of the ALT are of secondary importance relative to the leaching capacity of peat, which is in turn controlled by the water saturation of the peat core. The water residence time in peat pores also plays a role in enriching the fluids in some elements: the DOC, V, Cu, Pb, REEs, and Th were a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 higher in mounds relative to hollows. As such, it is possible that the time of reaction between the peat and downward infiltrating waters essentially controls the degree of peat porewater enrichments in DOC and other solutes. A 2 degrees northward shift in the position of the permafrost boundaries may bring about a factor of 1.3 +/- 0.2 decrease in Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Ni, Co, V, Zr, Hf, Th, and REE porewater concentration in continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, and a possible decrease in DOC, specific ultraviolet absorbency (SUVA), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Sr will not exceed 20% of their current values. The projected increase in ALT and vegetation density, northward migration of the permafrost boundary, or the change of hydrological regime is unlikely to modify chemical composition of peat porewater fluids larger than their natural variations within different micro-landscapes, i.e., within a factor of 2. The decrease in DOC and metal delivery to small rivers and lakes by peat soil leachate may also decrease the overall export of dissolved components from the continuous permafrost zone to the Arctic Ocean. This challenges the current paradigm on the increase in DOC export from the land to the ocean under climate warming in high latitudes.

AB The biogeochemistry of 10 headwater lakes in burnt peatland-conifer catchments and 14 in unburnt catchments was evaluated throughout a summer 2 years following forest fire in a boreal subarctic region of northern Alberta. Cation exchange within burnt catchments resulted in proton flux and a 9% reduction in mean pH. Lakes in burnt catchments contained more than twofold higher (P << 0.01) mean concentrations of total, total dissolved, and soluble reactive phosphorus, 1.5-fold higher (P << 0.01) concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, and more than 1.2-fold higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of total and total dissolved nitrogen, nitrate + nitrite, and ammonium compared with reference lakes. Total phosphorus concentration explained 86% of the variance in reference lake chlorophyll concentration but was not related to chlorophyll concentration in burnt lakes. Analysis of chlorophyll - total phosphorus residuals suggested that algae in burn-impacted lakes were light limited. With the addition of five lakes burnt between 1961 and 1985, time since disturbance and percent disturbance combined explained 74% of the variance in total phosphorus among burnt lakes. Fire caused increased flux of materials to the study lakes with slow recovery over decades.

AB The chemistry of Wet Spodosols (Aquods) differs from well-drained Spodosols. Two different hypotheses have been suggested to explain the contrasting genesis of wet spodic horizons. This study attempted to determine whether Aquods at a Danish peat-bog wetland site are a result of (i) in situ illuviation under a fluctuating water table, or (ii) degradation of a former Fe-rich, well-drained spodic horizon. Methods included soil surveys, wet chemical analyses, micromorphology, pollen analysis, and radiocarbon dating of soil organic matter (OM) fractions. Aquods, and soil material with spodic features, were exclusively found in sandy material at the margins of or underneath sphagnum peat bogs, whereas Inceptisols were found on well-drained sandy deposits only. Aluminum content was very high and Fe low in spodic materials with ortstein properties. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of wet sandy 2Bs horizons were dominated by alkyl C (70%) from water-insoluble OM and were clearly distinct from NMR spectra of overlying 2Bhsm material. Pollen analysis revealed that an open forest with a thick mor layer dominated until shortly after 5000 yr BP, when sphagnum was first recorded. Radiocarbon ages of bulk soil C in the spodic horizons had mean residence times of 4500 to 4400 yr. Accordingly, the spodic B horizon was probably formed by strong in situ illuviation of Al-OM complexes before the sphagnum peat bog formation. This suggests that spodic material formation and thus strong C accumulation underneath this Danish peat bog took place for a limited period, only in susceptible parent material, and at the margins of the expanding peat bog.

AB This study is aimed at assessing the effect of factors including lithology, forest/peatland coverage, dissolved organic carbon, and vegetation on chemical fluxes and concentrations of major elements in rivers. The mean annual element concentrations and dissolved fluxes of acid and basic rock dominated watersheds of the Karelia region and Kola peninsula, NW Russia, have been estimated from the chemical composition of river water samples collected in the summers of 1996-2000 and from annual discharge and chemical composition data of 16 watersheds collected from 1961 to 1975. The mean annual flux corrected for atmospheric input varies from 0.5 to 5.6 t/km(2)/y and is dominated by alkali metals for the Kola alkaline rocks and by calcium for the Karelian granito-gneisses. The pure "granitic" and pure "basaltic" river chemical denudation rates in the Baltic shield are 0.33 and 2.3 t/km(2)/y, respectively. The cationic and silica fluxes of both granitic and basaltic watersheds are comparable with those of other boreal regions having similar runoff, compositions, and climate. The cationic flux of the rivers is positively correlated with the basic rock fraction of the watershed, whereas the dissolved organic carbon flux increases with the increasing peatland fraction. The chemical composition of the river water is controlled by bedrock dissolution during dry periods, and by plant litter degradation and washout of organic debris from the topsoil' horizon during wet periods. Taking account the chemical composition of the plant litter and the biological turnover intensity, it was estimated that the plant litter degradation in Kola and Karelia regions provides 10-40% of total annual dissolved riverine element flux.

AB We monitored the dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence in two Wisconsin bog lakes over timescales ranging from hours to months. Peatland-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) was the major solute in both bog lakes, and diel cycles were dominant features of the CDOM fluorescence time series. Two distinct diel cycles that differed in amplitude and timing were observed: one in oxic epilimnia and a second in anoxic, hypolimnetic waters. These cycles were not attributable to instrumental artifacts (i.e., daily oscillations of temperature, ambient light, or battery voltage), hydrologic forcing, or the effects of inner filtering, pH, or redox conditions. High light extinction coefficients, especially in the ultraviolet region (approximate to 10 m(-1) to 30 m(-1)), suggest that DOM photolysis was negligible at the depths of the CDOM fluorescence probes in these dark-water lakes (dissolved carbon concentration: 10 mg C L-1 to 20 mg C L-1). The diel cycles were apparently governed primarily by biological activities that mediate DOM production (release) and destruction (uptake). Rates of carbon turnover derived from properties of the epilimnetic CDOM fluorescence cycle (0.28 mg C L-1 d(-1)) were similar to rates of net ecosystem production based on daily CO2 dynamics (0.32 mg C L-1 d(-1)). It appears that a small, secondary pool of labile organic carbon turns over at relatively high rates in these bog lakes, consistent with the two-compartment view of DOM stability.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon have increased in many, but not all, surface waters across acid impacted areas of Europe and North America over the last two decades. Over the last eight years several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these increases. but none are yet accepted universally. Research in this area appears to have reached a stalemate between those favouring declining atmospheric deposition, climate change or land management as the key driver of long-term DOC trends While it is clear that many of these factors influence DOC dynamics in soil and stream waters, their effect varies over different temporal and spatial scales We argue that regional differences in acid deposition loading may account for the apparent discrepancies between studies DOC has shown strong monotonic increases in areas which have experienced strong downward trends in pollutant sulphur and/or seasalt deposition. Elsewhere climatic factors, that strongly influence seasonality. have also dominated inter-annual variability, and here long-term monotonic DOC trends are often difficult to detect Furthermore, in areas receiving similar acid loadings, different catchment characteristics could have affected the site specific sensitivity to changes in acidity and therefore the magnitude of DOC release in response to changes in sulphur deposition We suggest that confusion over these temporal and spatial scales of investigation has contributed unnecessarily to the disagreement over the main regional driver(s) of DOC trends, and that the data behind the majority of these studies is more compatible than is often conveyed (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB This study has estimated the long term evaporation record for a peat covered catchment in northern England. In this study, 19 years of daily evaporation were estimated for rain-free periods using White's methods. Net radiation was measured over the study period; soil heat flux was calculated from temperature profiles; and sensible heat flux was calculated assuming the energy budget was closed. The calculated time series was compared to available environmental information on the same time step and over the same time period. Over a 19-year period it was possible to calculate 1662 daily evaporation rates (26% of the period). The study showed that the energy flux to net primry productivity was a small, long-term sink of energy but this sink was a virtue of high carbon accumulation in peat catchments: in catchments where there is no long-term dry matter accumulation, net primary productivity must be a small net source of energy. The study showed that evaporation increased over the study period whilst sensible heat flux significantly declined, reflecting an increased use of sensible heat energy to meet evaporative demand. The relatively small change in evaporative flux compared to other energy fluxes suggests that this system is a "near-equilibrium" system and not a "far-from-equilibrium" system.

AB Quantification and valuation of ecosystem services are critically dependent on the quality of underpinning science. While key ecological processes may be understood, translating this understanding into quantitative relationships suitable for use in an ecosystem services context remains challenging. Using blanket bogs as a case study, we derived quantitative 'pressure-response functions linking anthropogenic pressures (drainage, burning, sulphur and nitrogen deposition) with ecosystem functions underpinning key climate, water quality and flood regulating services. The analysis highlighted: i) the complex, sometimes conflicting or interactive effects of multiple anthropogenic pressures on different ecosystem functions; ii) the role of 'biodiversity' (primarily presence/absence of key plant functional types) as an intermediate factor determining how anthropogenic pressures translate into changes in flows of some ecosystem services; iii) challenges relating to the spatial scale and configuration of anthropogenic pressures and ecosystem service beneficiaries; and iv) uncertainties associated with the lags between anthropogenic pressures and ecosystem responses. The conceptual approach described may provide a basis for a more quantitative, multi parameter approach to the valuation of ecosystem services and the evidence based optimisation of policy and land management for ecosystem services.

AB The magnitude of future emissions of greenhouse gases from the northern permafrost region depends crucially on the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) that has accumulated over millennia in these perennially frozen soils. Many recent studies have used radiocarbon (C-14) to quantify the release of this "old" SOC as CO2 or CH4 to the atmosphere or as dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) to surface waters. We compiled similar to 1,900 C-14 measurements from 51 sites in the northern permafrost region to assess the vulnerability of thawing SOC in tundra, forest, peatland, lake, and river ecosystems. We found that growing season soil C-14-CO2 emissions generally had a modern (post-1950s) signature, but that well-drained, oxic soils had increased CO(2)emissions derived from older sources following recent thaw. The age of CO2 and CH4 emitted from lakes depended primarily on the age and quantity of SOC in sediments and on the mode of emission, and indicated substantial losses of previously frozen SOC from actively expanding thermokarst lakes. Increased fluvial export of aged DOC and POC occurred from sites where permafrost thaw caused soil thermal erosion. There was limited evidence supporting release of previously frozen SOC as CO2, CH4, and DOC from thawing peatlands with anoxic soils. This synthesis thus suggests widespread but not universal release of permafrost SOC following thaw. We show that different definitions of "old" sources among studies hamper the comparison of vulnerability of permafrost SOC across ecosystems and disturbances. We also highlight opportunities for future C-14 studies in the permafrost region.

AB Understanding the climatic and biological factors that regulate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux is crucial in peatlands because they contain a large proportion of terrestrial carbon (C). We predicted that rainfall reduction would increase soil CO2 efflux, and that cessation of below-ground allocation of recent plant assimilate would reduce soil CO2 efflux. These predictions were tested in the field using rainfall shelters that allowed a maximum of 40 % of rainfall onto 2 x 2 m plots by diverting rainwater from the shelter roofs with guttering, and by girdling stems of the dominant plant, Calluna vulgaris, for two years. We also used (CO2)-C-13-pulse labelling of intact monoliths at ambient CO2 concentrations to trace recent assimilate from plant shoots to roots, bulk soil, leachate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux in the sheltered plots increased in Year 1 but not in Year 2, and we found a positive relationship between soil CO2 efflux and water table depth. Our data indicate that lowering the water table below a critical threshold (15-20 cm) affects soil CO2 efflux. Girdling of C. vulgaris shoots resulted in no measurable reduction in soil CO2 efflux, while only similar to 3 % of C-13 fixed by shoots was recovered in soil CO2 efflux and DOC in the 20 days after labelling. Our findings show that below-ground allocation of recent assimilate from C. vulgaris plants > 6 years old has little impact on soil CO2 efflux.

AB This study investigates for the first time the relative importance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the fluvial carbon flux from an actively eroding peatland catchment in the southern Pennines, UK. Event scale variability in DOC and POC was examined and the annual flux of fluvial organic carbon was estimated for the catchment. At the event scale, both DOC and POC were found to increase with discharge, with event based POC export accounting for 95% of flux in only 8% of the time. On an annual cycle, exports of 35.14 t organic carbon (OC) are estimated from the catchment, which represents an areal value of 92.47 g C m(-2) a(-1). POC was the most significant form of organic carbon export, accounting for 80% of the estimated flux. This suggests that more research is required on both the fate of POC and the rates of POC export in eroding peatland catchments.

AB Thermokarst lakes and ponds formed due to thawing of frozen peat in high-latitude lowlands are very dynamic and environmentally important aquatic systems that play a key role in controlling C emission to atmosphere and organic carbon (OC), nutrient, and metal lateral export to rivers and streams. However, despite the importance of thermokarst lakes in assessing biogeochemical functioning of permafrost peatlands in response to climate warming and permafrost thaw, spatial (lake size, permafrost zone) and temporal (seasonal) variations in thermokarst lake hydrochemistry remain very poorly studied. Here, we used unprecedented spatial coverage (isolated, sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zone of the western Siberia Lowland) of 67 lakes ranging in size from 10(2)to 10(5)m(2)for sampling during three main hydrological periods of the year: spring flood, summer baseflow, and autumn time before ice-on. We demonstrate a systematic, all-season decrease in the concentration of dissolved OC (DOC) and an increase in SO4, N-NO3, and some metal (Mn, Co, Cu, Mo, Sr, U, Sb) concentration with an increase in lake surface area, depending on the type of the permafrost zone. These features are interpreted as a combination of (i) OC and organically bound metal leaching from peat at the lake shore, via abrasion and delivery of these compounds by suprapermafrost flow, and (ii) deep groundwater feeding of large lakes (especially visible in the continuous permafrost zone). Analyses of lake water chemical composition across the permafrost gradient allowed a first-order empirical prediction of lake hydrochemical changes in the case of climate warming and permafrost thaw, employing a substituting space for time scenario. The permafrost boundary shift northward may decrease the concentrations and pools of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Li, B, Mg, K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ni, Cu, As, Rb, Mo, Sr, Y, Zr, rare Earth elements (REEs), Th, and U by a factor of 2-5 in the continuous permafrost zone, but increase the concentrations of CH4, DOC, NH4, Cd, Sb, and Pb by a factor of 2-3. In contrast, the shift of the sporadic to isolated zone may produce a 2-5-fold decrease in CH4, DOC, NH4, Al, P, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ga, Zr, Nb, Cs, REEs, Hf, Th, and U. The exact magnitude of this response will, however, be strongly seasonally dependent, with the largest effects observable during baseflow seasons.

AB The measurement of chemical concentration profiles in pore water is a starting point for the analysis of biogeochemical processes in waterlogged peat soils. Concentration patterns may be obscured when macroporosity causes preferential flow in column experiments and when pore water is retrieved from the peat by suction. To investigate the magnitude of such effects, we used LiBr as a tracer in peat columns at outflow rates of 0, 2-3, and 8 nun d(-1). The results were compared with modeled advective-diffusive migration rates. Twenty to fifty percent of the tracer was recovered from depths at which the tracer would have been absent if preferential flow had not occurred. At the high flow rate, the preferential flow was stronger, and the retrieved pore-water was probably in disequilibrium with the matrix. When pore water was retrieved by suction, linear concentration gradients decreased by about 30% through the recovery of water from different depths, and the quality of fitted linear gradients decreased from R-2 = 0.99 to R-2 = 0.82. When flow rates are low (<3 mm d(-1)) and pore water concentration values from samplers are aggregated or regressed, the obtained concentration profiles seem to represent the vertical distribution of chemical species reasonably well. The use and interpretation of pore water profiles in peat soils is problematic if flow rates are higher and if vertical gradients are based on individual or few data points that have been obtained by suction samplers.

AB Microbial enzyme activities were followed during a field-based experimental simulation of the effects of higher rainfall in a Welsh peat land. The treatment did not significantly affect the activities of the carbon cycling enzymes, P-glucosidase, esterase or xylosidase. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme sulphatase decreased by 44% (P < 0.001) in response to the wetter conditions. The manipulation suggests that should climate change cause conditions to become wetter in peatlands, then (with the exception of sulphatase) current levels of wetness may be sufficient to limit decomposition processes, and thus any further increase in wetness is unlikely to induce a further decrease in decomposition rates. Correlations were found between the esterase activity and both nitrous oxide flux (r=-0.34, P<0.05), and methane release (r=0.53, P<0.01). Likewise, there was a correlation between xylosidase activity and both carbon dioxide emission (r=0.52, P<0.01) and aluminium concentration (r=0.58, P<0.01). All of the enzymes correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon (range r=0.53, P<0.01 sulphatase to r=0.61, P<0.001 glucosidase). Together, the correlations lend support to recent hypotheses suggesting that enzymes exert an influence over wetland biogeochemical properties.

AB Understanding the sources and removal mechanisms for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is critical to determining the importance of peatlands in influencing streamwater DOM concentrations. Soil saturation and soil temperature are the primary factors that influence DOM cycling in soils, but the relationships among these factors vary by soil type and climate. Despite the extent of peatlands that occur within Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) watersheds, there is little information describing how DOM storage and export patterns are related to soil saturation and temperature in the region. We measured soil water tables, soil temperatures and redox potential and compared these measurements to fluctuations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations in a forested wetland and sloping bog in southeast Alaska to address this key information gap. DOC concentrations ranged from 5 to 140 mg C l(-1) in wetland soils, 11 to 46 mg C l(-1) in streams, and varied greatly in response to changes in water table, redox potential and soil temperature. Similarly, DON concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 2.4 mg N l(-1) in wetland soils, 0.2 to 0.6 mg N l(-1) in streams and concentrations also reflected seasonal changes in physical measures. Depth to water table and soil temperature were significant factors related to the concentration of DOC in forested wetland soils and streams, while soil temperature was a significant factor that influenced stream DOC and DON concentrations. Comparing soil solution and stream DOM concentrations indicated that N is retained in bogs, while both dilution and biotic/abiotic retention mechanisms control DOM export in forested wetlands. The relationships among soil saturation, temperature and concentrations of DOC and DON provide preliminary models for estimating DOM fluxes from wetland soils in the CTR. Furthermore, these results can help calibrate regional watershed carbon flux models to predict the potential impacts of climate shifts and management activities on future wetland soil and stream DOM concentrations in CTR watersheds.

AB Blanket-bog peats, mapped as the Winter Hill and Crowdy associations by the Soil Survey of England and Wales, are an oceanic manifestation of the ombrotrophic 'raised-bog' (Hochmoor) peats that cover large tracts in the boreal zone of the northern hemisphere. This paper examines monthly analyses from 1992 to 1997 of major ions and other variables from an upland blanket bog in southwest England in relation to seasonality, rainfall, and the chemical composition of rainwater. Average ionic composition of surface water (and peat) integrates variable atmospheric solute inputs over the years. The dominant ions in the surface water, Na+ and Cl-, showed only weak seasonality, but divalent cations a stronger seasonal pattern with a summer maximum. Mean pH ranged from c. 4.4 in February to c. 4.2 in August. Changes in concentration of different cations were closely interlinked by cation exchange. The anion deficit, accounted for by anionic groups on the dissolved organic matter, was strongly seasonal with a summer maximum, as was optical absorbance at 320 nm. Nitrate and NH4+ were both at much smaller concentrations than in rain. Nitrate exceeded 1 mu mol l(-1) only during cold periods in winter, mainly following drought in the summer of 1995; NH4+ reached a few mu mol l(-1) only in summer. There was evidence of net retention of S by the peat in wet sites and during wet periods, and of net release of SO42- (and acidity) under dry conditions. The 1995 summer drought and ensuing dry year in 1996 had marked and persistent effects on pH, apparent ion deficit (DEF), SO42-, the divalent cations and Fe.

AB The significance of mires (peat-accumulating wetlands) is increasingly being recognised internationally because of their susceptibility to climate change and their biodiversity values. Mires are best known in the Northern Hemisphere, but numerous examples occur in the South. The objectives of this study were to characterise physicochemical conditions in a representative mire in New Zealand, and to draw comparisons with similar environments elsewhere. We measured a suite of physical, chemical and nutrient variables over two full annual cycles in mire pools in a subalpine area. Seasonal variation in and temporal coherence of several chemical variables were inconsistent among pools, and this is explained by variation in water source and pool size. For most variables, temporal variability was at least as high as spatial variability. In comparison with peat-based wetlands in northern Europe, these New Zealand sites tended to have higher pH at given concentrations of Ca. Data from mire pools in other regions, including Tasmania and other parts of New Zealand, shared the same characteristics. Inter-Hemi spheric differences in rainfall chemistry may partly account for the pH differences, but low levels of organic acids (measured as DOC) appear more likely to be responsible. The mechanisms leading to low DOC are uncertain, but could include the effects of high rainfall, and vegetation differences. All pools were confirmed as ultra-oligotrophic in winter, though summer peaks in productivity exceeded thresholds for mesotrophic conditions. As in the Northern Hemisphere, nutrient patterns were independent of the Ca/pH gradient. Despite significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity of these mire pools, their average water chemistry also differs from that typical in rivers and lakes in New Zealand. Given that mire pools are already known to support higher proportions of endemism in benthic diatoms compared to other freshwater habitats in New Zealand, we suggest they may constitute an unusual environment type on which more detailed aquatic biological studies are warranted.

AB The adsorption of As(V) and As(111) on synthetic two-line ferrihydrite in the presence and absence of a peat humic acid (HA(p)), Suwannee River fulvic acid (FA), or citric acid (CA) was investigated. Previous work with goethite has demonstrated the ability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to decrease As(V) and As(111) adsorption. The results obtained demonstrate that As(V) adsorption on ferrihydrite was decreased only in the presence of CA. Arsenate decreased the adsorption of all organic acids except HA(p). Both FA and CA reduced As(III) adsorption on ferrihydrite, while HAp had no effect. Fulvic and citric acid adsorption on ferrihydrite was decreased in the presence of As(111); however, FA and CA adsorption increased at lower pH, which was consistent with decreased As(111) adsorption. Peat humic acid did not decrease As(111) adsorption, and we believe that the adsorption process of HA(p) and As(111) and As(V) on ferrihydrite are independent of each other. Previously, we observed that As(V) adsorption on goethite decreased in the presence of HA(p) > FA > CA, while As(111) adsorption on goethite was decreased similarly to that on ferrihydrite in the presence of CA > FA approximate to HA, yet As(111) adsorption on ferrihydrite was greater than on goethite. The observed differences between this study and the earlier study on goethite are believed to be an intricate function of ferrihydrite's surface characteristics, which affect the mechanisms of adsorption and hence the affinity of organic acids such as HA(p), FA, and CA for the ferrihydrite surface. As such, the adsorption of DOCs to ferrihydrite are assumed to be less favorable and to occur with a fewer number of ligands, resulting in lower surface coverage of weaker bond strength.

AB Aims: To classify and characterize montane mires and deduce management strategies based on their current state and long-term development. Location: Kleinwalsertal, Austria. Methods: Vascular plants and bryophytes were recorded in a field study of 274 releves. Abiotic parameters (groundwater dynamics, water and soil characteristics) were measured at 35 sites. Macro-remain analyses of 42 soil profiles were used to reconstruct the long-term development of mires. Vegetation was differentiated by using conventional (Braun-Blanquet) and multivariate methods (Cluster analysis, Ordination). A combination of hydrogenetic criteria, chemical composition of peat and soil water, botanical composition of peat and current vegetation was applied to classify mire types. Results: Eight vegetation types were delimited and characterized pertaining to their ecological conditions. An acidity-alkalinity gradient was documented for the different vegetation types. Hydrological data indicated differences in human impact on mires. All transitions between soligenous, ombro-soligenous and ombrogenous mires were found along transects including shallow bogs on hilltops via base-rich fens on slopes, to transition mires at the onset and deeper bogs in the center of terraces. Analysis of short and long-term successional processes revealed that this sequence of mire types has been affected by human impacts at many locations. Thus, the discharge of base-rich subsurface water at the base of hillsides by ditches caused a) the ombrotrophication of transition mires and the expansion of secondary bog vegetation in the terraces and b) the development of straw meadows (Molinion) or wet meadows (Calthion) on the slopes at the expense of base-rich fens (Caricion davallianae). The increasing abandonment of species-rich fens is a problem for nature conservation. Conclusions: The analysis of vegetation development on various temporal scales is helpful to define restoration targets. In the study area, management should focus predominately on restoring the typical hydrology of mires and maintaining biodiversity of fen meadows by mowing or grazing.

AB This study investigates seasonal concentrations and fluxes of nitrogen (N) species under stormflow and baseflow conditions in the peat dominated Kinder River catchment, south Pennines, UK. This upland region has experienced decades of high atmospheric inorganic N deposition. Water samples were collected fortnightly over one year, in combination with high resolution stormflow sampling and discharge monitoring. The results reveal that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) constitutes similar to 54% of the estimated annual total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) flux (14.3 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1)). DON cycling in the catchment is influenced by hydrological and biological controls, with greater concentrations under summer stormflow conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DON are closely coupled, with positive correlations observed during spring, summer and autumn stormflow conditions. A low annual mean DOC: DON ratio (<25) and elevated dissolved inorganic N concentrations (up to 63 mu mol l(-1) in summer) suggest that the Kinder catchment is at an advanced stage of N saturation. This study reveals that DON is a significant component of TDN in peatland fluvial systems that receive high atmospheric inputs of inorganic N. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To determine the long-term impact of organic amendments on metal (Cd and Zn) immobilization, soil from the Campine region was amended with holm oak-derived biochar, compost, and peat, and monitored over a 3-year period. Pot experiments were conducted by mixing the amendments independently at 2% and 4% (g/g) with the soil. The mobility and solubility of metals in the treatments were assessed by means of rhizon soil moisture samplers, sequential BCR extractions, and diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT).
   Over the three-year period, the 2% biochar addition resulted in an average decrease in pore water concentration of 40% for Cd and 48% for Zn whereas the 4% addition led to an average decrease of 66% for Cd and 77% for Zn. The immobilization effect in the biochar treatments was attributed to the consistently higher pH and lower concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil. The latter may have been caused by sorption of DOC onto the surface of biochar thereby increasing its negatively charged functional groups that are able to sorb cations. On the other hand, compost and peat had the unwanted effect of significantly increasing the concentrations of Cd and Zn in the soil pore water. This was partly due to the formation of soluble organo-metallic complexes as significantly higher DOC concentrations were found in the compost and peat treatments.
   Results from the DGT measurements, after a 24 h deployment time, revealed a low resupply (R <= 0.4) of Cd and Zn from the solid phase to the soil solution in both amended and unamended soil. This suggests a case of slow metal desorption kinetics in the soil that was relatively unchanged by the presence of organic amendments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using a 50-year-old field experiment, we investigated the effects of the long-term land management practices of repeated burning and grazing on peatland vegetation and carbon dynamics (C). Plant community composition, C stocks in soils and vegetation, and C fluxes of CO2, CH4 and DOC, were measured over an 18-month period. We found that both burning and grazing reduced aboveground C stocks, and that burning reduced C stocks in the surface peat. Both burning and grazing strongly affected vegetation community composition, causing an increase in graminoids and a decrease in ericoid subshrubs and bryophytes relative to unburned and ungrazed controls; this effect was especially pronounced in burned treatments. Soil microbial properties were unaffected by grazing and showed minor responses to burning, in that the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass increased in burned relative to unburned treatments. Increases in the gross ecosystem CO2 fluxes of respiration and photosynthesis were observed in burned and grazed treatments relative to controls. Here, the greatest effects were seen in the burning treatment, where the mean increase in gross fluxes over the experimental period was greater than 40%. Increases in gross CO2 fluxes were greatest during the summer months, suggesting an interactive effect of land use and climate on ecosystem C cycling. Collectively, our results indicate that long-term management of peatland has marked effects on ecosystem C dynamics and CO2 flux, which are primarily related to changes in vegetation community structure.

AB Compost produced from biological treatment of organic waste has a potential for substituting peat in growth media preparation. The life-cycle-inventories (LCIs) of the two alternatives were compared using LCA-modelling (EASEWASTE) considering a 100-year period and a volumetric substitution ratio of 1:1. For the compost alternative, the composting process, growth media use, and offsetting of mineral fertilizers were considered. For the peat alternative, peatland preparation, excavation, transportation, and growth media use were considered. It was assumed that for compost 14% of the initial carbon was left in the soil after 100 years, while all carbon in peat was mineralized. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, the former is considered a saving, while the later is considered an emission, because peat in a peatland is considered stored biogenic carbon. The leaching during the growth media use was assessed by means of batch leaching tests involving 4 compost samples and 7 peat samples. The compost leached 3-20 times more heavy metals and other compounds than the peat. The life-cycle-assessment showed that compost performs better regarding global warming (savings in the range of 70-150 kg CO(2)-eq. Mg(-1)) and nutrient enrichment (savings in the range of 1.7-6.8 kg NO(3) Mg(-1) compost), while peat performs better in some toxic categories, because of the lower content of heavy metals.

AB The effects of increased tropospheric ozone (O-3) pollution levels on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands, and their underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, We exposed peatland mesocosms from a temperate wet heath dominated by the sedge Schoenus nigricans and Sphagnum papillosum to four O-3 treatments in open-top chambers for 2.5 years, to investigate the O-3 impacts on CH4 emissions and the processes that underpin these responses. Summer CH4 emissions, were significantly reduced, by 27% over the experiment, due to summer daytime (8 h day(-1)) O-3 exposure to non-filtered air (NFA) plus 35 ppb O-3, but were not significantly affected by year-round, 24h day(-1), exposure to NFA plus 10 ppb or NFA plus 25 ppb O-3. There was no evidence that the reduced CH4 emissions in response to elevated summer O-3 exposure were caused by reduced plant-derived carbon availability below-ground, because we found no significant effect of high summer O-3 exposure on root biomass, pore water dissolved organic carbon concentrations or the contribution of recent photosynthate to CH4 emissions. Our CH4 production potential and CH4 oxidation potential measurements in the different O-3 treatments could also not explain the observed CH4 emission responses to O-3. However, pore water ammonium concentrations at 20 cm depth were consistently reduced during the experiment by elevated summer O-3 exposure, and strong positive correlations were observed between CH4 emission and pore water ammonium concentration at three peat depths over the 2.5-year study. Our results therefore imply that elevated regional O-3 exposures in summer, but not the small increases in northern hemisphere annual mean background O-3 concentrations predicted over this century, may lead to reduced CH4 emissions from temperate peatlands as a consequence of reductions in soil inorganic nitrogen affecting methanogenic and/or methanotrophic activity.

AB Northern peatlands store ca. 1/3 of the world's soil organic carbon and this is attributed to low decomposition rates as a result of waterlogged, anaerobic conditions and high levels of phenolic substances. Climate change models predict both an increase in summer droughts and increased rainfall, depending on region, but information on the effect of these changes on the microbial population that mediate phenolic degradation is sparse. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGGE) was therefore used to assess the effect of simulated summer drought and increased rainfall on the diversity of phenolic degrading bacteria in a northern peatland using the gene XylE, encoding for the enzyme Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), as an indicator. Under simulated drought, a greater diversity (129.4%, P < 0.05) and abundance of phenolic catabolising bacterial species was found. Concurrent increased total phenol oxidase activities (83.3%) and beta-glucosidase activities (157.6%, P < 0.01) were found with consistently lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, DOC and increased CO2 fluxes. This increased mineralisation is likely to lower carbon storage capacity and increase climate forcing. Conversely, the increased rainfall simulation suppressed diversity (62.2%, P < 0.05), abundance and phenol oxidase activities (103.3%, P < 0.001), giving increased phenolic compound (424.8%, P < 0.1 only) and DOC concentrations (201.3%, P < 0.001), along with increased anaerobic trace gas fluxes. These hugely increased aquatic carbon concentrations available for export are of serious concern due to their deleterious effect on drinking water quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The transport and fate of mercury (Hg) was studied in two forest wetlands; a riparian peatland and an abandoned beaver meadow. The proportion of total mercury (THg) that was methyl mercury (% MeHg) increased from 2% to 6% from the upland inlets to the outlet of the wetlands. During the growing season, MeHg concentrations were approximately three times higher (0.27 ng/L) than values during the non-growing season (0.10 ng/L). Transport of Hg species was facilitated by DOC production as indicated by significant positive relations with THg and MeHg. Elevated concentrations of MeHg and % MeHg (as high as 70%) were found in pore waters of the riparian and beaver meadow wetlands. Groundwater interaction with the stream was limited at the riparian peatland due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the peat. The annual fluxes of THg and MeHg at the outlet of the watershed were 2.3 and 0.092 mu g/m(2) year respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis have been found to slow-down in water saturated peat soils with accumulation of metabolic end-products, i.e. dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4), due to a lack of solute and gas transport. So far it is not well understood how solute and gas transport may control this effect. We conducted a column experiment with homogenized ombrotrophic peat over a period of 300 days at 20 A degrees C. We specifically evaluated the effects of diffusive flux as control, downward advective water flux, intensified ebullition by conduit gas transport and diffusive oxygen supply on controlling anaerobic decomposition rates and carbon (C) turnover. To simulate advective flux, water and solutes were recirculated downward through the column after stripping of dissolved gases. We analyzed DIC and CH4 concentrations, production rates and fluxes, gas filled porosity, oxygen profiles (O-2) and microbial C biomass over time. DIC residence time thereby served as proxy to characterize transport. A slowdown of anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis evolved with the accumulation of the end-products DIC and CH4 and set in after 150 days. This slow-down was accompanied by a decrease in the distribution of microbial biomass C with depths. Anaerobic DIC and CH4 production rates were fastest close to the water table and sharply slowed with depth. Accumulation of DIC and CH4 in the homogeneous peat material throughout the column decreased decomposition constants from about 10(-5) near the surface to 10(-9) year(-1) deeper in the profile. Advective water transport extended the zone of active methanogenesis compared to a diffusive system; experimental enhancement of ebullition had little or no effect as well as strictly anoxic conditions. DIC residence time was negatively correlated to anaerobic respiration suggesting this parameter to be a predictor of anaerobic peat decomposition in peatlands. Overall, this study suggests that burial of peat and accumulation of metabolic end-products effectively slows decomposition and that this effect needs to be considered to explain peat accumulation and the response of peat mineralization rates to changes in environmental conditions.

AB Peatland soils are estimated to store a third of all terrestrial carbon stocks and are very sensitive to climate change. In these systems, one group of soil mesofauna, enchytraeid worms (Annelida, Oligochaeta), represent up to 70% of total soil fauna biomass and previous studies have highlighted their potential use as 'biological indicators' for functionally important changes in the C cycle.
   To examine the link between temperature, enchytraeids and carbon fluxes we performed a microcosm experiment in which we assessed the influence of temperature on enchytraeid populations and soil CO2 and DOC release from a Galician peatland soil over 90 days. Additionally, to unravel the potential underlying mechanisms responsible for DOC production, we also tested the effects of increasing temperatures and enchytraeid activities on the presence of organic chelating metals (iron and aluminium) and hydrogen ions (i.e. acidity) in the soil solution.
   Enchytraeid population numbers and biomass increased over time at both temperature treatments (14 and 19 degrees C), with the greatest increase produced at the highest temperature (to over five and seven times higher initial values, respectively, by day 88). Results also showed that, under warmer conditions, enchytraeid activities increased both CO2 fluxes and DOC release by twofold (Q(10) values of 3.9 and 3.6, respectively).
   The combined effect of temperature and enchytraeids promoted the breakdown of organic substances and consequently, more DOC and iron were leached. An important decline in H+ release was observed when enchytraeids were present and possibly eliminating one of the critical mechanisms restricting DOC release. These leachate pH values were also responsible for aluminium immobilisation and hence for its insignificant role in the export of DOC from the peat soil.
   We conclude that temperature change alone does not explain all the observed increases in soil respiration and DOC production but rather soil invertebrate responses to warming are crucial in controlling C fluxes in peatland soils. This is the result of temperature induced changes of enchytraeid populations and activities which have the potential of speeding up the decomposition of organic matter and altering soil aeration, metal mobilization and acidity of the soil solution, with important implications for the global carbon cycle.
   There is an urgent need for incorporating the response of soil biology in climate change modelling to make better predictions of future changes in terrestrial carbon pools.

TI North American approach to the restoration of Sphagnum dominated
   peatlands

DE bog; ecological engineering; mire; peat moss; rehabilitation;
   revegetation; technique
AB Sphagnum dominated peatlands do not rehabilitate well after being cutover (mined) for peat and some action needs to be taken in order to restore these sites within a human generation. Peatland restoration is recent and has seen significant advances in the 1990s. A new approach addressing the North American context has been developed and is presented in this paper. The short-term goal of this approach is to establish a plant cover composed of peat bog species and to restore a water regime characteristic of peatland ecosystems. The long-term objective is to return the cutover areas to functional peat accumulating ecosystems. The approach developed for peatland restoration in North America involves the following steps: 1) field preparation, 2) diaspore collection, 3) diaspore introduction, 4) diaspore protection, and 5) fertilization. Field preparation aims at providing suitable hydrological conditions for diaspores through creation of microtopography and water retention basins, re-shaping cutover fields and blocking ditches. It is site specific because it depends largely on local conditions. The second step is the collection of the top 10 centimetres of the living vegetation in a natural bog as a source of diaspores. It is recommended to use a ratio of surface collected to surface restored between 1: 10 and 1: 15 in order to minimize the impact on natural bogs and to insure rapid plant establishment in less than four years. Diaspores are then spread as a thin layer on the bare peat surfaces to be restored. It has been demonstrated that too scant or too thick a layer decreases plant establishment success. Diaspores are then covered by a straw mulch applied at a rate of 3 000 kg ha(-1) which provides improved water availability and temperature conditions. Finally, phosphorus fertilization favours more rapid substrate colonization by vascular plants, which have been shown to help stabilize the bare peat surface and act as nurse plants to the Sphagnum mosses.

AB To gain insight into the effects of drying and rewetting events on anaerobic respiration in ombrotrophic peat soils, we investigated bacterial sulfate (SO4) reduction and methane (CH4) production in anaerobic incubations of intact peat microcores from 30 to 40 cm depth of Met Bleue bog, Ontario/Canada. Concentrations of dissolved SO4, carbon dioxide (CO2), CH4, acetate, and hydrogen (H-2) were recorded and net turnover rates calculated from regression. Gross rates of bacterial sulfate reduction were determined by (SO4)-S-35 tracer incubation. After incubation, the peat was dried and rewetted, with saturated peat serving as control. CO2 production was initially rapid (up to <360 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) and slowed towards an endpoint of 2-3 mmol l(-1), which was only partly related to thresholds of Gibbs free energies of the involved processes. Acetate rapidly accumulated to levels of 600-800 mu mol l(-1) and remained constant thereafter. CH4 production (0-2.8 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) was small and delayed, even after SO4 was depleted, by about 30-40 d. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was endergonic and the process thus likely followed an acetotrophic pathway. Drying and rewetting replenished the SO4 pool, enhanced SO4 reduction rates and suppressed methanogenesis. The overall contribution of net SO4 reduction and methanogenesis to the CO2 production rate was small (0.5-22%) and only enhanced in replicates subjected to drying (35-62%). The major fraction of respiration in the incubated peat cores thus followed yet unidentified pathways. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Permafrost peatlands are biogeochemical hot spots in the Arctic as they store vast amounts of carbon. Permafrost thaw could release part of these long-term immobile carbon stocks as the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but how much, at which time-span and as which gaseous carbon species is still highly uncertain. Here we assess the effect of permafrost thaw on GHG dynamics under different moisture and vegetation scenarios in a permafrost peatland. A novel experimental approach using intact plant-soil systems (mesocosms) allowed us to simulate permafrost thaw under near-natural conditions. We monitored GHG flux dynamics via high-resolution flow-through gas measurements, combined with detailed monitoring of soil GHG concentration dynamics, yielding insights into GHG production and consumption potential of individual soil layers. Thawing the upper 10-15 cm of permafrost under dry conditions increased CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (without vegetation: 0.74 +/- 0.49 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1); with vegetation: 1.20 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.32 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1), mean +/- SD, pre- and post-thaw, respectively). Radiocarbon dating (C-14) of respired CO2, supported by an independent curve-fitting approach, showed a clear contribution (9%-27%) of old carbon to this enhanced post-thaw CO2 flux. Elevated concentrations of CO2, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon at depth indicated not just pulse emissions during the thawing process, but sustained decomposition and GHG production from thawed permafrost. Oxidation of CH4 in the peat column, however, prevented CH4 release to the atmosphere. Importantly, we show here that, under dry conditions, peatlands strengthen the permafrost-carbon feedback by adding to the atmospheric CO2 burden post-thaw. However, as long as the water table remains low, our results reveal a strong CH4 sink capacity in these types of Arctic ecosystems pre- and post-thaw, with the potential to compensate part of the permafrost CO2 losses over longer timescales.

AB C-14 is known as one of the radionuclides that have potential to be released into the biosphere from radioactive waste repositories and taken up by organisms. In this study, we used a novel approach to investigate the proportion of soil organic carbon (SOC) in invertebrates and microbial biomass. The study was conducted on a peatland site after the end of peat extraction. There was a large difference in the isotopic abundance of C-14 between the 8000-year-old peat and air. We used a two-pool isotope mixing model to reveal the fraction of soil-erived C in the organisms and in dissolved organic carbon in soil water. The contribution of soil-derived C was found to be highest in microbial biomass (61%) and earthworms (22%). Some contribution of soil-derived C was detected in fungus gnats (2%), but not in other insects or in spiders. These findings are important for developing evidence-based radioecological models based on correct understanding of the relative contributions of atmospheric C vs. SOC in organisms.

AB Two peatland micro-relief forms (microforms) - hummocks and hollows - differ by their hydrological characteristics (water table level, i.e. oxic-anoxic conditions) and vegetation communities. We studied the CH4 and CO2 production potential and the localization of methanogenic pathways in both hummocks and hollows at depths of 15, 50, 100, 150 and 200 cm in a laboratory incubation experiment. For this purpose, we measured CH4 and CO2 production rates, peat elemental composition, as well as delta C-13 values of gases and solids; the specific inhibitor of methanogenesis BES (2-bromo-ethane sulfonate, 1 mM) was aimed to preferentially block the acetoclastic pathway.
   The cumulative CH4 production of all depths was almost one fold higher in hollows than in hummocks, with no differences in CO2. With depth, CO2 and CH4 production decreased, and the relative contribution of the hydrogenotrophic pathway of methanogenesis increased. The highest methanogenic activity among all depths and both microforms was measured at 15 cm of hollows (91%) at which the highest relative contribution of acetoclastic vs. hydrogenotrophic pathway (92 and 8%, respectively) was detected. For hummocks, the CH4 production was the highest at 50 cm (82%), where relative contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis comprised 89%. The addition of 1 mM BES was not selective and inhibited both methanogenic pathways in the soil. Thus, BES was less efficient in partitioning the pathways compared with the delta C-13 signature. We conclude that the peat microforms - dry hummocks and wet hollows - play an important role for CH4 but not for CO2 production when the effects of living vegetation are excluded.

AB While iron (Fe) has been proposed to constrain dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export by forming precipitation (Fe-OC) in peatlands, uncertainties remain about the potential interactions between Fe and nitrogen. Such interactions are important for Fe and carbon exports as they can dissolve the Fe-OC through Fe reduction. Here we studied the reduction of ferrihydrite-OC (Fh-OC) following incubation with microbes from agricultural and natural peatlands under differing nitrogen availability, with high-throughput sequencing to identify microbial mechanisms. Our results showed that in agricultural peatlands, high nitrogen levels (100 mg kg(-1)) modified the composition and abundance of iron-reducing bacteria, increasing reduction rates of Fh-OC (0.09-0.20 kg Fe day(-1) ha(-1)) above the low N treatments (< 100 mg kg(-1)) (p < 0.05). However, reduction rates of Fh-OC and iron-reducing community in natural peatlands were far less affected. Our findings suggest that N-induced microbial reduction of Fe-OC may create the potential for greater Fe and carbon exports from agricultural peatlands to aquatic systems.

AB Climate change has been proposed as a driver of carbon (C) loss from the large pool of C held in soils. Aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and gaseous (soil respiration or net ecosystem CO(2) exchange) forms of C loss from soils have been considered. Under some climate change scenarios, gaseous emissions of C have been predicted to result in terrestrial ecosystems becoming a net source of C by 2050. Indeed, both forms of C loss have been linked to climate-related changes, such as warming and/or changes in precipitation. In our field-based drought manipulation experiment on an upland moorland in northeast Wales, we have carried out an annual drought treatment for 8 years, reducing levels of annual rainfall by 23% on average (1999-2007) through the use of automated roofs, which prevent rain falling on experimental plots between June and September annually. Following 5 years of repeated summer drought, there was a 26% increase in concentrations of DOC in soil water in the mineral soil in the drought plots and this further increased to 52% after 8 years. A similar pattern was not observed in the organic soil horizons. Despite higher DOC concentrations in the mineral soil horizon, decreased drainage of water from the drought-treated soils resulted in an overall decrease of 9% in total DOC export. Calculating the carbon (C) balance for the below-ground component of the ecosystem reveals that DOC represents 3% of gross C export. Previous studies at the site have demonstrated large increases in soil respiration resulting from the repeated drought treatment. By including data presented here with other C fluxes and pool measurements from the site, we demonstrate that soil carbon is accumulating by 126 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the control plots, but decreasing by 18 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the drought plots. The repeated drought treatment has thus resulted in the ecosystem switching from a net sink for C into a net source.

AB A review of headwater lakes in undisturbed watersheds on the Boreal Plain, with indirect gradient analyses of chemical data, indicated a clear separation between those in wetland-dominated watersheds (57-100% wetland with variable proportions of bog, fen, swamp, and marsh cover) and those in upland-dominated watersheds (0-44% wetland cover). In the former, percentage wetland cover in the watershed was positively correlated with total phosphorus (TP, r(2) = 0.78, primarily bog), total nitrogen (TN, r(2) = 0.50), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, r(2) = 0.74) concentrations. Rich fens appeared to sequester both TP and TN. In upland-dominated lakes, the ratio of catchment area to lake volume (CA/LV) was the strongest watershed correlate of TP concentration (r(2) = 0.56), whereas most limnetic nitrogen and DOC were generated in situ. Colour concentration, being highest in wetland lakes, was correlated with the ratio of isotopically defined effective drainage basin area to lake volume (eDBA/LV, r(2) = 0.63). Drainage basin slope was only weakly associated with water quality, likely because of low topographic relief (less than or equal to 11%). Higher Chlorophyta and Peridineae biomasses in wetland-dominated systems than in upland-dominated ones may coincide with greater NH4+ availability.

AB Much of the conifer plantation forest in Ireland is on peat soils. Plantations on this soil type are known to pose the greatest risk to degrading water quality by increased sedimentation, acidification and heavy metal accumulation. Peat soils are also known to leach phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a result of forestry operations. In moderation, such nutrient enrichment may have positive trophic impacts in oligotrophic freshwater systems such as those typical of peat catchments in western Ireland.
   In this study, the water chemistry and brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations of peat-land lakes were investigated to assess the associations of conifer plantation forest on the growth, energetics and population structure of brown trout. We conducted this study over a three-month period in the summer of 2010 by comparing brown trout populations and water chemistry in lakes with three distinct catchment land uses: (i) unplanted blanket bog, (ii) moderate levels of conifer plantation forest (30-40% of catchment afforested), and (iii) high levels of conifer plantation forest (80-90% of catchment afforested).
   Changes in hydrochemistry associated with conifer plantations resulted in elevated concentrations of N, P and DOC, but no change to pH, with increasing levels of plantation forest within the catchment. Whereas there was no consistent trend in brown trout density between land uses, highest densities were recorded in lakes with afforested catchments. Trout populations in lakes with afforested catchments were dominated by younger fish, primarily 1+ (year old) and 2+ (2 year old) individuals with some 0+ (young of the year) trout present, compared to control lakes, which were largely dominated by 2+ and 3+ (3 year old) individuals.
   Older age classes of trout had larger body sizes in lakes with high levels of plantation forest within the catchment relative to the other lakes, indicating higher empirical growth rates, likely due to the trophic enrichment effects of forestry. Brown trout specific growth models that incorporate the potential confounding influence of different temperature regimes, showed no consistent relationship between growth and forest cover over the study period. Food consumption models indicated that trout in all sites were energetically challenged during the summer when sampling took place. Discrepancies between the observed body size and estimated growth of trout in lakes may potentially be due to (a) a significant amount of growth occurring outside of the summer study period and/or (b) unusually elevated temperature regimes during the study period, particularly in the afforested sites.
   No negative impacts of conifer plantation forests on brown trout populations were recorded. However, forest managers may wish to minimise felling coupe within peatland plantations as felling operations may exacerbate nutrient and/or heavy ion input into aquatic systems in such catchments.

AB Over the past 30-40 years, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have increased in soil solutions and surface waters in many acid-sensitive areas of Europe and North America. This has been linked to recovery from acidification in response to decreasing levels of atmospheric pollution. Evidence from radiocarbon dating suggests that DOC in surface waters is typically derived from recently photosynthesised organic matter such as plant litter and exudates, yet there is little information on the pH-sensitivity of organic matter solubility, or its decomposition, in litter layers and in different organic soils. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine a) the sensitivity of DOC to acidity in different surface layers and soil types, in order to b) improve understanding of the key sources contributing to the increasing DOC trend. Such information is vital for understanding site specific characteristics contributing to inconsistencies in DOC release between catchments, and for improving predictions of carbon fluxes and budgets.
   Based on data collected at four established field pH-manipulation experiments in upland areas of the United Kingdom, we examined the sources, composition and acid-sensitivity of DOC export from the litter and organic soils. We found that litter generated nearly three times more DOC than the organic soils, consistent with radiocarbon evidence that recent plant inputs are a major source of DOC. Furthermore, litter derived DOC had lower specific ultraviolet light absorbance (SUVA) than organic soil DOC, suggesting greater biodegradability, and was not acid sensitive. In contrast, organic soil DOC concentrations were more strongly related to experimentally manipulated pH, implying that themobility of this DOC may be subject to physicochemical rather than biotic controls. Our results suggest that physicochemically mediated controls on organic matter solubility may be a key driver behind the widely observed increases in surface water DOC in areas undergoing recovery from acidification.

AB Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is highly important in humic waters of peatland regions, yet the coupling between organic and organo-mineral colloids, trace metals and bioavailability of photodegraded products is poorly known. Here we studied photo-destruction of organo-mineral colloids induced by UV-irradiation of sterile-filtered mire water. We revealed two simultaneously occurring processes of transformation of DOM and trace elements speciation: (i) disintegration of high molecular weight organo-mineral colloids into lower molecular weight (<1 kDa) DOM and metal complexes and (ii) formation of particulate (>0.22 mu m) aggregates of metals and organic matter. Over 26 days of UV-irradiation, up to 20% of dissolved organic carbon from peat waters was transformed into CO2. In addition to transformation of organic compounds, sizeable change in speciation and size fractionation of many trace metals such as Fe, Pb, Cd, Co, Zn, Cu, V, La, Ni and Cr occurred. Although short-term (1 day) UV-irradiation of mire water stimulated growth of cultivable Pseudomonas sp. bacterium, the long-term exposure (26 days) of organic substrate had a negative effect on bacterial development. Therefore, while sizeable transformation of the organic and metal colloidal load of peat water may occur over first 10 days of UV-irradiation, the enhanced bioavailability of UV-treated substrate is achieved after first day of exposure. The present study demonstrates the importance of even short-term UV-irradiation on colloidal transformation and potential bioavailability of humic waters from temperate mires and highlights the need for more detailed study of coupled metal-organic matter transformation induced by sunlight exposure of mire waters.

AB What processes control the accumulation and storage of carbon (C) in the mineral subsoil beneath peat? To find out we investigated four podzolic mineral subsoil profiles from forest and beneath peat in Lakkasuo mire in central boreal Finland. The amount of C in the mineral subsoil ranged from 3.9 to 8.1 kg m(-2) over a thickness of 70 cm and that in the organic horizons ranged from 1.8 to 144 kg m(-2) . Rates of increase of subsoil C were initially large (14 g m(-2) year(-1)) as the upland forest soil was paludified, but decreased to < 2 g m(-2) year(-1) from 150 to 3000 years. The subsoils retained extractable aluminium (Al) but lost iron (Fe) as the surrounding forest podzols were paludified beneath the peat. A stepwise, ordinary least-squares regression indicated a strong relation (R-2=0.91) between organic C concentration of 26 podzolic subsoil samples and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-extractable Fe (negative), ammonium oxalate-extractable Al (positive) and null-point concentration of dissolved organic C (DOCnp) (positive). We examined the ability of the subsoil samples to sorb dissolved organic C from a solution derived from peat. Null-point concentration of dissolved C (DOCnp) ranged from 35 to 83 mg l(-1) , and generally decreased from the upper to the lower parts of the profiles (average E, B and C horizon DOCnp concentrations of 64, 47 and 42 mg l(-1)). The DOCnp was positively correlated with percentage of soil C and silt and clay content. The concentration of dissolved organic C in pore water in the peat ranged from 12 to 60 mg l(-1) (average 33 mg l(-1)), suggesting that the sorptive capacity of the subsoil horizons for C had been exhausted. We suggest that the increase of C contents in the subsoil beneath mires is related to adsorption of dissolved organic C and slow mineralization under anaerobic conditions.

AB Thermokarst ponds are widespread in arctic and subarctic regions, but little is known about their temporal evolution prior to human observations. This paper presents a pioneer biostratigraphic study conducted at a subarctic site with limnologically contrasted ponds located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, Canada. Fossil diatom and visible near infrared (VNIR) derivative spectral analyses were performed on short sediment cores, confirming the occurrence of three distinct stratigraphic facies as already inferred from an anterior sedimentological study: a lacustrine upper facies (UF) and a marine lower facies (LF), separated by an organic-rich/peat transitional zone (TZ). Diatoms were almost absent from LF, but increased significantly in both TZ and UF. Identified diatom taxa were mainly benthic species (e.g. genera Fragilaria, Pinnularia), and their down-core distribution appeared to be related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and possibly pH conditions. Diatom-inferred DOC showed a decreasing trend towards the surface (potentially associated with an increase in pH), inverse to the general trend in this region, suggesting the action of other mechanisms on DOC, such as exhaustion of external inputs from limited catchments and the role of discontinuous peat layers (former surfaces of permafrost mounds) during the initial stages of pond formation. These bryophilous substrates in aerophilic habitats probably controlled diatom community composition. The combination of diatom and VNIR data revealed similar trends between (i) opal (amorphous silica) and diatom abundances; (ii) eukaryotic/prokaryotic algae ratio and anoxia or hypoxia in bottom waters; and (iii) limonite (iron oxide) and redox conditions in surface sediments. These findings indicate that diatom community changes and pond limnological evolution in the recent past were controlled mainly by autogenic processes (e.g. local vegetation/soil development, peat accumulation and erosion), rather than by allogenic forcing mechanisms (e.g. precipitation and temperature, geochemical leaching of the surrounding glaciomarine sediments).

AB Surface and ground water was sampled in a degraded bog area 36 times during 1993-2003 at Five representative points: point E (natural area with Sphagnum as the main vegetal cover), point W (boundary between the natural and degraded areas), point W' (area installed with vinyl sheeting), point WW (area where Sasa thrives), and point NC (area with naturally formed ditches). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for parameters measured in surface water and ground water at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m depths. "Sampling point" (i.e. locations along the degradation gradient) accounted for most of the variation in surface and ground water chemistry. It accounted for 30-80% of the total variation in pH, electrical conductivity, ammonia, dissolved nitrogen, major cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon. "Year" accounted for more variation in nitrate, nitrite, chloride, and sulfate than the sampling point did, but the variation in dissolved reactive phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus concentrations was not based on any of the calculated variables.

AB When restoring ecosystems, the simple removal of stresses causing degradation may seem preferable over other more costly and time consuming approaches. However, some restoration techniques can be implemented at reasonable cost and with increased efficiency in certain cases. We examined the successional trajectories of vegetation within abandoned block-cut peatlands in a major peat-producing region of Eastern Canada to evaluate whether the use of rewetting as a restoration technique can assist in the recovery of a typical bog plant community dominated by Sphagnum compared to spontaneous recolonization alone. We surveyed a total of 55 trenches in 6 peatlands twice, similar to 25 and similar to 35 years after the cessation of peat extraction. Canonical ordinations evidenced a generalized process of afforestation during the decade studied, partially driven by agricultural drainage in the surrounding landscape. Plant communities were dominated by ericaceous shrubs that hampered the spontaneous recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system typical of bogs in the short and medium-term. Three of the six peatlands surveyed were partially restored by blocking drainage ditches. There, we surveyed plant composition in rewetted (28) and non-rewetted (26) trenches and observed that rewetting mitigated the increase in tree dominance, decreased the dominance by ericaceous shrubs, and favored the spread of non-vascular species with a wet habitat preference (notably Sphagnum species from the Cuspidata section). We conclude that the use of low intervention restoration techniques in block-cut bogs, such as the blockage of former drainage ditches, can re-orient undesired vegetation trajectories driven by spontaneous recolonization alone.

AB Permafrost peatlands are important pools of soil carbon. Soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization and its temperature sensitivity in permafrost peatlands are crucial for predictions of soil carbon-climate feedback. However, little is known about the changes in SOC mineralization and its mechanism in response to environmental change in the permafrost peatlands of Northeastern China. We collected seven permafrost peatland soils from Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeastern China to investigate how the responses of microbes and labile substrates control the mineralization of SOC in the laboratory incubation study. The results show that temperature and sampling sites affected the mineralization of SOC. Elevated temperatures significantly increased the rate of carbon mineralization across the peatland soils. The mean sensitivity of SOC mineralization to temperature (Q(10) value) was 2.96. The increase in substrate availability and microbial abundance in parallel with the increase in temperature is responsible for the high rates of decomposition of the organic carbon pools. We found that the mineralization of soil carbon positively correlated with the concentrations of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N, as well as the abundances of bacteria, fungi, methanotrophs and nirK denitrifiers. Moreover, the content of DOC positively correlated with the abundances of soil bacteria, methanotrophs and nirK denitrifiers, indicating that the influences of soil microbial abundances on carbon mineralization were strongly mediated by the availability of carbon substrates. Our findings provide novel insights into the effects of increasing temperatures on the relationship between microbial communities and labile substrates and their roles in carbon decomposition in permafrost peatlands.

AB Recent accelerated decay of discontinuous permafrost at the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden has been attributed to increased temperature and snow depth, and has caused expansion of wet minerotrophic areas leading to significant changes in carbon cycling in the mire. In order to track these changes through time and evaluate potential forcing mechanisms, this paper analyses a peat succession and a lake sediment sequence from within the mire, providing a record for the last 100 years, and compares these with monitored climate and active layer thickness data. The peat core was analysed for testate amoebae to reconstruct changes in peatland surface moisture conditions and water table fluctuations. The lake sediment core was analysed by near infrared spectroscopy to infer changes in the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the lake-water, and changes in delta C-13 and C, N and delta N-15 to track changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool and the influence of diagenetic effects on sediment organic matter, respectively. Results showed that major shifts towards increased peat surface moisture and TOC concentration of the lake-water occurred around 1980, one to two decades earlier than a temperature driven increase in active layer thickness. Comparison with monitored temperature and precipitation from a nearby climate station indicates that this change in peat surface moisture is related to June-September (JJAS) precipitation and that the increase in lake-water TOC concentration reflects an increase in total annual precipitation. A significant depletion in C-13 of sediment organic matter in the early 1980s probably reflects the effect of a single or a few consecutive years with anomalously high summer precipitation, resulting in elevated DIC content of the lake water, predominantly originating from increased export and subsequent respiration of organic carbon from the mire. Based on these results, it was not possible to link proxy data obtained on peat and lake-sediment records directly to permafrost decay. Instead our data indicate that increased precipitation and anomalously high rainfall during summers had a significant impact on the mire and the adjacent lake ecosystem. We therefore propose that effects of increased precipitation should be considered when evaluating potential forcing mechanisms of recent changes in carbon cycling in the subarctic.

AB Moorland carbon reserves in organo-mineral soils may be crucial to predicting landscape-scale variability in soil carbon losses, an important component of which is dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Surface water DOC trends are subject to a range of scaling, transport and biotic processes that disconnect them from signals in the catchment's soils. Long-term soil datasets are vital to identify changes in DOC release at source and soil C depletion. Here we show, that moorland soil solution DOC concentrations at three key UK Environmental Change Network sites increased between 1993-2007 in both surface-and sub-soil of a freely-draining Podzol (48% and 215% increases in O and Bs horizons, respectively), declined in a gleyed Podzol and showed no change in a Peat. Our principal findings were that: (1) considerable heterogeneity in DOC response appears to exist between different soils that is not apparent from the more consistent observed trends for streamwaters, and (2) freely-draining organo-mineral Podzol showed increasing DOC concentrations, countering the current scientific focus on soil C destabilization in peats. We discuss how the key solubility controls on DOC associated with coupled physico-chemical factors of ionic strength, acid deposition recovery, soil hydrology and temperature cannot readily be separated. Yet, despite evidence that all sites are recovering from acidification the soil-specific responses to environmental change have caused divergence in soil DOC concentration trends. The study shows that the properties of soils govern their specific response to an approximately common set of broad environmental drivers. Key soil properties are indicated to be drainage, sulphate and DOC sorption capacity. Soil properties need representation in process-models to understand and predict the role of soils in catchment to global C budgets. Catchment hydrological (i.e. transport) controls may, at present, be governing the more ubiquitous rises in river DOC concentration trends, but soil (i.e. source) controls provide the key to prediction of future C loss to waters and the atmosphere.

AB The composition of organic matter in the conjugated series of natural water (soil, bog, creek, and lake water) has been considered. The composition of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids and humic substances has been determined. Humic substances have been found to account for the major portion of dissolved organic carbon (from 28 in lake water to 57% in bog water with weight-averaged molecular masses of the order of 1 kDa); and the amounts of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, to account for 2% of the total concentration of carbon of water-soluble organic compounds. Transformation of dissolved organic matter have been shown to take place in the series of the examined water: the composition and its characteristics have been shown to change; and the share of the fraction with molecular mass <1 kDa, to increase because of photo- and biodegradation of high-molecular organic compounds.

AB Knowledge about dissolved oxygen (DO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) distribution in lakes has increased considerably over the last decades. However, studies about high resolution dynamics of dissolved CO2 in different types of lakes over daily or weekly time scales are still very scarce. We measured summertime vertical DO and CO2 profiles at sub-hourly intervals during one week in eight Estonian lakes representing different lake types according to European Water Framework Directive. The lakes showed considerable differences in thermal stratification and vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen and CO2 as well as different diurnal dynamics over the measurement period. We observed a continuous CO2 supersaturation in the upper mixed layer of the alkalitrophic (calcareous groundwaterfed) lake and the dark soft-water lake showing them as CO2 emitting "chimneys" although with different underlying mechanisms. In three lake types strong undersaturation with CO2 occurred in the surface layer characterising them as CO2 sinks for the measurement period while in another three types the surface layer CO2 was mostly in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Factor analysis showed that DO% in the surface layer and the strength of its relationship with CO2% were positively related to alkalinity and negatively to trophic state and DOC gradients, whereas deeper lakes were characterised by higher surface concentration but smaller spatial and temporal variability of CO2. Multiple regression analysis revealed lake area, maximum depth and the light attenuation coefficient as variables affecting the largest number of gas regime indicators. We conclude that the trophic status of lakes in combination with type specific features such as morphometry, alkalinity and colour (DOC) determines the distribution and dynamics of dissolved CO2 and DO, which therefore may indicate functional differences in carbon cycling among lakes.

AB Small blanket bog lakes can contain many rare and threatened aquatic invertebrate species. Their conservation value, however, is threatened throughout Europe by peat extraction and particularly conifer afforestation, which can compromise the physico-chemical habitat quality of peatland lakes through excessive inputs of forestry-derived dissolved and particulate substances. To quantify the effect of conifer plantation forestry on the conservation value of these habitats, we compared the hydrochemistry and assemblages of aquatic Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Odonata of replicate lakes across three distinct catchment land uses: (i) unplanted blanket bog only present in the catchment, (ii) mature conifer plantation forests only present in the catchment and (iii) catchments containing mature conifer plantation forests with recently clearfelled areas. All three catchment land uses were replicated across regions of sedimentary and igneous geology. Lakes with afforested catchments, in both geologies, had elevated concentrations of plant nutrients, total dissolved organic carbon and heavy metals, the highest concentrations being recorded from the clearfell lakes. Coleoptera and Heteroptera assemblages responded strongly to forestry-mediated changes in water chemistry, whereas Odonata assemblages responded more to catchment geology - geology being confounded by altitudinal differences between lakes. The greatest species-quality scores (SQSs) and species richness were recorded from the clearfell lakes. Three of the four International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) nationally red-listed species recorded during this study were, however, absent from clearfell lakes. Our findings demonstrate that plantation forestry can have a profound impact on the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and conservation value of small blanket bog lakes, primarily via eutrophication. Despite indices such as SQS scores and species richness appearing to reveal a beneficial response of blanket bog lake communities to habitat deterioration, they mask that certain 'emblematic' species are being severely negatively impacted by the disturbance caused by plantation forestry. Considering the need for fertiliser to produce economically viable plantation forest crops, coupled with the inefficiencies of peat soils in retaining applied nutrients, the degradation of peatland lakes is likely to become more prevalent as plantation forestry continues to expand worldwide.

AB This study examines the relationship between wetlands hidden beneath the forest canopy ('cryptic wetlands') and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export to streams and lakes in forested ecosystems. In the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW), located in the Algoma Highlands of central Ontario, Canada, there is substantial natural variation in average annual DOC export (kgC ha(-1) year(-1)),ranging from 11.4 to 31.5 kgC ha(-1) year(-1) in catchments with no apparent wetlands. We hypothesized that the natural variation in DOC export was related to cryptic wetlands. Cryptic wetlands were derived manually from geographic coordinates that were surveyed with a differential global positioning system, and automatically from identification of topographic depressions and flat slopes (<1.5degrees) within a digital elevation model (DEM) in a geographic information system. For the TLW catchments, which are characterized by shallow soils over bedrock, a significant correlation (r(2) greater than or equal to 0-9, p < 0.001) between manual and automated methods was observed for scales up to 50 in when a light detection and ranging DEM was used for the topographic analysis. Regression models indicated that cryptic wetlands (%) explained the majority of the natural variation in DOC export (kgC ha(-1) year(-1)), with r(2) = 0.88 (p < 0.001) for the model based on the manually derived wetlands and r(2) = 0.85 (p < 0.001) for the model based on the automatically derived wetlands. The strength and significance of the automatically derived wetlands (%) versus DOC export (kgC ha(-1) year(-1)) regression model diminished when other sources of DEMs were used. This study emphasizes the importance of including cryptic wetlands in predictive models of DOC export, particularly in catchments where the topography includes depressions and flat areas but no apparent wetlands.

AB The combined autecology of individual species is expected to reflect the synecology of their respective functional groups and vice versa, but this assumption has been rarely assessed. We estimated this similarity in limiting ecological filters using vegetation survey data from 64 abandoned extracted peatlands in Estonia, which form a 50-year chronosequence of secondary succession. Partial overlap was found between filters predicting the occurrence of individual core species and richness in their respective functional groups. These overlapping filters were microtopographical form (flats, margins, ditches), time since abandonment, and various properties of peat. At the functional group level, time since abandonment and habitat properties showed clear interactions with microform type. Bog species and acidophilous bilocals successfully established on flats and ditch margins when residual peat was acidic and poorly decayed, while species of fens and mineral soils preferentially established in ditches of large extraction fields, where residual peat had higher pH and higher mineral content. We also detected some effects of landscape-level (patch area and forest neighbourhood) and regional filters (continentality); however, their limiting role was inconsistent. Many ecological filters also were shared between functional groups at the species level, but the optimal levels of these filters differed between groups. We conclude that even in species-poor habitats, both the autecology of individual species and the synecology of functional groups should be considered during habitat restoration. In peatland restoration, the following management strategies are advised to direct a faster and more successful trajectory: controlling the depth of peat extraction, partial filling of ditches, introducing plant propagules and managing mineral dust pollution.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in freshwater biogeochemistry. To investigate the influence of catchment character on the quality and quantity of DOM in freshwaters, 45 sampling sites draining subcatchments of contrasting soil type, hydrology, and land cover within one large upland-dominated and one large lowland-dominated catchment were sampled over a 1-yr period. Dominant land cover in each subcatchment included: arable and horticultural, blanket peatland, coniferous woodland, and improved, unimproved, acid, and calcareous grasslands. The composition of the C, N, and P pool was determined as a function of the inorganic nutrient species (NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, and PO43-) and dissolved organic nutrient (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], and dissolved organic phosphorus [DOP]) concentrations. DOM quality was assessed by calculation of the molar DOC : DON and DOC : DOP ratios and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)). In catchments with little anthropogenic nutrient inputs, DON and DOP typically composed > 80% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentrations. By contrast, in heavily impacted agricultural catchments DON and DOP typically comprised 5-15% of TDN and 10-25% of TDP concentrations. Significant differences in DOC : DON and DOC : DOP ratios were observed between land cover class with significant correlations observed between both the DOC : DON and DOC : DOP molar ratios and SUVA(254) (r(s) = 0.88 and 0.84, respectively). Analysis also demonstrated a significant correlation between soil C : N ratio and instream DOC : DON/DOP (r(s) = 0.79 and 0.71, respectively). We infer from this that soil properties, specifically the C : N ratio of the soil organic matter pool, has a significant influence on the composition of DOM in streams draining through these landscapes.

AB Determining the temperature sensitivity of terrestrial carbon (C) stores is an urgent priority for predicting future climate feedbacks. A key aspect to solve this long-standing research gap is to determine whether warmer temperatures will increase autotrophic activities leading to greater C storage or promote heterotrophic activities that will drive these systems to become C sources. We experimentally addressed this critical question by subjecting intact plant-soil systems in a UK upland ecosystem to simulated climate warming under natural field conditions. We report the results of a 13-year field-based climate manipulation experiment combining in situ respiration measurements with radiocarbon (C-14) analyses of respired CO2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil and the tissue contents of the dominant soil fauna (enchytraeids). We found that warming during the growing season produced the largely expected increases in ecosystem respiration (63%) and leaching of DOC (19%) with no evidence for thermal acclimation or substrate exhaustion over the whole 13-year experimental period. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence to support an increased release of old soil C after more than a decade of simulated climatic change, and indeed, C-14 analyses indicated that warming caused a significant shift towards mineralisation of more recent plant-derived C inputs. Further support came from the radiocarbon analyses of the enchytraeid tissues, which showed a greater assimilation of the more recent (plant-derived) C sources following warming. Therefore, in contrast to subarctic ecosystems, our results suggest that changes in C storage in this UK upland soil are strongly coupled to plant activities and that increasing temperatures will drive the turnover of organic material fixed only within recent years, without resulting in the loss of existing old carbon stores.

AB This study examines the effects of natural solar radiation on the metal-binding capacity of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Newington Bog water (35.5 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) was irradiated for 20 days under UV-B lamps in the laboratory and under natural solar radiation. In the presence of irradiated DOM, IC50 (contaminant concentration required to reduce algal growth by 50%) was significantly decreased with UV-B treatment for four metals: Pb, 64%; Cu, 63%; Ni, 35% and Cd, 40%. Solar radiation also significantly decreased IC50 of Pb (58%) and Cu (49%), DOC concentration (11%), DOM fluorescence (DOMFL, 33%) and DOG specific UV absorbance. Further experiments on Raisin River water (20.7 mg DOC L-1) exposed to 20 days of artificial UV-A and UV-B radiation produced significant decreases in IC50 for Cu (48%) with UV-A and for Pb (43%) with UV-B. DOC concentration was decreased 20% by UV-B and 24% by UV-A. DOMFL decreased 51.5% in the first 5 days of UV-A exposure, an effect that was not observed with the UV-B treatment. The UV-A treatment decreased UV absorbance more at longer wavelengths and over a broader wavelength band than did the UV-B treatment. Change in toxicity with UV irradiation was inconsistent among the metals tested in this study, indicating that some organic metal-binding ligands were more quickly removed or altered than others. The DOM remaining after irradiation appears to be qualitatively different from the unirradiated DOM. The much greater irradiance of UV-A makes its contribution to the removal and/or alteration of DOM at least as important as the influence of higher energy UV-B.

AB Peatlands are important carbon stores and many have natural pipes (tunnels) that transport water and carbon. Pipes are often viewed as passive and slowly changing features of peatland landscapes, particularly for sites that are relatively undisturbed by land management. However, there is a lack of data on pipe morphology change over time. This paper presents the first survey of natural pipe outlets in a peatland in which morphological changes in pipe outlets through time were measured. Three surveys of natural pipe outlets between 2007 and 2010 were conducted in a 17.4?ha, relatively undisturbed, blanket-peat-covered catchment in northern England. 27 of the 91 pipe outlets mapped in the first survey had perennial discharge and these outlets were significantly larger and shallower than those from ephemerally-flowing pipes. The cross-sectional area of 85% of pipe outlets changed (increased or decreased) during the study, with 20% of pipe outlet areas changing by more than 50?cm2 (equivalent to a median 207 % change in area for this upper fifth of pipes) up to a maximum of 312?cm2 for one pipe outlet. During the study, 18 pipe outlets completely infilled, while four new ones appeared. Mean pipe outlet area increased between August 2007 and July 2009 but decreased from July 2009 to April 2010. The largest changes in pipe morphology occurred between July 2009 and April 2010, which spanned the coldest winter for 31?years in the UK. During this period there was a significant increase in the proportion of vertically-elongated pipes and a decrease in the proportion of circular pipes. Pipe outlet morphology in blanket peat catchments is shown to be dynamic and may respond relatively quickly to changes in flow or extreme events, linked to short-term changes in weather and hence potentially to longer-term changes in climate or land management.

AB Hydrological and biogeochemical processes in terrestrial watershed compartments are an important source of short- and long-term physico-chemical dynamics in Precambrian Shield headwater lakes. In this study, a residual analysis of concentration discharge models based on the composite method of stream solute flux estimation was conducted to quantify two key factors contributing to terrestrialaquatic export of sulphate (SO42-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hydronium ion (H+) and colour for ten Precambrian Shield catchments in three lake basins: (1) advective transport capacity, as influenced by variations in runoff, and (2) the terrestrial supply of mobilizable solute, as influenced by terrestrial biogeochemical cycling and associated controlling variables. Overall, annual fluxes associated with mechanism (2) were approximately equal to those associated with mechanism (1) in driving inter-annual deviations from long-term mean annual solute export. There was considerable variation in the relative contributions of these mechanisms among solutes and watersheds, and % wetland area could not explain these differences. However, mean annual terrestrial-aquatic fluxes of DOC and colour were highly correlated with % wetland area, as were inter-annual variations in mean annual flux. The corresponding relationships between H+ and % wetland area were moderate but also significant. Annual fluxes SO42- were negatively associated with wetlands but there was no relationship between inter-annual variations in mean annual SO42- flux and % wetland area. The contribution of forested wetlands to annual flux variability for DOC, colour and H+ was primarily driven by inter-annual differences in runoff and associated mobilization of large solute pools within these critical source areas of organic carbon and acidity.

AB In the article, the main results of the study of dissolved greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colloidal trace elements-metals in surface and soil waters of hollows, depressions, permafrost subsidences are considered. These waters were sampled in areas with active and stable permafrost thawing in Western Siberia. It is found that these zones of active termokarst are mainly located on the slopes and the bottoms of the upper reaches of rivers, which drain the interfluve. Active thawing of flat mound bogs leads to the appearance of numerous hollows, depressions and thermokarst subsidences, especially on the border between forest and fens. This is related to the additional heat input from the flowing water and causing the thawing deep permafrost on the edges of ridges occupied by the forest. Increase in specific conductivity (S.C.) in the smallest water bodies and supra-permafrost water is accompanied by a significant increase in concentrations of DOC, P, K, Cu, Zn, Mo and Ba. It has been found that small hollows and subsidence (<10 -100 M-2) are characterized by much higher concentrations of DOC and CO2 (p < 0.05) in comparison with large depressions and thermokarst water bodies. There is also a decrease of CH4 concentration with an increase in the size of water bodies (p < 0.05), despite the fact that the data dispersion reaches 3 orders in small (<100 -300 m(2)) water bodies of the where located zones active termokarst landscape, concentrations of DOC, CO2 and CH4 are significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the previously studied water bodies formed under conditions of a stable state of permafrost in areas of Nojabrsk and Khanymey. Waters of the active thawed of permafrost peat landscapes are usually rich in oxygen (saturation in the range of 30 <= O-2 <= 105 %) and approximately 0.5 unit's pH more acidic than areas with a stable state of permafrost. Many major and trace elements show a statistically significant decrease in concentration from very small water bodies (<10 m (2)) to larger thermokarst waters. By the results of carried out research we can say that in the landscapes with active termokarst there will be direct mobilization of soil water in the hydrological network (rivers and lakes) with a minimal transformation of the water composition within the catchment area.

AB Specific conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, carbon, phosphorous, and nitrogen species were measured at 36 stations in the Richibucto River drainage basin, including the estuary, in New Brunswick, Canada, over the six-year period 1996 through 2001. Each station was sampled between 1 and 26 times (mean = 7.5, standard deviation = 6.0) during the ice free seasons without regard to tide. There was significant variance among stations in most parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the processes explaining the observed variance in water quality. Because of the high variability in specific conductance, stations were first grouped in a freshwater subset and an estuarine (brackish water) subset. For freshwater stations, most of the variance in water quality was explained by pH and total organic carbon, as well as high nutrient concentrations. These high nutrient concentrations, along with water salinity, which varies with flow and tides, are also important in determining water quality variability in brackish water. It is recommended that water quality parameters that were found to explain most of the variance by PCA be monitored more closely, as they are key elements in understanding the variability in water quality in the Richibucto drainage basin. Cluster analyses showed that high phosphorous and nitrate concentrations were mostly found in areas of peat runoff, tributaries receiving treated municipal effluent, and lentic zones upstream of culverts. Peat runoff was also shown to be acidic, whether it is runoff from a harvested area or a natural bog.

AB We summarise the work of an interdisciplinary network set up to explore the impacts of climate change in the British Uplands. In this CR Special, the contributors present the state of knowledge and this introduction synthesises this knowledge and derives implications for decision makers. The Uplands are valued semi-natural habitats, providing ecosystem services that have historically been taken for granted. For example, peat soils, which are mostly found in the Uplands, contain around 50% of the terrestrial carbon in the UK. Land management continues to be a driver of ecosystem service delivery. Degraded and managed peatlands are subject to erosion and carbon loss with negative impacts on biodiversity, carbon storage and water quality. Climate change is already being experienced in British Uplands and is likely to exacerbate these pressures. Climate envelope models suggest as much as 50% of British Uplands and peatlands will be exposed to climate stress by the end of the 21st century under low and high emissions scenarios. However, process-based models of the response of organic soils to this climate stress do not give a consistent indication of what this will mean for soil carbon: results range from a very slight increase in uptake, through a clear decline, to a net carbon loss. Preserving existing peat stocks is an important climate mitigation strategy, even if new peat stops forming. Preserving upland vegetation cover is a key win-win management strategy that will reduce erosion and loss of soil carbon, and protect a variety of services such as the continued delivery of a high quality water resource.

AB Organic matter (OM) in streams that provide drinking water is a potential energy source for bacterial regrowth in distribution systems and a precursor for disinfection byproducts. Baseflow concentrations of OM were measured over a 3-y period in 60 streams divided evenly between water-supply regions east and west of the Hudson River (EOH or WOH) in New York State. A baseline of OM concentrations in the 2 regions was generated, and land use/cover variables were related to those baseline concentrations. Dissolved organic C (DOC), biodegradable DOC (BDOC), and particulate OM (POM) reflected regional differences in land use and point-source discharges. Three-year mean concentrations for these variables and for total organic C (TOC) were significantly lower in the WOH than in the EOH by factors of 1.5 to 2.3. Size fractionation of POM showed similarities between regions with > 70% of particles in the 0.5- to 10-mu m size class. DOC made up most of the TOC in both regions, and DOC:POC ratios ranged from 1.7 to 54.4. Stepwise multiple linear regressions revealed that agriculture and forest land uses explained most of the variation in OM concentrations in the WOH, whereas wetlands and point-source discharges, primarily associated with wastewater treatment plants, explained most of the variation in OM concentrations in the EOH. Despite the potential problems from OM for drinking water quality, OM is a natural and important component of stream ecosystems, so its total elimination from watersheds is neither advisable nor possible. Our data from watersheds in the WOH region with high percentages (> 97%) of forested land use and from small to mid-sized watersheds in the EOH with no point-source discharges provide lower limits for OM concentrations and targets for best management practices.

AB Chemical composition of water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels were investigated over three years, along two large rivers in NE Poland, with different hydrological regimes. One river was from lakeland and the second a typical lowland river with forests and high contributions of peatlands in the catchment. The study involved hydrological (specific runoff, river discharge) effects on the variability of water chemistry and DOC concentrations. Specific runoff and discharge influence on DOC level and water quality. DOC concentrations and chemical water parameters were highest in the upper part of the lowland river and lowest in the upper course of the lakeland river. A two times lower DOC concentration was observed in the river draining lakeland with high values of specific runoff than in the lowland river. In typical lowland rivers course.

AB There are large temporal and spatial variations of methane (CH4) emissions from natural wetlands. To understand temporal changes of CH4 production potential (MPP), soil samples were collected from a permanently inundated Carex lasiocarpa marsh and a summer inundated Calamagrostis angustifolia marsh over the period from June to October of 2011. MPP, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, abundance and community structure of methanogenic archaea were assessed. In the C. lasiocarpa marsh, DOC concentration, MPP and the methanogen population showed similar seasonal variations and maximal values in September. MPP and DOC in the C. angustifolia marsh exhibited seasonal variations and values peaked during August, while the methanogen population decreased with plant growth. Methanogen abundance correlated significantly (P = 0.02) with DOC only for the C. lasiocarpa marsh. During the sampling period, the dominant methanogens were the Methanosaetaceae and Zoige cluster I (ZC-I (TM)) in the C. angustifolia marsh, and Methanomicrobiales and ZC-I (TM) in the C. lasiocarpa marsh. MPP correlated significantly (P = 0.04) with DOC and methanogen population in the C. lasiocarpa marsh but only with DOC in the C. angustifolia marsh. Addition of C. lasiocarpa litter enhanced MPP more effectively than addition of C. angustifolia litter, indicating that temporal variation of substrates is controlled by litter deposition in the C. lasiocarpa marsh while living plant matter is more important in the C. angustifolia marsh. This study indicated that there was no apparent shift in the dominant types of methanogen during the growth season in the species-specific freshwater wetlands. Temporal variation of MPP is controlled by substrates and substrate-driven changes in the abundance of methanogenic archaea in the C. lasiocarpa marsh, while MPP depends only on substrate availability derived from root exudates or soil organic matter in the C. angustifolia marsh.

AB It is increasingly recognised that widespread and substantial increases in Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in remote surface, and soil, waters in recent decades are linked to declining acid deposition. Effects of rising pH and declining ionic strength on DOC solubility have been proposed as potential dominant mechanisms. However, since DOC in these systems is derived mainly from recently-fixed carbon, and since organic matter decomposition rates are considered sensitive to temperature, uncertainty persists over the extent to which other drivers that could influence DOC production. Such potential drivers include fertilisation by nitrogen (N) and global warming. We therefore ran the dynamic soil chemistry model MADOC for a range of UK soils, for which time series data are available, to consider the likely relative importance of decreased deposition of sulphate and chloride, accumulation of reactive N, and higher temperatures, on soil DOC production in different soils. Modelled patterns of DOC change generally agreed favourably with measurements collated over 1020 years, but differed markedly between sites. While the acidifying effect of sulphur deposition appeared to be the predominant control on the observed soil water DOC trends in all the soils considered other than a blanket peat, the model suggested that over the long term, the effects of nitrogen deposition on N-limited soils may have been sufficient to raise the "acid recovery DOC baseline" significantly. In contrast, reductions in non marine chloride deposition and effects of long term warming appeared to have been relatively unimportant. The suggestion that future DOC concentrations might exceed preindustrial levels as a consequence of nitrogen pollution has important implications for drinking water catchment management and the setting and pursuit of appropriate restoration targets, but findings still require validation from reliable centennial-scale proxy records, such as those being developed using palaeolimnological techniques.

AB A palaeolimnological study of the annually laminated sediment sequence of Lake Xiaolongwan, a small maar lake in northeastern China, revealed distinct diatom responses to Lateglacial and early Holocene climate change between c. 19 700 and c. 10 700 a BP. In addition to analyses of diatom assemblage composition and of the bio-volume accumulation rate of planktonic diatoms, geochemical (total nitrogen, total organic carbon) and physical (varve type and thickness) indicators were used to assess past environmental change. The diatom assemblages reveal a complex interplay between direct climate effects on the seasonal lake conditions (timing of ice cover break-up, water column mixing and thermal stratification), catchment-mediated effects on the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon and, possibly, biotic interactions between the different algal groups present in the phytoplankton of Lake Xiaolongwan (diatoms, Chrysophyceae and Dinophyceae). The most remarkable changes in the aquatic system were: (i) a sharp increase in Asterionella formosa and the collapse of Handmannia balatonis at c. 14 780 a BP, corresponding with the onset of the Bolling - Allerod interstadial; (ii) a sharp rise in Stephanodiscus minutulus at c. 12 840 a BP, marking the start of the Younger Dryas event and (iii) when the lake phytoplankton became dominated by Dinophyceae instead of diatoms at c. 11 170 a BP, after the Pre-Boreal oscillation. Two diatom assemblage zones characterize the Younger Dryas at Lake Xiaolongwan, suggesting a bipartite division of this stadial event as in several records from eastern Asia and Europe. The quasi-synchronicity of these events with the oscillations described in the North Atlantic realm demonstrates that during the Lateglacial, North Atlantic dynamics at centennial and millennial time scales had a strong control upon the climate in northeastern China.

AB Upland moors and bogs in the United Kingdom are peatlands of high nature conservation value, many designated under the European Union's Habitat Directive, with internationally important bird populations, which depend on abundant invertebrate populations when breeding. Moorland management in the United Kingdom traditionally employs controlled burning in 10-30 year rotations of heather, Calluna vulgaris, creating habitat mosaics of different species composition and physical structure. This can increase overall invertebrate biodiversity and abundance, for certain key invertebrate groups. Burning has potential negative environmental effects, including peat erosion and contamination of drinking-water supplies. Rotational cutting of vegetation is now being trialled as an alternative to burning, but its long-term effects on invertebrates are poorly understood. We surveyed invertebrates on a 16-year chronosequence of rotational cutting on an extensive area of dwarf shrub vegetation on upland peat soils in Northern England. Invertebrate Simpson diversity was greatest on intermediate-aged patches, and along edges between cut and uncut areas. Older patches, cut between 2000 and 2008, were dominated by ants (Hymenoptera-Formicidae), plant-feeding bugs (Hemiptera-Auchenorrhyncha) and parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera-Parasitica). Patches cut more recently, between 2009 and 2016, had significantly lower invertebrate abundance, and were dominated by predatory ground beetles (Coleoptera-Carabidae), ants and harvestmen (Opiliones). There were significant relationships between vegetation and invertebrate community composition under both invertebrate sampling methods. We recommend that rotational cutting is used as the primary means of management, it should be undertaken in approximately 15-20 year rotations, in irregularly shaped mosaics, to maximise the benefits to invertebrates and associated wildlife.

AB The management of the UK uplands by rotational burning and grazing is a widespread practice that aims to control the development of vegetation in order to create suitable habitats for grouse and sheep. By modifying the above ground biomass it is possible that above and/or below ground hydrological regimes may be altered. This study investigates the effect burning has on various hydrological parameters of an upland blanket bog. The study was conducted on a long-term experimental site examining different combinations of managed burning and grazing intensities. The study has found that:
   (1) Although depth to water table shows strong seasonal trends, the shallowest water tables were found on those sites that were burnt every 20 years and grazed by sheep. The deepest water tables were found on those sites that had never been burnt.
   (2) In the year following a managed burn, water tables on those sites that were burnt were significantly shallower than before the burnt.
   (3) Hydraulic conductivity, as determined by dipwell slug tests, was found to be significantly lower on those plots that were burnt every 20 years.
   (4) Runoff occurrence was recorded and occurred at a significantly greater frequency on those sites that had recently been burnt.
   (5) By using antecedent weather conditions, significant parameters were found that could be used to model runoff generation.
   This paper demonstrates how the use of managed burning in upland settings can affect various hydrological responses of the peatland.

AB The sulfur compounds of refractory organic substances (ROS) of different origin have been characterized. Total organic sulfur was determined by elemental analysis. Sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cystine were analyzed chromatographically after hydrolysis with HCl or by proteolytic digestion using enzymes.
   The results obtained from elemental analysis show that the total amount of sulfur is strongly dependent on the origin of the samples, because of different environmental factors during the formation of ROS. For naturally occurring samples isolated from soil seepage water, bog lake water and ground water the carbon-to-sulfur atomic ratios (C/S) decrease with the stage of humification, because of preferential loss of carbon. In humic acids (HA) isolated from secondary effluent the high value of the nitrogen-to-sulfur ratio (N/S) was indicative of a large amount of protein-derived nitrogen and sulfur compounds. In the solutions from acid hydrolysis the total amount of amino acid carbon related to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was generally less than 5%. Percentages of cystine related to all the amino acids detected were in the range 4 to 16%; methionine was below the detection limit for most samples. The results show that cystine is very important among the amino acids released. Enzymatic release generally resulted in smaller amounts of amino acids, indicating that these molecules are not only present in bioavailable protein-like structures.
   The data were compared with those from other approaches reported in the literature for the speciation of sulfur forms in ROS, including potentiometric titration, differential reduction methods, and spectroscopic investigations.

AB For centuries, UK peatlands have been subject to competing sectoral land use and resource demands, generally resulting in their progressive degradation. There is now considerable interest in improving their management, especially in the uplands, partly because of their extreme sensitivity to environmental change and partly because of increasing recognition of the range of ecosystem services they provide. A change in emphasis in the research agenda has been detected, shifting from what peat ecosystems are to what they do. This is linked to a paradigm shift in the attitude of governments and, more generally, in civil society, to account for the wider values of ecosystem functioning. The ecosystem approach is used here as a framework to present more integrated thinking about future peatland management. Key questions, identified for societal consideration and debate, are matched to the 12 principles of the ecosystem approach sensu the Convention on Biological Diversity. A case is made for a more functional approach to defining management objectives based on delivery of ecosystem services. A compatibility matrix is used to indicate the possibilities of simultaneous delivery of services and likely incompatibilities among services. A critique is presented of features of UK upland peat ecosystems which characterise their ecological 'status' and societal context in relation to climate-change issues. The relative importance of climate as opposed to human activities in both peat formation and subsequent development remains a tantalising question, the resolution of which is highly relevant to the maintenance of existing peat and possibilities for ecosystem restoration, given changes in the climate envelope. Setting policy priorities requires a strong interdisciplinary evidence base. It also demands greater understanding of the effects of both direct and indirect human activities, as well as climate change, on the ability of upland peat ecosystems to deliver societal benefits, which previously may have been undetected, undervalued or simply taken for granted.

AB Based on a three-year study on the prokaryotic community composition in peat bog lakes surrounded by a floating mat of Sphagnum sp. moss in the conditions of Northeast Poland (Central Europe), we verified the relationship between 20 water parameters and main Eubacteria and Archaea phyla for specific sites: the subsurface (pelagic zone), near-bottom (benthic zone), and the Sphagnum mat (ecotone zone). Abundance and composition of the main aquatic bacteria phyla (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria) and Archaea were associated with different combinations of physico-chemical parameters of water, and followed temporal variations of temperature, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), aromaticity, and water color. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that water acidity is a less significant predictor of bacterial activity; however, we have found Betaproteobacteria negatively correlated (r = -0.49, p = 0.01), while Actinobacteria positively correlated (r = 0.21, p = 0.05) to pH. This relation was the most significant in the ecotone zone. In the overall bacteria community structure Betaproteobacteria dominated (18.3%) regardless of site or season, except for winter when, at low temperatures and DOC concentrations, Actinobacteria increased to 22.9%. The Archaea fraction was uniform (11%) in seasons and sites and showed no specific preferences to physico-chemical predictors. Although the water parameters from the Sphagnum mat did not differ significantly from pelagic water, its role as a source of allochthonous organic matter is crucial for bacteria activity. The relations between peat bog lake attributes and seasonal changes in bacterial diversity demonstrated a distinct divergent pattern for each prokaryote. Obtaining results will provide support for any future evaluation of the effects of environmental variables on prokaryotic community structures in peat bog lakes.

AB Seasonally flooded, freshwater cypress-tupelo wetlands, dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distictum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (S-R) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i.e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54.8, 1.48, 0.270, and 0.0205 mg L-1, for DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher S-R and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.

AB Global warming is likely to influence the soil microorganisms and enzyme activity and alter the carbon and nitrogen balance of peatland ecosystems. To investigate the difference in sensitivities of carbon and nitrogen cycling microorganisms and enzyme activity to warming, we conducted three-year warming experiments in a boreal peatland. Our findings demonstrated that both mcrA and nirS gene abundance in shallow soil and deep soil exhibited insensitivity to warming, while shallow soil archaea 16S rRNA gene and amoA gene abundance in both shallow soil and deep soil increased under warming. Soil pmoA gene abundance of both layers, bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance in shallow soil, and nirK gene abundance in deep soil decreased due to warming. The decreases of these gene abundances would be a result of losing labile substrates because of the competitive interactions between aboveground plants and underground soil microorganisms. Experimental warming inhibited -glucosidase activity in two soil layers and invertase activity in deep soil, while it stimulated acid phosphatase activity in shallow soil. Both temperature and labile substrates regulate the responses of soil microbial abundances and enzyme activities to warming and affect the coupling relationships of carbon and nitrogen. This study provides a potential microbial mechanism controlling carbon and nitrogen cycling in peatland under climate warming.

AB Long-term impacts of drier conditions on the hydrology of northern peatlands are poorly understood. We used long-term drainage near a historic drainage ditch, separating an area from the main peatland, as an analogue for long-term drying in a northern temperate bog. The objective was to identify the impact of drier conditions on ecohydrological processes and groundwater flow patterns in an area now forested and an area that maintained a bog-like character. Groundwater flow patterns alternated between mostly downward flow and occasionally upward flow in the bog area and were mostly upward-orientated in the forested area, which suggested that there the flow pattern had shifted from bog-to fen-like conditions. Flow patterns were in agreement with changes in post-drainage hydraulic conductivities, storage capacity of the peat and water table levels. Compared to the bog, hydraulic conductivities in the forested area were one to three orders of magnitude lower in the uppermost 0.75m of peat (paired t test, p < 0.05). Bulk density had increased and the water table level was lower and more strongly fluctuating in the forested area. Our findings suggest hydraulic gradients and flow patterns have changed due to increased evapotranspiration and interception with the emergence of a tree cover. The smaller size of the now-forested area relative to the remaining bog area appeared to be important for the hydrological change. With the main Mer Bleue bog as hinterland, enhanced runoff to the drainage channel had little effect on hydrologic and vegetation patterns. In the cut-off, smaller, now forested area pervasive changes in vegetation and hydrologic processes occurred. The difference in response to local drainage raises questions about tipping points with respect to the impact of drying on peatland ecosystems that need to be addressed in future research.

AB We measured flocculation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water from a humic lake (DOC = 14.9 mg C L-1) and from an adjacent mire (DOC = 25.7 mg C L-1), in in situ enclosure experiments with different light regimes. Light stimulated the formation of organic particles in both waters, and organic particle formation was observed at all incubation depths, even in the dark controls. Production of phytoplankton biomass was negligible, and allochthonous DOC was the most important precursor of the sinking particles. 8-22% and 25-60% of the loss of DOC in lake and mire water, respectively, could be accounted for by flocculation. Depth-integrated flocculation based on the enclosure experiments was 14.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Lake-water DOC concentration and water color has been increasing during the last decade, and sediment trap studies show that gross sedimentation of organic carbon also increased. Thus flocculation of allochthonous DOC, stimulated by light, constitutes a pathway for the sequestration of carbon in lake sediments.

AB Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) modifies the light penetration into water bodies due to stronger absorbance of UV and short wavelengths of light. Therefore, in natural waters with high CDOM concentration, the spectrum of sunlight is shifted towards brown, also referred to as brownification. Here, the relation between the spectrophotometrically measured water colour (CDOM) and landscape properties is examined. These properties explained at best > 40% of the CDOM variability among the study lakes larger than 10 km(2). The key "permanent" landscape variables were lake percentage (Lake(%)) in the uppermost catchment area, and the peat land coverage (Peat(%)) of the catchment, which indeed was strongly correlated with lake elevation above the sea level. High Lake % indicated low CDOM concentration, while high Peat(%) indicated the opposite. Relative to the Peat(%) of the catchment, the CDOM concentrations were, on average, slightly higher in medium-size lakes (area 10-100 km(2)) than in large lakes (area > 100 km(2)), while relative to Lake(%) the concentrations declined more in medium-size lakes.

AB Freeze-thaw (FT) events and increasing nitrogen (N) availability may alter N turnover and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in permafrost peatlands. However, the responses of N2O emissions to different N levels and additions during FT events are far from clear. We conducted an incubation study to investigate the impacts of different N addition levels (LN: 0.07 mg N g(-1), HN: 0.14 mg N g(-1)) and N addition forms (AC: ammonium chloride, NS: sodium nitrate) on the emissions of N2O under FT and non-freeze-thaw (NFT) conditions in boreal peatlands of Northeast China. Results indicated that the FT condition significantly increased N2O emissions compared with the NFT condition and peaks occurred during thawing. Compared with AC treatments, NS treatments significantly elevated the accumulation of N2O emissions under the FT condition, exhibiting significant differences in different NS levels. N2O emissions were also positively dependent on soil NO3- concentrations to supply nitrate for denitrification. Nitrate-N addition was mainly responsible for the burst of N2O with denitrification as the main process during FT events. Therefore, these results suggest that N2O emissions potentially increase during FT events with increasing nitrate-N deposition in permafrost peatlands, which would contribute to global climate warming.

AB Even though bogs function as the most important terrestrial carbon store on Earth and play a crucial role in the conservation of highly endangered species, the area covered by peatlands is declining globally. Consequently, numerous restoration efforts within degraded bogs have been realized. In many cases, however, it is unknown whether the conservation measures have been successful.
   We used Odonata (hereafter referred to as dragonflies) as ecological indicators to evaluate the restoration success of rewetting measures in central European degraded raised bogs. Depending on their land-use history (rewetted industrial peat cuts with and without former agricultural use), two types of bog restoration were compared with rural peat cuts (control).
   Our study demonstrated that restored bogs are important habitats for dragonfly conservation. Both types of restored bogs were as diverse in overall species richness as the control plots. However, land-use history had a strong effect on restoration success. All raised-bog species of the study area were able to recolonize at least some of the nutrient-poor restored bogs. The situation was different for the nutrient-rich restored bogs. Due to the high nutrient content - caused by the former agricultural use - the characteristic dragonfly fauna of raised bogs will be unlikely to be able to recolonize in these locations in the long term. Nevertheless, the nutrient-rich restored bogs represent an important secondary habitat, especially for transition-bog species. In conclusion, the conducted restoration measures created a network of small oligo- to mesotrophic water bodies, which fosters aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in bogs.

AB [ 1] This study uses a 10-year record of precipitation, soil, and stream concentration of nutrient and carbon species from an upland peat catchment to examine whether or not changes in nutrient inputs can explain long-term increases in DOC flux from peat. The study uses time series analysis and particularly the derivation of impulse response functions to provide an alternative approach to environmental manipulations and experimental additions of nitrogen. The study shows that ( 1) the catchment has a fixed capacity for nitrogen uptake and as such nitrogen flux from the catchment is controlled by precipitation inputs; ( 2) the DOC flux from the catchment shows no relationship with precipitation inputs and flux from the peat itself continues to increase over the period; ( 3) impulse response functions suggest that high DOC concentrations suppress nutrient flux from the catchment and not the other way around; and ( 4) no significant correlation could be found between nutrient time series and the residual of the DOC concentrations after removing the effects of both temperature and changes in water table. The study can find no evidence of a link between nutrient inputs and the release of DOC from the peat profile. The DOC flux corrected for rainfall inputs and the residual time series of regression all show sharp step changes in the DOC release after severe drought.

AB We critically review recent literature on carbon storage and fluxes within natural and constructed freshwater wetlands, and specifically address concerns of readers working in applied science and engineering. Our purpose is to review and assess the distribution and conversion of carbon in the water environment, particularly within wetland systems. A key aim is to assess if wetlands are carbon sinks or sources. Carbon sequestration and fluxes in natural and constructed wetlands located around the world has been assessed. All facets of carbon (solid and gaseous forms) have been covered. We draw conclusions based on these studies. Findings indicate that wetlands can be both sources and sinks of carbon, depending on their age, operation, and the environmental boundary conditions such as location and climate. Suggestions for further research needs in the area of carbon storage in wetland sediments are outlined to facilitate the understanding of the processes of carbon storage and removal and also the factors that influence them.

AB Permafrost degradation can result in the loss of significant amounts of carbon, through release to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and/or methane and through export downstream to lakes and rivers. The fate of this carbon in lake ecosystems is poorly understood. We investigated the capacity of lake bacteria to utilize carbon from different soils from an adjacent mire. Dark bioassays were undertaken to measure the dynamics of the bioavailability and chemical character of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The soils ranged from already degraded minerotrophic fens to ombrotrophic active layer and soils from the permafrost layer. Our study shows that soil DOC was rapidly consumed by bacteria collected from lake water, particularly within the first 48 h (about 85% of the total consumed DOC). The mean DOC consumption by lake bacteria was 0.087 mg L-1 d(-1) when supplied with lake water DOC and varied between 0.382 mg L-1 d(-1) (permafrost soil) and 0.491 mg L-1 d(-1) (degraded fen soil) when supplied with terrestrial DOC. Thus, the data suggest that export of DOC from degrading permafrost mires at any stage of degradation can potentially increase rates of respiration by fourfold to sevenfold and can have pronounced effects both on receiving lake ecosystems and on the land-atmosphere carbon balance. In this study we also propose simple predictive models, incorporating weight-averaged molecular weight and specific UV absorption in combination with other simple qualitative parameters for the estimation of potential bioavailability of soil DOC in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Vegetation removal with fire can alter the thermal regime of the land surface, leading to significant changes in biogeochemistry (e.g. carbon cycling) and soil hydrology. In the UK, large expanses of carbonrich upland environments are managed to encourage increased abundance of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) by rotational burning of shrub vegetation. To date, though, there has not been any consideration of whether prescribed vegetation burning on peatlands modifies the thermal regime of the soil mass in the years after fire. In this study thermal regime was monitored across 12 burned peatland soil plots over an 18-month period, with the aim of (i) quantifying thermal dynamics between burned plots of different ages (from <2 to 15 + years post burning), and (ii) developing statistical models to determine the magnitude of thermal change caused by vegetation management. Compared to plots burned 15 + years previously, plots recently burned (<2-4 years) showed higher mean, maximum and range of soil temperatures, and lower minima. Statistical models (generalised least square regression) were developed to predict daily mean and maximum soil temperature in plots burned 15+ years prior to the study. These models were then applied to predict temperatures of plots burned 2, 4 and 7 years previously, with significant deviations from predicted temperatures illustrating the magnitude of burn management effects. Temperatures measured in soil plots burned <2 years previously showed significant statistical disturbances from model predictions, reaching +6.2 degrees C for daily mean temperatures and +19.6 degrees C for daily maxima. Soil temperatures in plots burnt 7 years previously were most similar to plots burned.15 + years ago indicating the potential for soil temperatures to recover as vegetation regrows. Our findings that prescribed peatland vegetation burning alters soil thermal regime should provide an impetus for further research to understand the consequences of thermal regime change for carbon processing and release, and hydrological processes, in these peatlands.

AB This study assesses the impact of peatland restoration on fluvial N dynamics of south Pennine headwaters (UK) using a space-for-time approach. We monitored dissolved nitrogen in catchment drainage waters at intact, bare, and early stage restoration peatland sites over a two year period (Jan 2013Dec 2014). Our study demonstrates that peatland restoration is effective in reducing dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) leaching to levels lower than, or comparable to, the intact peatland site despite the adoption of a restoration approach involving fertilizer application in the revegetation process. In comparison with the bare site, DIN leaching was similar to 92% (10.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) lower at the restored site - where vegetation cover has been recently reintroduced. Whilst restoration increased the proportional significance of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) when compared to the bare site, it was not to a level significantly different from what existed at the intact site. The results also reveal a strong positive relationship (P < 0.001) between DON and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at all the sites, suggesting similarity of source material. Nitrate decreased with increasing DOC concentrations across the sites, suggesting the influence of organic C supply on NO3- immobilisation. In all but the bare site, average DON concentration was low in winter, but high in summer, and DIN concentration exhibited a winter-high and summer-low pattern; although year-on-year variations in this seasonal pattern was observed mainly at the bare site. Overall, our study has shown that restoration/revegetation is effective in advancing ecosystem recovery of degraded peatlands. Understanding nitrogen behaviour and trajectories as peatland restoration moves beyond early phases will require long-term catchment-scale monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A strong relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulphate (SO42-) dynamics under drought conditions has been revealed from analysis of a 10-year time series (1993-2002). Soil solution from a blanket peat at 10 cm depth and stream water were collected at biweekly and weekly intervals, respectively, by the Environmental Change Network at Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve in the North Pennine uplands of Britain. DOC concentrations in soil solution and stream water were closely coupled, displaying a strong seasonal cycle with lowest concentrations in early spring and highest in late summer/early autumn. Soil solution DOC correlated strongly with seasonal variations in soil temperature at the same depth 4-weeks prior to sampling. Deviation from this relationship was seen, however, in years with significant water table drawdown (>-25 cm), such that DOC concentrations were up to 60% lower than expected. Periods of drought also resulted in the release of SO42-, because of the oxidation of inorganic/organic sulphur stored in the peat, which was accompanied by a decrease in pH and increase in ionic strength. As both pH and ionic strength are known to control the solubility of DOC, inclusion of a function to account for DOC suppression because of drought-induced acidification accounted for more of the variability of DOC in soil solution (R-2=0.81) than temperature alone (R-2=0.58). This statistical model of peat soil solution DOC at 10 cm depth was extended to reproduce 74% of the variation in stream DOC over this period. Analysis of annual budgets showed that the soil was the main source of SO42- during droughts, while atmospheric deposition was the main source in other years. Mass balance calculations also showed that most of the DOC originated from the peat. The DOC flux was also lower in the drought years of 1994 and 1995, reflecting low DOC concentrations in soil and stream water. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that lower concentrations of DOC in both soil and stream waters during drought years can be explained in terms of drought-induced acidification. As future climate change scenarios suggest an increase in the magnitude and frequency of drought events, these results imply potential for a related increase in DOC suppression by episodic acidification.

AB Surface waters associated with peatlands, supersaturated With CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, act as important pathways linking a large and potentially unstable global repository of C to the atmosphere. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms which control C release from peatland systems to the atmosphere will contribute to better management and modelling of terrestrial C pools. We used non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) CO2 sensors to continuously measure gas concentrations in a beaver pond at Mer Bleue peatland (Canada): measurements were made between July and August 2007. Concentrations of CO2 in the surface water (10 cm) reached 13 mg, C l(-1) (epCO(2) 72) and 26 mg C l(-1) (epCO(2) 133) at depth (60 cm). The study also showed large diurnal fluctuations in dissolved CO2 which ranged in amplitude from similar to 1.6 mg C l(-1) at 10 cm to similar to 0.2 mg C l(-1) at 60 cm depth. CH4 concentration and supersaturation (epCH(4)) measured using headspace analysis averaged 1-47 mg C l(-1) and 3252, respectively: diurnal cycling was also evident in CH4 concentrations. Mean estimated evasion rates of CO2 and CH4 over file summer period were 44.92 +/- 7.86 and 0.44 +/- 0.25 mu g C m(-2)s(-1), respectively. Open water at Mer Bleue is a significant summer hotspot for greenhouse gas emissions within the catchment. Our results suggest that CO2 concentrations during the Summer in beaver ponds at Mer Bleue are strongly influenced by biological processes within the water column involving aquatic plants and algae (in situ photosynthesis and respiration). In terms of carbon cycling soil-stream connectivity at this time of, Year is therefore relatively weak. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil porewaters are a vital component of the ecosystem as they are efficient tracers of mineralweathering, plant litter leaching, and nutrient uptake by vegetation. In the permafrost environment, maximal hydraulic connectivity and element transport from soils to rivers and lakes occurs via supra-permafrost flow (i.e. water, gases, suspended matter, and solutes migration over the permafrost table). To assess possible consequences of permafrost thaw and climate warming on carbon and Green House gases (GHG) dynamics we used a "substituting space for time" approach in the largest frozen peatland of theworld. We sampled stagnant supra-permafrost (active layer) waters in peat columns of western Siberia Lowland (WSL) across substantial gradients of climate (-4.0 to -9.1 degrees C mean annual temperature, 360 to 600 mm annual precipitation), active layer thickness (ALT) (N300 to 40 cm), and permafrost coverage (sporadic, discontinuous and continuous). Weanalyzed CO2, CH4, dissolved carbon, and major and trace elements (TE) in 93 soil pit samples corresponding to several typical micro landscapes constituting theWSL territory (peat mounds, hollows, and permafrost subsidences and depressions). We expected a decrease in intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from soil and vegetation litter to the suprapermafrost waterwith increasing permafrost coverage, decreasing annual temperature and ALT along a latitudinal transect from 62.3 degrees N to 67.4 degrees N. However, a number of solutes (DOC, CO2, alkaline earth metals, Si, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates, and micronutrients (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, V, Mo) exhibited a northward increasing trend with highest concentrations within the continuous permafrost zone. Within the "substituting space for time" climate change scenario and northward shift of the permafrost boundary, our results suggest that CO2, DOC, and many major and trace elements will decrease their concentration in soil supra-permafrost waters at the boundary between thaw and frozen layers. As a result, export of DOC and elements from peat soil to lakes and rivers of the WSL (and further to the Arctic Ocean) may decrease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by hydroelectric reservoirs have shown until now that the fate of carbon, following impoundment, seems to reach the fate of carbon in natural aquatic ecosystems after a decade or so. To adequately assess this assumption and then obtain the net GHG emissions from the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric reservoir, the carbon stock and GHG emissions from peatlands and different succession stages of forested areas need to be characterized prior to the reservoir impoundment. It is therefore important to characterize the carbon flow process (surface fluxes and sequestrated carbon) from these terrestrial systems prior to impoundment. The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada, Quebec region, has developed an approach for mapping wetlands using Landsat/RADARSAT-1 satellite images. The method is based on image segmentation using the Definiens Professional software. The top-down object-based classification is based on the Canadian Wetland Classification System and quickly and precisely identifies ecologically meaningful wetland polygons. The main objective of this study is to produce a wetland map of the Eastmain River watershed using a SPOT-4 image aimed at identifying five classes of wetlands (bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water) for a geographical unit of at least 1 ha, and to add to the peatland classes a description of their components, such as pool complexes and vegetation structures, to assign measured carbon values to these different peatland classes and scale up the data to obtain a regional carbon budget. The second objective of the study consists in determining whether SPOT-4 images can be used to map wetlands, using the object-based method developed with Landsat/RADARSAT-1 images, and if a finer spatial resolution would improve the wetland mapping results by adding information on wetland components. The SPOT-4 classification using the object-based method allowed the five main wetland classes to be identified in addition to pool complexes in three density classes (isolated, low density, and high density) and "bogs"/"fens" vegetation structure (treed or open) in peatland classes. Validation was done at two levels: (i) between the five classes of wetlands, and (ii) between pool complexes and vegetation structures. The overall accuracy was 81% for the first level and 75% for the second.

AB Peat bog pools are rare and fragmented in the Western Balkans. Thus, aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity and the implications for microhabitat loss in these ecosystems are poorly known. Aquatic oligochaetes, widely used as indicators, were sampled using a benthos net in the largest and oldest Croatian bog, in four main water body types: a pond, a deep pool, a shallow pool and a ditch. As these microhabitats lack spatial replication both in the studied bog and in the region, we applied a nested study design with replicates sampled over time. We found a species-rich aquatic oligochaete fauna, with 11 taxa recorded. Oligochaete communities were strongly affected by vegetation complexity and the morphology of bog water bodies, namely, their size and depth. As revealed by generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), taxon richness and abundance were significantly higher in the ditch than in other water body types. This could be attributed to the vegetation complexity, supporting many different niches and providing allochthonous food supplies for oligochaetes. The various bog pools contribute to regional biodiversity and promote distinct patterns in the spatial distribution of oligochaetes. However, the predominance of ubiquitous oligochaetes, with high taxon richness, might indicate the degradation of the studied peat bog. This was further confirmed by the spread of vascular plants to the bog area and higher pH water values. All these warning signals suggest that hydro-ecological conditions should be urgently improved in order to preserve communities in the bog studied.

AB Although measured rates of biological degradation of DOC are typically low under dark conditions, it is assumed that water samples must be analysed soon after collection to provide an accurate measure of DOC concentration and UV-visible absorbance. To examine the impact of storage on DOC quality and quantity, we took water samples from an ombrotrophic peatland, and stored them in the dark at 4 degrees C for 138-1082 days. A median of 29% of DOC was lost during storage, but losses of absorbance at 254 nm were less. DOC loss followed a first-order exponential decay function, and was dependent on storage time. DOC half-life was calculated as 1253 days. Specific absorbance at 254 nm suggested that samples containing more aromatic DOC were more resistant to degradation, although time functioned as the primary control. Samples from two fens showed that loss of absorbance was greater at 400 nm rather than 254 nm, after 192 days storage, suggesting that non-aromatic DOC is preferentially degraded. These results suggest that samples can be stored for several months before losses of DOC become detectable, and that it is possible to back-calculate initial DOC concentrations in long-term stored samples based on known decay rates. Freeze/thaw experiments using samples from a range of peatlands suggested that DOC concentration was mostly unaffected by the process, but DOC increased 37% in one sample. Freezing had unpredictable and sometimes strong effects on absorbance, SUVA and E ratios, therefore freezing is not recommended as a method of preservation for these analyses.

AB Despite the importance of water purification to society, it is one of the more difficultwetland ecosystem services to quantify. It remains an issue in ecosystem service assessments where rapid estimates are needed, and poor-quality indicators are overused. We attempted to quantify the water purification service of South African palmiet wetlands (valley-bottom peatlands highly threatened by agriculture). First, we used an instantaneous catchment-scale mass balance sampling approach, which compared the fate of various water quality parameters over degraded and pristine sections of palmiet wetlands. We found that pristine palmiet wetlands acted as a sink for water, major cations, anions, dissolved silicon and nutrients, though there was relatively high variation in these trends. There are important limitations to this catchment-scale approach, including the fact that at this large scale there aremultiple mechanisms (internal wetland processes as well as external inputs) at work that are impossible to untangle with limited data. Therefore, secondly, we performed a small field-scale field survey of a wetland fragment to corroborate the catchment-scale results. There was a reasonable level of agreement between the results of the two techniques. We conclude that it appears possible to estimate the water purification function of these valley-bottom wetlands using this catchment-scale approach.

AB Prescribed burning is a common land management technique in many areas of the UK uplands. However, concern has been expressed at the impact of this management practice on carbon stocks and fluxes found in the carbon-rich peat soils that underlie many of these areas. This study measured both carbon stocks and carbon fluxes from a chronosequence of prescribed burn sites in northern England. A range of carbon parameters were measured including above ground biomass and carbon stocks; net ecosystem exchange (NEE), net ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and photosynthesis (P-g) from closed chamber methods; and particulate organic carbon (POC). Analysis of the CO2 data showed that burning was a significant factor in measured CO2 readings but that other factors such as month of sampling explained a greater proportion of the variation in the data. Carbon budget results showed that whereas all the plots were net sources of carbon, the most recent burn scars were smaller sources of carbon compared with the older burn scars, suggesting that burning of Calluna-dominated landscapes leads to an avoided loss' of carbon. However, this management intervention did not lead to a transition to a carbon sink and that for carbon purposes, active peat-forming conditions are desirable.

AB Intensive utilisation of peatland forests calls for logging activities to be increasingly carried out in conditions other than those in harsh winter. The low bearing capacity of peatlands forms a severe obstacle for the prevailing harvesting machinery. The aim of this study was to clarify and quantify the significance of above-ground biomass, brash mat, moisture content and mechanical properties of peat layer on the bearing capacity of pine bogs. In-situ driving tests were conducted in Western Finland on a pine bog covering a large variation of growing stock. Portable tools were tested for measuring strength properties of the top layer of peat. According to the results, shear modulus of top layer of peat, volume of trees and the existence of cutting debris are the most important factors affecting bearing capacity. Spiked shear vane was shown to be a promising tool in predicting the strength properties of peat soil.

AB With climate change, droughts may become more frequent in southern Ontario, which could release metals from peat and degrade downstream water quality. Monthly volume- weighted metal ( Al, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) concentrations and fluxes in streams and bulk deposition at Plastic Lake were monitored over 20 months in 2002- 2003, during which there was a summer drought. Monthly concentrations in the outflow from the wetland ( PC1) were variable, with very high concentrations following the drought. With the exception of Pb, statistically significant models of metal concentrations with SO42- and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were developed, and these relationships were used to estimate monthly metal exports between 1980 and 2000. Model predictions for Cd and Zn in PC1 agreed well ( p < 0.001) with concentrations measured between 1989 and 1991. Model predictions suggesting peaks in metal concentrations are common in years with pronounced summer droughts. In contrast to ombrotrophic bogs, the PC1 wetland receives the majority of its metal input from the terrestrial catchment, and mass balance approximations indicate no substantial depletion of metal reserves in peat. Drought- induced metal peaks may persist for many decades, potentially contributing to the delayed recovery of surface waters at Plastic Lake, despite declining S deposition.

AB The objective of the paper was the determination of values of selected habitat conditions optimal for Oxycoccus palustris Pers. on peatlands in the central part of East Poland in the aspect of provision of proper conditions in ecological cultivations of the plant. The obtained results showed a broad range of ecological tolerance towards the analysed physical-chemical properties of the habitat, however not the exceeding values typical of the occupied habitat, as evidenced by the relatively common occurrence of the species. Statistical analyses of the study results showed that important factors causing variability in the abundance and therefore condition of the population of the species at particular study sites include: P-total, P-PO4, and DOC (dissolved organic carbon). Ranges of values of the factors optimal for the functioning of the O. palustris population on the studied habitats were specified (P-total = 0.17 0.36; P-PO4 = 0.1 and DOC = 33.81 - 55.90 [mg dm(-3)]).

AB Peatlands in permafrost region are large carbon pools sensitive to global warming. However, the effects of increased temperature on carbon emissions and associated microbial abundances of peatlands under anaerobic condition remain largely unknown, especially when considering depths. For supplementing the deficiency about this, we collected soil from 0 to 150 cm depth of a permafrost peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountain and incubated at 5 and 15 degrees C for 55 days under anaerobic condition. Soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were detected during incubation, and inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and carbon-cycling microbial abundances were analyzed at the end of incubation. Results showed that emission rates and cumulative emissions amount of CO2 and CH4 at 15 degrees C across all soil depths were higher than those observed at 5 degrees C. Specifically, 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers had the highest CO2 emission rates and cumulative emission amounts, whereas the 40-60 cm and 60-80 cm layers had the highest CH4 emission rates and cumulative emission amounts. Mean temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) values of CO2 and CH(4 )were 2.39 and 55.49 respectively. Q(10) values of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, and methanotroph abundances were 1.17, 3.85, 1.75, 1.68, and 1.66 respectively, which were calculated by the abundance ratio of microbial functional gene at 15 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Similar to the trend of CO2 emissions, high bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, and methanotroph functional gene abundances were also observed in 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers, and such abundances increased along with temperature increasing. In sum, elevated temperature enhances the carbon emission of peatland in permafrost region, and the warming simulated CO2 emission is linked to the abundances of carbon-cycling microorganisms.

AB Iron (Fe) is among the limiting nutrients in marine environments and mainly originates from terrigenous sources. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), an important natural organic ligand, plays a key role in the dissolution and transport of terrestrial iron. Peat-derived DOC contains a large number of phenolics, and a systematic study of the geochemical interaction between DOC and Fe will contribute to the understanding of the global carbon and iron cycles. Phenolics, including phenolic acids, are secondary metabolites from plants and fungi. These compounds possess an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxyl groups and their structures may range from that of a simple phenolic molecule to that of a complex high-molecular weight polymer. Despite the extensive literature describing the biological effects of phenolic acids, the effect of phenolics on the iron cycle in peatlands is not known very well. Zoige peatland, the world's largest plateau peat wetland, was studied through field investigation and laboratory simulated experiments. The content of phenolics, filterable Fe and some physicochemical parameters in the rivers of the area were investigated. The waters are generally alkaline, with an average pH of 8.04, and aqueous Fe(III) and Fe(II) concentrations are higher than most of the common rivers in the world. The results of our experiments suggested that the high iron solubility was closely related to the phenolic content of the DOC. In particular, phenolics with catechol or galloy moieties forming complexes with iron and significantly impede the oxidation of complexed Fe(II). In addition, some phenolic substances are able to reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron. The combination of complexation and reduction in Fe by phenolics effectively increased the proportion of ferrous iron to total iron and slowed the oxidation and precipitation in the waters, maintaining a high content of "soluble iron" in the peatland. This mechanism has great implications for the effective transport of soluble iron from peatlands to aquatic ecosystems and the global coupled iron and carbon cycles.

AB The stability of global soil carbon ( C) represents a major uncertainty in forecasting future climate change. In the UK, substantial soil C losses have been reported, while at the same time dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland waters have increased, suggesting that soil C stocks may be destabilising in response to climate change. To investigate the link between soil carbon and DOC at a range of sites, soil organic matter, soilwater and streamwater DOC were analysed for radiocarbon (C-14). DOC exported from C-rich landscapes appears younger than the soil C itself, much of it comprising C assimilated post-1950s. DOC from more intensively managed, C-poor soils is older, in some cases > 100 years. Results appear consistent with soil C destabilisation in farmed landscapes, but not in peatlands. Reported C losses may to a significant extent be explained by mechanisms other than climate change, e. g. recovery from acidification in peatlands, and agricultural intensification in managed systems.

TI ADSORPTION BEHAVIOR OF HUMIC SUBSTANCES ON ACTIVATED CARBON - COMPARISON
   WITH THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTER OF MATERIAL FROM DIFFERENT
   ORIGIN
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The adsorption behaviour of humic substances on activated carbon was different for samples of different origin. Humic substances isolated from bog lakes or from aqueous soil solutions are less adsorbable than those from rivers, groundwater, or samples from landfill leachates. The adsorption behaviour was determined by different physical and chemical parameters. The experimental data could be described by model calculations based on Freundlich equations for two fictive components of the total dissolved organic carbon. The nominal molecular weight distribution of humic substances from bog lakes and soil solution showed relatively high values. In addition, these substances had pronounced aromatic structures. This goes along with a relatively weak adsorption on activated carbon. There was no clear correlation concerning the hydrophilic character of the humic substances and their acidic character (proton capacity). Humic substances isolated from river water, groundwater, and landfill leachates showed lower nominal molecular weight and lower UV-absorbance. They had a higher aliphatic character and were more readily adsorbed on activated carbon than the other samples. The findings are of technical importance for water treatment.

AB The Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) is a global hot-spot for carbon cycling and export. Yet the influence of microorganisms on carbon cycling processes in PCTR soil is poorly characterized. We developed and tested a conceptual model of seasonal microbial carbon cycling in PCTR soil through integration of geochemistry, micro-meteorology, and eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomal amplicon (rRNA) sequencing from 216 soil DNA and RNA libraries. Soil moisture and pH increased during the wet season, with significant correlation to net CO2 flux in peat bog and net CH4 flux in bog forest soil. Fungal succession in these sites was characterized by the apparent turnover of Archaeorhizomycetes phylotypes accounting for 41% of ITS libraries. Anaerobic prokaryotes, including Syntrophobacteraceae and Methanomicrobia increased in rRNA libraries during the wet season. Putatively active populations of these phylotypes and their biogeochemical marker genes for sulfate and CH4 cycling, respectively, were positively correlated following rRNA and metatranscriptomic network analysis. The latter phylotype was positively correlated to CH4 fluxes (r = 0.46, p < 0.0001). Phylotype functional assignments were supported by metatranscriptomic analysis. We propose that active microbial populations respond primarily to changes in hydrology, pH, and nutrient availability. The increased microbial carbon export observed over winter may have ramifications for climate-soil feedbacks in the PCTR.

TI Recovery of target bryophytes in floating rich fens after 25 yr of

AB Question: What are the changes in mineral-rich fens (H7410A) after 25 yr of improved surface water quality in a national park?
   Location: Stobbenribben floating-fen complex in National Park Weerribben-Wieden, the Netherlands.
   Methods: Bryophyte species composition, peak above-ground biomass and vascular plant nutrients, as well as electrical conductivity of various layers in the peat were measured between 1988 and 2013.
   Results: The eutrophic moss Calliergonella cuspidata clearly decreased in aerial extent over the 25-yr study, especially near the ditch supplying base-rich surface water to the fen. In contrast, the characteristic rich fen species Scorpidium scorpioides expanded locally near the ditch. In the rich fen zone, peak above-ground biomass decreased from ca. 1000 to 250 g.m(-2). Also, foliar N:P ratios in vascular plant tissues increased from 16 to more than 22 g.g(-1), which clearly point to lower P availability over time. Improved surface water quality probably also promoted persistence of rich fen habitats in a different way. A large part of the rich fen peatland in 1988 changed into Sphagnum peatland by 2013, probably due to the reduction of base-rich water from below the floating root mat. This mat had become ca. 35 cm thicker in the past 50 yr. However, in areas closer to the ditch, rich fen species persisted, due to inundation with base-rich water during high water periods. Base-rich water probably no longer comes to the surface through the floating root mat, but more likely from the ditch.
   Conclusions: Water quality improvement can be important in the long-term re-establishment of target fen species. Also, local inundation can be helpful if regional groundwater access becomes limited. In the national park, rich fens are more threatened than Sphagnum peatlands. This study suggests that the rich fen stage can be maintained, and succession towards Sphagnum peatland prevented, with occasional inundation with high pH, nutrient-poor water.

AB Climate change projections indicate increases in CO2 emissions and DOC release from peatlands, thereby potentially transforming them from sinks to carbon sources. The individual effects of abiotic and biotic factors on peatland carbon exports and the interactions among all these factors are still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a field study over two years in a peatland complex by selecting four habitats differing in their dominant vegetation (shrub, grass, sedge and moss) in order to assess the links between abiotic and biotic factors and carbon release at each habitat. Accounting for the wide variability across habitats allowed us to examine the direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic factors on carbon cycling at the ecosystem level (i.e. the whole peatland complex). Results showed that the habitats dominated by vascular plants had the highest microbial and above-ground plant biomass, as well as the highest values of Acari and Collembola biomass, whereas Enchytraeidae biomass was dominant in the moss habitat. Furthermore, at ecosystem level, the SEM explained 75% of the total soil respiration variation and 33% of the DOC variation. Accordingly, soil respiration was directly linked to enchytraeid biomass, with these invertebrates being positively related to soil moisture. In contrast, both soil temperature and soil moisture had direct effects on microbial and Acari biomass, and the interaction between Acari biomass and below-ground plant biomass was responsible for DOC release. These findings provide new insights into the role of soil biota in carbon dynamics in peatlands, by showing that the direct effects of abiotic factors on biotic communities (both plants and soil organisms) determine how much carbon is lost from these systems (either as CO2 e or DOC).

AB Northern peatlands are recognized as globally important stores of terrestrial carbon (C), yet we have limited understanding of how global changes, including land use, affect C cycling processes in these ecosystems. Making use of a long-term (> 50 year old) peatland land management experiment in the UK, we investigated, using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse chase approach, how managed burning and grazing influenced the short-term uptake and cycling of C through the plant-soil system. We found that burning affected the composition and growth stage of the plant community, by substantially reducing the abundance of mature ericoid dwarf-shrubs. Burning also affected the structure of the soil microbial community, measured using phospholipid fatty acid analysis, by reducing fungal biomass. There was no difference in net ecosystem exchange of CO2, but burning was associated with an increase in photosynthetic uptake of (CO2)-C-13 and increased transfer of C-13 to the soil microbial community relative to unburned areas. In contrast, grazing had no detectable effects on any measured C cycling process. Our study provides new insight into how changes in vegetation and soil microbial communities arising from managed burning affect peatland C cycling processes, by enhancing the uptake of photosynthetic C and the transfer of C belowground, whilst maintaining net ecosystem exchange of CO2 at pre-burn levels.

AB The winter period is seldom included in the estimates of aquatic-atmospheric carbon exchange. In this study we quantified the flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) over 3 years from 12 small subarctic lakes. The lakes accumulated consistent and high amounts of CO2 and CH4 (56-97% as CO2) over the winter, resulting in a high flux during ice thaw. The CO2 flux during ice thaw increased with increasing mean depth of the lakes, while the CH4 flux was high in lakes surrounded by mires. The ice thaw period was quantitatively important to the annual gas balances of the lakes. For nine of the lakes, 11 to 55% of the annual flux occurred during thaw. For three of the lakes with an apparent net annual CO2 uptake, including the thaw period reversed the balance from sink to source. Our results suggest that the ice thaw period is critically important for the emissions of CO2 and CH4 in small lakes.

AB To understand the implications of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on carbon turnover in peatlands, we conducted a C-13 pulse labeling experiment on Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum already receiving long-term (5 years) amendments of 56 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) as ammonium or nitrate. We examined shoot tissue retention, net ecosystem respiration returns of the C-13 pulse, and soil porewater DOC content under the two species. C-13 fixation in Eriophorum leaves was enhanced with nitrogen addition and doubled with nitrate supply. This newly fixed C appeared to be relocated below-ground faster with nitrogen fertilization as respiration returns were unaffected by N inputs. By contrast, increases in C-13 fixation were not observed in Calluna. Instead, net ecosystem respiration rates over Calluna increased with N fertilization. There was no significant label incorporation into DOC, suggesting a conservative strategy of peatland vegetation regarding allocation of C through root exudation. Greater concentrations of total DOC were identified with nitrate addition in Calluna. Given the long-term nature of the experiment and the high N inputs, the overall impacts of nitrogen amendments on the fate of recently synthesized C in Eriophorum and Calluna in this ombrotrophic peatland were surprisingly more moderate than originally hypothesized. This may be due to N being effectively retained within the bryophyte layer, thus limiting, and delaying the onset of, below-ground effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Kushiro Mire is the largest mire in Japan and in 1980 was the first wetland in Japan registered under the Ramsar Convention. Recent reports indicate an increase in nutrient loading into Kushiro Mire from changes in land use. We measured vertical profiles of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NO(3) (-), NO(2) (-), NH(4) (+)), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and various types of microbial activity in soil samples collected to approximately 1.5 m deep at two sites in Kushiro Mire. We found an accumulation of NO(3) (-) and DOC in the deeper soil. Denitrifying activity was highest in the shallower soils and decreased drastically with depth, whereas higher levels of fluoresceindiacetate hydrolysis, beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, and xylosidase enzyme activity were found in the deeper layers. We also detected humic-like substances as components of the DOC. These results suggest that the DOC in the wetland soil cannot be used as a substrate for denitrification, causing denitrification to be suppressed in the deeper soil. In addition, denitrifying activity would be very low in the deeper layers due to low soil temperature. As a result, nitrogen input to the mire has resulted in a large accumulation of NO(3) (-) in the deeper soil. This will eventually change the mire ecosystem through effects such as increased eutrophication and acidification.

AB There is concern that changes in climate and land use could increase rates of decomposition in peatlands, leading to release of stored C to the atmosphere. Rates of decomposition are driven by abiotic factors such as temperature and moisture, but also by biotic factors such as changes in litter quality resulting from vegetation change. While effects of litter species identity and diversity on decomposition processes are well studied, the impact of changes in relative abundance (evenness) of species has received less attention. In this study we investigated effects of changes in short-term peatland plant species evenness on decomposition in mixed litter assemblages, measured as litter weight loss, respired CO2 and leachate C and N. We found that over the 307-day incubation period, higher levels of species evenness increased rates of decomposition in mixed litters, measured as weight loss and leachate dissolved organic N. We also found that the identity of the dominant species influenced rates of decomposition, measured as weight loss, CO2 flux and leachate N. Greatest rates of decomposition were when the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris dominated litter mixtures, and lowest rates when the bryophyte Pleurozium schreberi dominated. Interactions between evenness and dominant species identity were also detected for litter weight loss and leachate N. In addition, positive non-additive effects of mixing litter were observed for litter weight loss. Our findings highlight the importance of changes in the evenness of plant community composition for short-term decomposition processes in UK peatlands.

AB Natural organic matter poses an increasing challenge to water managers because of its potential adverse impacts on water treatment and distribution, and subsequently human health. Projections were made of impacts of climate change on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the primarily agricultural Boyne catchment which is used as a potable water supply in Ireland. The results indicated that excluding a potential rise in extreme precipitation, future projected loads are not dissimilar to those observed under current conditions This is because projected increases in DOC concentrations are offset by corresponding decreases in precipitation and hence river flow. However, the results presented assume no changes in land use and highlight the predicted increase in DOC loads from abstracted waters at water treatment plants. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We tested the hypothesis that CO2 supersaturation along the aquatic conduit over Sweden can be explained by processes other than aquatic respiration. A first generalized-additive model (GAM) analysis evaluating the relationships between single water chemistry variables and pCO(2) in lakes and streams revealed that water chemistry variables typical for groundwater input, e.g., dissolved silicate (DSi) and Mg2+ had explanatory power similar to total organic carbon (TOC). Further GAM analyses on various lake size classes and stream orders corroborated the slightly higher explanatory power for DSi in lakes and Mg2+ for streams compared with TOC. Both DSi and TOC explained 22-46% of the pCO(2) variability in various lake classes (0.01-> 100 km2) and Mg2+ and TOC explained 11-41% of the pCO(2) variability in the various stream orders. This suggests that aquatic pCO(2) has a strong groundwater signature. Terrestrial respiration is a significant source of the observed supersaturation and we may assume that both terrestrial respiration and aquatic respiration contributed equally to pCO(2) efflux. pCO(2) and TOC concentrations decreased with lake size suggesting that the longer water residence time allow greater equilibration of CO2 with the atmosphere and in-lake mineralization of TOC. For streams, we observed a decreasing trend in pCO(2) with stream orders between 3 and 6. We calculated the total CO2 efflux from all Swedish lakes and streams to be 2.58 Tg C yr-1. Our analyses also demonstrated that 0.70 Tg C yr-1 are exported to the ocean by Swedish watersheds as HCO3- and CO(3)2- of which about 0.56 Tg C yr-1 is also a residual from terrestrial respiration and constitute a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2. Taking all dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes along the aquatic conduit into account will lower the estimated net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) by 2.02 Tg C yr-1, which corresponds to 10% of the NEE in Sweden.

AB Despite methylmercury (MeHg) production in boreal wetlands being a research focus for decades, little is known about factors in control of methylation and demethylation rates and the effect of wetland type. This is the first study reporting potential Hg methylation (k (m) ) and MeHg demethylation rate constants (k (d) ) in boreal wetland soils. Seven wetlands situated in northern and southern Sweden were characterized by climatic parameters, nutrient status (e.g. type of vegetation, pH, C/N ratio, specific UV-absorption), iron and sulfur biogeochemistry. Based on nutrient status, the wetlands were divided into three groups; (I) three northern, nutrient poor fens, (II) a nutrient gradient ranging from an ombrotrophic bog to a fen with intermediate nutrient status, and (III) southern, more nutrient rich sites including two mesotrophic wetlands and one alder (Alnus) forest swamp. The k (m) /k (d) ratio in general followed %MeHg in soil and both measures were highest at the fen site with intermediate nutrient status. Northern nutrient poor fens and the ombrotrophic bog showed intermediate values of %MeHg and k (m) /k (d) . The two mesotrophic wetlands showed the lowest %MeHg and k (m) /k (d) , whereas the alder swamp had high k (m) and k (d) , resulting in an intermediate k (m) /k (d) and %MeHg. Molybdate addition experiments suggest that net MeHg production was mainly caused by the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria. A comparison with other studies, show that k (m) and %MeHg in boreal freshwater wetlands in general are higher than in other environments. Our results support previous suggestions that the highest MeHg net production in boreal landscapes is to be found in fens with an intermediate nutrient status.

AB Subsidence, erosion, and degradation in agricultural peatlands are leading to the disappearance of highly fertile farmland. This study investigated two strategies aimed at extending the lifespan of cultivated peat soils: the application of straw and wood chips to compensate for soil losses and the application of copper (Cu) to slow peat decomposition, based on previous recommendations. Peat soil samples (270 g) were amended with 11 t ha(-1) of biomass materials (14.8 g kg(-1)) and 235.6 mg Cu kg(-1) and incubated in glass jars at constant temperature and water content. Thirty chemical parameters were then monitored over a 56-d period through repeated soil sampling. Discriminant analysis showed that the addition of biomass had the greatest affect on nitrogen (N) availability, immobilizing 7.8 to 12.1 kg of inorganic N per metric ton of incorporated biomass. Considering that peat soils may require from 4 to 40 t biomass ha(-1) yr(-1) to reach carbon equilibrium, the tested biomass materials could immobilize from 34 to 500 kg ha(-1) of N if confirmed at the field scale. This may help capture excess N but may also limit crop growth. Alternatively, slowing decomposition could reduce both biomass requirements and N immobilization. However, the results show that Cu had little effect on parameters linked to organic matter decomposition. Indeed, dissolved organic carbon was decreased by 11% in Cu-treated soils. A longer-term study should be conducted to confirm these observations at the field scale, thus helping to develop conservation strategies suitable for agricultural production.

AB Fire is known to impact soil properties and hydrological flow paths. However, the impact of prescribed vegetation burning on blanket peatland hydrology is poorly understood. We studied 10 blanket peat headwater catchments. Five were subject to prescribed burning, while five were unburnt controls. Within the burnt catchments, we studied plots where the last burn occurred similar to 2 (B2), 4 (B4), 7 (B7), or greater than 10 years (B10+) prior to the start of measurements. These were compared with plots at similar topographic wetness index locations in the control catchments. Plots subject to prescribed vegetation burning had significantly deeper water tables (difference in means=5.3 cm) and greater water table variability than unburnt plots. Water table depths were significantly different between burn age classes (B2> B4> B7> B10+) while B10+ water tables were not significantly different to the unburnt controls. Overland flow was less common on burnt peat than on unburnt peat, recorded in 9% and 17% of all runoff trap visits, respectively. Storm lag times and hydrograph recession limb periods were significantly greater (by similar to 1 and 13 h on average, respectively) in the burnt catchments overall, but for the largest 20% of storms sampled, there was no significant difference in storm lag times between burnt and unburnt catchments. For the largest 20% of storms, the hydrograph intensity of burnt catchments was significantly greater than those of unburnt catchments (means of 4.2 x 10(-5) and 3.4 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively), thereby indicating a nonlinear streamflow response to prescribed burning. Together, these results from plots to whole river catchments indicate that prescribed vegetation burning has important effects on blanket peatland hydrology at a range of spatial scales.

AB Litter decomposition is an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOC). In peatlands with hardly degradable soil DOC, the input of DOC from vascular plant litter can represent an important source of nutrients and decomposable substrates for soil microorganisms. We established a laboratory incubation with the litters of three peatland plant dominants (Sphagnum fallax, Vaccinium myrtillus and Eriophorum vaginatum) for 200 days, aiming to study DOC production and its quality. The quality of the DOC leached from the litters was characterized by a distribution of C, N and P among molecular weight (MW) fractions (< 1, 1-10, 10-100 and > 100 kDa), their aromaticity, composition of low molecular weight compounds (organic acids, sugars and amino acids) and DOC biodegradability.
   The leaves of vascular plants decomposed the fastest, releasing larger amounts of nutrients and easily degradable organic acids, sugars and amino acids to the leachate, when compared to their roots and Sphagnum. DOC distribution to the MW fractions did not differ among the litters. Neither the DOC distribution to the respective fractions nor leachate C/N/P stoichiometry were factors driving DOC biodegradability. Total dissolved P distribution to the MW fractions significantly differed among the litters, with Sphagnum being very specific: P was initially associated only with high molecular weight DOC, while later it was redistributed to the lower MW fractions and complexed with Al and Fe. The complexation may retard soluble reactive P leaching especially from Sphagnum litter. DOC biodegradability was higher for the vascular plant leaf litter than for the Sphagnum litter in the early stages of decomposition (20 days) but later decreased and became more uniform for all litters. These temporal differences (by decomposition stage) were more pronounced than those caused by litter origin. Our results indicate that mainly leaf litter of vascular plants can release significant amounts of DOC during the early stage of decomposition. This DOC is more aromatic with higher biodegradability and more nutrients (especially P) as compared to Sphagnum and can thus temporarily stimulate microbial activity in habitats dominated by the vascular plants.

AB Surface water, pore water, vegetation and peat cores were sampled from a waterlogged ombrotrophic peat bog on the Shetland Isles, UK and analysed for different S forms and their isotopic composition, in an attempt to elucidate the biogeochemical processes affecting S during peat diagenesis. Surface waters show that inputs of S to the peat have a maritime-dominated isotopic composition close to +20 parts per thousand(CDT). Uptake of S by vegetation introduces a -10 parts per thousand. shift in delta S-34 from these input values.
   Below the vegetation layer and down to 18 cm depth, bacterial SO42- reduction is the major control on S species distribution and isotopic composition within the solid peat and pore waters. In this part of the peat, preferential reduction of (SO4)-S-32 in pore water during metabolism produces isotopically light sulphide, which is incorporated into the solid phase in both inorganic and organic forms, while pore water SO42- becomes enriched in 34S. From 18 to 28 cm, organic 4 S content falls relative to C and residual organic S becomes 34 S-enriched, indicative of mineralization of organic S, a process which releases isotopically light S to the pore waters. Still deeper in the core (28 to similar to 50 cm), bacterial reduction of pore-water SO42- S-34, now enriched in, results in addition of isotopically heavy S to the solid phase. Limited pore water data suggest that below 50 cm mineralization reactions again release S from the organic fraction of the peat. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, agriculture biomass was used to remove dissolved organic matter from peat swamp runoff. The functional groups and morphological properties of 6 tropical agriculture biomasses (coconut husk, rice husk, empty fruit bunch, sago hampas, saw dust and banana trunk) in their raw and citric acid-treated states were examined. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra showed that various biomasses were typically characterised with lignocellulosic compounds. The spectra analysis further demonstrated that citric acid treatment resulted in the dissolution of lignin and hemicelluloses to various extents where carboxyl groups were also introduced. These changes hypothetically suggest improved adsorption ability. Treatment of peat swamp runoff with various untreated biomasses showed no adsorption. With the modified biomass, adsorption was evidenced, with rice husk illustrating the highest removal efficiency of 60% to 65%. The biosorbent can be used in the water treatment process especially for treating water with a high dissolved organic matter content. The spent sorbent can be subsequently applied as a soil conditioner as the dissolved organic fraction, commonly known as humic matter, possesses important agricultural value.

AB Water table fluctuations influence the carbon balance of wetlands, but the effects are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations. Thus, we compared C mineralization in a peatland mesocosm exposed to a water table fluctuation (from 5 to 67 cm beneath the surface) with that in mesocosms with a stable high water table (2 to 6 cm depth) and with production rates obtained from flask incubations. Net turnover rates were calculated from concentration data by diffusive-advective mass-balances. Under stable, high water table conditions, net production of CO2 (6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), CH4 (2.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and DOC (15.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were vertically stratified and production and fluxes equilibrated. Lowering and raising the water table from 5 to 67 cm resulted in complex patterns of net CH4 and CO2 production. Response and equilibration times of processes upon drainage and flooding ranged from days (aerobic CO, production, CH4 oxidation, fluxes under unsaturated conditions) to months (CH4 production, fluxes under saturated conditions). Averaged over the water table fluctuation, net production of CH4 decreased to 0.36 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and that of CO2 increased to 140 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Physical disturbance through the incubation of peat strongly increased production rates of CO2, CH4 and DOC compared to in situ, steady state rates. The decoupling of production and fluxes to the atmosphere under conditions with variable water table depths potentially explains part of the frequently reported lack of correlation between environmental variables and trace gas fluxes in field investigations, and questions the applicability of predictions of gas flux based on empirical relationships established under stable average conditions.

AB The fluvial fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatlands form an important part of that ecosystem's carbon cycle, contributing approximately 35% of the overall peatland carbon budget. The in-stream processes acting on the DOC, such as photodegradation and biodegradation, can lead to DOC loss and thus contribute CO2 to the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to understand what controls the rates of DOC degradation. Water samples from a headwater, peat-covered catchment, were collected over a 23month period and analyzed for the DOC degradation rate and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in the context of hydroclimatic monitoring. Measures of DOM composition included C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, and elemental analysis. Regression analysis showed that there was a significant role for the composition of the DOM in controlling degradation with degradation rates significantly increasing with the proportion of aldehyde and carboxylic acid functional groups but decreasing with the proportion of N-alkyl functional groups. The highest rates of DOC degradation occurred when aldehyde functionality was at its greatest and this occurred on the recession limb of storm hydrographs. Including this knowledge into models of fluvial carbon fate for an 818km(2) catchment gave an annual average DOC removal rate of 67% and 50% for total organic carbon, slightly lower than previously predicted. The compositional controls suggest that DOM is primarily being used as a ready energy source to the aquatic ecosystem rather than as a nutrient source.

AB Vegetation degradation resulting from climate change and human activities in wet meadows is an important issue worldwide. This phenomenon is known to influence soil labile organic carbon (LOC) and enzyme activities due to changes in environmental conditions. However, little is known about the response of LOC and enzyme activities to vegetation degradation in high-altitude wet meadows. In this study, we examined the response of LOC and carbon-cycle enzyme activities to different intensities of vegetation degradation (i.e., non-degraded (ND), slightly degraded (SD) moderately degraded (MD), and heavily degraded (HD)) in a Tibetan wet meadow. The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities (i.e., cellulase, amylase and beta-glucosidase) were investigated in two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found that the content of soil SOC and LOC fractions declined with increasing soil depth in each degraded level except for HD. Vegetation degradation significantly decreased the amount of SOC at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, and this decrease was attributed to the relative reduction of carbon source input and higher carbon decomposition. Vegetation degradation also significantly reduced the contents of SWC, DOC, MBC, LFOC, amylase and beta-glucosidase in the topsoil layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm). However, the corresponding contents in deeper soil layers had no significant differences. In addition, the SWC, DOC, LFOC and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities were higher in 2016 than in 2017. Significant correlations were obtained between SWC, SOC, LOC fractions and enzyme activities. Soil moisture was found to be the main abiotic driver for variation of soil carbon and enzyme activities. Our results indicate that vegetation degradation in the Tibetan wet meadows decreased the quantity of topsoil labile carbon fractions and enzyme activities and heavily degraded vegetation may lead to a change of profile distribution in soil carbon pool.

AB Ditch run-off chemistry of 40 catchments was monitored before and for 2-3 yrs after maintenance of the peatland ditch network and compared with data collected from 34 control catchments. Increases in mean pH, electrical conductivity, and the concentrations of suspended solids and base cations (sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium) and a decrease in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon were observed. Because of high concentrations in a few areas immediately after the digging operations and during the first post-treatment year in general, the mean concentrations of aluminium and iron also increased. No major changes occurred in the concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (N) and total dissolved phosphorus. High phosphorus concentrations were observed at a few sites immediately after the digging operations. Concentrations of mineral N, especially NH4+-N, increased significantly, while the concentrations of organic N decreased. The largest relative changes in element transport during the 3 yr period following treatment were the increases in the loads of NH4+-N and suspended solids. From the point of view of water protection, the loading of suspended solids was considered the most harmful effect of ditch network maintenance.

AB To understand the underlying factors affecting the seasonal variation of the methane concentration in a cool temperate freshwater marsh vegetated with Carex lasiocarpa in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China, we measured methane emission from, and the concentrations of methane, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and acetate in, water samples taken from the standing water surface to the top of the gley soil layer in the C. laisocarpa marsh, before and after plants were covered with a black cloth at the three growing stages of June, July and August 2002. The methane oxidation rate was also measured in situ by applying acetylene, a methane oxidation inhibitor, to whole plants, and the methane production rate in water sampled in June and July was measured via the anaerobic incubation in the laboratory. The methane production rate in water samples was significantly correlated with acetate concentration rather than DOC concentration, whereas the mean acetate concentration in water samples was higher in June than in July and August. Hence, the low methane concentration in June did not result from a lack of acetate for methane production. The mean methane and DOC concentrations in water samples were enhanced by 22.3 and 31.1% in June, 2.1 and 5.0% in July, and 3.4 and 15.2% in August, respectively, after plants were covered with a black cloth. The methane oxidation rate and redox potential in the freshwater marsh decreased from June to July or August. These results suggest that there was more oxygen in the rhizome and rhizosphere in June than in July and August, which not only accentuated methane oxidation but also reduced methane production. Therefore, the high methane concentration in water in July and August could be ascribed to both an increase in temperature and a decrease in redox potential or oxygen concentration in the rhizosphere.

AB The long-term development of three humic lake ecosystems in Poland was investigated through palaeoecological analyses of sediment cores. These wetland records spanning the Holocene were analyzed for plant macroremains, degree of peat decomposition, sediment geochemistry along with radiocarbon dating. Morphological characteristics of the catchments and data on contemporary water quality and management approaches were integrated. Our research on the palaeoecology of humic lakes suggests two main states: humic and eutrophic-humic. Of the lakes studied, only one consistently presented features typical of the humic type. The other two showed various states, and dynamic patterns of transformation. The results indicate that these systems can change from humic to eutrophic-humic, and back again, in response to catchment-linked factors, climatic change and human impact. Thus determination of uniform pattern in the development of humic lakes is questionable. This suggests that a reassessment of brown water lakes is necessary.

AB Much attention has been given to the carbon balance of peatland and heathland ecosystems and their role as global carbon stores. They are also important as buffers for atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution, locking N into the soil and vegetation through tight nutrient cycling and preventing the leaching of soluble N into freshwater ecosystems. We compared mean annual soil exchangeable N, mineralisation and soil solution nitrogen at three contrasting ericaceous-dominated ecosystems: a lowland heath, an upland heath and an ombrotrophic raised bog at intermediate altitude, all of which were sites of long-term N-manipulation experiments. We expected that soil leachate N would be associated with soil C/N and total soil C, and that sites with higher C % and soil C/N would have greater ability to buffer N deposition before N saturation and leaching began. However, although soil solution N responded to N deposition at all the sites, we found that only the heathland sites were consistent with this expectation. The bog, with the highest C/N and largest C pool, was not the most strongly buffered. The upland heath was most effective at retaining N (extractable NH4+-N +3900 % from control) compared to the lowland heath (extractable NH4+-N +370 % from control) and the bog (extractable NH4+-N, +140-240 % from control). We concluded that the absence of a definable Calluna litter layer at the lowland heath and the bog, and the anoxic conditions at the bog, explained the earlier onset of leaching and that carbon and nitrogen cycles appeared more closely coupled in the heathlands but became decoupled at the bog due to the strong controlling effect of hydrology.

AB Thermal gradient apparatus has been used to study enzyme activity and carbon cycling in peat collected seasonally from a Northern upland peatland. A thermal optimum was observed in the peat where maximum carbon-cycling enzyme activities (phenol oxidase and beta-glucosidase), phenolic compound concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and microbial respiration (CO(2) efflux) were all found in a given season. The thermal optimum for these carbon-cycling processes coincided with the highest ambient soil temperature recorded at the time of peat collection, suggesting microbial acclimation to the external conditions. Under the waterlogged conditions of this experiment, phenol oxidase activites correlated positively with phenolic compounds (winter 0.96, P < 0.01; spring 0.92, P < 0.001; summer 0.94, P < 0.001; autumn 0.88, P < 0.001) and (beta-glucosidase activities with DOC (winter 0.91, P < 0.01; spring 0.85, P < 0.01; summer 0.92, P < 0.001; autumn 0.72, P < 0.05). We propose, therefore, that the relative activities of these enzymes is crucial in mobilising DOC from the peat matrix, with implications for carbon exports to the receiving waters (magnitude and molecular weight distribution) and CO(2) efflux to the atmosphere. The pronounced seasonality in carbon processing found here, must be taken into account when modelling carbon flux in and from these systems, if responses to climate change are to be predicted satisfactorily. Furthermore, because the optimum activity of these carbon-cycling enzymes shifted with seasonal changes in temperature, it is essential to perform enzyme assays in soil ecological investigations at field temperatures (rather than standardised temperatures), when information on natural process rates is required.

AB To better understand aquatic-terrestrial linkages in the sub-Arctic, and specifically the relative importance of landscape position versus land cover, we surveyed lakes, soils, land cover, and lake/basin characteristics in a 14 000 km(2) region of acidic forest-tundra landscape near northern Manitoba, Canada (59.56 degrees N, 97.72 degrees W) in 2009. We analyzed 39 different biological, chemical, and physical variables for lakes and soils. We used a remote-sensingbased classification to determine that the landscape was 21% water, 46% peat-forming lowland, and 24.9% open tundra, and we assigned lake order to all lakes based on the order of the outlet stream for each lake. Lakes were oligotrophic to mesotrophic (median total phosphorus: TP = 11.8 mu g L-1), N-limited (median dissolved inorganic nitrogen: TP = 1.6), acidic (median pH 5.7), and had moderate amounts of dissolved organic carbon (median DOC = 5.2 mg L-1). We identified 2 principle groups of variables represented by DOC and conductivity/cations, respectively, that captured major axes of lake variation. DOC, 2 measures of DOC quality (a(250)/a(365) [a proxy for molecular weight and aromaticity] and specific ultraviolet absorbance), and Fe and were significantly correlated with percent cover of lowland forest, but conductivity/cations were not correlated with variation in land cover. Soils were generally acidic (pH 2.7-4.4) and nutrient-poor, and wetland soils contained more carbon and higher concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and other cations than upland open tundra. Landscape position of lakes (measured as lake order) did not capture systematic differences in land cover or lake biogeochemistry. Our results highlight the importance of lowland export of DOC to lakes and further suggest the need for additional regional studies of aquatic-terrestrial connections in Arctic and sub-Arctic landscapes.

AB Increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been reported for many catchments across the northern hemisphere. Hypotheses to explain the increase have varied (eg. increasing air temperature or recovery from acidification) but one test of alternative hypotheses is the trend over the recent decade, with the competing hypotheses predicting: continuing increase; the rate of increase declining with time; and even decrease in concentration. In this study, records of DOC concentration in non tidal rivers across the UK were examined for the period 2003-2012. The study found that:
   i) Of the 62 decade-long concentration trends that could be examined, 3 showed a significant increase, 17 experienced no significant change and 42 showed a significant decrease; in 28 of the 42 significant decreases, a significant step change was apparent with step changes being a decrease in concentration in every case.
   ii) Of the 118 sites where annual flux and concentration records were available from 1974, 28 showed a significant step change down in flux and 52 showed a step down in concentration. The modal year of the step changes was 2000 with no step changes observed before 1982.
   iii) At the UK national scale, DOC flux peaked in 2005 at 1354 ktonnes C/yr (5.55 tonnes C/km(2)/yr) but has declined since.
   The study suggests that there is a disconnection between DOC records from large catchments at their tidal limits and complementary records from headwater catchments, which means that mechanisms believed to be driving increases in DOC concentrations in headwaters will not necessarily be those controlling trends in DOC concentration further downstream. We propose that the changes identified here have been driven by changes in in-stream processing and changes brought about by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Therefore, signals identified in headwater catchments may bear little relation to those observed in large rivers much further downstream and vice versa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   TRENDS
AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from many catchments in Europe and North-America are steadily increasing. Several studies have sought to explain this observation. As possible causes, a decrease in acid rain or sulfate deposition, concomitant reductions in ionic strength and increasing temperatures were identified. DOC often originates from riparian wetlands; but here, despite higher DOC concentrations, ionic strength in pore waters usually exceeds that in surface waters. In the catchment under study, DOC concentrations were synchronous with dissolved iron concentrations in pore and stream water. This study aims at testing the hypothesis that DOC exports are mediated by iron reduction/oxidation cycles. Following the observed hydrographs, delta O-18 of water and DOC fluorescence, the wetlands were identified as the main source of DOC. Antecedent biogeochemical conditions, i.e., water table levels in the wetlands, influenced the discharge patterns of nitrate, iron and DOC during an event. The correlation of DOC with pH was positive in pore waters, but negative in surface waters; it was negative for DOC with sulfate in pore waters, but only weak in surface waters. Though, the positive correlation of DOC with iron was universal for pore and surface water. The decline of DOC and iron concentrations in transition from anoxic wetland pore water to oxic stream water suggests a flocculation of DOC with oxidising iron, leading to a drop in pH in the stream during high DOC fluxes. The pore water did not per se differ in pH. There is, thus, a need to consider processes more thoroughly of DOC mobilisation in wetlands when interpreting DOC exports from catchments. The coupling of DOC with iron fluxes suggested that increased DOC exports could at least, in part, be caused by increasing activities in iron reduction, possibly due to increases in temperature, increasing wetness of riparian wetlands, or by a shift from sulfate dominated to iron reduction dominated biogeochemical regimes.

AB Here, we examine how marine microbial communities respond when dissolved organic matter (DOM) is mobilized from coastal wetlands. Biological transformations of this DOM may increase in the presence of reactive substrates, such as algal-derived DOM (ADOM) in the coastal zonea process known as priming. We performed laboratory experiments examining transformations of DOM derived from coastal wetland peat (PDOM) with and without the presence ADOM. Associated shifts in microbial community composition and functional gene abundance were measured to evaluate mechanisms of priming effects. ADOM presence stimulated CO2 production when compared to the seawater control, which was further enhanced in the copresence of PDOM. DOM characterization showed a substantial difference in features present at the end of the incubation when PDOM was present with and without ADOM, while metagenomic sequencing indicated shifts in microbial community composition and identified 23 unique functional genes associated with pathways for the breakdown of aromatic compounds.

AB Climate warming and organic matter decomposition are connected in a recursive manner; this recursion can be described by temperature sensitivity. We conducted a multifactorial laboratory experiment to quantify the temperature sensitivity of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) decomposition processes of common boreal organic soils. We incubated 36 mor and 36 slightly decomposed Carex-Sphagnum peat samples in a constant moisture and ambient temperature for 6 months. The experiment included three temperature and two moisture levels and two food web manipulations (samples with and without fungivore enchytraeid worms). We determined the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seven molecular size classes together with ammonium N and dissolved organic N in low molecular weight and high molecular weight fractions. The temperature sensitivity function Q(10) was fit to the data. The C and N release rate was almost an order of magnitude higher in mor than in peat. Soil fauna increased the temperature sensitivity of C release. Soil fauna played a key role in N release; when fauna was absent in peat, the N release was ceased. The wide range of the studied C and N compounds and treatments (68 Q(10) datasets) allowed us to recognize five different temperature sensitivity patterns. The most common pattern (37 out of 68) was a positive upwards temperature response, which was observed for CO2 and DOC release. A negative downward pattern was observed for extractable organic nitrogen and microbial C. Sixteen temperature sensitivity patterns represented a mixed type, where the Q(10) function was not applicable, as this does not allow changing the sign storage change rate with increasing or decreasing temperature. The mixed pattern was typically connected to intermediate decomposition products, where input and output fluxes with different temperature sensitivities may simultaneously change the storage. Mixed type was typical for N processes. Our results provide useful parameterization for ecosystem models that describe the feedback loop between climate warming, organic matter decomposition, and productivity of N-limited vegetation.

AB Field experiments were carried out in order to assess the practicality and application of (SO4)-S-34 (2-) as a tracer of the physical and geochemical fate of aerially derived sulfur in peat. Six enclosures were isolated in a lowland peat with high historical acid sulfate inputs at Thorne Moors, UK, and treated with regular additions of 99.9% pure (SO4)-S-34 (2-) for 12 months. The total S-34 sulfate addition resulted in negligible change to the sulfate concentration, but allowed unequivocal change to the isotopic composition of sulfate inputs relative to pre-experiment control data set. Migration and biogeochemical transformations of the S-34 tracer were monitored via depth-specific sampling of surface and pore-waters every 6 weeks, and sacrificial sampling of solid peat at 12, 24, and 48 week intervals. Tracer incorporation into the various sulfur forms within the surface and pore-waters, vegetation, organic and inorganic fractions of the peat was apparent through strong positive deviation of delta S-34 from natural values (in comparison with 18 months control data set for the same site). Consistency within enclosures is good and a detailed model of sulfur cycling within each enclosure can be established but natural variability in the control data and differences between replicate enclosures prevents more quantitative assessment. The S-34 tracer was initially rapidly removed from surface waters. The majority of uptake was by living vegetation (5.7-33% of tracer added, mean 17.6%), or through transformation to the organic fraction of the upper peat (25 cm) after rapid bacterial reduction of sulfate to sulfide. Despite penetration of S-34 labelled sulfate to deeper pore-waters over time, there was no significant reduction to sulfide or subsequent incorporation into organic or inorganic fraction at these depths (> 25 cm); organic and inorganic sulfur, and pore-water sulfide retained their initial unlabelled isotopic compositions. This limitation on sulfur cycling at relatively shallow depth may be attributed to diminished labile organic matter inhibiting the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria or poisoning of sulfate reducers by high dissolved sulfide, after long-term sulfur pollution of this ecosystem.

AB A detailed investigation into sulphur leaching in peatland headwater catchments in the South Pennines, UK shows that, despite significant reductions in sulphur emissions, sulphur remains a key acidifier. This sulphur can be considered as legacy atmospheric pollution, stored within the peat by processes of dissimilatory sulphate reduction and now being leached into the region's surface waters. Persistently lower water tables at gully edge locations define a thick erosional acrotelm that is vulnerable to aeration, oxidation and flushing throughout the year, and not solely confined to periods of drought. Stream discharge behaves as a two-end member system, whereby pre-event water, rich in DOC and sulphate, is diluted by event water as a result of event water flowing through fast flow pathways such as macropores and overland flow. A rapid increase in water table elevation during the storm and a decrease in elevation after the storm indicate that event water has infiltrated the peat and has then been released into the stream. Streamwaters in peat dominated upland catchments with high densities of gullying have high concentrations of sulphate and low concentrations of DOC, whereas the reverse is true for those catchments with low densities of gullying. This is consistent with the concept that high concentrations of sulphate can suppress the solubility of DOC. A significant store of sulphate exists within South Pennine peats, and continued gully erosion will enhance sulphur leaching meaning that the timescale involved for any depletion is uncertain. It is therefore important that models predicting recovery from acidification in these upland systems include an understanding of how this stored sulphur is being leached, especially with respect to gully erosion, climate change and reduced precipitation.

AB We investigated carbon dynamics in the water column and CO2, and CH4 exchange across the air-water interface in four closed-basin lakes in northern Wisconsin: two with clear, low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) waters and two bog lakes with stained, high-DOG waters. Clear-water lakes quickly became undersaturated following ice-out and remained undersaturated until fall turnover. Bog lakes were supersaturated in CO2 throughout the ice-free season, although surface CO2 concentrations dropped sharply following ice-out and increased again during autumn turnover. Differences in seasonal patterns of CO2 were attributed to morphometry and the timing and intensity of mixing events. Ice-free season fluxes of CO2 were 6.7 and 10.0 mol.m(-2) in the bog lakes and 1.2 and 0.09 mol.m(-2) in the clear-water lakes. Fluxes of CH4 were significant only immediately after ice-out and during autumn turnover and were <0.4 mol.m(-2) in the bog lakes and <0.05 mol.m(-2) in the clear-water lakes. Compared with changes in carbon pools in the lakes, our results indicate rapid carbon turnover rates in bog lakes, as opposed to clear-water lakes. We suggest that allochthonous inputs of CO2 may be responsible for this rapid turnover.

AB 1. Due to its novelty and scale, the EMBER project is a key study within the prescribed burning evidence base. However, it has several significant but overlooked methodological flaws.
   2. In this paper, we outline and discuss these flaws. In doing so, we aim to highlight the current paucity of evidence relating to prescribed burning impacts on ecosystem services within the British uplands.
   3. We show that the results of the EMBER project are currently unreliable because: it used a correlative space-for-time approach; treatments were located within geographically separate and environmentally distinct sites; environmental differences between sites and treatments were not accounted for during statistical analysis; and, peat surface temperature results are suggestive of measurement error.
   4. Policy Implications. Given the importance of the EMBER project, our findings suggest that (a) government agencies and policymakers need to re-examine the strengths and limitations of the prescribed burning evidence base; and, (b) future work needs to control for site-specific differences so that prescribed burning impacts on ecosystem services can be reliably identified.

AB Moorlands are unique environments found in uplands of the temperate zone including in the UK, New Zealand and Ireland, and in sorne high altitude tropical zones such as the Andean paramos. Many have been managed through grazing, burning or drainage practices. However, there are a number of other environmental and social factors that are likely to drive changes in management practice over the next few decades. Some moorlands have been severely degraded and in some countries conservation and restoration schemes are being attempted, particularly to revegetate bare soils. Native or non-native woodland planting may increase in some moorland environments while atmospheric deposition of many pollutants may also vary. Moorland environments are very sensitive to changes in management, climate or pollution. This paper reviews how environmental management change, such as changes in grazing or burning practices, may impact upon moorland processes based on existing scientific understanding. It also reviews the impacts of changes in climate and atmospheric deposition chemistry. The paper focuses on the UK moorlands as a case study of moorland landscapes that are in different states of degradation. Future research that is required to improve our understanding of moorland processes is outlined. The paper shows that there is a need for more holistic and spatial approaches to understanding moorland processes and management. There is also a need to develop approaches that combine understanding of interlinked social and natural processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We characterized peat decomposition at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA, to a depth of 2m to ascertain the underlying chemical changes using Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) and related these changes to decomposition proxies C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. FT IR determined that peat humification increased rapidly between 30 and 75cm, indicating a highly reactive intermediate-depth zone consistent with changes in C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. Peat decomposition at the MEF, especially in the intermediate-depth zone, is mainly characterized by preferential utilization of O-alkyl-C, carboxyl-C, and other oxygenated functionalities with a concomitant increase in the abundance of alkyl- and nitrogen-containing compounds. Below 75cm, less change was observed but aromatic functionalities and lignin accumulated with depth. Significant correlations with humification indices, identified by FT IR spectroscopy, were found for C:N ratios. Incubation studies at 22 degrees C revealed the highest methane production rates, greatest CH4:CO2 production ratios, and significant O-alkyl-C utilization within this 30 and 75cm zone. Oxygen-containing functionalities, especially O-alkyl-C, appear to serve as excellent proxies for soil decomposition rate and should be a sensitive indicator of the response of the solid phase peat to increased temperatures caused by climate change and the field study manipulations that are planned to occur at this site. Radiocarbon signatures of microbial respiration products in deeper pore waters at the MEF resembled the signatures of more modern dissolved organic carbon rather than solid phase peat, indicating that recently photosynthesized organic matter fueled the bulk of subsurface microbial respiration. These results indicate that carbon cycling at depth at the MEF is not isolated from surface processes.

AB Allochthonous organic carbon in aquatic systems is metabolized by heterotrophic bacteria, with significant consequences for the biostructure and energy pathways of freshwater ecosystems. The degree to which allochthonous substrates support growth of bacteria is largely dependent on bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), i.e., bacterial production ( BP) per unit of assimilated carbon. Here we show how the spatial variability of BGE in the boreal region can be mediated by the distribution of the two dominating landscape elements forest and mires. Using an 11 days bioassay approach, the production and respiration of bacteria were measured in water samples from nine small Swedish streams (64 degrees N 19 degrees E), representing a gradient ranging from organic carbon supplied mainly from peat mires to carbon supplied mainly from coniferous forests. BP was positively correlated to forest coverage (%) of the catchment, while bacterial respiration was similar in all streams. Consequently, BGE showed a strong positive correlation with forest coverage. Partial least square regression showed that BGE was chiefly regulated by qualitative properties of the organic material, indicated by the absorbance ratio a254/a365 plus C/N and C/P ratios. The data suggest that a share of the organic carbon pool, drained mainly from forest soils, had a potential of being incorporated into bacterial biomass with great efficiency. Its potential for supporting growth was probably nutrient regulated as indicated by inorganic nutrient enrichment experiments.

AB Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 bm mumol m(-2) s(-1) for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m(-2) year- 1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m(-2) year(-1). These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal.

AB UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to characterize the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the inflows and in the outflow of the large and shallow temperate Lake Vortsjarv and to determine its temporal and spatial dynamics in 2008-2010. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was influenced by water temperature, precipitation, stream gradient, discharge, and percentage of peatland in the catchment area and its mean annual values by rivers varied from 9.2 to 27.7 mg L-1. Higher DOC values in the outflow in summer/autumn corresponded to periods of intensive phytoplankton development whereas lower values were observed in winter or early spring when biological processes are at a standstill. The results of specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and 285 nm (SUVA(285)) showed domination of fulvic acids in the rivers. According to our spectroscopic results, the aromaticity of DOM increased with the increasing percentage of peatland and forest and with the decreasing percentage of arable land in the river catchments.

   CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Changes in the pattern of Plant distribution have been studied over thirteen years on a rewetted surface forming a shallow basin within abandoned peat cuttings. While complete inundation has reduced competition from Molinia caerulea and Betula, it has been followed by the death of Sphagnum cuspidatum, previously growing as rafts in ditches.
   The most successful expansion of Sphagnum cover has occurred where tussocks have become waterlogged, rather than inundated. Vegetation has been slow to develop over open water. Where Molinia is dominant, managers of cutover peatlands should aim to stabilise levels to achieve waterlogged conditions over the largest possible area. Water characteristics are closer to those of poor fen than raised bog. It may be that conditions sufficiently wet for Sphagnum establishment on cutover surfaces in central and eastern England can only be achieved by creating a poor fen environment in the first instance.

AB This study considers the impact of managed rotational burning of vegetation and sheep grazing upon the composition of soil waters within an upland peat soil. The study has considered soil water compositions from a complete factorial design of treatment plots where three different burning treatments were considered in replication with grazing and no grazing. All plots were sampled across a complete year with three dipwells in each plot. The study included aluminium (Al), iron, calcium, sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium, sulphate, chloride (Cl-), bromide, fluoride, phosphate (pO(4)(3-)) and nitrate; and in order to clarify the nature of the results, the pH, conductivity and dissolved organic carbon were also considered, but the major results for these are reported elsewhere. The study finds: (1) Ca, Na, Mg and pO(4)(3-) concentrations are significantly lower on all burnt plots, with only Al concentration being significantly higher on burnt plots. (2) Only Cl- showed any significant changes (a decrease) with the presence of sheep grazing, and then only when plots were also burnt. (3) A principal component analysis shows that the composition of most soil waters can be described by rainwater and soil water components, but in unburnt plots a base-rich, high ionic strength water is sometimes present.
   The study suggests that burning, but not grazing, caused significant changes in soil water composition leading to increased interaction between incoming rainwaters and the peat soil but led to loss of interaction with deeper waters. However, no evidence was found for structural change in the soils even after long term (50 years) grazing and burning management. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Radiocarbon (C-14) ages were determined for 10 iron samples from the war booty offering site in the Nydam peat bog (SE Denmark), and compared to archaeologically inferred periods of deposition. Additional C-14 measurements were carried out for modern iron standards made with charcoal of known isotopic composition to evaluate possible effects of handling. Modern iron standards give depleted C-14 concentrations, compared to the initial charcoal C-14 composition, and may indicate carbon fractionation effects during carbon dissolution in the iron lattice. Further studies are needed to verify if this is a common effect during iron production. C-14 dating of two swords and one ax head are in comparatively good agreement with expected deposition times and indicate only small old-wood effects. In contrast, C-14 dating of iron rivets from the Nydam (B) oak boat proved difficult due to corrosion with siderite (FeCO3) and conservation with wax. A step-combustion procedure was applied, using a low (similar to 570-600 degrees C) temperature prior to the high (similar to 970-1000 degrees C) combustion temperature for carbon extraction, aiming to remove siderite and wax before collecting the original carbon dissolved in the iron lattice. Nevertheless, measured C-14 ages of the iron rivets differ by about 200-300 years from the dendro-date of the Nydam (B) oak boat they belong to, indicating persisting aging effects (e.g. old-wood, contamination with fossil carbon added during iron making and/or handling prior C-14 dating). Also, a possible recycling of older iron cannot be excluded.

AB Electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry (ESI-IMS) was used to detect atrazine in a synthetic water sample that contained 0.01 M KCl and water that was collected from a natural cranberry bog. The bog water contained humic substances and had a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of 16 mg/l, There was no interference from these matrices observed in ESI-IMS measurements. The analytical merits of ESI-IMS for direct water sampling and detection are reported. A dynamic response range of more than 2 orders of magnitude and a limit of detection in the nanomolar range were obtained. In addition, results of the ESI-IMS method were compared with conventional spectra obtained by HPLC with UV detection. Concentration measurements for atrazine in bog water determined with ESI-IMS matched those obtained by HPLC. Successful detection of the target compound in a complex water matrix indicated that ESI-IMS could be used as a fast screening technique for solution-phase environmental samples. Results from this study provide fundamental information necessary for constructing a field-monitoring device based on the ESI-IMS technique. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Little is known about the sources and processing of selenium, an important toxicant and essential micronutrient, within boreal and sub-arctic environments. Upon climate warming and permafrost thaw, the behavior of Se in northern peatlands becomes an issue of major concern, because a sizable amount of Se can be emitted to the atmosphere from thawing soils and inland water surfaces and exported to downstream waters, thus impacting the Arctic biota. Working toward providing a first-order assessment of spatial and temporal variation of Se concentration in thermokarst waters of the largest frozen peatland in the world, we sampled thaw lakes and rivers across a 750-km latitudinal profile. This profile covered sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost regions of western Siberia Lowland (WSL), where we measured dissolved (<0.45 mu m) Se concentration during spring (June), summer (August), and autumn (September). We found maximum Se concentration in the discontinuous permafrost zone. Considering all sampled lakes, Se exhibited linear relationship (R-2 = 0.7 to 0.9, p < 0.05, n approximate to 70) with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration during summer and autumn. Across the permafrost gradient, the lakes in discontinuous permafrost regions demonstrated stronger relationship with DOC and UV-absorbance compared to lakes in sporadic/isolated and continuous permafrost zones. Both seasonal and spatial features of Se distribution in thermokarst lakes and ponds suggest that Se is mainly released during thawing of frozen peat. Mobilization and immobilization of Se within peat-lake-river watersheds likely occurs as organic and organo-Fe, Al colloids, probably associated with reduced and elemental Se forms. The increase of active layer thickness may enhance leaching of Se in the form of organic complexes with aromatic carbon from the deep horizons of the peat profile. Further, the northward shift of permafrost boundaries in WSL may sizably increase Se concentration in lakes of continuous permafrost zone.

AB Only a few studies have considered the N budget of peat soils and this in turn has limited the ability of studies to consider the impact of changes in climate and atmospheric deposition upon the N budget of a peat soil. This study considered the total N budget of an upland peat-covered catchment over the period 1993 to 2009. The study has shown:
   i) Over the period of study the total N atmospheric deposition declined from 3.5 to 0.7 tonnes N/km(2)/yr.
   ii) The total fluvial export of N at soil source varied from 0.41 to 1.85 tonnes N/km(2)/yr with the fluvial flux being greater than the atmospheric input in 3 years of the study, implying significant internal processing.
   iii) Measuring the C:N ratio of organic matter pools in the ecosystem shows that gross primary productivity and litter decomposition represent outputs of N from the soil while DOC production and humification represent inputs of N.
   iv) Overall, the total N budget of the peat ecosystem varies from -1.0 to +2.5 tonnes N/km(2)/yr, i.e.in some years the ecosystem is a net source of N.
   The time series of the total N budget suggests that the ecosystem is responding to the occurrence of severe droughts with a long-term decline in N storage that could be interpreted as a response to long-term high N deposition rates, even if those rates have now diminished.

AB Permafrost thawing and erosion results in the enrichment of northern lakes by soil organic matter. These allochthonous inputs favour bacterial decomposition and may cause the draw-down of dissolved oxygen to anoxic conditions that promote methanogenesis. Our objective in the present study was to determine the seasonal variations in dissolved oxygen in a set of permafrost peatland lakes in subarctic Quebec, Canada, and to relate these changes to metabolic rates, ice cover, and mixing. The lakes had high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and their surface waters in summer had greenhouse gas concentrations that were up to one (CO2) to three (CH4) orders of magnitude above air-equilibrium values, indicating their strongly heterotrophic character. Consistent with these observations, the peatland lakes had elevated rates of bacterial production and oxygen consumption. Continuous measurements of oxygen by in situ sensors and of ice cover by automated field cameras showed that the lakes became fully anoxic shortly after freeze-up. The waters were partially re-oxygenated by mixing events in spring and fall, but in one lake, the bottom waters remained anoxic throughout the year. These observations provide a foundation for subsequent bio-geochemical and modelling studies of peatland thaw lakes as an abundant class of Arctic freshwater ecosystems.

AB This study uses 2 years of data from a detailed weekly water sampling programme in a 11.4 km(2) upland peat catchment in the Northern Pennines, UK. The sampling comprised precipitation, soil-water samples and a number of streams, including the basin outlet. Samples were analysed for: pH, conductivity, alkalinity, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Total N, SO4, Cl and colour. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify end-members and compositional trends in order to identify controls on the development of water composition. The study showed that the direct use of PCA had several advantages over the use of end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) as it combines an analysis of mixing and evolving waters without the assumption of having to know the compositional sources of the water. In its application to an upland peat catchment, the study supports the view that shallow throughflow at the catotelm/acrotelm boundary is responsible for storm runoff generation and shows that baseflow is controlled by cation exchange in the catotelm and mixing with a base-rich groundwater.

AB Ireland reported the highest non-compliance with respect to total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) in drinking water across the 27 European Union Member States for the year 2010. We carried out a GIS-based investigation of the links between geographical parameters and catchment land-uses with TFHMs concentrations in Irish drinking water. A high risk catchment map was created using peat presence, rainfall (>1400 mm) and slope (<5%) and overlain with a map comprising the national dataset of routinely monitored TTHM concentrations. It appeared evident from the map that the presence of peat, rainfall and slope could be used to identify catchments at high risk to TTHM exceedances. Furthermore, statistical analyses highlighted that the presence of peat soil with agricultural land was a significant driver of TTHM exceedances for all treatment types. PARAFAC analysis from three case studies identified a fluorophore indicative of reprocessed humic natural organic matter as the dominant component following treatment at the three sites. Case studies also indicated that (1) chloroform contributed to the majority of the TTHMs in the drinking water supplies and (2) the supply networks contributed to about 30141:1 of TTHMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the enhanced organic matter decomposition induced by climate warming as well as increased external nitrogen (N) inputs, increased soil N availability in wetlands can alter soil enzyme activities and hence ecosystem C dynamics. An incubation experiment was conducted to assess the effects of increased N availability on soil enzyme activities in freshwater marsh and peatland of Northeast China. N was added as ammonium nitrate solution at four levels (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg N/g soil for N0, N1, N2, and N3, respectively). Results showed that the effect of N availability increasing on soil enzyme activities varied with soil types, fertilization rates, and incubation times. Increased N availability inhibited urease activity in marsh soils throughout the incubation, whereas N2 and N3 treatments suppressed urease activity in peat soils only at 6 days. Marsh soil invertase activity increased after 15 days of incubation because of N addition. N availability increasing stimulated the peat soil protease activity initially, but negative effect was observed at the end of incubation. In both soils, increased N availability had no effect on acid phosphatase except for N3 treatment at 27 days. With increased N addition levels, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased in marsh soils, but did not change in peat soils. These findings suggest that, in marsh ecosystems, increased N availability alters soil urease and invertase activities and DOC pool, and thus changes the soil organic C dynamics. However, soil urease and DOC are not sensitive to N availability increasing in peat soils.

AB This study uses detailed monitoring of a peat catchment to estimate the amount of DOC loss within a stream. The study compares DOC concentrations and specific absorbances (absorbance at 400 nm per concentration of DOC) of shallow and deep soil waters with those at the catchment Outlet. The mass balance between source and outlet is assessed by two methods: a simple method based upon a conservative tracer, and one based upon a principal component analysis using multiple tracers. The single tracer method suggests an average removal of 20% while the principal component approach suggests 32% removal. The rate of removal varies between 0.03 and 23 mg C/day. On an annual basis the removal amounts to between 45.8 and 85 ton C/year, equivalent to an areal loss of between 4 and 7.4 g C/m(2)/year. The change in specific absorbance, at 400 nm, shows that the DOC is sourced from shallow soil water (10 cm) and not from the deep soil water (50 cm). There is consistent increase in specific absorbance through the catchment. The rate of removal is zero-order with respect to DOC concentration but shows significant decrease with increasing specific absorbance and stream residence time. The study shows that by accounting for the loss of DOC within the streams of the catchment, the catchment is close to balance with respect to carbon and is a smaller carbon sink than previously estimated.

AB Fertiliser use in agriculture increases the non-point pollution of waters with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Wetland buffer zones (WBZs) are wetland ecosystems between agricultural lands and water bodies that protect surface waters from non-point source pollution. We assessed how vegetation harvesting within WBZs impacts their N and P removal efficiency, nutrient uptake by plants and their biomass quality. We surveyed vegetation of a spontaneously rewetted fen along a small river in Poland, and analysed plant biomass, its nutrient contents and nutrient-leaching potential and the water chemistry. Total N removal reached 34-92% and total P removal 17-63%. N removal was positively related to the initial N concentration, regardless of mowing status. We found a high N removal efficiency (92%) in the harvested site. Vegetation of mown sites differed from that of unmown sites by a higher water-leached carbon and P contents in the biomass. We found that vegetation harvesting may stimulate the overall N removal, but may increase potential biomass decomposability, which eases the recycling of plant-incorporated nutrients back to WBZ. Thus, mowing should always be followed by the removal of biomass. Neglecting already mown WBZs may temporarily lower their nutrient removal efficiency due to potentially faster decomposition of plant biomass.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns in streamwater acidity are ecologically important, but difficult to measure in parallel. Here we present the spatial distribution of streamwater chemistry relevant to acidity from 60 stream sites distributed throughout a 67 km(2) boreal catchment, sampled during a period of winter baseflow (high pH) and during a spring flood episode (low pH). Sites were grouped based on pH level and pH change from winter baseflow to spring flood. The site attributes of each pH group were then assessed in terms of both stream chemistry and subcatchment landscape characteristics. Winter baseflow pH was high throughout most of the stream network (median pH 6.4), but during the spring flood episode stream sites experienced declines in pH ranging from 0-1.6 pH units, resulting in pH ranging from 4.3-6.3. Spring flood pH was highest in larger, lower altitude catchments underlain by fine sorted sediments, and lowest in small, higher altitude catchments with a mixture of peat wetlands and forested till. Wetland-dominated headwater catchments had low but stable pH, while the spring flood pH drop was largest in a group of catchments of intermediate size which contained well-developed coniferous forest and a moderate proportion of peat wetlands. There was a trend with distance downstream of higher pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and base cation concentrations together with lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC, strongly negatively correlated with pH). This apparent scale-dependence of stream chemistry could be explained by a number of environmental factors which vary predictably with altitude, catchment area and distance downstream-most notably, a shift in surficial sediment type from unsorted till and peat wetlands to fine sorted sediments at lower altitudes in this catchment. As a result of the combination of spatial heterogeneity in landscape characteristics and scale-related processes, boreal catchments like this one can be expected to experience high spatial variability both in terms of chemistry at any given point in time, and in the change experienced during high discharge episodes. Although chemistry patterns showed associations with landscape characteristics, considerable additional variability remained, suggesting that the modeling of dynamic stream chemistry from map parameters will continue to present a challenge.

AB In this paper, CH4 flux was measured from Nov. 2002 to Oct. 2005, to estimate CH4 emissions in winter and during freeze-thaw period, and interannual variation in CH4 emissions in freshwater marsh in northeast China. The results showed that there was an obvious CH4 emission (0.1-2.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in the freshwater marsh in winter. Flux of CH4 in winter (November to March the next year) was about 3.8%, 5.5%, and 2.2% of the whole year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Emission of CH4 significantly increased during the freeze-thaw period (April-June), and was about 30.8%, 20.9%, and 20.6% of the whole year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Standing water depth greatly governed interannual variation of CH4 emissions from marshes during the thaw-freeze period. Interannual variation of CH4 emissions was significant during the growing season (p < 0.05). Standing water depth during April to June was a primary factor, which affected the interannual variation of CH4 flux during the growing season. Precipitation during the preceding non-growing season affected CH4 emission indirectly via standing water depth. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands function as important climate regulators by providing conditions for the large-scale production and release of methane from vegetation. Several studies have suggested an apparent link between two global warminggases that result in higher emissions of methane from rice paddies and wetlands subjected to elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. We show that an increase in the relative abundance of methane-producing archaea isolated from the rhizosphere of a highly invasive plant was associated with enhanced plant biomass from CO2-stimulated roots. Methane emissions from a cattail invasive to North America Typha angustifolia (narrow leaf cattail) increased 148% under an enriched atmosphere of CO2 (700 ppm). Root biomass also increased under elevated CO2 for T. angustifolia and was correlated with methane flux, suggesting that future CO2 stimulation may lead to higher methane emissions from Typha-dominated wetlands.

AB Water discolouration is one of the key water quality problems faced by UK water companies taking raw water from peatland catchments. A water colour model has been developed using a combined Geographical Information System and Multicriteria Evaluation approach. The model was used to predict water colour production potential based on key land management practices controlling colour production in UK upland catchments. Calibration of the model with historic data collected at water treatment works treating water from upland areas showed that the model was potentially capable of accurately predicting water colour production potential at the catchment scale (c. 90%). Subsequent validation has shown this to be the case. Rotational heather burning and vegetation type (particularly heather) were identified as the two most statistically significant variables influencing water colour generation in the study catchments. It was predicted that colour is generated in particular hotspots and management to improve water quality should, therefore, focus on such areas. Blending of water is also an important process in controlling colour at the catchment scale and at water treatment works, with high colour often being diluted by runoff from land elsewhere in the catchment with lower potential to generate colour.

ID LIMITING NUTRIENTS; LONG-TERM; NITROGEN; CATCHMENT; SITE
AB Soil solution was collected to identify seasonal trends in its chemistry and to examine relationships between the concentrations of ions and variables that may control them. Samples were collected fortnightly at 10 cm and 50 cm depth in a blanket peat soil at Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve in the northern Pennine uplands of England. Dissolved organic carbon at 10 cm peaked each summer and correlated most strongly with temperature. At both depths Na+ and Cl- were the dominant ions, reflecting the oceanic climate. Over the 3-year sampling period, concentrations of the principal anions and cations at 10 cm varied little except during the autumns of 1994 and 1995 following unusually dry summers. At these times concentrations of SO42--S increased from < 3 <mu>mol to a maximum of 430 mu mol and were balanced by smaller increases in Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and H+. The SO42- concentration at 10 cm was most strongly correlated with depth to the water table 3 weeks prior to sampling. At 50 cm depth in the peat a small increase in SO42- occurred only during the autumn of 1995, and the concentration of SO42- at this depth correlated most strongly with that at 10 cm. At neither depth were there any strong correlations with deposition. The increase in H+ concentration associated with the peak in SO42- at 10 cm depth represents a fall in pH from usual values around 4.2 to 3.5.

AB Solute concentrations in stream water vary with discharge in patterns that record complex feedbacks between hydrologic and biogeochemical processes. In a comparison of three shale-underlain headwater catchments located in Pennsylvania, USA (the forested Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory), and Wales, UK (the peatland-dominated Upper Hafren and forest-dominated Upper Hore catchments in the Plynlimon forest), dissimilar concentration-discharge (C-Q) behaviors are best explained by contrasting landscape distributions of soil solution chemistry - especially dissolved organic carbon (DOC) - that have been established by patterns of vegetation and soil organic matter (SOM). Specifically, elements that are concentrated in organic-rich soils due to biotic cycling (Mn, Ca, K) or that form strong complexes with DOC (Fe, Al) are spatially heterogeneous in pore waters because organic matter is heterogeneously distributed across the catchments. These solutes exhibit non-chemostatic behavior in the streams, and solute concentrations either decrease (Shale Hills) or increase (Plynlimon) with increasing discharge. In contrast, solutes that are concentrated in soil minerals and form only weak complexes with DOC (Na, Mg, Si) are spatially homogeneous in pore waters across each catchment. These solutes are chemostatic in that their stream concentrations vary little with stream discharge, likely because these solutes are released quickly from exchange sites in the soils during rainfall events. Furthermore, concentration-discharge relationships of non-chemostatic solutes changed following tree harvest in the Upper Hore catchment in Plynlimon, while no changes were observed for chemostatic solutes, underscoring the role of vegetation in regulating the concentrations of certain elements in the stream. These results indicate that differences in the hydrologic connectivity of organic-rich soils to the stream drive differences in concentration behavior between catchments. As such, in catchments where SOM is dominantly in lowlands (e.g., Shale Hills), we infer that non-chemostatic elements associated with organic matter are released to the stream early during rainfall events, whereas in catchments where SOM is dominantly in uplands (e.g., Plynlimon), these non-chemostatic elements are released later during rainfall events. The distribution of SOM across the landscape is thus a key component for predictive models of solute transport in headwater catchments.

AB Soil freeze-thaw cycles in the winter-cold zone can substantially affect soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, and deserve special consideration in wetlands of cold climates. Semi-disturbed soil columns from three natural wetlands (Carex marsh, Carex marshy meadow and Calamagrostis wet grassland) and a soybean field that has been reclaimed from a wetland were exposed to seven freeze thaw cycles. The freeze-thaw treatments were performed by incubating the soil columns at -10 degrees C for 1 d and at 5 degrees C for 7 d. The control columns were incubated at 5 degrees C for 8 d. After each freeze-thaw cycle, the soil solution was extracted by a solution extractor installed in each soil layer of the soil column, and was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The results showed that freeze thaw cycles could increase DOC, NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations in soil solutions, and decrease TDP concentrations. Moreover, the changes of DOC, NH4+-N, NO3--N and TDP concentrations in soil solutions caused by freeze thaw cycles were different in various sampling sites and soil layers. The increments of DOC concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles were greater in the wetland soil columns than in the soybean field soil columns. The increments of NH4+-N concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles decreased with the increase of soil depth. The depth variation in the increments of NO3--N concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles in the wetland soil columns was different from that in the soybean field soil columns. The decrements of TDP concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles were greater in columns of Carex marsh and Carex marshy meadow than in columns of Calamagrostis wet grassland and the soybean field. The study results provide information on the timing of nutrient release related to freezing and thawing in natural versus agronomic soils, and have implications for the timing of nutrient application in farm fields in relation to water quality protection.

AB PurposeSmall arm shooting ranges located in peatland areas are gathering increased attention due to severe metal and antimony (Sb) contamination and challenging conditions for remediation. The goal of the present study was to gain further understanding of the distribution, binding and transport of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and Sb in peatland contaminated by small arm shooting range activities.Materials and methodsA field experiment was carried out at a recently closed shooting range facility in Norway, including (i) peat soil sampling for various selective extractions (water, chemical extractions, extractions by diffusive gradients in thin films, DGT), (ii) establishing groundwater wells for groundwater sampling and monitoring of groundwater level and (iii) sampling of water and sediments in surface water. The results from groundwater monitoring were used to carry out hydrogeological numerical simulations using Seep/W and CTran/W. These models were used to evaluate the residence time of the contaminants in the peatland.Results and discussionIncreased metal concentrations were observed in the top layer of the peatland, indicating low vertical transport. Groundwater revealed high concentrations of Pb (225g/L), Cu (16 +/- 6g/L) and Sb (11 +/- 2g/L), the dominating contaminant source to the downstream surface water. Hydrogeological modelling indicated that transport mainly happened in the upper peat layer, as a result of a higher hydraulic conductivity close to the surface and a high groundwater table. Pb (6.9 +/- 0.1g/L), Cu (24.0 +/- 0.0g/L) and Sb (7.4 +/- 0.1g/L) concentrations in the stream samples confirmed the spreading of contaminants at levels toxic to aquatic organisms. Pb and Cu were most likely associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), whereas Sb showed no correlation with DOC.Conclusions The elements contaminating the peatland may leak to the nearby water course over a long-term period. Copper showed the highest concentration in the stream water despite considerably higher levels of Pb in the peat soil. Strong complexation of Cu to dissolved organic matter might explain this observation. Only a little fraction of the contaminants is transported in a particulate form, and therefore are increased sedimentation measures not considered as viable remediation option.

AB Regular bi-weekly additions of NH4NO3, equivalent to a rate of 3 g N m(-2) yr(-1), were applied to cores of Sphagnum capillifolium, inhabiting hummocks and S. recurvum a pool and hollow colonizer, in a raised bog in north east Scotland. Microbial biomass C and N, both measured by chloroform extraction, showed similar seasonal patterns and, for most depths, the effects of added N on microbial biomass C and N changed with time. The addition of inorganic N had greatest effect during October when the water table had risen to the surface and microbial C and N in the untreated cores had decreased. Microbial C and N were maintained at 75 g C m(-2) and 8.3 g N m(-2) above the values in the untreated cores and far exceeded the amounts of N that had been added up to that date (1 g N m(-2)) as NH4NO3. This increased microbial biomass was interpreted as leaching of carbonaceous material from the NH4NO3 treated moss resulting in greater resistance of the microbial biomass to changes induced by the rising water table. Treatment with N also caused significant reductions in extractable dissolved organic N (DON) at 10-15 cm depth, beneath the surface of the moss, but at lower depths to 25 cm no changes were observed. Extracted dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not affected by N treatment and showed less seasonal variation than DON, such that the C:N ratio of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all depths increased from approximately 4 in July to around 30 in December.

AB Better knowledge of spatial and temporal delivery of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in small catchments is required to understand the mechanisms behind reported longterm changes in C fluxes from some peatlands. We monitored two storms with contrasting seasons and antecedent conditions in a small upland UK moorland catchment. We examined DOC concentrations and specific UV absorbance (SUVA at 285 nm), together with solute concentrations required to undertake end-member mixing analyses to define dominant flow paths contributing to streamflow. This was combined with laboratory soil-solution equilibrations. We aimed to resolve how seasonal biogeochemical processing of DOC and flowpath changes in organo-mineral soils combine to affect DOC exported via the stream. An August storm following a dry period gave maximum DOC concentration of 10 mg l(-1). Small DOC: DON ratios (16-28) and SUVA (2.7-3.6 l mg(-1) m(-1)) was attributed to filtration of aromatic compounds associated with up to 53% B horizon flow contributions. This selective filtration of high SUVA DOC was reproduced in the experimental batch equilibration system. For a November storm, wetter antecedent soil conditions led to enhanced soil connectivity with the stream and seven times greater DOC stream-load (maximum concentration 16 mg l(-1)). This storm had a 63% O horizon flow contribution at its peak, limited B horizon buffering and consequently more aromatic DOC (SUVA 3.9-4.5 l mg(-1) m(-1) and DOC: DON ratio 35-43). We suggest that simple mixing of waters from different flow paths cannot alone explain the differences in DOC compositions between August and November and biogeochemical processing of DOC is required to fully explain the observed stream DOC dynamics. This preliminary evidence is in contrast to other studies proposing hydrological controls on the nature of DOC delivered to streams. Although our study is based only on two storms of very different hydrological and biogeochemical periods, this should promote wider study of DOC biogeochemical alteration in headwaters so that this be better incorporated in modelling to predict the impacts of changes in DOC delivery to, and fate in, aquatic systems.

AB This study proposes a multicomponent, multiprocess scheme to explain the turnover of organic matter (particulate and dissolved organic matter) in streams. The scheme allows for production and degradation of organic matter by both photic and aphotic processes with transformation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to increasingly refractory forms. The proposed scheme was compared to 10months of experimental observations of the turnover and fate of particulate and dissolved organic matter in stream water from a peat-covered catchment. The scheme was able to explain average decline in DOC concentration of 65% over 70h with a 13% mean average percentage error based on turnover in three types of organic matter (particulate, labile dissolved, and refractory dissolved) although the order and rate of reactions did change between sets of experimental observations. The modeling suggests that activation energies are low for all except the most refractory forms of DOC in turn, suggesting that processes are not sensitive to temperature change. Application of the modeling scheme to organic matter turnover in the River Tees, northern England, showed that annual removal of total organic carbon was equivalent to between 13 and 33 tC/km(2)/yr from an at source export of between 22 and 56 tC/km(2)/yr giving a total in-stream loss rate of between 53 and 62% over a median in-stream residence time of 35h.

AB Water purification is one of the most essential services provided by wetlands. A lot of concerns regarding wetlands subjected to climate change relate to their susceptibility to hydrological change and the increase in temperature as a result of global warming. A warmer condition may accelerate the rate of decomposition and release of nutrients, which can be exported downstream and cause serious ecological challenges; e.g., eutrophication and acidification. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of climate change on water quality in peatland and constructed wetland ecosystems subject to water level management. For this purpose, the authors simulated the current climate scenario base on the database from Malmo? station (Scania, Sweden) for 2016 and 2017 as well as the future climate scenarios for the last 30 years of the century based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and different regional climate models (RCM) for a region wider than Scania County. For future climate change, the authors simulated low (RCP 2.6), moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate scenarios. All simulations were conducted within climate chambers for experimental peatland and constructed wetland mesocosms. Our results demonstrate that the effect of climate scenario is significantly different for peatlands and constructed wetlands (interactive effect) for the combined chemical variables. The warmest climate scenario RCP 8.5 is linked to a higher water purification function for constructed wetlands, but to a lower water purification function and a subsequent deterioration of peatland water qualities, even if subjected to water level management. The explanation for the different response of constructed wetlands and peatlands to climate change could be due to the fact that the substrate in the constructed wetland mesocosms and peatlands was different in terms of the organic matter quality and quantity. The utilization of nutrients by the plants and microbial community readily exceed the mineralization under a limited nutrient content (as we had in constructed wetland) when the temperature rises. However, concerning the extreme scenario RCP 8.5, the peatlands have shown a tendency to have reverse processes.

AB Boreal wetlands, primarily peatlands, are important global carbon (C) reservoirs and integral components of regional hydrological networks. This paper summarizes our current state of knowledge regarding components of water and nutrient budgets in northern wetlands, with a focus on Canada. Boreal wetland water budgets are strongly influenced by the following: seasonal weather patterns as they relate to the timing of precipitation and meltwater inputs and evapotranspiration (ET) losses; vegetation cover in the wetland and surrounding uplands as it relates to rain and snow interception and evapotranspiration; and connectivity of the wetland to the regional hydrological network. Key factors that influence boreal wetland phosphorus (P) budgets are: spatial and temporal variability in the water table as they relate to reduction-oxidation conditions and rewetting of highly decomposed peat; concentrations of metals and ions involved in P complexation and release; vegetation age and type (herbaceous versus woody); and seasonal weather patterns as they relate to water retention time. As with other components of the boreal forest, wetlands are often limited in bioavailable nitrogen (N), therefore bulk deposition and symbiotic fixation are key N sources. Within many wetlands, N is rapidly cycled through vegetation and microbial communities, and converted to gaseous N or exported as organic N in outflows. In terms of C budgets, boreal wetlands are important reservoirs, converting inorganic and organic C inputs to peat. Climate change and anthropogenic N loading threaten the water and C balance in boreal wetlands.

AB I examined differences in the biogeochemical cycles of CH4 and CO2 (fluxes, concentrations, production, CH4 oxidation) in Typha latifolia wetlands on silty clay sediment versus organic peat soil in central New York State to determine whether variation in the amount of organic matter in sediment or soil, or plant production on sites with different organic matter content, affected variation in CH4 and CO2. I found very high temporal variation in CH4 within each site, precluding the detection of variation in CH4 as a function of sediment or soil organic matter content. In 1994, CH4 efflux from two peat sites to the atmosphere averaged 7 and 87 nmol m(-2) s(-1) compared to 89 and 408 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for two sediment sites. Mean CO2 efflux from the peat sites was 0.40 and 1.51 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared to 1.02 and 1.65 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the sediment sites. I assessed the role of plant production by experimentally removing T. latifolia shoots from small plots: this lowered CH4 efflux from the sediment site by 85%, suggesting that plants foster CH4 production in low organic matter sediment, but CH4 efflux was 14-times greater following shoot removal on one peat site. Shoot removal had no effect on CO2 efflux. Variations in temperature, dissolved organic carbon, and pCH(4) in sediment or soil porewater explained the variation in CH4 efflux among the four study sites, whereas variation in net primary production explained the variation in CO2 efflux.

AB Permafrost-supported peatlands near the southern limit of permafrost are experiencing dramatic landscape changes as a result of recent climate warming, which have the potential to impact aquatic ecosystems through changes in terrestrial run-off. Our objectives were to determine how terrestrial organic matter inputs to aquatic ecosystems in the southern Northwest Territories (Canada) changed as a result of peat subsidence, and whether terrestrial organic matter can be linked to sedimentary mercury. To accomplish this, we analyzed lipid biomarkers, lignin-derived phenols, and other geochemical proxies in sediment cores from two lakes (KAK-1 and TAH-7) affected by recent peat subsidence. Both lakes experienced substantial shifts in organic matter proxies through time, but the trajectory of change differed, reflecting local heterogeneity in hydrological setting and other environmental factors. In KAK-1, recent peat subsidence corresponded to a decrease in lignin-derived phenol yield, increased inferred lignin oxidation, and delta N-15 depletion. In TAH-7, peat subsidence was likely initiated by a local forest fire, and resulted in an increase in the n-alkanol ratio C-30/(C-30 + C-28) (consistent with a warmer, wetter climate), lignin-derived phenol yield (mainly syringyls), and delta C-13 depletion. In TAH-7, total mercury inputs were positively correlated to terrestrial carbon inputs, suggesting allochthonous carbon is an important vector for mercury transport to the lake. In both lakes, an increase in the C-23/(C-23 + C-29) n-alkane ratio was observed and suggests increased organic matter input from Sphagnum mosses. Our results demonstrate how terrestrial landscape changes occurring as a result of peat subsidence can influence carbon accumulation in aquatic ecosystems in discontinuous permafrost zones.

AB Utilization of bottom ash in road construction may lead to a release of contaminants that can affect the soil of the swales constructed along these roads. Column tests were performed to evaluate the retention behavior of Cu, Cr Zn, and Pb, originating from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash leachate, in two substrates: peat and mould (a cultural soil). A chemical sequential extraction method was used to predict the risk associated with the release of the retained elements with modifications of environmental conditions. Apart from the dissolution of organic matter (OM), ash leachate properties hindered the metal transport from peat. Mould was efficient only in removing Zn, making it a less favorable substrate for the leachate control along the roads. Readily soluble forms made up a minor fraction of the retained metals in peat, reducing the risk of metal release due to ion exchange and pH drop. Changes in redox potential might be the main cause of Zn desorption from peat as the Fe-Mn oxides were the main scavengers for this metal. Oxidation of OM would be the primary reason of Cu and Cr release, while for Pb both fractions (Fe-Mn oxides and OM) might equally contribute to the metal discharge.

AB Soil enzymes influence the distribution of organic matter (OM) and play a decisive role in the retention of OM in soil ecosystems. The present study was conducted to assess the role of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes in OM decomposition under dry and submerged moisture conditions and to examine factors affecting their activity in Red and Brown soils. An incubation experiment of 6 mo duration was performed in a randomized complete block design with 10 treatments in triplicates. Rice straw (RS) and green manure (GM) were used at three rates (0, 5, and 25 mg g(-1) soil, expressed as control [CK], RS1, RS2, GM1, and GM2, respectively). The soils were maintained at two water levels: 25% (W1) and 200% (W2). All soil chemical properties and enzymatic activities were measured by standard methods. We found that the activities of soil phenol oxidase and catalase in the Brown soil were 2- and 1.5-fold higher than in the Red soil, respectively. This led to high OM decomposition, resulting in 1.23- and 1.2-fold higher carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and 1.23- and 1.21-fold more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the Brown soil. In contrast, low oxidative enzyme activities in the Red soil decreased C and N mineralization, DOC, DON, reducing sugars (2.58-fold), and amino acids (2.22-fold) but increased the phenolic compounds (1.36-fold). The hydrolytic enzymes (i.e., urease and neutral phosphatase) showed significant correlation (p < 0.01) to amino acids and reducing sugars but showed no correlation to phenolic compounds and soil organic matter (SOM). Conversely, oxidative enzymes (i.e., phenol oxidase and catalase) showed significant correlation (p < 0.01) to phenolic compounds, amino acids, reducing sugars, and SOM. Our results suggest that oxidative enzymes are key components of the pathways involved in the breakdown of organic compounds and OM in soils and consequently act as an "enzymatic latch." We observed that soil water and pH have significant (P < 0.01) effects on soil enzyme activity.

AB NO3, Mn, Fe, and SO4 act as terminal electron acceptors (TEAs), modifying mineralization pathways and coupling biogeochemical cycles. Although single TEA concentrations and fluxes have been intensively studied, the factors regulating the simultaneous fluxes and molar ratios of TEAs are poorly elucidated. We studied the mean concentrations, exports, and molar ratios of TEAs from 27 boreal catchments differing in land cover (percentage of agricultural land, peatland, forest, and built-up area) during the years 2000-2011. TEA exports and molar ratios were strongly controlled by land cover and only a little by atmospheric deposition. Fields produced the highest export of TEAs, particularly NO3. Peatland was linked to low NO3 and SO4, but high Fe exports. NO3, Mn, and Fe exports from forests were low, SO4 having proportionally the highest export. Together, the percentages of field and peatland predicted 93, 80, 75, and 67% of the variation in the export of NO3, Mn, Fe, and SO4, respectively. The variable export of TEAs having different availability and physical behavior may create different premises for anaerobic mineralization in downstream systems, which adds a new dimension to the link between terrestrial system, land use, and environmental problems, such as eutrophication and climate change.

AB As ice wedge degradation and the inundation of polygonal troughs become increasingly common processes across the Arctic, lateral export of water from polygonal soils may represent an important mechanism for the mobilization of dissolved organic carbon and other solutes. However, drainage from ice wedge polygons is poorly understood. We constructed a model which uses cross-sectional flow nets to define flow paths of meltwater through the active layer of an inundated low-centered polygon towards the trough. The model includes the effects of evaporation and simulates the depletion of ponded water in the polygon center during the thaw season. In most simulations, we discovered a strong hydrodynamic edge effect: only a small fraction of the polygon volume near the rim area is flushed by the drainage at relatively high velocities, suggesting that nearly all advective transport of solutes, heat, and soil particles is confined to this zone. Estimates of characteristic drainage times from the polygon center are consistent with published field observations.

AB Background, aim, and scope Fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopies are simple but useful methods to characterize organic matter in the aqueous phase according to its aromatic nature and humification degree. Although there are several studies about porewater and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) from peat, at present, no comparative investigations are available in the literature. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify and compare chemical and spectroscopic features of porewaters and corresponding WEOM samples along a 105-cm undisturbed peat profile.
   Material and methods The peat core was collected in June 2005 from a Swiss ombrotrophic bog and divided into slices of 1 +/- 0.15-cm thickness. Porewater samples (n=91) were extracted and analyzed for pH; from these, 30 samples were filtered (0.45 mu m), analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and characterized by means of UV-vis (E(4)/E(6) ratio) and fluorescence spectroscopies. The same analyses were also carried out on the WEOM of the corresponding peat samples.
   Results and conclusions The results show several differences between porewaters and WEOM throughout the bog profile. In particular, and with the exception of the first ca. 20 cm depth, spectroscopic data clearly underline a more "humic-like" character of DOC of WEOM compared to porewater samples. Furthermore, the trends in E(4)/E(6) ratios of both porewaters and WEOM samples indicate that the organic matter is characterized by decreasing aromaticity, molecular weights, and degree of polycondensation throughout the profile. The high correlation among the bulk density of the peat and the DOC concentrations in both porewaters and WEOM samples demonstrates a clear stratification of the organic matter which suggests that the vertical migration of DOC is rather limited. The first ca. 20 cm of the profile shows also opposite physicochemical and spectroscopic features compared to the deeper horizons probably because this is the predominantly oxic zone with far greater physiological activity of plants and microorganisms.
   Recommendations and perspectives Assessing porewater and WEOM features throughout peat, soil, and sediment profiles is important to better understand water-sediment interface dynamics and translocation processes of organic and inorganic pollutants, especially considering that ombrotrophic bogs are often used as archives of atmospheric depositions.

AB Soil compaction is an often-recorded characteristic of degraded soils, and-along with soil seating and contamination-frequently found in urban habitats. Knowledge about the impact of soil degradation on the ecosystem functioning in urban environments is limited, although urbanization is the major ongoing land use change worldwide. Since urban soils are a potential habitat for soil animals, and burrowing soil fauna exerts a profound impact on the structure and functioning of soils, we studied the impact of increased bulk densities on the ability of Enchytraeus albidus (Enchytraeidae: Oligochaeta) to penetrate compacted soils. Moreover, it was our aim to characterize the influence of the worms on the mobilization of nutrients in urban soils. E. albidus was able to enter compacted sandy loamy soil. columns with a bulk density of up to approx. 1.4 g cm(-3), but only up to approx. 1.0 g cm(-3) in pure sandy soil columns. Soil. compaction increased the amounts of water-extractable sodium (7.5%) and magnesium (13.4%) compared to the non-compacted soil. Presence of E. albidus in the non-compacted soil resulted in higher water-extractabte concentrations of sodium (17.4%), potassium (16.8%), calcium (11.3%), magnesium (13.2%), dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 14.5%) and nitrate (20.4%) in soil, extracts. In the compacted soil, however, the enhanced nutrient availability due to the activity of the enchytraeids was less pronounced than in the non-compacted soil. Although the concentrations of DOC (13.5%), nitrate (15.6%), calcium (5.8%) and magnesium (4.0%) were significantly higher in the presence of E. albidus than in the columns without animals, the performance of the animals was partly impaired. This was most likely due to the higher penetration resistance of the compacted soils. The degree of compaction investigated in this study was relatively low-chosen to allow for the colonization of the soils by E. albidus. We conclude that the observed negative effects of increased bulk densities on the activity of soil enchytraeids can occur in any more frequented city park, thereby decreasing turnover rates and the supply of soil nutrients in urban ecosystems.

AB Diluted solutions of a peat water and a biological wastewater effluent were subjected to coagulation, ozonation, and chlorination. The effects of these pretreatments on the removal of humic substances by activated carbon adsorption were tested. Batch adsorption isotherms were analyzed using a distributed fictive component method, which assumed a logarithmic normal distribution of Freundlich K and a non-adsorbable fraction in the Ideal Adsorption Solution Theory for multicomponent adsorption. Coagulation treatment not only increased adsorbabilities bur also decreased its heterogeneity in terms of multicomponent adsorbates. Ozonation decreased adsorbabilities and increased heterogeneity in adsorbabilities by producing weakly adsorbing compounds. The average Freundlich K decreased, while the Freundlich exponent, lin, and non-adsorbable fraction was increased with ozone consumption. Chlorination showed the same effects as ozonation, However, after ozonation, equilibrium capacity at low activated carbon doses was increased because of the reduced dissolved organic carbon concentration by ozonation, (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

AB Severe drying of soils can lead to cracking and thus the generation of new hydrological pathways. In soils that show hydrophobic behaviour upon drying, it is possible that such flowpaths survive beyond the period of the drought that caused the initial cracking. Change in flowpaths in peat following severe droughts has been proposed as an explanation for tong-term increases in DOC concentration leaving peat-covered catchments across the Northern Hemisphere With changes in climate making dry summers and summer drought more likely in the UK, this study aims to understand whether there have been long-term flowpath changes in a peat soil following a 1 in 33 year drought. The measure used by this study to analyse changes in the flowpaths present in peat soils is the probability of runoff initiation. The probability of runoff initiation represents a method for comparing the occurrence of runoff from the catchment in comparison to the precipitation inputs relative to the antecedent conditions of the catchment. The study examines 1674 rainfall events over a five year period before and after a severe drought and shows that the most important factor for controlling runoff initiation is the total amount of rainfall in any event and that the system is capacity rather than rate limited. The time of year is found to have a significant influence upon the probability of runoff initiation above and beyond the effect of water table depth and rainfall character. However, the study can find no persistent effect of severe drought beyond the period of drought itself, suggesting that, in terms of the factors investigated here, peat flowpaths are stable against changes in drought frequency and severity with climate change and cannot contribute to long-term changes in DOC runoff.

AB Salt marshes form part of the widely distributed intertidal landscape. The salt marshes of the East Frisian barrier island Langeoog (NW Germany) belong to the barrier-connected salt marsh type and were protected by a summer dike that was removed in 2004. In this study, pore water and sediment data were combined to investigate the effects of the de-embankment along a transect including sites on seawater-influenced grassland, high and low salt marsh, and transition zone tidal flat-low salt marsh. Pore waters were sampled with in situ pore water samplers for 13 mo and analysed for trace metals (Fe, Mn), nutrients (NH4+, PO43-), dissolved organic carbon, and sulphate. Additionally, on site measurements of pH and salinity were carried out. Pore water ultrafiltration experiments with 5000 Da MWCO (molecular weight cut off) complemented the water analyses. Sediment samples were taken from hammer corings and were analysed for bulk parameters (total carbon [TC], total inorganic carbon [TIC], total organic carbon [TOC], total sulphur [TS]) and selected major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mn). Additionally, reactive iron and manganese were analysed.
   Sediments along the study transect are characterised by quartz dominance and very low TC (TOC and TIC) and TS contents. The iron content is comparable to other salt marsh sediments. The high percentage of reactive iron (up to 40%) indicates that salt marsh sediments form an important iron source for pore waters, as confirmed by high pore water concentrations of dissolved iron (up to 583 mu M). Dissolved iron in pore waters most likely results from reduction and dissolution of oxidised iron minerals by organic ligands or Fe(II) organic complexes. Iron complexation by humic substances and siderophores in combination with circum-neutral pH values keep iron in solution. Therefore, the studied salt marshes presumably form an important iron reservoir, which may account for elevated pyrite contents frequently observed in Holocene coastal peats.
   Flooding of the salt marsh during a storm surge resulted in a considerable increase in pore water iron (8-fold), manganese (21-fold), phosphate (5-fold), and ammonia (7-fold) concentrations. These results show that seawater restoration (de-embankment) should be handled very carefully, especially with regard to nutrient release and subsequent changes in pore water quality.

AB In this study, the importance of individual soil mineral constituents on humic acid (HA) sorption is evaluated by employing a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped for energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The goal of the study is to observe the microchemical surface composition of model soil colloids and relate the surface microchemical composition to the sorption behavior of a peat soil derived HA on selected model soil colloids. This information is critical to understanding the fate and transport of subsurface contaminants. Results obtained from this study indicate the existence of a correlation between the atomic ratio of (Al+Fe) : Si of soil colloid surfaces and the HA sorption capacity, where those soil colloids with larger values of the (AI+Fe) : Si ratio are able to sorb HA more efficiently. This allows us to predict that the HA sorption capacity for soil colloids increases with progressively increasing states of soil maturity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nearly 1000 Norwegian lakes in catchments with low human activity were surveyed. By covering a wide range of nitrogen (N) deposition (0.1-2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) along a latitudinal and climatic gradient, we clearly demonstrate how nitrogen (N) deposition, climate, and a few key catchment properties, notably the terrestrial vegetation density and the fraction of bogs, together serve as major predictors of concentrations and ratios of carbon, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silicate (Si) in downstream lakes. Inorganic N in lakes was positively correlated with N deposition, while organic N was closely associated with allochthonous dissolved organic carbon. The ratio of NO3 to total N as well as NO3 to total P and NO3 to SiO2 were highly variable, and most of this variability was explained by N deposition; terrestrial vegetation density, as inferred from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; temperature; runoff; and the fraction of bogs in the catchment. Climate-induced changes in element concentrations and elemental ratios could profoundly affect the lake metabolism and community composition. By linking these data with downscaled climate change predictions we may also predict future shifts in element export and element ratios in various lakes with reasonable accuracy.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport during storms is studied because it is important in the annual watershed export budget for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We sampled stream water from two watersheds (upland and wetland-dominated) and three subcatchments (bog, forested wetland, and mineral forest) located within the wetland-dominated watershed during a fall and summer storm to investigate changes in the magnitude and chemical quality of DOM during stormflows. Stormflow export of DOC ranged from 2.3 kg C ha(-1) in the upland watershed to 13.9 kg C ha(-1) in the bog subcatchment. Biodegradable DOC (BDOC) export for these same storms ranged from 0.6 kg C ha(-1) in the upland watershed to 4.2 kg C ha(-1) in the bog subcatchment. The percent BDOC decreased during both storms in the upland watershed, while percent BDOC increased in the three wetland streams. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices further showed that as stream water DOM concentrations increased during stormflows in the upland watershed, the contribution of protein-like fluorescence decreased and humic-like fluorescence increased. However, the contribution of protein-like fluorescence increased and humic-like fluorescence decreased slightly in the three wetland streams. These results indicate that shifts in the biodegradability and chemical quality of DOM are different for upland and wetland watersheds. Taken together, our findings suggest stormflows are responsible for substantial export of BDOC from coastal temperate watersheds. Moreover, we found that PARAFAC modeling of fluorescent DOM is an effective tool for elucidating shifts in the quality of stream water DOM during storms.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) spectra were measured to characterize the dissolved and particulate organic matter in a bog and to investigate the seasonal fluctuation of this organic matter. The optical density spectra in the UV region of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were proportional to lambda(-4) where lambda is the wavelength of incident light. There was also small absorption on the lambda(-4) spectra. The optical density at a wavelength of 280 nm was proportional to the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOG). The spectra and the dependency of optical density on DOC did not vary throughout the investigation period. The UV spectra of acid extractions of particulate organic matter (POM) showed two absorption peaks at the wavelengths of 220 nm and 335 nm. These peaks are well represented by the sum of two Lorentz functions. The ratio of the absorbances, A(280)/A(335), was dependent on the nitrogen/carbon ratio of POM and the chlorophyll fraction in particulate organic carbon (POC), and not dependent on POC itself. The dependency of POC absorption at 280 nm varied with this ratio which fluctuated seasonally.

AB Temporal trends in stream water total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and export were studied in 8 forested headwater catchments situated in eastern Finland. The Seasonal Kendall test was conducted to identify the trends and a mixed model regression analysis was used to describe how catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological variables (e.g. precipitation, air and stream water temperatures, and atmospheric deposition) related to the variation in the concentration and export of stream water TOC. The 8 catchments varied in size from 29 to 494 ha and in the proportion of peatland they contained, from 8 to 70%. Runoff and TOC concentration were monitored for 15-29 years (1979-2006). Trends and variation in TOC levels were analysed from annual and seasonal time series. Mean annual TOC concentration increased significantly in seven of the eight catchments. The trends were the strongest in spring and most apparent during the last decade of the study period. The slopes of the trends were generally smaller than the variation in TOC concentration between years and seasons and between catchments. The annual TOC export showed no clear trends and values were largely determined by the temporal variability in runoff. Annual runoff showed a decreasing trend in two of the eight catchments. Mean annual air and stream water temperatures showed increasing trends, most clearly seen in the summer and autumn series. According to our modeling results. stream water temperature, precipitation and peatland percentage were the most important variables explaining annual and most seasonal TOC concentrations. The atmospheric deposition of SO(4), NH(4), and NO(3) decreased significantly over the study period, but no significant link with TOC concentration was found. Precipitation was the main hydrometeorological driver of the TOC export. We concluded that stream water TOC concentrations and exports are mainly driven by catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological factors rather than trends in atmospheric acid deposition.

AB Despite the importance of soil and surface waters freezing in permafrost landscapes, the behaviour of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients and metals during periodic freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) remains poorly known. The on-going climate warming is likely to increase the frequency of FTC in continental aquatic settings, which could modify the chemical composition of waters. In this study, we conducted 9 repetitive cycles of overnight freezing (similar to 20 degrees C) and 5 h thawing (4 degrees C) in the laboratory using representative 0.22 mu m-filtered waters from NE European permafrost peatland: leachates of vegetation and soil, and natural surface waters (depression, thermokarst lake and river). Only minor (<5%-15%) changes of DOC concentrations, SUVA(254) and molecular weight were observed in all leachates and the depression water. In contrast, several trace elements (Fe, Al, P, Mn, As, and REE) exhibited sizable variations during FTC (>10%). The leachates and the depression water were enriched in trace elements, whereas the thermokarst lake and the river demonstrated a decrease in concentration of Fe (similar to 39 and similar to 94%, respectively), Al (similar to 9 and similar to 85%), and Mn (similar to 10 and similar to 79%) during FTC. Overall, the observations demonstrated an increase in aliphatic low molecular weight organic matter (OM), and the precipitation of Fe, Al hydroxides and organo-mineral particles. Therefore, enhanced of frequency of FTC can favour the release of metals and toxicants from acidic OM-rich surface waters and maintain stable OM-metalscolloids in large lakes and rivers, thus regulating aquatic transport of DOC and metals from soils to the Arctic Ocean.

AB Herbicides that interact with soil organic matter do so with both the solid and the dissolved fractions, so that the distribution of herbicide between the soil solution and solid phases is determined by competitive effects. In the present study, adsorption experiments were carried out with the cationic herbicide paraquat and untreated and acid-washed samples of a peat soil, at different values of pH and ionic strength. Less herbicide was adsorbed onto the untreated peat than onto the acid-washed peat: the difference was due to the presence of exchangeable cations, as demonstrated in experiments carried out by adding Ca2+ to suspensions of acid-washed peat. The results were interpreted by an electrostatic model and the fitting parameters indicated that the adsorption constants were the same for both samples of peat, although the number of binding sites available was different. Simultaneous resolution of the adsorption equilibrium of paraquat for the soil organic matter (SOM) and of the binding equilibrium between paraquat and dissolved organic matter (DOM) enabled the distribution of paraquat between the solid and solution phases to be determined. The increased solubility of the SUM with increasing pH led to a decrease in the fraction of paraquat retained on the peat surface above pH 5.5, which favors the mobility of the herbicide in the soil.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a significant component of carbon and nutrient cycling in fluvial ecosystems. Natural wetlands, as important DOC sources for river and ocean ecosystems, have experienced extensive natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change, hydrological variations and land use change in recent years. The DOC characteristics in surface ponds from contrasting wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China were investigated. Surface ponds at seven sites (two natural phialiform wetlands, three natural riparian wetlands, one degraded wetland and one artificial wetland, i.e., rice paddy) were monitored during the growing seasons of 2009 and 2010. The results show that the surface ponds at the five natural wetland sites exhibited a wide range of DOC concentrations (10.06-48.73 mg L-1) during the study period. The DOC concentrations showed no annual differences (P > 0.05) at all the wetland sites, except one of the phialiform wetland sites. The two phialiform wetlands exhibited higher DOC concentrations than the three riparian wetlands (P < 0.05). The DOC concentration in the surface pond at the artificial wetland site was relatively low (P < 0.05) compared to that at the degraded wetland site. The C/C ratios (the color per carbon unit ratio, Abs(400)/DOC concentration) showed inconsistent variations among these seven wetland sites, while the E4/E6 ratio (Abs(465)/Abs(665), fulvic acid/humic acid) from the surface pond in the rice paddy land exerted 42.07-55.36% reductions (P < 0.05), compared to those at the five natural wetland sites. Furthermore, the E4/E6 ratio in the surface pond at the rice paddy site was significantly lower compared to that at the degraded wetland site (P < 0.05), which indicated that disturbance to wetland DOC in surface ponds might be stronger when natural wetlands were converted to rice paddies in comparison with wetland degradation. This study could not only provide insightful points for understanding the aquatic DOC dynamics from different wetland ecosystems, but also support data information for incorporating the aquatic DOC into the model for regional carbon budgets in the future.

AB We used the carbon isotope composition (C-14 and delta C-13) to measure the source and age of DOC, POC, dissolved CO2 and CH4 (delta C-13 only) released from three natural peat pipes and the downstream catchment outlet of a small peatland in northern England. Sampling under different hydrological extremes (high flows associated with storm events and low flows before or after storms) was used to explore variability in C sources as flow paths change over short periods of time. The d13C composition of organic C differed (delta C-13-DOC -28.6 parts per thousand to -27.6 parts per thousand; delta C-13-POC -28.1 parts per thousand to -26.1 parts per thousand) from that of the dissolved gases (delta C-13-CO2 -20.5 parts per thousand to +1.1 parts per thousand; delta C-13-CH4 -67.7 parts per thousand to -42.0 parts per thousand) and showed that C leaving the catchment was a mixture of shallow/deep pipe and non-pipe sources. The isotopic composition of the dissolved gases was more variable than DOC and POC, with individual pipes either showing C-13 enrichment or depletion during a storm event. The C-14 age of DOC was consistently modern at all sites; POC varied from modern to 653 years BP and evasion CO2 from modern to 996 years BP. Differences in the isotopic composition of evasion CO2 at pipe outlets do not explain the variability in delta C-13 and C-14 at the catchment outlet and suggest that overland flow is likely to be an important source of CO2. Our results also show that the sources of CO2 and CH4 are significantly more variable and dynamic than DOC and POC and that natural pipes vent old, deep peat CO2 and POC (but not DOC) to the atmosphere.

AB Our aim was to determine whether the response of below-ground feedback processes to atmospheric warming affects nutrient dynamics and primary production in a model peatland ecosystem. Specifically, we examined the interactions between a dominant soil animal of a blanket peat ecosystem (Enchytraeidae. Oligochaeta) and microbes in response to soil warming (to 6degreesC above current mean summer temperatures), and the consequences of these interactions for nutrient mineralisation and the growth of the graminoid Festuca ovina L. Enchytraeids reduced soil microbial biomass (total PLFA) by 23%, but did not affect soil nutrient availability or plant nutrient content. Enchytraeids did, however, increase C mineralisation by 8%, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in the soil solution. Atmospheric warming increased plant nutrient uptake (increasing shoot N and P contents by 12 and 11%. respectively). but reduced the function of enchytraeids with respect to their role in DOC release (by 16%). These findings suggest that in the short term, independent of the effects of enchytraeids. warming may have reduced the ability of the soil microbial biomass to immobilise nutrients and may have relaxed the competition for nutrients between plants and microbes in these nutrient poor soils. increasing the ability of plants to act as a nutrient sink. The results suggest that although soil warming may disrupt biological interactions that are presently operating in these ecosystems, this may not necessarily result in detrimental effects on ecosystem function, which we determined by the growth of F. ovina.

AB The Orawa-Nowy Targ Basin is one of only a few areas in the Polish Carpathians with high relative cover of peatlands (12 %). This fraction is declining progressively due to several centuries of peat exploitation for fuel, gardening and balneology. The peatland at Ludimierz near Nowy Targ is regionally important for its high biodiversity but has been scarred by historical and contemporary peat extraction. The current area and fragmentation of peat domes on Ludimierz Bog were assessed, along with the characteristics and condition of the vegetation. Also, topographical changes across areas of peat extraction were analysed using a combination of remote sensing and field study methods in order to identify the locations of modern peat extraction and natural mass movements. The condition of the raised bog and changes in its boundaries were thus deduced, paying attention to the bog's exceptional environmental and landscape values. The area covered by the bog is currently 39 ha and it is divided into three separate domes which are drained by a network of ditches and through discontinuities of the water table at peat extraction areas. The vegetation on extraction areas currently has a higher biomass growth rate than the plant cover on the domes, and is in better condition on the basis of NDVI assessment.

AB The concentration of total Hg was compared among 45 wetlands in three regions of Ontario. Twenty-two of these wetlands were located in the Muskoka-Haliburton Highlands and Temagami - North Bay regions and included bogs, fens, and marshes. Twenty-three were riverine marshes along the St. Lawrence River, near Cornwall, a Great Lakes area of concern, where Hg has been released through industrial activity. Overall, significant but weak negative relationships were found between pH and alkalinity of the surface waters and total water Hg concentrations (r(2) = 0.28-0.30, p < 0.001). A significant positive relationship was found between dissolved organic C and total water Hg (r(2) = 0.30). On average, St. Lawrence wetlands had lower total water Hg when compared with the inland wetlands, While a strong positive relationship was found between sediment organic matter and total sediment Hg concentrations (p < 0.001), the relationship was significantly different between the St. Lawrence and inland wetlands. In general, the St. Lawrence wetlands, despite the proximity to point sources of Hg, actually had lower sediment Hg, likely because of the lower organic matter. However, the St. Lawrence wetlands had twice the amount of Hg per unit of organic matter; the consequences of this difference for methyl mercury production and bioaccumulation need to be addressed.

AB The dissolved CO2 concentration of stream waters is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. This study reconstructs long-term records of dissolved CO2 concentration for the outlets of two large catchments (818 and 586 km(2)) in northern England. The study shows that:
   1. The flux of dissolved CO2 from the catchments (as carbon per catchment area), when adjusted for that which would be carried by the river water at equilibrium with the atmosphere, is between 0 and 0.39 t km (-2) year(-1) for the River Tees and between 0 and 0.65 t km(-2) year(-1) for the River Coquet.
   2. The flux of dissolved CO2 is closely correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and is unrelated to dissolved CO2 export from the headwaters of the study catchments.
   3. The evasion rate Of CO2 from the rivers (as carbon per stream area) is between 0.0 and 1.49 kg m(-2) year(-1), and calculated in-stream productions Of CO2 are estimated as between 0.5 and 2.5% of the stream evasion rate.
   4. By mass balance, it is estimated that 8% of the annual flux of DOC is lost within the streams of the catchment.
   The study shows that the loss Of CO2 from the streams of the Tees catchment is between 3.1 and 7.5 kt year(-1) (as carbon) for the River Tees, which is the same order as annual CH4 flux from peats within the catchment and approximately 50% of the net CO2 exchange to the peats of the catchment.

AB Methane fluxes from a shallow peatland lake (3450 m a.s.l., 1.6 km(2) in area, maximum depth <1 m) on eastern Tibetan Plateau were measured with floating chamber method during May to August, 2009. The overall average of methane emission rate during the study period was 34.71 +/- 29.15 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The occurrence of ebullition among the overall methane flux from Lake Medo was about 74%. The average rate of ebullition was 32.45 +/- 28.31 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which accounted for 93% of the overall average of methane emission. Significant seasonal variation was found for occurrence (P < 0.05) and rate (P < 0.01) of ebullition, both peaking synchronously in mid-summer. Both the occurrence and rate of ebullition were found positively related to sediment temperature but negatively related to lake water depth. The high methane production in the lake sediment was likely fueled by organic carbon loaded from surrounding peatlands to the lake. The shallowness of the water column could be another important favorable factor for methane-containing bubble formation in the sediment and their transportation to the atmosphere. The methane ebullition must have been enhanced by the low atmospheric pressure (ca. 672 hPa) in the high-altitude environment. For a better understanding on the mechanism of methane emission from alpine lakes, more lakes on the Tibetan Plateau should be studied in the future for their methane ebullition.

TI Scale-dependency of hydraulic conductivity: an example from Thorne Moor,
   a raised mire in South Yorkshire, UK
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE peat; raised mire; hydraulic conductivity (K); scale; Thorne Moor
AB The hydraulic conductivity (K) of many low permeability materials is strongly scale-dependent. In raised mires and other types of peat deposit the effects of features such as abandoned infilled ditches, root holes and localized woody material, cause K to be heterogeneous and scale-dependent. Despite this, field measurements are routinely made using auger hole (slug) tests at the scale of only a few tens of centimetres. Such measurements are locally valid, but where the regional subsurface movement of water through peat bogs is simulated using groundwater models, typically at the scale of hundreds of metres, they give rise to a systematic underestimate of flows and an overprediction of water table elevations. Until now, techniques to obtain values at a scale sufficiently large to include the effects of localized features of higher permeability have not been applied routinely.
   Research at Thorne Moor, a large raised mire, demonstrates that the K of peat varies over several orders of magnitude when measured at different scales, using a variety of techniques. Laboratory and auger hole tests cannot be relied upon to provide results that represent the hydraulic conductivity of large expanses of peatland. This has significant implications for the management and long-term restoration of peatlands where both regional and local control of water levels is crucial. For groundwater models to be used successfully to plan such schemes, it is essential to apply the K values relevant to the scale of the simulation.
   This paper describes and tests novel techniques, using ditches, for the derivation of K at large scales which overcome many of the problems that have been identified with conventional techniques and are capable of producing estimates that are appropriate to the application of physically based regional flow models.

AB Peatland streams potentially represent important conduits for the exchange of gaseous carbon between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere. We investigated how gaseous evasion of carbon from the stream surface compared with downstream carbon transport at three locations on a Scottish headwater stream. Carbon dioxide was consistently above atmospheric saturation in the stream, with mean concentrations of 159.1, 81.8, and 29.5 mu mol L-l at the lower, middle, and upper sites, respectively (i.e., 7.6, 3.9, and 1.2 times in excess of atmospheric equilibrium concentrations). Methane concentrations in stream water were much lower but showed a similar pattern. Rates of gaseous evasion from the stream surface to the atmosphere, determined experimentally using direct measurement of dissolved gas concentrations in conjunction with coinjection of conservative solute and volatile gas tracers, also declined downstream. Combined stream losses of all forms of carbon from the entire catchment (i.e., degassing from the stream surface and exports downstream) totaled 54,140 kg C yr(-1). Evasion of carbon dioxide from the stream surface accounted for 34% of this total, compared to 57% lost as dissolved organic carbon via export downstream. When expressed per unit area of watershed, the gaseous C evasion from the stream represents a loss of 14.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which equals 28-70% of the estimated net carbon accumulation rate fur such peatlands. This study shows that gaseous carbon loss from the surface of temperate headwater streams can be both spatially variable and significant in terms of rates of net annual land surface-atmosphere exchange at the catchment scale.

AB Producer-decomposer interactions within aquatic biofilms can range from mutualistic associations to competition depending on available resources. The outcomes of such interactions have implications for biogeochemical cycling and, as such, may be especially important in northern peatlands, which are a global carbon sink and are expected to experience changes in resource availability with climate change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nutrients and organic carbon on the relative proportion of primary producers (microalgae) and heterotrophic decomposers (bacteria and fungi) during aquatic biofilm development in a boreal peatland. Given that decomposers are often better competitors for nutrients than primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, we predicted that labile carbon subsidies would shift the biofilm composition towards heterotrophy owing to the ability of decomposers to outcompete primary producers for available nutrients in the absence of carbon limitation.
   We manipulated nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and organic carbon (glucose) in a full factorial design using nutrient-diffusing substrates in an Alaskan fen.
   Heterotrophic bacteria were limited by organic carbon and algae were limited by inorganic nutrients. However, the outcomes of competitive interactions depended on background nutrient levels. Heterotrophic bacteria were able to outcompete algae for available nutrients when organic carbon was elevated and nutrient levels remained low, but not when organic carbon and nutrients were both elevated through enrichment.
   Fungal biomass was significantly lower in the presence of glucose alone, possibly owing to antagonistic interactions with heterotrophic bacteria. In contrast to bacteria, fungi were stimulated along with algae following nutrient enrichment.
   The decoupling of algae and heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of glucose alone shifted the biofilm trophic status towards heterotrophy. This effect was overturned when nutrients were enriched along with glucose, owing to a subsequent increase in algal biomass in the absence of nutrient limitation.
   By measuring individual components of the biofilm and obtaining data on the trophic status, we have begun to establish a link between resource availability and biofilm formation in northern peatlands. Our results show that labile carbon subsidies from outside sources have the potential to disrupt microbial coupling and shift the metabolic balance in favour of heterotrophy. The extent to which this occurs in the future will probably depend on the timing and composition of bioavailable nutrients delivered to surface waters with environmental change (e.g. permafrost thaw).

AB The Flow Country peatlands receive national and international recognition and protection as a highly valued habitat, and also provide a number of important ecosystem services. While there has been much research on the terrestrial peatland habitat of the Flow Country, the area's many hundreds of natural water bodies have been largely unstudied. The first part of this study therefore focuses on establishing the contemporary conditions at 18 Flow Country lakes, examining between-lake heterogeneity in terms of physical structure, water chemistry and biological communities. Temporal change in these lakes is then considered by combining contemporary ecological and palaeolimnological approaches. We examine how the diatom and chironomid communities of Flow Country lakes have changed since a time prior to the mid-nineteenth century. Results show that the lake communities today are different to those present pre-1850, containing more taxa tolerant of increased acidity and nutrient availability. General linear modelling (GLM) analysis demonstrated a statistically significant association between the extent of change in diatom communities and both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate. Community shifts, though considerable, are shown to be complex and idiosyncratic and no shift between trophic states is indicated. The extent and type of coarse-scale community change we observed points to widespread bottom-up drivers such as land management, afforestation and/or atmospheric deposition rather than more localised management practices such as fish stocking. The benefits of combining approaches is discussed and palaeolimnological methods by which land management, afforestation and atmospheric deposition could be further disentangled are identified.

Here we compare the small-scale spatial variability <1 m) in bacterial diversity and community composition between two of those ponds with contrasting apparent color, using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Further, we compared the results with the nearest (80 m) main lagoon in the system to elucidate the importance of different environmental factors such as salinity and the importance of these ponds as a source of shared diversity. Bacterial diversity was higher in both ponds than in the lagoon and community composition was largely different among them and characterized by very low operational taxonomic unit sharing. Whereas the "green" pond with relatively low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (33.5 mg L-1) was dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, the one with extreme DOC concentration (424.1 mg L-1) and red hue was dominated by Cyanobacteria. By contrast, the lagoon was largely dominated by Proteobacteria, particularly by Gammaproteobacteria. A large percentage (47%) of all reads was unclassified suggesting the existence of large undiscovered bacterial diversity. Our results suggest that even at the very smallscale spatial range considered, local environmental factors are important in explaining differences in bacterial community composition in those systems. Further, our study highlights that Altiplano peatland ponds represent a hitherto unknown source of microbial diversity.

AB An 18-month reciprocal peat transplant experiment was conducted between two peatlands in the Czech Republic. Both sites were 100% Sphagnum-covered, with no vascular plants, and no hummocks and hollows. Atmospheric depositions of sulfur were up to 10 times higher at the northern site Velke jerabi jezero (VJJ), compared to the southern site Cervene blato (CB). Forty-cm deep peat cores, 10-cm in diameter, were used as transplants and controls in five replicates. Our objective was to evaluate whether CO2 and CH4 emissions from Sphagnum peat bogs are governed mainly by organic matter quality in the substrate, or by environmental conditions. Emission rates and delta C-13 values of CO2 and CH4 were measured in the laboratory at time t=18 months. All measured parameters converged to those of the host site, indicating that, at least in the short-term perspective, environmental conditions were a more important control of greenhouse gas emissions than organic carbon quality in the substrate. Since sulfate reducers outcompete methanogens, we hypothesized that the S-polluted site VJJ should have lower methane emissions than CB. In fact, the opposite was true, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher methane emissions from VJJ. Additionally, as a first step in an effort to link C isotope composition of emitted gases and residual peat substrate, we determined whether multiple vertical delta C-13 profiles in peat agree. A high degree of within-site homogeneity in delta C-13 was found. When a specific vertical delta C-13 trend was seen in one peat core, the same trend was also seen in all the remaining peat cores from the wetland. The delta C-13 value increased downcore at both CB and VJJ. At VJJ, however, 20 cm below surface, a reversal to lower delta C-13 downcore was seen. Based on Pb-210 dating, peat at 20-cm depth at VJJ was only 15 years old. Increasing delta C-13 values in VJJ peat accumulated between 1880-1990 could not be caused by assimilation of atmospheric CO2 gradually enriched in the light isotope C-12 due to fossil fuel burning. Rather they were a result of a combination of isotope fractionations accompanying assimilation and mineralization of Sphagnum C. These isotope fractionations may record information about past changes in C storage in wetlands.

ID DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PEATLANDS
AB The observed increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming, have raised interests in identifying sources and sinks of carbon in the environment. Terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Particularly, wetland systems function primarily as long-term reservoirs for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and as sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of carbon reservoirs in two high-altitude wetlands in the central Andean mountain of Colombia. Carbon cycle in both systems is related mainly with the plant biomass dynamics from the littoral zone. Thus, total organic carbon concentrate an average up to 329 kg of N ha(-1) and 125 kg of P ha(-1) every year vs only 17 kg N ha(-1) and 6 kg P ha(-1) in the water column of the limnetic zone in the wetland, evidencing spatial differences in carbon concentrations for these types of ecosystems. Results revealed that these systems participate in the balance and sequestration of carbon in the Colombian Andes.

AB The long-term development of a humic lake ecosystem in Poland was investigated via palaeoecological analyses of age-dated sediment cores. Peat and lacustrine deposit records spanning approximately 12,000years of lake history were analysed with regard to palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, degree of peat decomposition, Cladocera and geochemistry. Our study demonstrated the difficulty of classifying sediments deposited in humic lakes. We considered it inadequate to classify dy sediment exclusively using macroscopic criteria in the absence of geochemical parameters. Our study of the palaeoecology of the humic lake suggested three primary shifts in its trophic status: from oligotrophy to mesotrophy (AllerOd-Boreal), to eutrophy (Atlantic), and to humotrophy (from the Sub-Boreal to the present). The results indicated that shifts in the trophic status occurred in response to climatic changes and factors linked to the catchment. The transformation from a clearwater lake of high trophic status to a humic lake was possible, such that the latter may originate not only from an oligotrophic lake. As a result of our pioneering study, we determined that a humic water body may even develop because of transformation of a eutrophic lake.

AB Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations from seven boreal catchments in northern Sweden were monitored between June 1996 and May 1998 to examine spatial and temporal variations in streamwater TOC export and its relationship with catchment characteristics. The annual average export of TOC ranged between 36 and 76 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and correlated positively with the areal extent of wetlands (r(2) = 0.72; p = 0.03). The daily output of TOC was 5-11 times higher during the spring than during any other season. In total, the four week long spring period contributed between 50% and 68% of the annual TOC export from the seven catchments. The relative importance of the spring snow melt period for the annual TOC export, however, correlated negatively with the percentage of wetlands (r(2) = 0.83; p<0.01). We suggest that the smaller relative importance of the spring runoff period for the annual TOC export from wetland dominated catchments is a result of the hydrological flow paths associated with the snow melt period. While a large fraction of the spring runoff from forested areas reaches the stream via subsurface flow paths across riparian soils rich in TOC, the flow paths through wetland dominated systems include a much larger component of low-TOC snow melt water via surface flow over ice and frozen peat.

AB Shifts in microbial community function and structure can be indicators of environmental stress and ecosystem change in wetland soils. This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity, increased inundation, and their combination, on soil microbial function (enzyme activity) and structure (phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) signatures and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) profiles) in a brackish mangrove peat soil using tidal mesocosms (Everglades, Florida, USA). Increased tidal inundation resulted in reduced soil enzyme activity, especially alkaline phosphatase, an increase in the abundance and diversity of prokaryotes, and a decline in number of eukaryotes. The community composition of less abundant bacteria (T-RFLPs comprising 0.3-1 % of total fluorescence) also shifted as a result of increased inundation under ambient salinity. Several key biogeochemical indicators (oxidation-reduction potential, CO2 flux, porewater NH4 (+), and dissolved organic carbon) correlated with measured microbial parameters and differed with inundation level. This study indicates microbial function and composition in brackish soil is more strongly impacted by increased inundation than increased salinity. The observed divergence of microbial indicators within a short time span (10-weeks) demonstrates their usefulness as an early warning signal for shifts in coastal wetland ecosystems due to sea level rise stressors.

AB We have examined the roles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH in determining patterns of Pb fractionation in surface water from Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in undisturbed and urbanized watersheds of the Pinelands of New Jersey. In undisturbed wetlands, the water is highly acidic (pH 3.5) and has high concentrations of DOC; wetlands receiving urban runoff are less acidic and have lower concentrations of DOC. The effects of PH were separated from the effects of DOC by experimentally raising the pH of water from the undisturbed site to 6.0. A separation procedure was compiled from the literature to separate the soluble Pb fraction into labile (exchangeable on ion-exchange resin) and non-labile fractions, and the latter fraction was further separated into photo-oxidation-sensitive and insensitive fractions. In low pH, high DOC waters, 95% of added PbCl2 remained soluble, and 56 to 80% of this Pb was labile (varying with contact time with the resin). In high-pH swamp waters, a smaller fraction (64 to 71%) remained soluble; the distribution of the soluble Pb among non-labile forms varied with the source of the water. Pb fractionation in runoff was quite different from that in runoff-impacted swamp water at the same pH, and may reflect differences in DOC and/or higher levels of Fe in the runoff.

This site of abrupt permafrost collapse is dominated by minerotrophic fens located within the flat mound peat bog. The CO2, DOC, major and trace metal concentrations decreased with the increase of the surface area of the water body, along the hydrological continuum (soil water -> hollows -> depressions and permafrost subsidences -> thaw ponds -> thermokarst lakes). Aqueous concentrations of CO2, CH4, Ca, Si, P, Al, Fe, Nd, and U were a factor of 4 to 10 higher in the site of catastrophic thaw compared to the steady thawing of a palsa peat bog that was previously studied in the same region. The colloids (1 kDa-0.45 mu m) formed in hot spots were strongly enriched in Fe, Al, and trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates relative to organic carbon.
   Because the increase in the thickness of the thawing depth intensifies the input of inorganic components from deep mineral horizons, abrupt permafrost thaw enriches the surface waters in Al-rich colloids and low molecular weight organic complexes. As a result, the WSL's surface water colloidal composition may shift from DOM-rich and DOM-Fe-rich to DOM-Al-rich, and the release of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates from the soil to the river will increase. We hypothesize that in sites of abrupt permafrost thaw, there is direct mobilization of soil waters to a hydrological network (rivers and lakes) and there is minimal transformation by autochthonous processes, which is unlike the case of steady permafrost thawing. Therefore, the change in physical factors, such as water pathways and the water residence time, within a given elementary landscape will likely control the overall impact of on-going permafrost thaw on both the surface water chemistry and dissolved greenhouse gas pattern of the territory. For this, high-resolution (< 2 m) remote sensing analysis of water dynamics in the permafrost landscape is necessary.

AB Mire specialist species are under strong anthropogenic pressure. In areas where the exploitation of their habitat has been temporary or unsuccessful, restoration frequently has risen as an objective. The results of the restoration activities for habitat specialists, however, are unclear. In this work we investigated whether raising the water level ca. 10years ago in degraded bogs has brought back a characteristic group of fauna, and mire specialists therein. Dip-netting for Odonata larvae, together with habitat description, was carried out in restored, unrestored, and natural sites. We found almost no larvae at unrestored sites. The restored sites provided habitat for diverse Odonata fauna, including lagg zone species. Bog specialists only occurred at a former pit-mining site. Based on the study, we suggest three means to support the biodiversity of mire Odonata: (i) protecting the remaining natural mires, (ii) using pit-mining instead of milling for peat extraction, and (iii) creating special pools in former milled sites that have been designated for mire restoration.

AB Landscape morphology exerts strong, scale-dependent controls on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry in heterogeneous catchments. We applied three descriptors of landscape structure at different spatial scales based on new geographic information system tools to predict variability in stream concentrations for a wide range of solutes (Al, Ba, Be, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, Si, Sr, Sc, Co, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Rb, Y, Cd, Sb, Cs, La, Pb, Th, U, DOC, and Cl) using a linear regression analysis. Results showed that less reactive elements, which can be expected to behave more conservatively in the landscape (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, and Si), generally were best predicted from the broader-scale description of landscape composition (areal coverage of peat, tills, and sorted sediments). These results highlight the importance of mineral weathering as a source of some elements, which was best captured by landscape-scale descriptors of catchment structure. By contrast, more nonconservative elements (e.g., DOC, Al, Cd, Cs, Co, Th, Y, and U), were best predicted by defining wet areas and/or flow path lengths of different patches in the landscape. This change in the predictive models reflect the importance of peat deposits, such as organic-rich riparian zones and mire ecosystems, which are favorable environments for biogeochemical reactions of more nonconservative elements. As such, using this understanding of landscape influences on stream chemistry can provide improved mitigation strategies and management plans that specifically target source areas, so as to minimize mobilization of undesired elements into streams.

AB The importance of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) as a methane sink in freshwater systems is largely unexplored, particularly in peat ecosystems. Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) was recently discovered and reported to be catalyzed by the bacterium "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera," which is affiliated with the NC10 phylum. So far, several "Ca. Methylomirabilis oxyfera" enrichment cultures have been obtained using a limited number of freshwater sediments or wastewater treatment sludge as the inoculum. In this study, using stable isotope measurements and porewater profiles, we investigated the potential of n-damo in a minerotrophic peatland in the south of the Netherlands that is infiltrated by nitrate-rich ground water. Methane and nitrate profiles suggested that all methane produced was oxidized before reaching the oxic layer, and NC10 bacteria could be active in the transition zone where countergradients of methane and nitrate occur. Quantitative PCR showed high NC10 bacterial cell numbers at this methane-nitrate transition zone. This soil section was used to enrich the prevalent NC10 bacteria in a continuous culture supplied with methane and nitrite at an in situ pH of 6.2. An enrichment of nitrite-reducing methanotrophic NC10 bacteria was successfully obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of retrieved 16S rRNA and pmoA genes showed that the enriched bacteria were very similar to the ones found in situ and constituted a new branch of NC10 bacteria with an identity of less than 96 and 90% to the 16S rRNA and pmoA genes of "Ca. Methylomirabilis oxyfera," respectively. The results of this study expand our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of NC10 bacteria in the environment and highlight their potential contribution to nitrogen and methane cycles.

AB In this study we have evaluated the effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on sorption of imidacloprid, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and 4-bromoaniline (4-BA) on a typical calcareous soil (Luvic Xerosol) from south-eastern Spain. Two different types of DOM were used, that is to say, dissolved natural organic matter extracts from a commercial peat (DNOM) and a high-purity tannic acid (TA) solution. The experiments were carried out in a 0.01 M CaCl2 aqueous medium at 25 degrees C. The results indicated that the presence of both DNOM and TA, over a concentration range of 15-100 mg L-1, produced an increase in the amount of 3,4-DCA and 4-BA sorbed and a decrease in the amount of imidacloprid retained on the soil studied. A modified distribution coefficient, K-doc, has been proposed as a safer parameter for soil sorption predictions of organic pollutants and it could be of help to model the fate of these in the environment.

AB An understanding of the symbiotic water and gas exchange processes at the ecosystem scale is essential to the development of appropriate restoration plans of extracted peatlands. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum extracted peatland in eastern Quebec, utilizing full-scale micrometeorological measurements of both evaporation and CO2. The results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat, but CO2 emissions are similar to 25% greater than an adjacent nonrestored comparison site. The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Macropore flow at the groundwater/surface water interface to a humic lake and the seepage fluxes through the lake bottom were measured, as well as was the groundwater chemistry. With a 100-fold difference in discharge from the lake, the seepage rates through the lake bottom differed by only 15%, indicating that macropores provided a major part of the inflow during high-flow events. Two larger macropores had flow rates between 0.3 and 0.7 L s(-1), corresponding to velocities of 1-3 m min(-1). The flow rates of four smaller macropores were recorded to only 0.02-0.1 x 10(-4) L s(-1). One of the larger macropores had water with high concentration of alkalinity, Ca and Si in dry periods, whereas during wet periods dissolved organic carbon was elevated and pH was depressed. This is a indication of different source areas depending on the rainfall rate. As the alkalinity/chloride ratios were lower in the macropores than in the peat water, acid groundwater seemed to find a shortcut directly into the lake.

AB Much research has been undertaken on the photocatalytic degradation of humic substances with titanium dioxide using commercial humic acids (HA), which are extracts from either peat or coal. Most of the research has been focused on the changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 absorption. These parameters only give a general assessment. This work studies the changes in the physical and structural properties of a commercial humic acid by size exclusion chromatography with DOC and UV254 absorption detection (SEC-DOC, SEC-UV254), and the evolution of halogenated organic compounds (AOX) and trihalomethanes (THMs) during the photocatalytic degradation with simulated solar UV irradiation and Degussa P-25 TiO2. These changes are compared with those reported for natural organic matter (NOM). The photodegradation of commercial HA and NOM proceeds in a similar and sequential manner, initially with the preferential adsorption of larger molecules, then the degradation of these larger molecular size fractions and proceeding towards smaller molecular size fractions, while decreasing THMs and AOX formation potential.

ID PEATLAND
AB Peatlands do not readily return to functional wetland ecosystems after harvesting (cutting), because the harsh hydrological and microclimatic conditions are unsuitable for Sphagnum regeneration. In this study, drainage ditches blocked after harvesting restored the water balance to a condition similar to a nearby natural bog. Evaporation averaged 2.9 and 2.7 mm day(-1) on the cutover and natural bog, respectively. Evaporation consumed most of the rainfall input (86 and 80%, respectively), whereas runoff was minor at both sites (6 and 4%, respectively). However, the water table position was markedly different at these sites. Median water table depth was 0.05 m below the surface in the natural bog, compared with 0.44 m in the cutover bog (ditches blocked). Changes to the peak soil matrix owing to drainage and cutting reduced the specific yield (Sy) of the peat to 0.04-0.06 from 0.35-0.55, causing exaggerated water table changes in the cutover site. Nevertheless, volumetric soil moisture in the cutover site (0.67 +/- .08) had low variability, and was maintained above moisture contents found in Sphagnum hummocks in the natural bog (0.48 +/- .10), although less than on Sphagnum lawn(0.84 +/- .11). Poor Sphagnum regeneration on cutover surfaces can therefore be attributed to its inability to extract water from the underlying peat, which retains water at matric suction greater than the nonvascular Sphagnum can generate.
   The corrupted iron pan under main ditches has permitted partial recharge of the underlying aquifer, reducing local hydraulic gradients, thereby decreasing vertical seepage loss.

AB This paper investigates how vascular plants affect carbon flow and the formation and emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4 ) in an arctic wet tundra ecosystem in NE Greenland. We present a field experiment where we studied, in particular, how species-specific root exudation patterns affect the availability of acetate, a hypothesized precursor of CH4 formation. We found significantly higher acetate formation rates in the root vicinity of Eriophorum scheuchzeri compared with another dominating sedge in the wetland, i.e. Dupontia psilosantha . Furthermore a shading treatment, which reduced net photosynthesis, resulted in significantly decreased formation rates of acetate. We also found that the potential CH4 production of the peat profile was highly positively correlated to the concentration of acetate at the respective depths, whereas it was negatively correlated to the concentration of total dissolved organic carbon. This suggests that acetate is a substrate of importance to the methanogens in the studied ecosystem and that acetate concentration in this case can serve as a predictor of substrate quality. To further investigate the importance of acetate as a predecessor to CH4 , we brought an intact peat-plant monolith system collected at the field site in NE Greenland to the laboratory, sealed it hermetically and studied the decomposition of (14) C-labelled acetate injected at the depth of methanogenic activity. After 4 h, (14) CH4 emission from the monolith could be observed. In conclusion, allocation of recently fixed carbon to the roots of certain species of vascular plants affects substrate quality and influence CH4 formation.

AB Stalagmites can contain annual luminescence laminae, and some samples provide long continuous chronologies from which climatic information can be extracted. One such site is Uamh an Tartair in Assynt, northwest Scotland, where most stalagmites contain continuous laminae sets for the last two to three millennia. At this site, the normal mode of deposition is for one luminescent lamina to be deposited in autumn, derived from luminescent organic matter that is flushed onto the sample from the overlying peat. However, in the stalagmite investigated here, 43 lamina doublets occur, where two laminae appear to be preserved in a winter. We argue, both from the timing of these events within the 'Little Ice Age', as well as from analogous situations in alpine streams, that the doublets occur due to the presence of a second, spring melt flush of organic matter. The interpretation of stalagmite double laminae, therefore, has considerable potential as a palaeoclimate proxy, and at our study site, we suggest one of severe winters over the last millennium.

AB The transformations of aqueous inorganic divalent mercury (Hg(II)(i)) to volatile dissolved gaseous mercury (Hg(0)((aq))) and toxic methylmercury (MeHg) govern mercury bioavailability and fate in northern ecosystems. This study quantified concentrations of aqueous mercury species (Hg(II)(i), Hg(0)((aq)), MeHg) and relevant geochemical constituents in pore waters of eight Alaskan wetlands that differ in trophic status (i.e., bog-to-fen gradient) to gain insight on processes controlling dark Hg(II)(i) reduction and Hg(II)(i) methylation. Regardless of wetland trophic status, positive correlations were observed between pore water Hg(II)(i) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. The concentration ratio of Hg(0)((aq)) to Hg(II)(i) exhibited an inverse relationship to Hg(II)(i) concentration. A ubiquitous pathway for Hg(0)((aq)) formation was not identified based on geochemical data, but we surmise that dissolved organic matter (DOM) influences mercury retention in wetland pore waters by complexing Hg(II)(i) and decreasing the concentration of volatile Hg(0)((aq)) relative to Hg(II)(i). There was no evidence of Hg(0)((aq)) abundance directly limiting mercury methylation. The concentration of MeHg relative to Hg(II)(i) was greatest in wetlands of intermediate trophic status, and geochemical data suggest mercury methylation pathways vary between wetlands. Our insights on geochemical factors influencing aqueous mercury speciation should be considered in context of the long-term fate of mercury in northern wetlands.

AB Over a one-year study period (2003), we monitored total Hg (HgT) and methyl Hg (MeHg) at two sites in a Swedish forest stream located above (Site(ref)) and below a stretch of Hg-contaminated sediments (Site(Hg)). We also monitored HgT, MeHg, and ancillary water chemistry in peat water close to the stream and HgT in open field wet deposition. Despite the presence of historical Hg contaminants, direct atmospheric Hg deposition and transfer of Hg from the catchment explained more than half of the annual HgT load at Site(Hg). The concentrations of both HgT and MeHg were sensitive to changes in water discharge (Q) and water temperature (T) at both sites, suggesting that the stream HgT and MeHg load can change dramatically in response to changing weather conditions. The 2003 data together with data from 1996 disclosed intersite differences and temporal variation in the relationships between HgT, MeHg, and TOC (total organic carbon), reflecting variable sources of HgT, MeHg, and TOC and temporal changes in factors affecting Hg speciation.

AB This paper presents new information on the hydrology and water quality of the eroding peatland headwaters of the River Severn in mid-Wales and links it to the impact of plantation conifer forestry further down the catchment.
   The Upper Hafren is dominated by low-growing peatland vegetation, with an average annual precipitation of around 2650 mm with around 250 mm evaporation. With low catchment permeability, stream response to rainfall is "flashy" with the rising limb to peak stormflow typically under an hour. The water quality is characteristically "dilute"; stormflow is acidic and enriched in aluminium and iron from the acid organic soil inputs. Baseflow is circum-neutral and calcium and bicarbonate bearing due to the inputs of groundwater enriched from weathering of the underlying rocks. Annual cycling is observed for the nutrients reflecting uptake and decomposition processes linked to the vegetation and for arsenic implying seasonal water-logging within the peat soils and underlying glacial drift. Over the decadal scale, sulphate and nitrate concentrations have declined while Gran alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon and iron have increased, indicating a reduction in stream acidification.
   Within the forested areas the water quality is slightly more concentrated and acidic, transgressing the boundary for acid neutralisation capacity as a threshold for biological damage. Annual sulphate and aluminium concentrations are double those observed in the Upper Hafren, reflecting the influence of forestry and the greater ability of trees to scavenge pollutant inputs from gaseous and mist/cloud-water sources compared to short vegetation. Acidification is decreasing more rapidly in the forest compared to the eroding peatland possibly due to the progressive harvesting of the mature forest reducing the scavenging of acidifying inputs. For the Lower Hafren, long-term average annual precipitation is slightly lower, with lower average altitude, at around 2520 mm and evaporation is around double that of the Upper Hafren.

AB 1 CO2 emissions in boreal peatlands were measured during two seasons on various mire site types representing different nutrient statuses and water tables. In order to examine the long term effects of water table draw-down on the CO2 fluxes, the sites also included 25-50-year-old drainages.
   2 On virgin sites the lowest CO2 fluxes were measured at ombrotrophic sites dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (78-127 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 60-200 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)) and the highest CO2 fluxes were at ombrotrophic sites with abundant understorey vegetation (183-259 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 290-340 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)).
   3 Lowering of the water table by 1 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 7.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C and 9.5g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1). In some cases the effect of ditches on the water table, and correspondingly on CO2 fluxes, was small. However, effective draining caused approximate to 100% increase in CO2 fluxes. Drainages had higher CO2 fluxes compared with virgin subsites at the same temperature and water table.
   4 The effect of temperature on CO2 fluxes depended on the water table, the average Q(10) value being 2.9 with water tables of 0-20 cm and 2.0 with water tables below 20 cm.
   5 CO2 fluxes are compared with primary production figures, and peat carbon stores and the carbon balance in changing climate are discussed.

ID FLOODPLAIN WETLAND; NARBOROUGH-BOG
AB The valley mire 'Mittletes Trebeltal' in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (northeast Germany) has recently been re-wetted in the course of an EU-funded conservation project. On the basis of geological cross-sections, a hydrological model applying the Boussinesq-equation has been developed to investigate the hydrological dynamics of the study area and to evaluate various management strategies. Modelled water levels corresponded well to measured ones. The optimised values of two of the main model parameters-the hydraulic conductivity and the proportions of vegetation types-agreed with measurement values, and, respectively, the real vegetation cover, while the third one, the specific yield, should pragmatically be used as a calibration parameter. Due to a proportion of around 30% of tall fen vegetation, the modelled evapotranspiration clearly exceeded grass evapotranspiration resulting in low groundwater levels in some parts of the fen during summer. Generally, the water levels are controlled by topographic features (i.e. former peat cuttings) and weather conditions during the summer months. When analyzing different management scenarios, even an optimal water supply (ditch water levels near the ground surface) could not raise the groundwater table to ecologically sound levels during summer. However, during winter, these ditch water levels enhanced flooding. The groundwater fluxes towards the river, and, respectively, towards the fen were low. The minor importance of these fluxes for the water balance was caused by very low hydraulic gradients. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk of nutrient export from the fen into the river is very limited and compound transformations take place within the mire system itself. Hydrological analysis as a prerequisite for the assessment of nutrient and pollutant transport and transformation processes can be carried out-as a first approach-with simple models on the basis of a limited dataset.

AB The extent and kinetics of adsorption of a peat-derived humic substance (HS) onto a hydrophobic surface (mercury electrode) and a polar mineral surface (gamma-Al2O3 colloids) was studied. Adsorption on the Hg-electrode was assessed by directly measuring the change of the double layer capacitance caused by the adsorption of HS on the electrode surface through phase-selective a.c. polarography; the extent of adsorption of HS on the gamma-Al2O3-surface was monitored by determining the residual HS-concentration in solution.
   On both surfaces, HS is adsorbed strongly over a wide pH-range; hydrophobic interaction (i.e., expulsion from solution) prevails at the mercury surface while coordinative adsorption (ligand exchange), enhanced by hydrophobic effects, is the predominant mechanism at the oxide surface. Adsorption kinetics are characterized by an initial fast process, where even in dilute solutions (<1 mg HS L(-1)), a high surface coverage is attained initially. True adsorption equilibrium however, cannot be reached within hours. The slow approach to equilibrium is thought to be caused mainly by the polydispersity of HS resulting in fractionation processes, where presumably fast-adsorbing low-molecular weight compounds are successively displaced from the surface by slow-adsorbing compounds of higher molecular weight. Slow molecular rearrangements of HS-molecules at the interface cannot be ruled out, however.
   Our results suggest that adsorption of humic substances on mineral as well as hydrophobic aquatic surfaces may lead to a progressive and selective immobilization of certain fractions of humic substances. It is probable that the higher-molecular weight fractions accumulate at aquatic interfaces, whereas lower-molecular weight fractions, such as fulvic acid components, are more likely to remain in solution. This may have significant effects on the qualitative composition and reactivity of dissolved vs. particulate organic carbon and on the residence time of different fractions of humic substances in natural systems. In turn, the chemical reactivity of particle surfaces may also be influenced by different fractions of adsorbed humic substances.

AB Binding of metals in typical bath peat samples ("Gro beta es Gifhorner Moot", Sassenburg/North Germany) and their aqueous extracts was characterized by means of a multi-method approach, For that purpose a sequential extraction procedure based on peat-filled chromatography columns was developed. Water-soluble metal and DOM (dissolved organic matter) fractions were subdivided by use of a stepwise increased pH gradient (pH 3.8-5), finally by the chelator EDTA and 0.1 mol L-I hydrochloric acid. Metal fractions very strongly bound to peat were assessed by an aqua regia extraction.
   Metal determinations required were performed by atomic spectrometry methods (AAS, ICP-OES, and TXRF). The metal and DOM concentrations in the peat extracts varied significantly, depending on the natural variety of the peat matter under study (e.g., Al: 25-674, Cd: 0.05-0.2, Cu: 5-15.4, Fe: 77-1785, Mn: 21-505, Ni: 2-33, Ph: < 1, Zn: 9-715 (<mu>g L-1); Na: 8-45, K: 1.3-14.9, Ca: 2-51, Mg: 1.1-7.9 (mg L-1); 26-73 mg L-1 DOC). An increase of the pH increased the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) of the peat extracts, but hardly the concentration of heavy metals. The latter could only be re-mobilized by EDTA and dilute hydrochloric acid. Additional investigations of the peat extracts using tangential-flow ultrafiltration revealed that the heavy metals extracted at pH < 4 were predominantly dissociated. At higher pH (pH > 4.5) they were preferentially bound to macromolecular DOM. Moreover, using multistage ultrafiltration the size distribution of the DOM and their metal species was assessed.

AB Although water level changes are supposed to be a key factor affecting the functioning of lake ecosystems, knowledge on this topic is scarce, particularly for humic lakes. This paper presents the results of 18 years' research on a small humic lake exposed to hydrological change (rising of the water level), which was induced by spontaneous colonization of the lake by the European beaver (Castor fiber L.). We put forward a hypothesis that this change will be reflected in the quantity and structure of summer phytoplankton due to expected changes in the water chemistry. We noted a statistically significant decrease in total phosphorus and calcium concentrations, electrolytic conductivity, and Secchi disc transparency, and an increase in water color. The phytoplankton structure changed, with cyanoprocaryota and greens decreasing and flagellates increasing. The alteration was observed in a lake which had previously been drained by ditches, so beaver damming appeared to cause the return of the lake to its original endorheic conditions as well as to a water chemistry and phytoplankton structure more typical of undisturbed humic lakes.

AB Arctic permafrost soils contain large amounts of organic carbon and the pollutant mercury (Hg). Arctic warming and associated changes in hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology risk mobilizing soil Hg to rivers and to the Arctic Ocean, yet little is known about the quantity, timing and mechanisms involved. Here we investigate seasonal particulate Hg (PHg) and organic carbon (POC) export in 32 small and medium rivers across a 1700 km latitudinal permafrost transect of the western Siberian Lowland. The PHg concentrations in suspended matter increased with decreasing watershed size. This underlines the significance of POC-rich small streams and wetlands in PHg export from watersheds. Maximum PHg concentrations and export fluxes were located in rivers at the beginning of permafrost zone (sporadic permafrost). We suggest this reflects enhanced Hg mobilization at the permafrost boundary, due to maximal depth of the thawed peat layer. Both the thickness of the active (unfrozen) peat layer and PHg run-off progressively move to the north during the summer and fall seasons, thus leading to maximal PHg export at the sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zone. The discharge-weighed PHg:POC ratio in western Siberian rivers (2.7 +/- 0.5 mu g Hg: g C) extrapolated to the whole Ob River basin yields a PHg flux of 1.5 +/- 0.3 Mg y(-1), consistent with previous estimates. For current climate warming and permafrost thaw scenarios in western Siberia, we predict that a northward shift of permafrost boundaries and increase of active layer depth may enhance the PHg export by small rivers to the Arctic Ocean by a factor of two over the next 10-50 years.

AB This study aims to reconstruct the recent dynamics of two bogs located in an agricultural landscape and to determine which factors favour tree expansion, the most salient change recently reported in treeless peatlands. The vegetation and hydrological dynamics of the bogs as well as land use changes in the vicinity were reconstructed using a combination of paleoecological, paleohydrological, and historical approaches. It was hypothesized that upland deforestation indirectly induced atmospheric mineral dust deposition on sites, thus increasing nutrient availability and triggering forest expansion. Results indicated that a widespread, but asynchronous tree expansion occurred in both bogs during the 20th century. However, no evidence suggesting that nutrient enrichment favoured the phenomenon was found. Forest expansion seems rather to have been favoured by drying of the peat surface, as a decrease of the water table depth coincided with the beginning of the forest encroachment on both sites. This drying correlated with the establishment of an in situ artificial drainage ditch on one site and with agricultural development in the catchment of the other. Local historical factors of each site apparently override regional factors such as climate anomalies or upland deforestation in explaining rapid, abrupt changes in bogs.

AB Climate change and gullies (and ditches) on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology. Yet, exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood. In this study, we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using Visual MODFLOW. Groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season, 2017 were examined in the Zoige peatland, located on the northeastern side of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China with elevations of 3400-3900 m. Simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3.89 x 10(4) m(2) and three sub-zones within it representing peatland with no gullies (NG), a deep gully cutting through the peat layer (CT), and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer (NCT). Model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field-measured data. Modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways (MHPs) (i.e., precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), gully, groundwater flow, and boundary) to changes of water storage in peats (AS). Although these MHPs varied differently during rain and inter-rain periods, AS values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between P and ET. Variations of MHPs caused by NCT and CT were secondary to those due to those of P and ET during the wet season referred to as the short-term climate change. Vertical groundwater (VGW) flows were strongly correlated with water table (WT) levels in both rain and inter-rain periods, but their directions had different patterns in the two periods. Horizontal groundwater (HGW) flows tended to move into the deep (CT) gully, while move from the shallow (NCT) gully to the neighbor peats during both periods. Since HGW flows were about ten times greater than VGW ones, their effect on AS was significant during the long dry season. This would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats, demonstrating the coupled effect of long-term climate change and gullies on AS. These findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future Zoige peatland management practices.

AB Cutover bogs do not return to functional peatland ecosystems after abandonment because re-establishment of peat-forming mosses is poor. This paper presents a conceptual model of bog disturbance caused by peat harvesting (1942-1972), and the hydrological evolution that occurred after abandonment (1973-1998). Two adjacent bogs of similar size and origin, one harvested and the other essentially undisturbed, provide the basis for understanding what changes occurred. The model is based on historical trends evident from previous surveys of land-use, boa ecology and resource mapping; and from recent hydrological and ecological data that characterize the current condition. Water balance data and historical information suggest that runoff increased and evapotranspiration decreased following drainage, but tended towards pre-disturbance levels following abandonment, as vegetation recolonized the surface and drainage became less efficient over time. Dewatering of soil pores after drainage caused shrinkage and oxidation of the peat and surface subsidence of approximately 80 cm over 57 years. Comparisons with a nearby natural bog suggest that bulk density in the upper 50 cm of cutover peat increased from 0.07 to 0.13 g cm(-3), specific yield declined from 0,14 to 0.07, water table fluctuations were 67% greater, and mean saturated hydraulic conductivity declined from 4.1 x 10(-5) to 1.3 x 10(-5) cm s(-1). More than 25 years after abandonment, Sphagnum mosses were distributed over broad areas but covered less than 15% of the surface. Areas with 'good' Sphagnum regeneration (>10% cover) were strongly correlated with high water tables (mean -22 cm), especially in zones of seasonal groundwater discharge, artefacts of the extraction history. Forest cover expanded from 5 to 20% of the study area following abandonment. The effect of forest growth (transpiration and interception) and drainage on lowering water levels eventually will be countered by slower water movement through the increasingly dense soil, and by natural ditch deterioration. However, without management intervention, full re-establishment of natural hydrological functions will take a very long time. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB There is little understanding of the pathways of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) removal in treatment wetlands. The aim of this research was to evaluate HCB dechlorination as affected by common reed (Phragmites australis) and broad-leaved cattail (Typha latifolia) applications in neutralized and enriched with nutrients peat with high, low and nil HCB concentration (300, 15, and 0 mu g/g, respectively). After 10 weeks of the experiment, HCB removal was 49.4-67.2% in High-HCB peat, and 57.6-74.8% in Low-HCB peat. The mean removal of HCB was 53.5% in the unvegetated and 68.7% in the vegetated microcosm wetlands. The amount of HCB metabolites showed that dechlorination rates in Low-HCB microcosms were higher than in High-HCB microcosms, which were mainly attributed to the lower phytotoxicity and higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content than that of Low-NCB. Although HCB uptake by plants was <0.1% of the initial concentration, in both High-HCB and Low-HCB pears vegetated with Typha and Phragmites, enhanced HCB dechlorination rate was found. This was probably because the roots and its exudates enhanced dechlorination process. Microbial degradation was the predominating process in HCB removal. The following dechlorinated metabolites of HCB were detectable from the water, macrophytes and peat samples: PeCB. 1,2,3,4-,1.2,3,5- and 1,2,4,5-TeCB, 1,2,3-,1,2,4- and 1,3,5-TCB.

AB Wetlands have been widely applied for water quality amelioration. Enzymatic analysis was applied in a study of decomposition in constructed wetlands. We hypothesise that soil enzyme activities would be lower in wetland sediment than adjacent upland and that the lower soil enzyme activities are partly responsible for the water quality amelioration. Four soil enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phosphatase, and arylsulfatase) and microbial activity (electron transport system activity) were measured across a transect from a upland soil to a wetland sediment in two constructed wetland sites in the USA. Along with the activities, hydrochemistry was determined in inflow and outflow of the wetlands. In both wetlands, the enzyme activities in the sediments were significantly lower than the adjacent upland soils. For hydrochemistry, significant decreases were observed in phosphate and nitrate concentrations in outflow water compared to inflow water. However, there were no significant changes in other anions (F-, Cl-, SO42-). For dissolved organic carbon, it seems that the wetlands would be a source rather than a sink. The results suggest that the enzymatic approach represents a valuable method to assess decomposition processes in wetland sediments, and that characteristically low enzyme activities in the sediments may be important in the water quality amelioration function.

AB To reveal the degree of allochthonous vs. autochthonous control on carbon dynamics in deep, boreal lakes, we studied two (one organic-rich and one organic-poor) small (similar to 0.1 km(2)) and deep (similar to 40 m), seasonally stratified lakes located in the European subarctic zone (NW Russia, Arkhangelsk region) during a 2.5-year period. The dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) concentrations were 15-30 mg l(-1) and 0.5.9 mg l(-1) in the humic lake and 0.8-4.3 mg l(-1) and 18-52 mg l(-1) in the organic-poor lake, respectively. The DOC profile in the organic-poor lake was sensitive to phytoplankton blooms in July-August and snowmelt in May, whereas the organic-rich lake was a highly stable system throughout the year in both the epilimnion and hypolimnion, with significant (ca. 40%) increase in DOC concentration in the hypolimnion relative to the epilimnion. The ratio of dissolved organic carbon to organic nitrogen (C-org/N-org) was significantly lower in the organic-poor lake, reflecting a strong impact of autochthonous N-org production and N diffusion from the sediment to the water column. There was a clear difference in the vertical pattern of the proportion of the low molecular weight (LMW < 1 kDa) organic carbon (OC) between the humic and the organic-poor lakes. Regardless of season, the organic-poor lake's LMW < 1 kDa was 40%-90%, whereas that of the organic-rich lake 20%-30%. This difference was most likely linked to the dominance of peat soil and bog providing allochthonous OC to the organic-rich lake throughout the year, and possible production of LMW autochthonous organic ligands by phytoplankton and photodegradation in the organic-poor lake. The important role of allochthonous organic matter (OM) in the color properties of the lake water was confirmed by the light absorbance in the visual range and specific ultraviolet absorption measurements. Overall, deep humic (organic-rich) lakes are expected to be less sensitive to external impacts and possible climate change. The evaluation of both number and depth of humic lakes in the boreal zone is crucial for assessing their CO2 emission and carbon storage potential.

AB Light attenuation associated with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter (i.e. browning) is likely to affect the response of benthic biofilms to nutrient enrichment and warmer temperatures expected for northern aquatic ecosystems with climate change. To examine how these factors will interact to regulate the association between algae and heterotrophic bacteria in northern peatlands, we manipulated light (100%, 60%, 30%, 20% and 5% of ambient), nutrients (unenriched, enriched) and temperature (ambient, warming), in a full factorial design by shading nutrient diffusing substrates inside mesocosms with or without warming (3 degrees C) in an Alaskan fen. After 12days of experimental conditions, there was no effect of light or temperature on the abundance of algae or bacteria in the absence of nutrient enrichment. Enrichment with a combination of nitrogen and phosphorus significantly increased the abundance of algae and heterotrophic bacteria at ambient light levels (418molm(-2)s(-1)), and warming significantly enhanced the positive effects of nutrients on algal accrual. Although warming enhanced the effects of nutrient enrichment on bacterial growth, the magnitude of the effect was not statistically significant compared to nutrient enrichment alone. The positive influence of nutrient enrichment and the synergistic effects of nutrients and warming on algae and bacteria were lost at 30% ambient light (below 125molm(-2)s(-1)). We conducted a separate laboratory incubation using recirculating water baths maintained at either ambient or elevated water temperature (warming of 5 degrees C) to evaluate the effects of warming on the use of algal exudates by heterotrophic bacteria. During the 16-day assay, the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria increased rapidly in the presence of a common solution of algal exudates and the rate of exudate assimilation by bacteria was significantly enhanced by warming compared with ambient temperature. The positive association between light availability and heterotrophic bacteria, coupled with accelerated bacterial growth in the presence of algal exudates, support bacterial dependence on algal subsidies in the presence of recalcitrant organic substrates in this northern peatland. Within a predictive context, our results demonstrate that greater light attenuation associated with browning of surface water may reduce the positive influence of warmer temperatures and elevated nutrient levels on the microbial loop by reducing algal production on submerged surfaces in northern peatlands.

AB Peat soils comprise a large part of the western and northern Netherlands. Drainage for agriculture has caused increased soil aeration which has stimulated decomposition and, hence, soil subsidence, currently amounting to 1-2 cm/yr. River water is supplied to these peat areas in summer to prevent drying out of the peat soils. Saltwater intrusion and evaporation make this surface water slightly brackish during drought periods. In addition, brackish seepage can surface more easily during such dry periods. We performed an incubation experiment in which the effects of salinization on aerobic decomposition and mineralization of shallow peat samples and anaerobic decomposition and mineralization of deep peat samples were studied. We considered four different types of peat samples: peat sampled in agricultural peat meadows and in nature reserves, originally formed under either eutrophic or oligotrophic conditions. The aerobic decomposition was approximately reduced by 50% after salinization, whereas the anaerobic decomposition rates remained unchanged. Remarkably, the response to salinization did not differ between the peat types and land uses. Ammonium concentrations increased while nitrate concentrations decreased after salinization, probably as a result of reduced nitrification. Especially in the oligotrophic peat, ammonium concentrations increased substantially. Phosphate concentrations increased, possibly caused by changes in desorption and adsorption processes due to higher ion concentrations. DOC concentrations decreased in the brackish samples due to precipitation. Furthermore, the eutrophic peat samples showed increasing sulfate concentrations, both in oxic and anoxic incubations, which was attributed to pyrite oxidation. Independently of salinization, nitrification rates were higher in the agricultural, fertilized, peat soils. In conclusion, while salinization might reduce subsidence rates, it will have adverse effects on water quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Few studies provide experimental data to support the role of permafrost thaw on changes in arctic freshwater chemistry. We designed an incubation experiment to look at rapid nutrient release from permafrost soils and active layer soils under different warming scenarios, changes in redox environment, and microbial activity. Permafrost soil tended to immediately release more nutrients than active layer soils, especially under warmer conditions; suggesting the active layer is depleted in nutrients and the water column may be re-supplied with these ions from thawing permafrost. The release of micronutrients (Ca, Fe, Mg, S, Si) from incubated permafrost soils responded strongly to increased temperature; however, temperature alone was not necessarily the primary driver of macronutrient (N, P) release from permafrost. Other physicochemical parameters influenced by temperature, such as oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), microbial activity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Fe played an additional role in nutrient release from permafrost. These experiments suggest nutrient release via thaw of permafrost soils is able to contribute ample essential nutrients to arctic aquatic ecosystems, even within one day of warming. Further warming of the Arctic is likely to result in substantial changes to nutrient availability and cycling in these dominant habitats.

AB Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

AB 1. Mesotrophic lakes are a threatened habitat in the United Kingdom (UK), and are specified within the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) as requiring protection. Lough Melvin is a large mesotrophic lake that is of particular interest owing to the genetic diversity of its brown trout, but it is currently showing signs of nutrient enrichment.
   2. In 1990, average lake total phosphorus (TP) was less than 19 mu g P L-1 but increased to 29.5 mu g P L-1 by July 2001. Inflow TP also increased from 34 mu g P L-1 to 41 mu g P L-1 over the same period. Neither phosphorus nor nitrogen appeared to be limiting.
   3. Despite higher lake TP, annual chlorophyll a did not increase, remaining less than 5 mu g L-1. The phytoplankton was dominated by cyanobacteria and seems to have remained unchanged since the 1950s. Rotifer numbers increased significantly after 2001 but the macro-zooplankton did not. The absence of a phytoplankton response to P enrichment is attributed to light limitation caused by peat staining and thorough mixing.
   4. In the catchment, an accelerated programme of clear-felling began in 1999. Recent changes in the lake are consistent with the known impacts of clear-felling conifers on peat soils, namely larger P and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) losses. The latter was reflected in a lower Secchi depth and an enhanced microbial food-web supporting a larger rotifer population.
   5. It is suggested that, for the purposes of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), Lough Melvin and other large, alkaline but peat-stained lakes may be treated as a distinct lake type as they do not fit easily into the conventional classifications of dystrophic or mesotrophic lakes.

AB We characterized the major ion chemistry of over 800 lakes on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, from a probability sample of 59 lakes (August 1988). There were two groups: alkalinity < 300 mueq/L (78% of the lakes) and alkalinity > 700 mueq/L. Low-alkalinity lakes had significantly lower concentrations of base cations and silica and significantly higher average concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than high-alkalinity lakes. Despite widespread acidic soils and bog vegetation, and resulting high DOC concentrations, none of the lakes sampled was acidic. Sulfate concentrations (approximately 3 mueq/L) were similar in the two groups, as were Cl- concentrations, which decreased with distance from the coast. High-alkalinity lakes were similar chemically to rivers and shallow aquifers in the region, suggesting that the high alkalinity is a product of the major weathering reactions in this terrain; the substantially different ratios of base cations in the two groups also indicate quantitative and qualitative weathering differences. Low-alkalinity lakes were at higher elevations than high-alkalinity lakes, presumably in groundwater recharge zones. Consequently, the chemical differences between the two lake groups appeared to be controlled by relatively small differences in local hydrologic setting, and possibly by differences in mineralogy along the groundwater flowpaths.

AB Soilborne plant diseases seriously limit agricultural production. Due to environmental concerns, sustainable agricultural practices must involve the use of environmentally friendly alternatives, such as biocontrol microbes (BMs), to suppress various plant diseases. However, the success of BM application largely depends on the carrier formulation. An ideal carrier that can support the survival of a BM while discouraging the growth of the target pathogen is expected to enhance the performance of the BM in plant disease control. In this study, various commercial composts and peats were evaluated as carriers for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens QL-18, a BM used to control tomato bacterial wilt (TBW) caused by the soilborne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. Among the evaluated carriers, rapeseed cake compost (RCC) was found to be the best carrier, acting as both a substrate and food source for B. amyloliquefaciens QL-18. RCC facilitated the growth and survival of strain QL-18 by supplying adequate levels of dissolved carbon and nitrogen. Moreover, aqueous extracts of RCC alone inhibited R. solanacearum growth, suggesting that certain RCC components are toxic to the pathogen. Greenhouse and field experiments demonstrated that RCC improved the ability of B. amyloliquefaciens QL-18 to reduce the incidence of TBW and the population of the pathogen in the tomato rhizosphere. Although other carriers maintained large populations of B. amyloliquefaciens QL-18, similar to those obtained with RCC, they were not deemed suitable carriers because they constituted a poor nutrient supply for B. amyloliquefaciens QL-18 growth; thus, they had less of an impact on disease control. The principle of BM carrier selection should be adopted in the future when developing new bio-products for the effective control of soilborne plant diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands play an important role in global carbon cycling, but their responses to long-term anthropogenically changed hydrologic conditions and nutrient infiltration are not well known. While experimental manipulation studies, e.g., fertilization or water table manipulations, exist on the plot scale, only few studies have addressed such factors under in situ conditions. Therefore, an ecological gradient from the center to the periphery of a continental Canadian peatland bordering a eutrophic water reservoir, as reflected by increasing nutrient input, enhanced water level fluctuations, and increasing coverage of vascular plants, was used for a case study of carbon cycling along a sequence of four differently altered sites. We monitored carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) surface fluxes and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations in peat profiles from April 2014 through September 2015. Moreover, we studied bulk peat and pore-water quality and we applied delta C-13-CH4 and delta C-13-CO2 stable isotope abundance analyses to examine dominant CH4 production and emission pathways during the growing season of 2015. We observed differential responses of carbon cycling at the four sites, presumably driven by abundances of plant functional types and vicinity to the reservoir. A shrub-dominated site in close vicinity to the reservoir was a comparably weak sink for CO2 (in 1.5 years: -1093 +/- 794, in 1 year: +135 +/- 281 g CO2 m(-2); a net release) as compared to two graminoid-moss-dominated sites and a moss-dominated site (in 1.5 years: -1552 to -2260 g CO2 m(-2), in 1 year: -896 to -1282 g CO2 m(-2)). Also, the shrub-dominated site featured notably low DIC pore-water concentrations and comparably C-13-enriched CH4 (delta C-13-CH4: -57.81 +/- 7.03 parts per thousand) and depleted CO2 (delta C-13-CO2: -15.85 +/- 3.61 parts per thousand) in a more decomposed peat, suggesting a higher share of CH4 oxidation and differences in predominant methanogenic pathways. In comparison to all other sites, the graminoid-moss-dominated site in closer vicinity to the reservoir featured a similar to 30% higher CH4 emission (in 1.5 years: +61.4 +/- 32, in 1 year: +39.86 +/- 16.81 g CH4 m(-2)). Low delta C-13-CH4 signatures (-62.30 +/- 5.54 parts per thousand) indicated only low mitigation of CH4 emissions by methanotrophic activity here. Pathways of methanogenesis and methanotrophy appeared to be related to the vicinity to the water reservoir: the importance of acetoclastic CH4 production apparently increased toward the reservoir, whereas the importance of CH4 oxidation increased toward the peatland center. Plant-mediated transport was the prevailing CH4 emission pathway at all sites even where graminoids were rare. Our study thus illustrates accelerated carbon cycling in a strongly altered peatland with consequences for CO2 and CH4 budgets. However, our results suggest that long-term excess nutrient input does not necessarily lead to a loss of the peatland carbon sink function.

AB Despite the importance of surface waters of permafrost landscapes in carbon (C) emission and dissolved C and metal storage and export, the majority of available observations in high latitude aquatic systems deal with punctual or seasonal sampling without accounting for diurnal variations in temperature and primary productivity-respiration cycles. Towards providing comprehensive understanding of diet variations in CO2 emission, organic C and element concentrations in lakes of frozen peatlands, we monitored, each 2 h over 2 days, the water temperature, pH, CO2 fluxes, CO2, CH4, dissolved organic- and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively), nutrients, carboxylic acids, bacterial number, and major and trace elements in two acidic (pH = 3.6 and 4.0) and humic (DOC = 15 and 35 mg L-1) thermokarst lakes of discontinuous permafrost zone in Western Siberia. We discovered a factor of 2 to 3 higher CO2 concentrations and fluxes during the night compared to daytime in the high-DOC lake. The emission fluxes in the low-DOC lake increased from zero to negative values during the day to highly positive values during the end of night and early morning.The methane concentration varied within a factor of 5 without any link to the diurnal cycle. The bulk of dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) hydrochemical parameters remained highly stable with +/- 10% variation in concentration over 2 days of observation (DOC, DIC, SUVA(254nm), carboxylates (formate, oxalate, puryvate and glutarate), Mn, Fe, Al, other trace elements). Concentrations of Si, P, K, Cu varied within +/- 20% whereas those of Zn and Ni ranged by a factor of 2 to 4 without any link to diurnal pattern. Overall, the impact of diel cycle on CH4, DOC, nutrient and metal concentration was below 10%. However, neglecting night-time period may underestimate net CO2 emission by ca. 30 to 50% in small organic-rich thaw ponds and switch the CO2 exchange from uptake/zero to net emission in larger thermokarst lakes. Given the dominance of large lakes in permafrost regions, the global underestimation of the emission flux may be quite high. As such, monitoring CO2 concentrations and fluxes in thermokarst lakes during months of extended night Lime (August to October) is mandatory for assessing the net emissions from lentic waters of frozen peatlands.

AB The investigated coal mining lakes (ML Ill, ML 117, and ML 107) in the Lusatian lignite mining district are extremely acidic. The concentrations of iron in these geogenic acidified lakes are orders of magnitude higher than in acidic bog lakes and softwater lakes acidified by atmospheric deposition.
   For the most part ferric iron was the predominant species by a Fe(III) to Fe(II) ratio of more than 10. Density stratification of the water column leads to vertical concentration gradients of ferrous iron. Extremely high concentrations of ferrous iron were found in the anoxic layers above the sediment of ML 111 and ML 107. High concentrations of Fe(II) were correlated with high concentrations of carbon dioxide. A microbial potential to reduce ferric iron was found in the sediments.
   In ML 111 and ML 117 the concentrations of Fe(II) in the epilimnion were markedly higher than in the oxic hypolimnetic layers. It can be suggested that the occurence of ferrous iron in the epilimnion is of photochemical origin, as described for softwater lakes. Minimum concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in the epilimnion could be correlated to the increase of ferrous iron concentrations. Especially in springtime and summer the concentrations of Fe(II) in the epilimnion were higher than in the oxic hypolimnetic layer below.

AB Low water tables typically found in peatlands during dry summer periods or in the vicinity of drainage ditches may lead to moisture deficiency in porous surface peats. Episodes of drought stress might compromise the growth benefits brought about by lower ground-water levels. We examined the water relations of black spruce (Picea mariana) trees on a natural peatland during relatively wet (1990) and relatively dry (1991) summers. Seasonal patterns of pre-dawn and mid-day shoot water potentials and stomatal conductance were not related to peat water content or to water-table depth. There was no evidence of water stress or osmotic adjustment in sampled trees during wet and dry growing seasons. Our soil moisture data showed that although water-table levels were as low as -66 cm in 1991, water availability in the root zone remained high. Even with the absence of mid-day water stress during the summer of 1991, a 50% reduction in stomatal conductance as compared with the previous year was found. We suggest that signals from the bulk of the roots located in dry peat top layer contributed to the regulation of stomatal conductance.

AB Drained organic soils are large sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) in many European and Asian countries. Therefore, these soils urgently need to be considered and adequately accounted for when attempting to decrease emissions from the Agriculture and Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sectors. Here, we describe the methodology, data and results of the German approach for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils and outline ways forward towards tracking drainage and rewetting. The methodology was developed for and is currently applied in the German GHG inventory under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.
   Spatial activity data comprise high resolution maps of land-use, type of organic soil and mean annual water table (WT). The WT map was derived by a boosted regression trees model from data of more than 1000 dipwells. Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were synthesized from a unique national data set comprising more than 250 annual GHG balances from 118 sites in most land-use categories and types of organic soils. Measurements were performed with harmonized protocols using manual chambers. Nonlinear response functions describe the dependency of CO2 and CH4 fluxes on mean annual WT, stratified by land-use where appropriate. Modelling results were aggregated into "implied emission factors" for each land-use category, taking into account the uncertainty of the response functions, the frequency distribution of the WT within each land-use category and further GHG sources such as dissolved organic carbon or CH4 emissions from ditches. IPCC default emission factors were used for these minor GHG sources. In future, response functions could be applied directly when appropriate WT data is available. As no functional relationship was found for N2O emissions, emission factors were calculated as the mean observed flux per land-use category. In Germany, drained organic soils emit more than 55 million tons of GHGs per year, of which 91% are CO2. This is equivalent to around 6.6% of the national GHG emissions in 2014. Thus, they are the largest GHG source from agriculture and LULUCF. The described methodology is applicable on the project scale as well as in other countries where similar data are collected.

AB Due to geochemical processes, peat soils often have elevated concentrations of trace elements, which are gradually released following drainage for agriculture. Our objectives were to use incubation temperatures to vary microbial activity in two metalliferous peats (M7 acidic peat and M3 neutral peat) from the Elba, New York region, and to use periodic leaching to assess the extent of trace element release from these soils. Dried soils were mixed with glass beads to maintain aeration, moistened, and incubated at 4, 16, 28, and 37degreesC in 10-cm-diameter x 8-cm-tall columns. Five incubation-leaching cycles were performed, each consisting of 7.3 d of incubation (28 d for the final cycle) followed by 16 h of leaching with synthetic acid rain at 2.5 mm h(-1). Microbial activity was determined initially and after the final leaching by measuring C mineralization following glucose stimulation. Cumulative respiration results were ranked 28 > 16 > 4 > 37degreesC, with M7 acidic peat respiration values greater than M3 neutral peat at each temperature. Initial leachate pH levels were between 2 and 4, with acidification less pronounced and shorter-lived for the M3 peat. Leachate S, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NO3-N, and trace elements declined with successive leachings (rebounding slightly in the final M3 leachate), with concentrations typically greater in the M7 leachate. Elemental losses followed the same general ranking (28 > 16 > 4 > 37degreesC); losses at 28degreesC were 15 to 22% for As, Cd, Ni, and Zn from the M7 peat; losses from M3 were comparable only for Cu (1%) and Ni (19%). The correlation of respiration with S, DOC, and trace elements losses indicates that microbial processes mediated the release of trace elements in both peat soils. Neutral M3 peat pH levels limited losses of most analytes.

AB Organic materials deposited in lacustrine environments can be derived from both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and can serve as valuable indicators of catchment and in-lake ecological changes over time. However, spatial and temporal variation in the deposition of these materials within a lake basin will influence the interpretation of these sediment deposits. In this study, materials deposited in suspended sediment traps and basin sediments in Lough Feeagh, a temperate coastal humic lake, show variations in organic matter, total organic carbon and nitrogen loads, algal pigment concentrations and diatom assemblages. Sediment trap samples from three locations along with adjacent surface sediment cores show a clear north-south (inlet to outlet) gradient. C/N ratios reflected a mixture of algal and land-derived organic matter with a major peat influence, and comparisons between sediment trap and surface sediment assemblages revealed pigment and diatom assemblages influenced by lake-basin position and water depth. While some coherency between trap and sediment samples was apparent a more complicated biological response is demonstrated along with reduced water clarity in recent years thus highlighting the implications of increased allochthonous imputs for biological and biogeochemical processes in oligo-humic aquatic systems.

AB Previous studies reported N-15 enrichment of biota in reclamation wetlands that contain oil sands processed material (e.g., processed water and tailings); however, there is little information on the factors controlling N-15 enrichment in these systems. In this microcosm study, the aim was to examine stable C and N isotopes and growth (chlorophyll a [chl a] and dry weight) of algae as a function of exposure to different sources and concentrations of water-soluble fractions (WSF) derived from tailings. Two sources of tailings including mature fine tailings (MFT) and consolidated tailings (CT) and peat-mineral overburden were utilized to generate separate WSF that differed in water quality. In general, there was N-15 enrichment of filamentous algae along the increasing gradient of WSF/nutrient concentrations in both CT and peat microcosms, and among the different sources, algae were more N-15 enriched in CT WSF than in peat WSF. Growth of filamentous algae was inhibited at higher WSF concentrations, possibly due to reduced light availability at elevated levels of fine clay particles in MFT microcosms and colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in peat microcosms. Filamentous algae displayed lower biomass and N-15 depletion in 100% peat WSF. This study indicated that both the quality (source) and quantity of WSF affected algal growth and directly and/or indirectly influenced delta N-15 of algae. The distinct N-15 enrichment of primary producers derived from tailings suggest that stable N isotopes might be useful to trace exposure to oil sands processed material in biota that utilize these resources in reclaimed systems constructed with tailings or natural systems that receive tailings dyke seepage.

AB The response of the dispersion nanostructure of surface river bed sediment to the controlled removal and readdition of natural organic matter (NOM), in the absence and presence of background electrolyte, was examined using the technique of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Partial NOM removal induced aggregation of the mineral particles, but more extensive NOM removal restored colloidal stability. When peat humic acid (PHA) was added to a NOM-deficient sediment concentration-related structural transformations were observed: at 255 mg/L PHA aggregation of the nanocolloid was actually enhanced, but at 380 mg/L PHA disaggregation and colloidal stability were promoted. The addition of 2 mM CaCl2 induced mild aggregation in the native sediment but not in sediments with added PHA, suggesting that the native NOM and the PHA respond differently to changes in ionic strength. A first attempt at using SANS to directly characterize the thickness and coverage of an adsorbed PHA layer in a natural nanocolloid is also presented. The results are discussed in the context of a hierarchical aquatic colloidal nanostructure, and the implications for contemporary studies of the role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in sustaining the transport of colloidal iron in upland catchments.

AB [1] Arctic warming may cause the release of vast amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) from permafrost, which will manifest itself in the fluxes and composition of organic carbon in northern rivers and Arctic coastal regions. To elucidate the transport pathways of SOC, radiocarbon composition was measured for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), sediments and SOC from the Mackenzie, Sagavanirktok, and Yukon river basins, and soil leaching experiments were conducted. The radiocarbon ages of riverine suspended POC and sediments ranged from 4430 to similar to 7970 yr BP, while DOC was much younger (390-1440 yr BP) except samples from the Sag River. Soil leaching experiments released <1% of SOC as DOC. The decoupling in age and partitioning between POC and DOC indicates that POC in these rivers is dominated by old SOC derived from permafrost thawing and river-bank erosion in contrast to DOC, which is more readily influenced by modern terrestrial biomass, especially in large river basins which also drain subarctic regions. These observations imply that melting of permafrost will be manifest in the age and amounts of POC in arctic rivers whereas change in DOC will reflect altered plant ecology.

The amount of (CO2)-C-14 Was determined after 4, 6, 12, 19, and 26 days. After 26 days of incubation, each substrate showed priming effects, but not in all examined treatments. Most substrates stimulated the degradation of the model substances (positive priming effects). Negative priming effects only were found in the lignin system with oxalic acid and catechol addition at both concentrations., The strongest positive priming occurred in, the peat system with the oxalic acid addition of 80 mug, C g(-1) where 1.8% of the peat were mineralized after 26 days, compared to 0.7% in the control. The addition of 400 mug alanine-C g(-1),caused the strongest increase in lignin mineralization, amounting to 3.9% compared to 2.8% in the control. During the incubation the extent of priming changed with time. Most substrates caused the strongest effects during the first 4 to 10 days of incubation. The extent of priming depended on substrate type, substrate concentration, and organic model substance. Possibly this is due to the activation of different microorganisms.

AB The respiration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by aerobic heterotrophic bacterioplankton in boreal surface waters is one of the major factors that regulate CO2 exchange of lakes and rivers with the atmosphere in arctic and subarctic zones. The DOM that originates from topsoil leaching and vegetation degradation is brought to the lakes by surface flow and is subjected to coagulation and degradation by heterotrophic bacteria, which are well-established processes in the majority of boreal aquatic settings. The behavior of colloids and organic complexes of trace metals during this process is virtually unknown. In this work, we studied the interaction of two model heterotrophic bacteria, soil Pseudomonas aureofaciens and aquatic Pseudomonas reactans, with peat and Sphagnum moss leachates from the permafrost region under controlled laboratory conditions in nutrient-free media. The moss leachate was the better substrate for bacterial survival, with P. reactans exhibiting an order of magnitude higher live cell number compared with P. aureofaciens. In eight-day experiments, we analyzed organic carbon and approximate to 40 major and trace elements (TEs) during heterotrophic bacteria growth. The total net decrease in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was similar for both bacteria and ranged from 30mgg(wet)(-1) to 10mgg(wet)(-1) during 8days for the moss and peat leachate, respectively. Despite significant evolutions of pH, DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and cell number, most major (Mg, K, and Ca) and TEs remained nearly constant (within +/- 30% of the control). Only Fe, Al, P, Zn, Mn, Co, and Ba and to a much lesser extent Cd, Pb, Rare Earth Elements (REEs), U, Ti, and Zr were affected (p<0.05) by the presence of bacteria relative to the control and exhibited slight to moderate decreases during the experiment. Adsorption onto bacterial surfaces produced fast initial removal of Al, Mn, and Ba and to a lesser degree Cd, Pb, REEs, and U. Intracellular metabolic assimilation mostly affected P, Zn, and Co and progressively decreased their concentrations. Finally, coagulation as individual Fe/Al hydroxides due to DOM removal or pH change could also affect elements that were precipitated with organomineral colloids (Ti and Zr). The degrees of major and TE susceptibility to bacterial activity based on concentration changes during the experiment in both substrates ranged over three orders of magnitude from mgL(-1) to mu gL(-1) and followed the order DOC >> P >> Ba > Zn Fe Al > Mn > Cu Sr > Zr Ti > Ni Co > REEs U > Hf approximate to Th, which reflected the abundance of the elements in the two substrates. Generally, the soil exopolysaccharide producing bacterium P. aureofaciens in the peat leachate had the greatest impact of the four combinations investigated in this study (two bacteria with two substrates). Under ongoing environmental changes in the boreal zone, the autochthonous processes of bacterioplankton activity are able to decrease the concentrations of a very limited number of TEs, including mainly Fe and several macro- (P) and micro- (Zn, Mn, and Ba) nutrients.

AB A new technique for quantifying the geomorphic form of northern forested wetlands from airborne LiDAR surveys is introduced, demonstrating the unprecedented ability to characterize the geomorphic form of northern forested wetlands using high-resolution digital topography. Two quantitative indices are presented, including the lagg width index (LWI) which objectively quantifies the lagg width, and the lateral slope index (LSI) which is a proxy measurement for the dome shape or convexity of the wetland ground surface. For 14 forested wetlands in central Ontario, Canada, northwestern Ontario, Canada, and northern Minnesota, United States, these indices were systematically correlated to metrics of topographic setting computed from LiDAR digital elevation models. In particular, these indices were strongly correlated with a Peatland Topographic Index (PTI, r(2) = 0.58 and r(2) = 0.64, respectively, p <= 0.001) describing the relative influence of upslope contributing area on the hydrology and biogeochemistry of individual wetlands. The relationship between PTI and the LWI and LSI indices was interpreted as geomorphic evolution in response to the spatially varying influence of upslope runoff on subsurface hydrochemistry. Spatial patterns of near-surface pore water chemistry were consistent with this interpretation. Specifically, at four wetland sites sampled extensively for pore water chemistry, the mean and variance of near-surface pore water methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were higher within the zone of enhanced upland-wetland interactions, as inferred from the LiDAR-derived LWI estimates. Use of LiDAR surveys to measure subtle topographic gradients within wetlands may therefore help quantify the influence of upland-wetland interactions on biogeochemical cycling and export in northern forested landscapes.

AB Increased forest harvest with more whole-tree utilization can decrease base cations (BC) in soils and stream runoff. This paper analyses how reducing stream BC changes the capacity of a boreal stream network to buffer pH changes. We estimated change in stream pH during spring snowmelt in 60 locations throughout a 68 km2 boreal catchment in northern Sweden with different scenarios of BC removal from stream water ranging from 10 to 50 mequiv. .L(-1). The pH decreased in all scenarios, and if BC decreased by 50 mequiv. .L(-1), stream length with pH above the acid threshold pH 5 during spring snowmelt decreased from 82% to 44% of the stream network, whereas the stream length with pH above 5.5 decreased from 60% to 10%. The pH sensitivity of different stream reaches to reductions in BC was positively related to the slope of the catchment, forest cover, and forested mires, whereas it was negatively related to the percentage of agricultural fields. Because the long-term effect of different forestry practices on stream BC is unclear, there is all the more reason to evaluate BC sensitivity before, rather than after, eventual problems arise.

AB The microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) was studied in three Finnish boreal estuaries with contrasting land use patterns (Kiiminkijoki - natural forest and peatland; Kyronjoki - agricultural; Karjaanjoki - mixed/urban). Bioassays of 12-18 d long durations were used in 3 seasons at in situ temperatures. Besides the bulk parameters, a suite of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality parameters were also investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM and the molecular weight of DOM. Bioavailable DOC and DON pools varied significantly between the estuaries, from 7.9 to 10.6% and from 5.5 to 21.9 %, respectively. DOM originating from the catchment dominated by natural forests and peatlands (Kiiminkijoki) had the lowest DOC and DON degradation rates, as well as the lowest proportions of biodegradable DOC and DON. A greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment increased the bioavailability of DON, but not the bioavailability of DOC (Kyronjoki). Additionally, DOM quality varied significantly between the estuaries, and DOM originating from the agricultural Kyronjoki catchment sustained higher DOC and DON degradation rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) compared to those of the natural forest and peat dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment. The quality of DOM, indicated by differences in CDOM, fluorescent DOM and molecular weight, varied between estuaries with differing land use and was concluded to be major driver of BGE of these systems and thereafter to the microbial CO2 fluxes from the estuaries. The differences in BGE resulted in a 5-fold difference in the calculated daily bacterial CO2 emissions between the study's estuaries due to bacterial activity, ranging from 40 kg C d(-1) in the Karjaanjoki estuary to 200 kg C d(-1) in the Kyronjoki estuary. Lower DOC : DON ratios, smaller molecular weight and higher CDOM absorption spectral slope values of DOM resulted in higher proportion of the initial DOC and DON being transferred to microbial growth and therefore to the pelagic food web. The pristine, peatland and forest-dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment had the lowest BGE, and therefore proportionally highest CO2 fluxes.

AB Despite the importance of thermokarst (thaw) lakes of the subarctic zone in regulating greenhouse gas exchange with the atmosphere and the flux of metal pollutants and micro-nutrients to the ocean, the inventory of lake distribution and stock of solutes for the permafrost-affected zone are not available. We quantified the abundance of thermokarst lakes in the continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost zones of the western Siberian Lowland (WSL) using Landsat-8 scenes collected over the summers of 2013 and 2014. In a territory of 105 million ha, the total number of lakes >0.5 ha is 727,700, with a total surface area of 5.97 million ha, yielding an average lake coverage of 5.69% of the territory. Small lakes (0.5-1.0 ha) constitute about one third of the total number of lakes in the permafrost-bearing zone of WSL, yet their surface area does not exceed 2.9% of the total area of lakes in WSL. The latitudinal pattern of lake number and surface coverage follows the local topography and dominant landscape zones. The role of thermokarst lakes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and most trace element storage in the territory of WSL is non-negligible compared to that of rivers. The annual lake storage across the WSL of DOC, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Al constitutes 16%, 34%, 37%, 57%, and 73%, respectively, of their annual delivery by WSL rivers to the Arctic Ocean from the same territory. However, given that the concentrations of DOC and metals in the smallest lakes (<0.5 ha) are much higher than those in the medium and large lakes, the contribution of small lakes to the overall carbon and metal budget may be comparable to, or greater than, their contribution to the water storage. As such, observations at high spatial resolution (<0.5 ha) are needed to constrain the reservoirs and the mobility of carbon and metals in aquatic systems. To upscale the DOC and metal storage in lakes of the whole subarctic, the remote sensing should be coupled with hydrochemical measurements in aquatic systems of boreal plains.

AB U.S. coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes span a north-to-south gradient (latitude 47-41 degrees N) of increasing human population and agricultural intensity that alters their water chemistry and vegetation. We related field-measured water chemistry to vegetation condition and composition using data from 48 freshwater coastal wetlands along this sub-continental gradient, building upon previous findings that GIS-derived landscape descriptors could adequately predict vegetation condition in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Our aim was to determine (1) whether plant communities could be differentiated by their surface water chemistry, and (2) if water chemistry could better predict wetland vegetation condition than GIS-derived variables. Seven distinct plant communities were identified by agglomerative hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling of vegetation cover data: Sphagnum-carpeted poor fens, Sparganium eurycarpum marshes, Calamagrostis canadensis wetlands, Schoenoplectus pungens marshes, Phragmites australis marshes, and two floristically distinct Typha-dominated marshes. There were significant differences (ANOVA) among the seven plant assemblages identified for most water chemistry metrics (Cl-, chlorophyll a, conductivity, NO3-N, pH, total N, total P, total suspended solids), but dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, and NH4-N did not vary significantly across the assemblages. The two different Typha-dominated plant communities were chemically distinct from each other in chlorophyll a, conductivity, NO3-N, pH and total suspended solids concentrations, and we recommend that they be separated into distinct associations: Typha spp. - Thelypteris palustris - Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Typha spp. - C. canadensis - Leersia oryzoides. Plant communities tended to be geographically clustered, but wetlands that were geographic outliers of their floristic type were chemically similar to other wetlands in their plant community grouping despite being on different lakes. When offered both GIS-derived and field-measured potential predictor variables, a regression tree model of wetland condition chose only GIS-derived variables. However, a classification tree model derived solely from field-measured water chemistry variables correctly classified 79% of the sites into four plant community groupings based on total N, conductivity, and pH. Grouping wetlands by plant communities could provide a scientifically-defensible basis for stricter water quality standards to protect sensitive wetland types. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands cover a very small area of the Earth, but store globally significant quantities of carbon and export disproportionate quantities of fluvial organic carbon, especially when the peatlands are degraded or disturbed. Peatland headwater catchments with high concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) provide an opportunity to investigate the possibility of competing effects that could lead to enhanced or diminished turnover of DOC in the presence of POC. Both POC and DOC can be degraded by light and microbes, producing smaller molecules and releasing CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, and POC can inhibit light penetration, stabilize DOC by providing adsorption sites and providing surfaces for microbes to interact with DOC. However, the majority of peatland fluvial carbon studies are conducted using filtered water samples, and measure only the DOC concentration, so the impact of the particulate organic matter (POM) on in-stream processing of organic carbon is relatively unknown. It is therefore possible that studies have underestimated carbon transformations in rivers as they have not considered the interaction of the particulate material on the dissolved concentrations; there could be higher losses than previously estimated, increasing the contribution of peatland headwaters to GHG emissions. In this study, we assessed if the current approach of DOC degradation studies accurately represent the impact of POM on DOC degradation, by quantifying DOC production from POM, and therefore POC, over time in water with manipulated POM concentrations. Both filtered and unfiltered water lost 60% of the DOC over 70 hours, whereas the treatment with additional POM lost only 35%. The results showed that filtering does not significantly impact the DOC degradation rates; however, when the POC concentration was doubled, there was a significant reduction in DOC degradation, suggesting that filtering would still be necessary to get accurate rates of DOC transformations in waters with high POC concentrations.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwaters is recognised as a significant and active component of the global carbon budget. DOM exported from terrestrial ecosystems may be compositionally and functionally altered by chemical and biological reactions as it is transported downstream. The processes affecting DOM in headwater streams remain uncertain but are potentially highly variable depending on DOM composition and nutrient availability as a function of soils, land-use, and human pressures. To investigate variability of DOM reactivity we took water samples from two contrasting headwater catchments, considered functional 'end-members' for DOM export: one rich in aromatic DOM and low in inorganic nutrients (peatland), and another (nearby) catchment characterized by less aromatic DOM and high nutrient loadings (agricultural grassland). Under controlled laboratory conditions, we evaluated the effects of light, presence/absence of aquatic biota and nutrient enrichment on short-term changes in DOM quantity and quality in these samples. For the peat stream, exposure to sunlight (with UV) resulted in net abiotic DOM removal, whereas in the agricultural stream it led to net biological DOM production. Nutrient addition accelerated DOM production in both streams. We conclude that in-stream changes in DOM quantity and quality represent the net effect of multiple consumption and production processes whose relative importance is strongly influenced by source-dependent DOM composition and environmental factors such as inorganic nutrient content and sunlight exposure. Our findings suggest that headwater streams may be more active processors of carbon and nutrients than presumed hitherto.

TI EFFECT OF A LOWERED WATER-TABLE ON NITROUS-OXIDE FLUXES FROM NORTHERN

SO NATURE

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE CHANGE; METHANE FLUX; FENS
AB NORTHERN peatlands contain 20-30% of the total organic nitrogen and carbon in the world's soils1,2, and thus they apparently have the potential to exert a significant influence on the global atmospheric budget of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (N2O).  In the drier, warmer summer conditions predicted at high latitudes by some climate models3,4 as a result of greenhouse-gas forcing, northern peatlands would become drier, increasing the rate of mineralization of organic matter1,5 and of the microbial processes that produce N2O. These regions might therefore be expected to exert a strong feedback on climate. But whereas methane emissions have been well studied6,7, little is known about the effect on N2O fluxes of changes in the level of peatland water tables. Here we present a comparison of present-day N2O fluxes from virgin peatlands in Finland with those from sites in the same regions that were drained by ditching 30 and 50 years ago. The lowered water table had no effect on N2O emissions from nutrient-poor peat but enhanced those from nutrient-rich peat. We estimate that equivalent drying caused by climate change would increase the total emissions of N2O from northern peatlands by 0.03-0.1 teragrams of nitrogen per year, which is just 0.3-1% of the present global annual emissions. Thus northern peatlands are unlikely to exert a significant climate feedback from N2O emissions.

AB Mountain fens are vital ecosystems for habitat, biodiversity, water and carbon cycling, but there is little comprehensive information on their distribution, abundance or condition in any region of the western U.S. Our study objectives were to: 1) evaluate fen distribution, abundance and characteristics in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, 2) quantify disturbances, and 3) prioritize restoration needs of fens. We mapped 624 fens in 37 watersheds and collected field data on 182 of these fens. We estimated that approximately 2,000 fens occur in the San Juan Mountains, primarily in the subalpine zone at an average elevation of 3,288 m. Fens ranged from 0.2 to 20.5 ha in size, peat thickness ranged between 0.40 to > 4.00 m, and surface slope ranged from 0-21%. Groundwater pH ranged from 3.1-7.6 and Ca+2 from 1-341 mg/L, reflecting the diverse geochemistry of watershed parent materials. We identified 188 vascular and 63 bryophyte taxa, and classified the 309 sampled stands into 20 plant communities that formed along complex hydrogeomorphic and geochemical gradients. The majority of fens were in excellent condition; however 10% of our sampled fens had high to very high restoration potential due to impacts from roads, mining, and ditching.

AB Anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity (K) are seldom considered in models of mire hydrology. We investigated the effect of anisotropy and heterogeneity on groundwater flow in bog peat using a steady-state groundwater model. In five model simulations, four sets of K data were used. The first set comprised measured K values from an anisotropic and heterogeneous bog peat. These data were aggregated to produce the following simplified data sets: an isotropic and heterogeneous distribution of K; an isotropic and homogeneous distribution; and an anisotropic and homogeneous distribution. We demonstrate that, where anisotropy and heterogeneity exist, groundwater flow in bog peat is complex. Fine-scale variations in K have the potential to influence patterns and rates of groundwater flow. However, for our data at least, it is heterogeneity and not anisotropy that has the greater influence on producing complex patterns of groundwater flow. We also demonstrate that patterns and rates of groundwater flow are simplified and reduced when measured K values are aggregated to create a more uniform distribution of K. For example, when measured K values are aggregated to produce isotropy and homogeneity, the rate of modelled seepage is reduced by 28%. We also show that when measured K values are used, the presence of a drainage ditch can increase seepage through a modelled cross-section. Our work has implications for the accurate interpretation of hydraulic head data obtained from peat soils, and also the understanding of the effect of drainage ditches on patterns and rates of groundwater flow.

AB The societal risks of water scarcity and water-quality impairment have received considerable attention, evidenced by recent analyses of these topics by the 2030 Water Resources Group, the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. What are the effects of fire on the predicted water scarcity and declines in water quality? Drinking water supplies for humans, the emphasis of this exploration, are derived from several land cover types, including forests, grass-lands and peatlands, which are vulnerable to fire. In the last two decades, fires have affected the water supply catchments of Denver (CO) and other southwestern US cities, and four major Australian cities including Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne. In the same time period, several, though not all, national, regional and global water assessments have included fire in evaluations of the risks that affect water supplies. The objective of this discussion is to explore the nexus of fire, water and society with the hope that a more explicit understanding of fire effects on water supplies will encourage the incorporation of fire into future assessments of water supplies, into the pyrogeography conceptual framework and into planning efforts directed at water resiliency.

AB Savage Fen is a wetlands complex at the base of north-facing bluffs in the Minnesota River Valley. The complex includes 27.8 hectares of calcareous fen that host rare calciphile plants whose populations are declining in Minnesota. Water and sediment compositions in the calcareous fen were studied to gain a better understanding of the hydrologic system that sustains the rare vegetation. Groundwater in the fen is a calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type with circumneutral pH values. The groundwater composition is the result of interactions among water, dissolved and gaseous carbon species, carbonates, and ion exchangers. Shallow groundwater is distinguished from deep groundwater by smaller concentrations of chloride, sulfate, magnesium, and sodium, and larger concentrations of calcium, bicarbonate, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonium. Magnesian calcite is the prevalent carbonate in unconsolidated sedimentary fill beneath the fen and is an important source and sink for dissolved calcium, magnesium, and inorganic carbon. Calcite concentrations just below the water table are small because aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of organic matter increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P(CO2)), decrease pH, and cause calcite to dissolve. Thick calcite accumulations just above the water table, in the root zone of calciphile plants, result from water table fluctuations and attendant changes in P(CO2). Groundwater beneath Savage Fen recharges in lakes and ponds south of the fen and upwells to the surface within the fen. Water at the water table is a mixture of upwelling groundwater and water near the surface that flows downslope from higher elevations in the fen. Changes in oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of shallow groundwater indicate that the proportion of upwelling groundwater in shallow groundwater decreases downgradient in the calcareous fen. Encroachment of reed grasses into the calcareous fen may reflect human-caused disturbances in the recharge area.

AB Straw incorporation, a common agricultural practice for improving soil quality in paddy soil, leads to the increase of methane (CH4) emission. Application of biochar in soil is an attractive method to sequestrate carbon and reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. This study aimed at exploring the effect of biochar on CH4 emission in the paddy soil with straw incorporation.
   In this study, the low-temperature biochar (BC300) and high-temperature biochar (BC500 and BC700) were incubated with or without straw in soil. Soil CH4 fluxes were monitored during the whole period of laboratory incubation. Soil properties were measured, including pH, redox potential (Eh) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The abundance and composition of methanogenic archaeal and methanotrophic bacterial communities were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing, respectively.
   When no straw was applied, low-temperature biochar decreased soil Eh, increased the abundances of methanogenic archaea, and thus promoted the emission of CH4, while high-temperature biochar had little effect on CH4 emission. When straw was applied, biochar inhibited CH4 emission by decreasing the content of available carbon for methanogenic archaea. The inhibition effect of high-temperature biochar was stronger than that of low-temperature biochar.
   The results indicated that CH4 emission was affected by both biochar type and straw application. Biochar could significantly decrease CH4 emission when straw was returned to paddy soil, and the decrease induced by high-temperature biochar was stronger than that of low-temperature biochar.

AB This study evaluates and compares the parameters of equilibrium adsorption from aqueous solutions of river fulvic acids (FA) and peat fulvic acids. Compared to peat FA, the river FA had lower biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). We observed a tendency for correlation between change of Gibbs free energy of adsorption and BDOC value. A chlorination dose of 1.4 mg L-1 did not change FA biodegradability and adsorbability. ClO2 treatment produced similar results; ClO2 had a stronger oxidizing influence on FA with low BDOC than on FA with high BDOC. In general, the oxidative effect of O-3 was greater than Cl-2 or ClO2 and the oxidative effect of ClO2 was greater than Cl-2. Qi-Schideman and modified Freundlich equations well described all isotherms of FA on activated carbon F300. The content of low-adsorbed substances in peat FA decreased in the sequence: initial solution -Cl-2 - ClO2 - O-3. A similar difference was also seen with BDOC content in FA solutions. For peat FA with high BDOC content, the low-adsorbed fraction transformed to a strong-adsorbed fraction. Chlorination and chlorine dioxide treatment decreased low-adsorbed fraction absorbability, although ozone treatment increased it, which corresponded with a change in BDOC and a change in Gibbs free energy of adsorption. Chlorination and ClO2 treatment increased the non-adsorbable fraction, and ozonation substantially decreased the non-adsorbable part of the FA. Treatment by chlorine and ozone increased the concentration range of the strong-adsorbed fraction; chlorine dioxide did not significantly influence this fraction.

AB This presents the longest, consistent records of dissolved organic carbon in rivers ever published. This study presents long-term records of organic matter as indicated by water colour that were constructed for three catchments in Northern England for as far back as 1962. Observations show that there have been large increases in DOC concentrations over the period of study with in one case a doubling of the concentration over a period of 29 years. However, in one of the catchments no significant change was observed over a 31-year period. All catchments show common inter-annual control on carbon release in response to droughts, but no step increases in DOC concentrations were observed in response to such perturbations with pre-drought levels being restored within a period 3-4 years. Observed increasing trends do not correlate with changes in river discharge, pH, alkalinity or rainfall, but do coincide with increasing average summer temperatures in the region. The times series of DOC concentration over the period of the record appears stationary, but the distribution of daily values suggests a change in sources of colour over the increasing trend. The evidence supports a view that increases in carbon release are in equilibrium with temperature increases accentuated by land-use factors.

AB Through restoration, degraded wetlands are thought to recover their carbon storage function over time. However, little is known about the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions after restoration of degraded wetlands. In this study, we selected four wetlands, two degraded (one grazed and one graze-released site), one restored for 6 years and one natural site from the Zoige wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China to investigate the dynamics of SOC following restoration. The concentrations of SOC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), and heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) in the degraded sites were significantly lower than those in the natural wetland. In contrast, soil delta C-13 (i.e. C-13/C-12 ratio) in the degraded sites was significantly higher than that in the natural site. After 8 years of restoration, the restored and the natural wetland sites did not differ significantly in SOC, DOC, LFOC, HFOC or delta C-13. Therefore, restored wetlands regained some of their role in carbon storage over time. SOC turnover was slower in the natural wetland than in the degraded and restored sites.

AB Premise of the study : The goal of this study was to illuminate the evolutionary history and ecological importance of plant mixotrophy-the uptake and utilization of exogenous organic compounds.
   Methods : We quantitatively assessed the effect of sugar amendments on laboratory growth of Sphagnum compactum as a representative emergent peat moss and two species of ecologically associated zygnematalean algae, Cylindrocystis brebissonii and Mougeotia sp.
   Key results : Together with observations published elsewhere, our results suggest that under carbon or light limitation, the uptake of exogenous sugars by cells of charophycean algae and peat mosses may help these organisms maintain positive carbon balance. Utilization of 1% glucose by aquatic-grown algae helped to relieve dissolved inorganic carbon limitation, enhancing photoautotrophic growth by factors of 9.0 and 1.7, respectively. After an 8-wk growth period, amendments of 1% and 2% glucose enhanced air-grown moss biomass by 28 and 39 times, respectively, that of controls lacking sugar amendments. After 9 wk, 1% fructose enhanced biomass by 21 times, and 2% sucrose enhanced biomass by 31 times.
   Conclusion : Our results indicate that plant mixotrophy is an early-evolved trait. The results also indicate that quantitative differences in sugar utilization by bryophytes and charophycean algae correlate with relative investments in protective cell-wall polyphenolics measured in previous studies, suggesting that sugar utilization may subsidize the cost of producing phenolic wall compounds in bryophytes.

AB This study analyses long-term water quality data from an upland peat catchment in order to understand long-term changes in hydrological flowpaths and how they relate to recovery from severe drought and control the release of DOC. The study examined comparative records from rainfall, soil and stream samples over a 9-year period, which included an approximately I in 30-year drought 2 years into the period. The study examined single tracers and utilised multivariate statistics to examine changing sources and routes of runoff. The study shows that the severe drought is part of dry period not restricted to a single summer and this extended dry period may give rise to the extent of the chemical changes observed in the stream chemistry. During this period of drought there is no evidence for substantive new flowpaths being generated during the drought, instead the residence time of the water in the upper peat horizon (< 10 cm depth) increases and that this increase is reflected in the chemistry of runoff. The soil waters deeper in the peat profile (approx. 50 cm) show increased influence of rainwater compositions and that during drought the residence times at depth increase. There is an offset between the severe drought and maximums in concentrations of Fe, DOC and Al are related to the hydrophobic nature of the peat matrix. The effects of a 30-year drought persisted for no more than 3 years ending with the end of the dry period, and at least the effects of severe drought lasted only a year. The study suggests that in peat catchments summer's are hydrologically independent of the winters and this fact limits the consequences of severe drought. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The biomarker composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the six largest Arctic rivers was studied between 2003 and 2007 as part of the PARTNERS Project. Samples were collected over seasonal cycles relatively close to the river mouths. Here we report the lignin phenol and p-hydroxybenzene composition of Arctic river DOC in order to identify major sources of carbon. Arctic river DOC represents an important carbon conduit linking the large pools of organic carbon in the Arctic/Subarctic watersheds to the Arctic Ocean. Most of the annual lignin discharge (>75%) occurs during the two month of spring freshet with extremely high lignin concentrations and a lignin phenol composition indicative of fresh vegetation from boreal forests. The three large Siberian rivers, Lena, Yenisei, and Ob, which also have the highest proportion of forests within their watersheds, contribute about 90% of the total lignin discharge to the Arctic Ocean. The composition of river DOC is also characterized by elevated levels of p-hydroxybenzenes, particularly during the low flow season, which indicates a larger contribution from mosses and peat bogs. The lignin composition was strongly related to the average C-14-age of DOC supporting the abundance of young, boreal-vegetation-derived leachates during spring flood, and older, soil-, peat-, and wetland-derived DOC during groundwater dominated low flow conditions, particularly in the Ob and Yukon Rivers. We observed significant differences in DOC concentration and composition between the rivers over the seasonal cycles with the Mackenzie River being the most unique, the Lena River being similar to the Yenisei, and the Yukon being most similar to the Ob. The observed relationship between the lignin phenol composition and watershed characteristics suggests that DOC discharge from these rivers could increase in a warmer climate under otherwise undisturbed conditions.

AB Research throughout Europe has indicated the continuing reductions in acidic aerial deposition and associated improvements in freshwater pH. However, information on macroinvertebrate responses to these on-going changes is rare. During 2009, 2010 and 2011, 34 peat-dominated catchments in three geologically distinct acid-sensitive regions of Ireland were sampled for macroinvertebrates (6 occasions) and chemistry (3 seasons) to assess the effects of reduced sulphate and nitrate deposition in an ecoregion with historically low acidic deposition. Streams drained moorland catchments without forest, catchments with 20%-50% (low) and catchments with forest cover and > 50% (high) forest cover. Results indicate ecological improvements have occurred in many forested catchments when compared with findings in the early 1990s, especially on metamorphic and igneous geologies. However, episodically low pH (< 5.7) and high inorganic aluminium concentrations (> 150 mu g l(-1)), associated with storm-flow events, resulted in periods of ecological degradation. Nevertheless, the reductions in ecological health appeared seasonal, associated with antecedent hydrochemistry and climate. Interestingly, acid-sensitive Baetidae were present in the majority of forested streams in Ireland, owing to the recent improvements in water quality. However, caution must be advised as there are still many hydrochemical and ecological uncertainties in peat-soil forested catchments, owing to the high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, climate change and changes to catchment management.

AB This work reports on the changes in compositions of humic acids (HAs) and fulvic acids (FAs) during photocatalytic degradation. The HAs and FAs were obtained from the XAD-resin fractionation of natural-organic matter (NOM) from a bog lake (Lake Hohloh, Black Forest, Germany). Degussa P-25 titanium dioxide (TiO2) in a suspension and a solar UV simulator (batch reactor) were used in the experiments. The photocatalytic degradation of the HAs and FAs were monitored using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) equipped with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet (UV254) detection (SEC-DOC and SEC-UV254) and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The evolutions of the photocatalytic degradations of the HA and FA fractions were selective. The photocatalytic degradation started with the degradations of high molecular weight compounds with relatively high UV254 absorbances in the HA and FA fractions to yield low molecular weight compounds showing less specific UV254 absorbances. Observance of the same tendency for the original NOM from Lake Hohloh indicates that these XAD-fractions still having complex compound mixtures. However, the larger molecular weight fractions of the FAs showed higher preferential adsorptions onto TiO2, which caused their faster degradation rates. Furthermore, FAs showed a greater reduction of the total THM formation potential (TTHMFP) and the organic halogen compounds adsorbable on activated carbon formation potential (AOXFP), in comparison with the HAs.

AB Approximately 42% of Canada is covered by forests, which in turn can be subdivided into nine distinct forest ecozones. Many forested ecozones are located in northern Canada, where cold winters and cool summers provide forest environments that are less well-understood that those in more temperate locations. A number of major developments in recent years have stressed the need for enhanced understanding of hydrological processes in these forest landscapes. These include an increased emphasis on sustainable forest management in Canada as well as major scientific initiatives (e.g. BOREAS) examining water, carbon and energy fluxes in forest ecosystems, with a particular focus on boreal and subarctic forests. Recent progress in our understanding of forest hydrology across Canada is reviewed. Studies of hydrological processes across the spectrum of forest ecozones are highlighted, as well as work on hydrological responses to forest disturbance and recovery. Links between studies of hydrological processes in Canada's forests and other fields of research are examined, with particular attention paid to ongoing efforts to model hydrological impacts and interactions with the climate, biogeochemistry, geomorphology and ecology of forested landscapes.

AB Rice residue management often leads to increased methane (CH4) emissions but the outcomes of edaphic and management factors are not always predictable. Rice residue can act as a substrate for CH4 production; however the role it plays in priming (mineralization) of soil organic matter (SUM) to release additional substrates for CH4 production are not well established. We anaerobically incubated a highly organic soil with C-13-enriched rice straw for 3 months to investigate its priming effect (PE) on SUM and source of C for CH4 production. Anaerobic decomposition of SUM was accompanied by iron (Fe) reduction with minimal CH4 production when straw was absent. Straw addition enhanced Fe reduction and increased CH4 production concurrently with a clear succession of microbial community structure and function assessed with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. The PE on CH4 production from SUM was strong and positive during the entire experiment. Overall, PE on SUM (CO2 plus CH4 production) was slightly positive at the end of the experiment, associated with only a 32% mineralization of the added straw-C (as CO2 plus CH4). Straw addition also released large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from SOM. Our results suggest that straw addition effects on PE of SUM and CH4 production can last for a long period of time showing that straw will cause non-linear response in CH4 production and potentially result in significant losses of soil C as DOC by leaching or direct exports in histosols.

AB Methane oxidation (methanotrophy) in the water column and sediments of forested swamp pools likely control seasonal and annual emission of CH 4 from these systems, but the methanotrophic microbial communities, their activities, locations, and overall impact, is poorly understood. Several techniques including 14 CH 4 oxidation assays, culture-based most probable number (MPN) estimates of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and protozoan abundance, MOB strain isolation and characterization, and PCR techniques were used to investigate methanotrophy at a forested swamp near Ithaca, New York. The greatest methanotrophic activity and largest numbers of MOB occurred predominantly at the low oxygen sediment/water interface in the water column. Seasonally, methanotrophic activity was very dynamic, ranging from 0.1 to 61.9 mumoles CH4 d(-1) g(-1) dry sediment, and correlated most strongly with dissolved inorganic carbon (r = 0.896). Incorporation of methanotrophic variables (abundance and activity) into existing CH4 flux regression models improved model fit, particularly during mid summer when CH4 fluxes were most dynamic. Annually integrated methane flux and methanotrophic activity measurements indicate that differences in methanotrophic activity at the sediment/water interface likely accounted for differences in the annual CH4 emission from the field site. Direct isolations of MOB resulted in the repeated isolation of organisms most closely related to Methylomonas methanica S1. A single acidophilic, type II MOB related to Methylocella palustris K was also isolated. Using a PCR-based MPN method and 16S rRNA genome copy number from isolates and control strains, type I and type II MOB were enumerated and revealed type I dominance of the sediment-associated MOB community.

AB The size distribution and speciation of organic matter (OM) in soil solution, bog, stream, and humic and clearwater lake in the north boreal zone (Karelia region, north west Russia) during the summer base-flow period for several years were investigated. The samples were filtered in the field using cascade filtration through progressively decreasing pore size (100, 20, 10, 5, 0.8, 0.4, 0.22, 0.1, 0.046 mu m, 100 kDa, 10 kDa and 1 kDa) followed by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, UV-vis and size exclusion chromatography measurements. Surrogate parameters, such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA; absorbance at 254 nm normalized for DOC concentration in l mg (1) m (1)) and the absorbance ratios E-254/E-436, E-280/E-350, E-254/E-365, E-365/E-470 and E-470/E-655 (ratio of spectrophotometric absorbance of the sample at two wavelengths) were applied for the characterization of OM in filtered and ultrafiltered water from soil solution, bog, river and lake.
   In the < 0.22 mu m filtrates, there was a systematic decrease in DOC concentration, C/N ratio, SUVA (hydrophobicity and aromaticity) and proportion of colloidal (1 kDa-0.22 mu m) OC along the watershed profile from peat bog soil solution, feeding humic lake, to the middle course of the stream towards the terminal oligotrophic lake. Within the filtrates and ultrafiltrates of soil solution and terminal lake, C/N increased from 100 to 140 and from 7 to 25 for 0.22-10 mu m and < 1 kDa fractions, respectively. SUVA, degree of humification, hydrophobicity and aromaticity generally increased from high molecular weight (HMW) to low molecular weight (LMW) fractions, being highest in the < 1 kDa fraction. The results allowed a comprehensive view of DOM transport and transformation among various size fractions within a small boreal watershed that can serve as an analogue of small rivers discharge to the Arctic Ocean. It follows that, during the summer baseflow season, the signature of organic-rich interstitial soil solutions originating in a typical peat bog zone can be completely masked by processes occurring in adjacent bog surface waters feeding lakes, as well as in the stream itself. As such, depending on local landscape, one may expect extremely high variability in both chemical nature and MW of DOM delivered by small coastal watersheds to the Arctic Ocean during the summer baseflow period.

AB Among wetlands, rich fens are one of the most species-rich, and also one of the most threatened habitats due to drainage activities. We tested the effects of several restoration measures on vegetation composition and dynamics over 4 years in two rich fens in east central Sweden that had been drained about 50 years ago. The encroaching tree layer was removed, and the restoration measures examined were rewetting by ditch blocking, mowing, and peat disturbance (removing vegetation and mixing the surface peat). At both sites, rewetting alone (without mowing or peat disturbance) led to small changes in species composition. In plots with peat disturbance, several characteristic rich fen species established, probably from a persistent diaspore bank or from refugia nearby. The disturbance treatment also prevented a rapid reestablishment of dominant grasses and mosses that had spread since drainage. Late season mowing alone appeared not to be a very efficient treatment in the initial phase after restoration, but seemed to reinforce the positive effects of peat disturbance. The results indicate the necessity of combining several treatments to recreate an ecologically functional vegetation.

AB Wetlands are very vulnerable ecosystems and sensitive to changes in the ground water table. For the last few thousand years, hydrological balance has also been influenced by human activity. To improve their cropping features, drainage activity and fertilizing were applied. The drainage process led to an abrupt change of environment, the replacement of plant communities and the entire ecosystem. The problem of carbon sequestration is very important nowadays. A higher accumulation rate is related to higher carbon accumulation, but the intensity of carbon sequestration depends on the type of mire, habitat, and climatic zone. The main aim of this article was an examination of the changes in poor-fen ecosystem during the last 200 years in relation to natural and anthropogenic factors, using paleoecological methods (pollen and macrofossils). The second aim was a detailed investigation of the sedimentary record to aid our understanding of carbon sequestration in the poor fen of temperate zone. This case study shows that fens in temperate zones, in comparison with boreal ones, show higher carbon accumulation rates which have been especially intensive over the last few decades. To reconstruct vegetation changes, detailed palynological and macrofossil analyses were done. A 200-year history of the mire revealed that it was influenced by human activity to much degree. However, despite the nearby settlement and building of the drainage ditch, the precious species and plant communities still occur.

AB This work describes the effects of simulated solar UV light on the bulk properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of bog lake water and on the formation of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs). By means of size-exclusion chromatography it was shown that the more hydrophilic moieties of the DOM were preferentially photodegraded while the more hydrophobic ones remained relatively unaffected or were even formed. The combined photochemical-biological degradation proved to be more important than the pure photochemical mineralization. Formic, acetic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, and succinic acids were identified as important degradation products. Their contribution to the dissolved organic carbon increased from 0.31% before to 6.4% after 24 h irradiation. About 33% of the bioavailable photoproducts of DOM were comprised of these LMWOAs. The influence of nitrate on the formation of carboxylic acids could not be observed in the investigated system. Kinetic experiments indicated that degradation of LMWOAs occurred simultaneously during irradiation experiments, alpha-oxygen-substituted LMWOAs being more amenable to these processes. Dissolved iron acted as a catalyst of DOM photodegradation and LMWOA photoformation. Copper played an antagonistic role in the irradiation experiments, reducing the formation of formic, acetic, and malonic acids while increasing the formation of oxalic acid.

AB Carbon mass balance studies of 20 small, forested catchments and seven lakes on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario during a 12-year period have shown that most carbon in the study lakes is derived from terrestrial sources, primarily peatlands, and that carbon retained by lakes (total inputs less loss via outflow from the lake) is partitioned between lake sediments and the atmosphere. The partitioning of retained carbon is a function of lake alkalinity: the ratio of evaded/sediment carbon increases with decreasing alkalinity. These carbon flux relationships were applied to the global boreal forest biome to evaluate the role of aquatic systems with respect to carbon fluxes and pools within the biome. We calculate that approximately 66 Tg of organic and inorganic carbon are exported annually from the boreal forest biome to adjacent surface waters of which 14 to 36 Tg reach coastal waters. The remainder is either evaded to the atmosphere (12 to 21 Tg yr(-1)) or stored in lake sediments (18 to 31 Tg yr(-1)). Approximately 120 Pg of carbon may be stored in boreal lake sediments, a conservative estimate based on an accumulation period of 5,000 years and a size comparable to recent boreal pool estimates of 419 Pg for peatlands and 64 Pg for plant biomass. Hence the amount of total carbon stored in the boreal forest biome may be significantly larger because of storage in lake sediments.

AB Methane emissions and below ground methane pore water concentrations were determined in an alpine fen at 1,915 m a.s.l. in central Switzerland. The fen represented an acidic (pH 4.5-4.9), nutrient-poor to mesotrophic habitat dominated by Carex limosa, Carex rostrata, Trichophorum caespitosum and Sphagnum species. From late fall to late spring the fen was snow-covered. Throughout winter the temperatures never dropped below 0A degrees C at 5 cm below the vegetation surface. Methane emissions in June, July, August and September were in the range of 125 (+/- 26)-313 (+/- 71) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) with a tendency to decrease along the summer season. Mean methane pore water concentrations at a depth of 20-40 cm below the vegetation surface were 526 (+/- 32) mu M in June and in the range of 144 (+/- 10)-233 (+/- 7) mu M in July, August and September. At a depth of 0-20 cm the mean methane pore water concentrations dropped back to < 20 mu M with an almost linear decrease between 0 and 15 cm. Oxygen pore water concentrations were close to air saturation in the first few centimeters and dropped back below detection limit at a depth of 20 cm. In July and August the pore water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were in the range of 7.2-10.1 mg C l(-1) at all depths. The pore water concentrations of acetate, formate and oxalate were in the range of 2.0-8.2 mu M at all depths. Methanotrophic and methanogenic communities were quantified using pmoA and mcrA, respectively, as marker genes. The abundances of both communities showed a distinct peak at a depth of 10-15 cm below the vegetation surface.

AB The hydrology and nutrient dynamics of a sacred lake in the western part of the Sikkim Himalaya were studied. The lake watershed has broad-leaved mixed forest and agriculture land, two perennial and five seasonal inlets, and one major outlet. Annual inflow was 1103x10(6) l while outflow was 4279x10(6) l. About 70% of its water was from subsurface flow and seepage. More than 50% of the discharge was recorded in August (peak rainy season month) and the least in March (lean month). Sediment flow to the lake was 346 Mg y(-1) and outflow 316 Mg y(-1). The remaining 30 Mg was deposited in the lake. High sediment runoff in the rainy season turned the lake turbid and caused expansion of the bog. The nutrient (dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, total-N, ammonium-N, phosphate-P and chloride) levels of the lake, inlets and outlet varied between seasons and sites. Plankton productivity ranged from 16 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in winter to 247 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season. Its respiratory loss was 12 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in winter and 160 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season. Religious activities, agriculture, cattle grazing and forestry in the watershed should be controlled for maintaining the longevity of the lake.

AB Once or twice weekly, water sampling was undertaken for a two and a half year period in the Kalix River, northern Sweden. Soil water, groundwater, water in tributaries and mire water were also sampled at several occasions. Samples were filtered and analysed for major dissolved elements and TOC. Although only 5% of the bedrock in the Kalix River drainage basin is situated in the Caledonian mountains (mostly schist, with some outcrops of dolomite and limestone), the chemical composition of the river, at the river mouth, is clearly influenced by water from the mountain areas. High dissolved Ca/Mg ratios in June and July indicate a large influence of water from the mountain areas during summer. The dissolved Si/Mg ratio increases when water from the woodland (bedrock consisting of Precambrian granitoids) predominates during snowmelt in May, but the ratio is low during summer when water from the mountains is increased. However, the low Si concentrations in the mountain areas are probably not primarily the result of the different rocks but more a reflection of the less intense weathering of silicate minerals in the mountains. High Si/Mg ratios are closely related to high TOC. All the major dissolved elements, except TOC, are diluted by snowmelt in May. However, the dilution varies for different elements. Based on the interpretations of major element ratios the melt water discharge in May reflects two major compartments in the woodland; peatland areas and the upper section of the soil. During summer and autumn storm events in the woodland most of the storm water originated from peatland. High K/Mg ratios in the river in May are related to water discharge from the upper section of the till. Low S/Mg ratios in the river indicate an influence of mire water from the woodland both during melt water discharge in May and during increased water discharge in autumn. The Ca/Mg ratios in tributaries in the woodland are consistently lower during melt water discharge compared with values in August. The lower Ca/Mg ratio in May probably reflects water that has been in contact with the B-horizon in the till during spring flood. Data show that the TOC discharged during spring flood originates from two major compartments in the landscape, the upper soil profile and peatland. Storm discharge of TOC during the rest of the year originates mostly from peatland.

AB Studies with application of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon have been performed on calcareous tufa, groundwater and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the spring mire cupola in Wardzy. This study was focused on the verification of the a priori hypothesis that the analysed calcareous tufa is a chemical deposit and on the attempt to supplement an earlier scenario of environmental changes in the Subboreal with oscillations of water temperature. The constructed model of chemical and isotope balance, and delta C-13 determinations in DIC, allowed for calculating ratios of stable isotopes of carbon in particular speciations and in gaseous CO2. The obtained results coupled with delta C-13 values in calcite indicate that this mineral precipitated from the solution chemically (without the contribution of living organisms). Additionally, it was possible to reconstruct the temperature range at which the calcareous tufa was formed. The reconstructed scenario of changes in the thermal conditions was refined based on delta O-18 determinations in groundwater and calcite. Accordingly, the oldest calcareous tufa, with an age of about 5500 cal years BP, was formed in cool climate conditions (with average annual temperatures by about 3 degrees C lower than presently). The formation of younger series of the calcareous tufa took place between 4400-2900 cal years BP and represents a much warmer period with two distinct cooler episodes at 3900 and 3000 cal years BP, respectively. The course of the obtained temperature curves correlates well with the GISP2 curve and curves obtained for other sites in Northern, and Central Europe.

AB Natural organic acids are important in the acid-base chemistry of many natural waters. However, field studies suggest that the degree of acid neutralization provided by natural organic acids is small, even in organic-rich waters. We added sulfuric acid and sodium bicarbonate separately to a bog stream in the Czech Republic to evaluate the role of organic acids in the acidification and subsequent recovery of brown waters subjected to chronically high acid deposition. Despite naturally high organic acid concentrations (dissolved organic carbon [DOC] concentration, 48.9 mg L-1; total carboxyl group concentration [C-T], 344 mu equiv L-1; organic acid anion concentration [RCOO-], 176 mu equiv L-1), only 10% of the added acid and base were neutralized by the protonation or deprotonation of carboxylic functional groups. Approximately 80% of the acid and base additions remained unbuffered. Release of aluminum and basic cations to solution accounted for the remainder of the added acid and base. A Gaussian model of organic acid dissociation, fitted to our experimental results, explained the variations in RCOO- and the minimal buffering offered by organic solutes. Sulfate and hydrogen ion (H+) concentrations at the study site declined sharply (ca. 50%) in 1992-1996, but DOC, C-T, and RCOO- were unchanged. Our experimental and monitoring results suggest that organic acids are not likely to hinder significantly the recovery of brown water streams in the region from chronic anthropogenic acidification).

AB The influence of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the uptake of natural and synthetic macromolecular dissolved organic materials (DOMs) from aqueous solutions by granular activated carbon (GAG) was investigated. The sorption behaviors of six of the nine DOMs tested were enhanced by the presence of DO; these included polymaleic acid, peat humic acid, Leonardite humic acid, Suwannee River fulvic acid, and Laurentian fulvic and humic acids. The sorptions of Aldrich and soil humic acids and polystyrene sulfonate were not sensitive to the presence or absence of DO. Sensitivity of sorption to DO generally increased with decreasing molecular size, polydispersity, and aromaticity and with increasing acidity for the five natural DOMs. Oxygen-sensitive sorption of the low molecular weight fractions of peat humic acid, a slightly oxygen-sensitive DOM, was noticeably greater than that of the whole material, Sorption of the low molecular weight fractions of Aldrich humic acid, an oxygen-insensitive DOM, did not show any particular sensitivity to oxygen.

The wetland inflow and outflow were continuously monitored which in combination of precipitation and evaporation data allowed to study the effect of direct precipitation (dilution) and evaporation (enrichment) on the wetland water balance and water quality. The evaporated water volume was approximately 20% of the inflow on days with small inflows, whereas the proportion of precipitation was more variable. Negative correlations between hydraulic load and water quality at the outlet were found, whereas evaporation, precipitation from/to wetland had a negligible impact on outlet water quality. The observation year was rainier than normal, which complicated application of isotope techniques as the evaporation signal was weak. However, the heavy rain provided ample data on wetland performance under different flow conditions. The wetland reduced concentrations of e.g. suspended solids, phosphate-phosphorus, ammonium and iron, but reduction rate of other dissolved nutrients and organic carbon was low or negative. The observed retention of suspended solids load (28% during snowmelt, 61% during the whole observation period) shows that treatment wetlands can reduce the environmental impact of peat extraction areas.

AB In this study we quantify the partitioning of recent assimilates to above- and below-ground carbon (C) pools in two subarctic mire ecosystems - wet minerotrophic and semiwet ombrotrophic mire - using in situ C-14 pulse-labelling. Ecosystem C partitioning to rhizomes, coarse roots, fine roots, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbes were quantified twice during the growing season at three different soil depths. Finally the C-14-partitioning data from this and a previous study were combined to estimate the overall C partitioning of the three main vegetation types of a Scandinavian subarctic mire in early and late summer.
   The semiwet ombrotrophic ecosystem hosted a much larger root biomass on an area basis compared to the wet minerotrophic ecosystem which might be due to differences in the soil nutrient level. Microbial C was found to be the largest C-pool in both ecosystems. Ecosystem C-14 partitioning was poorly related to plant biomass for the semiwet and the wet ecosystem. Overall a higher partitioning of recent assimilates to below-ground compartments was apparent in August-September compared to June-July, while the opposite was found for the above-ground C-pools. In the semiwet ecosystem twice as much C-14 was found in DOC compared to the wet ecosystem, where root density, litter and above-ground biomass were important controls of the C-14-recovery in DOC. Plant-derived DOC was estimated to be 15.4 versus 12.9 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the semiwet and wet ecosystem, respectively.
   Graminoid dominated and dwarf shrub dominated vegetation types of the subarctic mire Stordalen differ with respect to the relative amount of recently assimilated C partitioned to C-pools with "slow" versus "fast" decomposition rate. The capacity for sequestration of recently fixed C within "slow" C-pools might affect the ecosystem C balance (NEE) and C-storage. The potential for vegetation changes might therefore be an important factor to consider in studies of response of ecosystem C-dynamics to global change factors in subarctic mires.

AB Sand-based turfgrass root zones have limited nutrient retention and water-holding capacity. Peat moss often is used to offset these deficiencies, but peat moss decomposes. Biochar is a co-product of several biofuel production processes used to produce bio-oil. Biochar is stable and could have similar water and nutrient retention impacts as peat moss when mixed in sand-based turfgrass root zones. The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of biochar as a sand-based root zone amendment. Water retention, water infiltration, creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) rooting depth, and nutrient evaluation experiments were conducted on six sand and biochar root zone mixtures. At field capacity, sand-based media containing 25% (v/v) biochar retained 260 and 37096 more water compared to media containing 5% biochar and a pure sand control, respectively. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of the root zones decreased as biochar concentrations increased. The rooting depth of bentgrass was reduced up to 46% at biochar concentrations > 10%. Extracted pore water electrical conductivity and dissolved total organic carbon increased as biochar concentrations increased. Nitrogen leaching was reduced as biochar concentrations increased. According to the results, biochar may improve water storage, reduce overall water use, and decrease N fertilizer applications in sand-based turfgrass ecosystems.

AB Unraveling the potentially shifting controls over microbial activity among habitats and across seasonal transitions is critical for understanding how freshwater ecosystems influence broader elemental cycles, and how these systems may respond to global changes. We used nutrient-diffusing substrates to investigate seasonal patterns and constraints on microbial activity of biofilms in streams draining distinct landscape features of the boreal biome (forests, mires, and lakes). Microbial respiration (MR) largely mirrored spatial and temporal variation in water temperature. However, limitation by labile carbon (C) was a constraint to microbial activity during ice-covered periods, when MR of control nutrient-diffusing substrates fell below rates predicted from stream temperature alone. Variation in C limitation among the study streams was reflective of putative organic C availability, with C limitation of biofilms weakest in the dissolved organic C (DOC)-rich, mire-outlet stream and greatest in the relatively DOC-poor, forest stream. Incidences of nutrient limitation were only observed during warmer months. Our study illustrates how variation in processes mediated by heterotrophic biofilms and seasonal shifts in resource limitation can emerge in a stream network draining a heterogeneous landscape. In addition, our results show that, for a large portion of the year, heterotrophic processes in boreal streams can be strongly limited by the availability of labile C, despite high DOC concentrations. Metabolic constraints to dissolved organic matter processing at near-freezing temperatures, coupled with hydrological controls over the delivery of more labile organic resources to streams (e.g., soil freezing and flooding), have potentially strong influences on the productivity of boreal streams.

AB Arsenic concentrations in a drinking water reservoir system in the Eastern Ore mountains (Osterzgebirge, Germany) were observed over a 17-year period. The region experienced an environmental change during the past 20 years with decreasing acid, sulphur and nitrogen deposition and a recovering vitality of forested catchment sites. An increase of the arsenic content in the reservoir waters during that change was observed. This was caused by a diminished nitrate supply leading to lower redox potential in the sediments favouring sediment arsenic release. The recent annual cycle in the Altenberg reservoir water arsenic concentration was found to be independent from artificial aeration of the hypoxic hypolimnion during the summer stratification. However, we found a strong seasonal dependent change in water As concentration, with amaximum in autumn and a minimum in spring. The low productive system is driven by peat derived organic matter. For the recent arsenic catchment yield coherencies to dissolved organic carbon export and runoff intensity were found, indicating rising arsenic loads due to climate-related soil organic matter destabilization. Thus, in the reservoir system, both dry and wet climate conditions can increase the water As concentrations due to an internal arsenic release and a catchment arsenic import.

AB We investigated the spatial and temporal connectivity between concentrations of organic carbon in stream water and the soil carbon pool in a small ( 1.3 km(2)) upland catchment in NE Scotland by comparing downstream changes in dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) with spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Stream water DOC concentrations increased downstream to reach a maximum in the center of the catchment and then decreased in the lower part of the catchment, a pattern that was linked to spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Subcatchment analysis of the soil carbon pool and DOC export showed that the strong relationship between percent of peat coverage and stream water DOC in the upper part of the catchment did not hold farther downstream, where freely draining mineral soils become spatially more important. Temporal variations in stream water and soil water DOC concentrations in the central part of the catchment were studied using samples collected from two depths ( 0.20 - 0.45 m and 0.65 - 0.95 m) in the two most important soil types there ( histosols and fluvisols). Stream water DOC concentrations were only related to soil water DOC in shallow peat. DOC concentration in shallow peat and stream water were both positively correlated with temperature. Multivariate regression analysis showed that 55% of the variation in stream water DOC concentrations could be explained by a model including stream temperature, discharge, and soil solution DOC concentrations in the shallow histosols. We conclude that the linkage between stream water DOC concentrations and the soil C pool in the upper 1.5 km of the stream reach are likely to be driven by temperature-related DOC production in near-surface histosols. Farther downstream, this relationship between organic carbon in the soil and stream becomes weaker as other processes ( e. g., lower inputs from minerals soils and allochthonous within-stream processing of DOC) become more important.

AB Organic soils are an important substrate for cycling carbon between terrestrial and atmospheric pools. The degree of decomposition of organic soil material influences the physical and chemical characteristics that control the carbon cycles in these soils. Although organic soils are abundant in southeast Alaska, little information is available on the state of decomposition or variability within organic soil mapping units. Determination of physical (fiber content) and chemical (sodium pyrophosphate extract color, SPEC) decomposition is used to classify organic soils and subsequently establish map units. The purpose of this study is to provide physical and chemical decomposition data to better characterize and classify, forested organic soils in southeast Alaska and to improve our understanding of the distribution of fiber within these soils. Fiber content and pyrophosphate color were determined on 115 samples from 23 organic soils from throughout the Tongass National Forest. These samples show that complexes of hemic and sapric suborders mapped in the Tongass Soil Survey are dominantly hemic. Some Fiber analyses differ considerably from statements in descriptions of established series in the Tongass Soil Survey. Physical decomposition of the fibers is in the hemic range, but chemical decomposition indicated by SPEC is sapric due to accumulation of soluble organic matter by water movement down steep slopes as well as in situ decomposition. Suborder classes provide a means to incorporate appropriate decomposition levels into existing soil series.

AB A comparison of the tree-ring width of pines growing in areas adjacent to a peat bog and on a Baltic raised bog dome suggests that cambium activity in each tree group is affected by different factors. The study was aimed at pinpointing effects of meteorological factors on two pine populations growing under different hydrological conditions. The study further sought to identify periods during which anthropogenic pressure affected the two populations. The pines growing on mineral soil were characterised by ring-width growth-climate responses typical of this part of Europe, whereas the tree-ring growth of the pines growing on the peat bog showed no unequivocal relationship with meteorological conditions. The tree-ring width growth dynamics of that population responded primarily to changes in the level of the groundwater table. These changes were associated with human activities over the last two centuries. The development of the tree stands on the peat bog and in its immediate vicinity was reconstructed using this assumption and available historical evidence. A banding drainage ditch dug around 1880 resulted in the drying of the peat bog, the introduction of pines, and the forestation of the bog. Digging of central ditches (in the 1960s) resulted in periodic desiccation of the bog surface and reduction of the tree-ring widths; similar responses were observed in the 1980s as a consequence of the deepening and opening of the drainage ditches. The recent years are characterised by decreasing ring-width growth as a result of the damming of drainage ditches. Damming resulted in an increase of the groundwater table level in the bog and in a partial inundation of tree roots. This partial inundation interfered with gas exchange and adversely affected the health status of the pines studied. Our results allow conclusions to be drawn regarding peat bog palaeohydrology and facilitate absolute dating of changes associated with anthropogenic transformations. In active nature protection, such data are of key importance for understanding the functioning of a peatland and for planning active conservation measures.

AB To simulate the effects of wildfire on the combustion process in soils and their potential to leach organic compounds into streams and groundwater, mineral soil samples were heated at temperatures of 150-550 degrees C. Then, the soils were leached with deionized water, filtered, and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon. The water extract was concentrated by both XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins and analyzed by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Approximately 15-20% of the water-extractable organic carbon was identified as benzene dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids, and tetracarboxylic acid isomers, commonly called BPCAs. Also identified were isomers of pyridine dicarboxylic acids and tricarboxylic acids (PCAs). The conversion of soil organic carbon to BPCAs occurs at 250 degrees C and reaches a maximum between 350 and 450 degrees C. At higher temperatures (>450 degrees C), the BPCA concentrations decrease, suggesting decarboxylation and conversion to carbon dioxide and water. This is the first report of BPCAs and PCAs in water-extractable organic carbon from thermally altered soil and suggest that these compounds are possible candidates for further water-quality studies in watersheds affected by wildfire. Finally, BPCAs and PCAs could contribute to the black carbon and nitrogen in seawater and are worthy of future investigation.

AB An assessment has been made of the probable impact upon freshwater solute chemical composition of increasing woodland cover in Scotland using native species appropriate to natural woodland. Mineral soil acidification is likely as a consequence of tree growth where the soil parent material is a rock of low base status such as quartzite, granite or old sandstone, and will, in turn, contribute to freshwater acidification. Additional atmospheric pollutant or sea salt trapping by trees will exacerbate drainage water acidification. Acidity of surface horizons depends upon the underlying mineral soil composition, acid deposition and tree species, and all three factors should be taken into consideration, along with increased water interception loss, when assessing afforestation impact on stormflow water. The interception factor is, however, less important in wetter areas than in drier regions. The spatial distribution of soil characteristics relative to the stream channel is very important, and in areas with acidification-sensitive soils, buffer zones of adequate width may be used to combat water acidification. Ground rocks such as gabbro may be more appropriate than conventional liming materials for the management of such strips, to avoid excessively high surface soil pH values.

AB The binding of two phenolic compounds, nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA), and the herbicide metabolite hydroxydesethyl terbuthylazine (HDT) to dissolved organic matter (DOM) as well as its impact on the environmental fate of the compounds in soil have been investigated. In sorption studies with an acidic silty loam soil and a neutral loam soil, no impact of added DOM on adsorption and desorption coefficients was observed. Adsorption coefficients normalized to soil organic carbon (K-proportional to) of the compounds on the loamy silt soil spanned three orders of magnitude: 90, 890, and 9,140 L/kg for HDT, BPA, and NP respectively. Significantly lower K-proportional to values for HDT on the neutral loam soil as compared to the acidic loamy silt soil indicated additional polar interactions between the latter and the basic herbicide metabolite. In dialysis experiments with fulvic acid from silty loam soil (FA) and peat humic acid (HA), a formation of analyte-DOM associates was observed only for HA. The degree of association was characterized by distribution coefficients normalized to the dissolved organic carbon concentration (K-DOC). Values for NP (8,970 L/kg) and BPA (860 L/kg) corresponded with the respective soil sorption coefficients, suggesting similar binding mechanisms in both cases.

AB The effect of preferential flow in soil pipes on nitrate retention in riparian zones is poorly understood. The characteristics of soil pipes and their influence on patterns of groundwater transport and nitrate dynamics were studied along four transects in a 1- to >3-m deep layer of peat and marl overlying an oxic sand aquifer in a riparian zone in southern Ontario, Canada. The peat-marl deposit, which consisted of several horizontal layers with large differences in bulk density, contained soil pipes that were generally 0.1 to 0.2?m in diameter and often extended vertically for 1 to >2?m. Springs that produced overland flow across the riparian area occurred at some sites where pipes extended to the peat surface. Concentrations of NO3-N (2030?mg?L-1) and dissolved oxygen (DO) (46?mg?L-1) observed in peat pipe systems and surface springs were similar to values in the underlying sand aquifer, indicating that preferential flow transported groundwater with limited nitrate depletion. Low NO3-N concentrations of <5?mg?L-1 and enriched d15N values indicated that denitrification was restricted to small areas of the peat where pipes were absent. Groundwater DO concentrations declined rapidly to <2?mg?L-1 in the peat matrix adjacent to pipes, whereas high NO3-N concentrations of >15?mg?L-1 extended over a larger zone. Low dissolved organic carbon values at these locations suggest that supplies of organic carbon were not sufficient to support high rates of denitrification, despite low DO conditions. These data indicate that it is important to develop a greater understanding of pipes in peat deposits, which function as sites where the transport of large fluxes of water with low biogeochemical reaction rates can limit the nitrate removal capacity of riparian zones.

AB Changes in atmospheric deposition have been proposed as one possible explanation of the widespread increase in DOC concentration observed in many Northern Hemisphere catchments. This study uses detailed, long-term, monthly monitoring records of pH, conductivity SO(4), and DOC in precipitation, soil water, and runoff chemistry from an upland peat-covered catchment in northern England. By deriving impulse transfer functions this study explores whether changes in deposition lead to significant changes in the occurrence of each component in the soil and runoff water; especially significant changes in DOC. The study shows that (1) impulses in the deposition of acidity have no significant effect upon pH or DOC in soil water or runoff. (2) DOC in soil water and runoff is responsive to impulses in SO(4) and conductivity, but only when those impulses are changes in soil water chemistry and not when they are in atmospheric deposition. (3) The effects of changes in SO(4) and/or conductivity can easily be overemphasized if memory effects are not accounted for, and their effect is limited to only 1 or 2 months after a severe drought. This study can support the view that changes in ionic strength can result in changes in DOC concentration in soil water or runoff, but the system studied is unresponsive to changes in atmospheric deposition. Impulses in soil water SO(4) do not lead to increases in DOC concentrations, and so this mechanism does not provide an explanation for DOC increases.

AB Chemical treatment of non-point derived pollution often suffers from undesirable oscillations in purification efficiency due to variations in runoff water quality. This study examined the response of the chemical purification process to variations in water quality using a 2(k) factorial design for runoff water rich in humic substances. The four k factors evaluated and the levels applied were: organic matter as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (20-70 mg/L), suspended solids (SS) (10-60 mg/L), initial water pH (4.5-7), and applied coagulant dosage (ferric sulphate) (35-100 mg/L). Indicators of purification efficiency were residual concentration of DOC, SS and total phosphorus (tot-P). Analysis of variance and factor effect calculations showed that the initial DOC concentration in raw water samples and its interactions with the coagulant dosage applied exerted the most significant influence on the chemical purification process, substantially affecting the residual concentration of DOC, SS and tot-P. The variations applied to the factors SS and pH only slightly affected purification efficiency. The results can be used in the design of purification systems with high organic matter load variation, e.g. peat extraction runoff. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency with which riparian zones remove nitrate (NO3-) from contaminated ground water can vary with landscape setting. This study was conducted to determine the influence of flood plain geometry, Lithology, hydrologic now path, and nitrate transport on mechanisms of nitrate depletion of contaminated ground water. Patterns of NO3-N, chloride, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and delta(15)N-NO3- and delta(18)-NO3- values in combination with detailed piezometric head measurements were investigated in a river floodplain connected to a large upland sand aquifer in an agricultural region near Alliston, Ontario, Canada. Ground water discharging to the forested floodplain from the sand aquifer exhibited large spatial variability in NO3--N concentrations (10-50 mg/L), The transport and depletion of NO3- was strongly influenced by floodplain geometry and lithology, Little ground water flow occurred through the low-conductivity matrix of peat in the floodplain. Plumes of NO3--rich ground water passed beneath the riparian wetland peat and flowed laterally in a 2- to 4-m-thick zone of permeable sands across the floodplain to the river. Analyses of the distribution of the NO3--N concentrations, isotopes, and DOC within the floodplain indicate that denitrification occurred within the sand aquifer near the river where nitrate-rich ground water interacted with buried channel sediments and surface water recharged from peat to the deeper sands. This study shows that the depth of permeable riparian sediments, ground water now path, and the location of organic-rich subsurface deposits may be more important than the width of vegetated strips in influencing the ability of riparian zones to remove nitrate.

AB The high variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural systems (concentration, composition) means rapid methods are required for its characterization so that a high number of samples can be analyzed. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of spectrometer type and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration on the humification indices of water-soluble fulvic acids (FAs) derived from synchronous fluorescence spectra, and thus enable the broader application of this method for DOM characterization. We used three standard FAs from the International Humic Substances Society, 24 water-soluble FAs isolated from topsoil, groundwater and surface water in a fen area, and two different spectrometers. The wavelengths at which bands occurred were similar for all the FAs. Therefore, the differences between the spectra of the FAs studied could be described by humification indices (band ratios). The humification indices calculated correlated very well between spectrometers despite small differences in the wavelengths of bands and shoulders. The absolute values of these indices deduced from two spectrometers can only be directly compared if the spectra are corrected using a standard substance. Increasing DOC concentration resulted in a linear increase in humification indices with a sample specific slope. Therefore, we recommend using an uniformly low DOC concentration of about 10 mg C l(-1) for recording the spectra of samples with typically low DOC concentrations (aquatic samples, soil solutions). This value is a compromise between relatively low absorption to minimize inner filter effects and a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry and the potential for organic matter (OM) to self-associate with other OM components are important aspects of understanding the mechanisms of DOM sorption to clay surfaces. To investigate this further, we sorbed DOM isolated from peat humic acid onto either kaolinite, montmorillonite and gibbsite via ten sequential batch equilibration sorption experiments. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sorption to all minerals increased consistently, suggesting that sorption occurred via mineral-OM interactions at the beginning of the experiment. After six successive DOM loadings, the concentration of DOC sorbed by kaolinite and gibbsite began to plateau, likely due to the saturation of mineral surface sorption sites. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of unbound DOM showed that kaolinite and montmorillonite sorbed aliphatic, protein and lignin components initially and primarily aliphatic and aromatic constituents in later sorption experiments, whereas gibbsite sorbed mostly aliphatic compounds during all DOM loadings. Analysis of the organo-clay complexes using H-1 high resolution-magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR confirmed the preferential sorption of aromatic and aliphatic components to all three minerals. Overall, these results suggest that OM-OM interactions may be important mechanisms of DOM sorption to clay mineral surfaces.

AB Several studies have highlighted an increase in DOC concentration in streams and lakes of UK upland catchments though the causal mechanisms controlling the increase have yet to be fully explained. This study, compiles a comprehensive data set of DOC concentration records for UK catchments to evaluate trends and test whether observed increases are ubiquitous over time and space. The study analysed monthly DOC time series from 198 sites, including 29 lakes, 8 water supply reservoirs and 161 rivers. The records vary in length from 8 to 42 years going back as far as 1961. Of the 198 sites, 153 (77%) show an upward trend in DOC concentration significant at the 95% level, the remaining 45 (23%) show no significant trend and no sites show a significant decrease in DOC concentration. The average annual increase in DOC concentration was 0.17 mg C/l/year. The dataset shows: (i) a spatial consistent upward trend in the DOC concentration independent of regional effects of rainfall, acid and nitrogen deposition, and local effects of land-use change; (ii) a temporally consistent increase in DOC concentration for period back as far as the 1960s; (iii) the increase in DOC concentration means an estimated DOC flux from the UK as 0.86 Mt C for the year 2002 and is increasing at 0.02 Mt C/year. Possible reasons for the increasing DOC concentration are discussed.

AB We have examined how some major catchment disturbances may affect the aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes in the boreal zone, using gas flux data from studies made in 1994-1999 in the pelagic regions of seven lakes and two reservoirs in Finland. The highest pelagic seasonal average methane (CH4) emissions were up to 12 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from eutrophied lakes with agricultural catchments. Nutrient loading increases autochthonous primary production in lakes, promoting oxygen consumption and anaerobic decomposition in the sediments and this can lead to increased CH4 release from lakes to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were higher from reservoirs and lakes whose catchment areas were rich in peatlands or managed forests, and from eutrophied lakes in comparison to oligotrophic and mesotrophic sites. However, all these sites were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. The pelagic CH4 emissions were generally lower than those from the littoral zone. The fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were negligible in the pelagic regions, apparently due to low nitrate inputs and/or low nitrification activity. However, the littoral zone, acting as a buffer for leached nitrogen, did release N2O. Anthropogenic disturbances of boreal lakes, such as increasing eutrophication, can change the aquatic greenhouse gas balance, but also the gas exchange in the littoral zone should be included in any assessment of the overall effect. It seems that autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources, which contribute to the CH4 and Co-2 production in lakes, also have importance in the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.

   catalyst; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products
AB The wider presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in nature is a major cause for concern in society. Among pharmaceuticals, the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen has commonly been found in aquatic and soil environments. We produced a Co-doped carbon matrix (Co-P 850) through the carbonization of Co2+ saturated peat and used it as a peroxymonosulphate activator to aid ibuprofen degradation. The properties of Co-P 850 were analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy filtered transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results showed that Co/Fe oxides were generated and tightly embedded into the carbon matrix after carbonization. The degradation results indicated that high temperature and slightly acidic to neutral conditions (pH = 5 to 7.5) promoted ibuprofen degradation efficiency in the Co-P 850/peroxymonosulphate system. Analysis showed that approx. 52% and 75% of the dissolved organic carbon was removed after 2 h and 5 h of reaction time, respectively. Furthermore, the existence of chloride and bicarbonate had adverse effects on the degradation of ibuprofen. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis confirmed that SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(center dot-); radicals together contributed to the high ibuprofen degradation efficiency. In addition, we identified 13 degradation intermediate compounds and an ibuprofen degradation pathway by mass spectrometry analysis and quantum computing. Based on the results and methods presented in this study, we propose a novel way for the synthesis of a Co-doped catalyst from spent NaOH-treated peat and the efficient catalytic degradation of ibuprofen from contaminated water.

AB Climate change is predicted to bring about a water level (WL) draw-down in boreal peatlands. This study aimed to assess the effect of WL on the carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics of a boreal oligotrophic fen ecosystem and its components; Sphagnum mosses, sedges, dwarf shrubs and the underlying peat. We measured CO2 exchange with closed chambers during four growing seasons in a study site that comprised different vegetation treatments. WL gradient in the site was broadened by surrounding half of the site with a shallow ditch that lowered the WL by 10-25 cm. We modeled gross photosynthesis (P-G) and ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and simulated the CO2 exchange in three WL conditions: prevailing and WL draw-down scenarios of 14 and 22 cm. WL draw-down both reduced the P-G and increased the R-ECO, thus leading to a smaller net CO2 uptake in the ecosystem. Of the different components, Sphagnum mosses were most sensitive to WL draw-down and their physiological activities almost ceased. Vascular plant CO2 exchange, en bloc, hardly changed but whereas sedges contributed twice as much to the CO2 exchange as shrubs in the prevailing conditions, the situation was reversed in the WL draw-down scenarios. Peat respiration was the biggest component in R-ECO in all WL conditions and the increase in R-ECO following the WL draw-down was due to the increase in peat respiration. The results imply that functional diversity buffers the ecosystem against environmental variability and that in the long term, WL draw-down changes the vegetation composition of boreal fens.

AB Landscapes can be viewed as spatially heterogeneous areas encompassing terrestrial and aquatic domains. To date, most landscape carbon (C) fluxes have been estimated by accounting for terrestrial ecosystems, while aquatic ecosystems have been largely neglected. However, a robust assessment of C fluxes on the landscape scale requires the estimation of fluxes within and between both landscape components. Here, we compiled data from the literature on C fluxes across the air-water interface from various landscape components. We simulated C emissions and uptake for five different scenarios which represent a gradient of increasing spatial heterogeneity within a temperate young moraine landscape: (I) a homogeneous landscape with only cropland and large lakes; (II) separation of the terrestrial domain into cropland and forest; (III) further separation into cropland, forest, and grassland; (IV) additional division of the aquatic area into large lakes and peatlands; and (V) further separation of the aquatic area into large lakes, peatlands, running waters, and small water bodies These simulations suggest that C fluxes at the landscape scale might depend on spatial heterogeneity and landscape diversity, among other factors. When we consider spatial heterogeneity and diversity alone, small inland waters appear to play a pivotal and previously underestimated role in landscape greenhouse gas emissions that may be regarded as C hot spots. Approaches focusing on the landscape scale will also enable improved projections of ecosystems' responses to perturbations, e.g., due to global change and anthropogenic activities, and evaluations of the specific role individual landscape components play in regional C fluxes.

AB Aquatic CO2 concentrations are highly variable and strongly linked to discharge, but until recently, measurements have been largely restricted to low-frequency manual sampling. Using new in situ CO2 sensors, we present concurrent, high-frequency (<30min resolution) CO2 concentration and discharge data collected from five catchments across Canada, UK, and Fennoscandinavia to explore concentration-discharge dynamics; we also consider the relative importance of high flows to lateral aquatic CO2 export. The catchments encompassed a wide range of mean CO2 concentrations (0.73-3.05mg C L-1) and hydrological flow regimes from flashy peatland streams to muted outflows within a Finnish lake system. In three of the catchments, CO2 concentrations displayed clear bimodal distributions indicating distinct CO2 sources. Concentration-discharge relationships were not consistent across sites with three of the catchments displaying a negative relationship and two catchments displaying a positive relationship. When individual high flow events were considered, we found a strong correlation between both the average magnitude of the hydrological and CO2 response peaks, and the average response lag times. An analysis of lateral CO2 export showed that in three of the catchments, the top 30% of flow (i.e., flow that was exceeded only 30% of the time) had the greatest influence on total annual load. This indicates that an increase in precipitation extremes (greater high-flow contributions) may have a greater influence on the flushing of CO2 from soils to surface waters than a long-term increase in mean annual precipitation, assuming source limitation does not occur.

AB This work investigates the use of Fenton's process (pH 5.5 and 6; 0.10-0.50 mM Fe(II); molar ratios Fen to H2O2 of 1:5-1:20) combined with flocculation for the treatment of groundwater which is rich in natural organic matter (NOM) (10.60.37 mg C/L) and arsenic (110 +/- 6.7 mu g/L). Changes to the character of the residual NOM fractions were followed, as well as the removal efficiencies of NOM and arsenic. Under optimal reaction conditions at pH 5.5, 55% of the Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) was removed, whilst removals of specific disinfection by-product precursors of trihalomethanes (THM), haloacetic acids (HAA) and haloacetonitriles (HAN) were 80%, 75% and 98%, respectively. Total arsenic concentrations were reduced to below 5 mu g/L under all investigated experimental conditions. After the Fenton treatment, the percentage of the hydrophobic NOM fraction (humic acid and fulvic acid fraction) decreased, and the percentage of the hydrophilic fraction (acidic and non-acidic fractions) increased. The hydrophilic fraction, which was the most abundant in the treated water, was also the most reactive fraction towards THM and HAA formation, whereas the residual fulvic acid fraction contributed the most to the formation of HAN.

AB Carbon dioxide evasion from inland waters such as lakes, rivers and streams represents a significant component of the global carbon cycle, yet in many parts of the world, relatively little is known about its source. Radiocarbon dating of aquatic CO2 has the potential to provide new insights into C cycling in the terrestrial-aquatic-atmosphere continuum, and whilst a range of methods are available for the collection of samples for C-14 analysis, they all have limitations or disadvantages (e.g. slow collection rates and potential non-equilibrium). These issues are further compounded in remote field sites. Here, we describe a new method for the field collection of CO2 samples from low-pH waters (pH<7) for radiocarbon analysis, which involves a scaled-up version of the widely used headspace equilibration technique coupled with syringe injection of samples into molecular sieve traps for convenient and stable storage. We present the results of laboratory and field tests to verify this 'super headspace method' and discuss its advantages compared with existing techniques, particularly for sampling in remote locations. This includes its high portability, speed of use and absence of any special sample preservation requirements. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Factors controlling the levels and forms of trace metals in streams, and transport from watersheds into streams, are poorly understood. We determined levels of filtrable (<0.4 mu m) and particulate Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in rivers draining two contrasting watersheds in eastern Wisconsin. Both are developed on glaciated terrain, but the North Branch Milwaukee watershed (agricultural) is characterized by gently sloping uplands with thick silt loam soils, while the Wolf River (forested) has peat loam soils on hilly terrain. Watershed differences resulted in higher mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations under baseflow conditions in the Wolf River (7 mg l(-1)) than in the Milwaukee River (4 mg l(-1)), but higher suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels in the Milwaukee (18 vs. 2 mg l(-1)). Mean filtrable trace metal concentrations (ng l(-1)) under baseflow conditions were similar in the Milwaukee and Wolf rivers (Al = 4.0 and 5.8; Cd = 4.2 and 3.2; Cu = 660 and 200; Pb = 56 and 53; Zn = 340 and 240), but particulate metal levels (ng l(-1)) were higher in the Milwaukee (Al = 230 vs. 16; Cd = 14 vs. 0.8; Cu = 736 vs. 90; Pb = 750 vs. 30; Zn = 2290 vs. 180). Filtrable metal concentrations exhibited low variability (relative standard deviation) under baseflow (Milwaukee: 5-20% Cu, Pb, Zn; 20-40% Al, Cd-Wolf: 10-35% Cu, Pb, Zn; 30-60% Al, Cd), while variability in particulate metal concentrations was somewhat higher (18-73%). During events (spring melt, storms), concentrations increased 1- to 5-fold for filtrable metals and 1- to 17-fold for particulate metals. Differences between watersheds and within-watershed responses to events were related in part to SPM (particulate metals) and DOC (filtrable metals) levels in the rivers and their associated influences on metal partitioning. In the Milwaukee River (higher SPM and lower DOG), particulate metal phases were more dominant (range among the five metals in mean % particulate = 47-98% vs. 24-74% for the Wolf. Partitioning (K-d) to SPM followed the order Pb > Zn > Cd > Cu, whereas relationships to DOC indicated essentially the reverse order for metal binding to DOG. SPM was a good predictor of particulate metal levels, especially in the Milwaukee River (> 94% of variance in particulate Cd, Pb, and Zn was accounted for, vs. 44-69% in Wolf River). While DOC was able to account for a significant portion of the variation in certain filtrable metal levels (r(2) = 0.52-0.65), other metals showed poorer correlations, probably due to variability in the composition of DOC and SPM and to variability in the forms of metal (aqueous complexes, colloid-bound) in the filtrable fraction.

AB Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are an ever-increasing occurrence in water networks, particularly those which abstract water from peatland areas. Although much research has been carried out to discover novel methods to remove specific DBPs, the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from source water may provide a more sustainable solution in many areas. This study focuses on the removal of NOM by novel filters, which could be retrospectively fitted to any conventional water treatment facility. The filters comprised stratified layers of a variety of media, including sand, Bayer residue, granular activated carbon (GAC), and pyritic fill. The filters were operated under two loading regimes, continuous and intermittent, at loading rates similar to recognised design standards. The most successful filter design comprised stratified layers of sand, GAC, and pyritic fill. Over the duration of a 240 day study, these filters obtained average dissolved organic carbon removal rates of 40%, and achieved average specific ultra-violet absorbance reductions from 2.9 to 2.4 L mg(-1) m(-1). The study demonstrates that these novel filters may be used to reduce NOM levels, thus reducing the potential for DBP formation. Such designs can incorporate the use of waste media, making the overall design more sustainable and robust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Under the context of climate change, studying CO2 emissions in alpine rivers is important because of the large carbon storage in these terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, riverine partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 emission flux (FCO2) in the Yellow River source region (YRSR) under different landcover types, including glaciers, permafrost, peatlands, and grasslands, were systematically investigated in April, June, August, and October 2016. Relevant chemical and environmental parameters were analyzed to explore the primary controlling factors. The results showed that most of the rivers in the YRSR were net CO2 source, with the pCO(2) ranging from 181 to 2441 mu atm and the FCO2 ranging from -50 to 1574 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Both pCO(2) and FCO2 showed strong spatial and temporal variations. The highest average FCO2 was observed in August, while the lowest average was observed in June. Spatially, the lowest FCO2 were observed in the permafrost regions while the highest FCO2 were observed in peatland. By integrating seasonal changes of the water surface area, total CO2 efflux was estimated to be 0.30 Tg C year(-1). This indicates that the YRSR was a net carbon source for the atmosphere, which contradicts previous studies that conclude the YRSR as a carbon sink. More frequent measurements of CO2 fluxes, particularly through several diel cycles, are necessary to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, our study suggested that the riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in permafrost (5.0 +/- 2.4 mg L-1) is possibly derived from old carbon released from permafrost melting, which is equivalent to that in peatland regions (5.1 +/- 3.7 mg L-1). The degradation of DOC may have played an important role in supporting riverine CO2, especially in permafrost and glacier-covered regions. The percent coverage of corresponding land cover types is a good indicator for estimating riverine pCO(2) in the YRSR. In view of the extensive distribution of alpine rivers in the world and their sensitivity to climate change, future studies on dynamics of stream water pCO(2) and CO2 outgassing are strongly needed to better understand the global carbon cycle.

AB In many regions, naturally occurring organic acid anions can effectively buffer mineral acid inputs from atmospheric deposition, moderating their effect on surface water pH. We studied the effect of chronically high inputs of acid rain on the chemistry of three brown-water streams in the western Czech Republic. The dissolved organic acids in the streams were similar in character to those of other systems in Europe and North America. The site densities (the carboxyl group content per mass of C) were similar to values reported from Fenno-Scandia, and the relationship between the apparent pK(a) and pH conformed to those from two North American studies. Sulfate and organic acid anions (OA(-)) were the dominant anions in all three streams, yet despite high dissolved organic carbon and total organic acid concentrations, OA(-) comprised only 21-32% of total anion charge. This pattern was due to very high sulfate concentrations and, in two of the streams, a low degree of dissociation of the organic acids, probably the results of high long-term inputs of strong acids. Stream water pH was highly correlated to sulfate concentration, but uncorrelated with OA(-), suggesting that free acidity is controlled by strong mineral acids rather than organic acids. Thus future reductions in strong acid inputs should result in increased pH and a return to organic control over acid-base chemistry.

AB The investigated coal mining lakes of the Lusatian lignite mining district and the mid-German lignite district are geogenically acidified caused by pyrite and marcasite oxidation. All lakes are characterized by high ionic strength and extremely high concentrations of dissolved ferric iron. In oxic water layers, up to 10% of total iron is present as Fe(II). Mean concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are extremely low in the investigated Lusatian lakes (<0.1 mmol/L). During summer months, DOC concentrations below the detection limit were observed in epilimnetic layers accompanied by increased concentrations of ferrous iron. It is suggested that photochemical reactions are responsible for depletion of DOC and formation of ferrous iron as it has been described for acidic soft-water lakes. The coupling of DOC degradation and ferrous iron production was verified with sunlight exposure experiments. Samples of acidic mining lakes were irradiated in quartz glass vessels. Up to 50% of DOC was transformed to CO2 after 300 min of irradiation with natural sunlight, and the light-induced production of Fe(II) was up to 450% (compared to 100% Fe(II) concentration before irradiation).
   As a consequence of acidification and photochemical reactions, the carbon budget of investigated mining lakes is kept low because organic carbon is finally oxidized to carbon dioxide which leaves epilimnetic water layers as a gas.

AB We present a new remote sensing based method to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux discharged from rivers into coastal waters off the Sarawak region in Borneo. This method comprises three steps. In the first step, we developed an algorithm for estimating DOC concentrations using the ratio of Landsat-8 Red to Green bands B4/B3 (DOC (mu M C) = 89.86 center dot e(0.27 center dot(B4/B3))), which showed good correlation (R = 0.88) and low mean relative error (+5.71%) between measured and predicted DOC. In the second step, we used TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation data to estimate river discharge for the river basins. In the final step, DOC flux for each river catchment was then estimated by combining Landsat-8 derived DOC concentrations and TMPA derived river discharge. The analysis of remote sensing derived DOC flux (April 2013 to December 2018) shows that Sarawak coastal waters off the Rajang river basin, received the highest DOC flux (72% of total) with an average of 168 Gg C per year in our study area, has seasonal variability. The whole of Sarawak represents about 0.1% of the global annual riverine and estuarine DOC flux. The results presented in this study demonstrate the ability to estimate DOC flux using satellite remotely sensed observations.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important fraction in carbon (C) and nutrient budgets for aquatic ecosystems and can have broad effects on food webs and nutrient cycling. To look at the role land use cover and climate might play in DOM transport from the boreal region, the export of total organic carbon (TOC), total organic nitrogen (TON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was estimated for Finnish main rivers and their sub-catchments, altogether 86 catchments, situated between latitudes 60 degrees N and 69 degrees N and covering 297,322 km(2), 88% of the total area of Finland. On an average, 94% of the TOC, 90% of the total nitrogen (TN) and 40% of the total phosphorus (TP) in Finnish rivers was in a dissolved form. The majority of the DOM export from Finnish catchments consists of organic C. The TOC export increased with increasing peatland proportion (r = 0.39, p = 0.003), while TON export increased with the increasing percentage of agricultural land (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). Although upstream lakes covered only on average 9% of the catchment area, they were the most important predictor for TOC, TON and DOP export (r = -0.83, r = -0.82 and r = -0.61, respectively). The higher the upstream lake percentage, the lower the export indicating organic matter retention in lakes.

AB Littoral wetlands comprise a terrestrial to aquatic continuum along which carbon dioxide is exchanged with the atmosphere and organic carbon is transferred to lakes. Net ecosystem productivity-the difference between atmospheric CO2 uptake and total ecosystem respiration-in these shore areas depends partly on the extent and duration of spring flooding. Ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 fluxes were studied at a boreal lake in Finland to analyze how flooding affects the dynamics of littoral net ecosystem productivity. Two shore transects with different hydrological conditions and vegetation distributions were studied during consecutive ice-free periods with contrasting flooding patterns. Net ecosystem productivity in different vegetation zones did not respond consistently to extended flooding; the response depended on the phenology of plant emergence during the flood and on the decrease in the water level after flooding. The decrease in the water level was steeper in silt-mud sediment than in fen peat, With an exceptionally high water level relative to the height of the vegetation, net ecosystem productivity decreased by 50-100% (net loss, 0.4-7.4 mol m(-2) of CO2 during the wetter open-water period). However, the wetter season could also have a 60-140% higher net ecosystem productivity (net CO2 gain of 0.7 Mol m(-2) to net loss of 6.8 Mol m(-2)) because of the decreased decomposition rate. An extended flooding period greatly reduces the amount of litter produced in a specific year. In both flooding patterns, the littoral zone was an overall net CO2 emitter, but the large variation in the decomposition rate suggests that there are differences in the load of organic matter from the littoral to the pelagic zone.

AB A homogenized 76-year daily-mean temperature series is presented for Moor House, an upland peatland meteorological station in northern England, which provides the longest instrumental temperature record in the UK uplands. This paper assesses trends in the temperature record over time compared to the nearby lowland temperature record at Durham. Overall warming for 1991-2006 compared with 1931-1960 and 1961-1990 was approximately the same at the upland site (0.53 degrees C and 0.73 degrees C for the two time periods, respectively) as at Durham (0.61 degrees C and 0.71 degrees C), maintaining a similar lapse rate. However, winter warming is dominant at Moor House and more pronounced and concentrated over a shorter period than at Durham; summer warming is more prominent at Durham. Therefore, seasonal lapse rates have changed and become more divergent between winter and summer half-years. Rather than changes in the dominance of particular air-masses over the study area accounting for seasonal lapse rate changes, there had been significant steepening of lapse rates over time for some air flow types. Minimum temperatures have increased more than maximum temperatures at Moor House with a consequent significant reduction in diurnal range. At Durham minimum and maximum temperatures have changed in approximate tandem so that there is no significant change in diurnal temperature range. The frequency of air frosts reduced by approximately 23% (from 129 days per year to 99) at Moor House from 1991-2006 compared to 1953-1980, and this may have major implications for the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic systems in the region. These results demonstrate that while overall annual warming in the uplands and lowlands within particular regions may be similar, even where annual lapse rates have been maintained, the seasonal distribution of that warming may be quite different even over short distances and so lowland records are not a reliable indicator of regional upland temperature change.

AB Peatlands store globally significant quantities of soil carbon, and Sphagnum moss is the main peat forming vegetation type in bogs. Sphagnum moss productivity is driven by the moisture content of its apical cluster of branches, the capitulum. Capitulum moisture content is dependent on the arrangement of leaves, branches and stems for a given species and also on hydrological conditions of the underlying peat. Despite this link, the response of CO2 exchange in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands to extreme drought is still unclear, particularly under field conditions.
   We used drainage to expose Sphagnum rubellum to extreme drought and monitored water table, volumetric water content (VWC), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at plots in a 25 m transect perpendicular to a deep drainage ditch and compared results to an undrained site. VWC in the upper 10 cm of peat was strongly related to water table at depths shallower than 55 cm. Below this depth, near surface VWC remained relatively constant between 25 and 28% and Sphagnum GEP was effectively shut down. This also resulted in decreased ER at these locations. The combined effect was a linear relationship between VWC and NEE with moist sites acting as net CO2 sinks (up to -5 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) whereas sites closest to the ditch were consistently small carbon sources. We suggest that understanding how climate change will alter peatland hydrology relative to the moisture thresholds of Sphagnum mosses is critical to determining the fate of their carbon sink function.

AB Absorbance in the UV or visible spectrum (UV-vis) is commonly used as a proxy for DOC concentrations in waters draining upland catchments. To determine the appropriateness of different UV-vis measurements we used surface and pore water samples from two Welsh peatlands in four different experiments: (i) an assessment of single wavelength proxies (1 nm increments between 230-800 nm) for DOC concentration demonstrated that 254 nm was more accurate than 400 nm. The highest R-2 values between absorbance and DOC concentration were generated using 263 nm for one sample set (R-2 = 0.91), and 230 nm for the other three sample sets (respective R-2 values of 0.86, 0.81, and 0.93). (ii) A comparison of different DOC concentration proxies, including single wavelength proxies, a two wavelength model, a proxy using phenolic concentration, and a proxy using the area under a UV spectrum at 250-350 nm. It was found that both a single wavelength proxy (<= 263 nm) and a two wavelength model performed well for both pore water and surface water. (iii) An evaluation of the E2 : E3, E2 : E4, E4 : E6 ratios, and SUVA (absorbance at 254 nm normalised to DOC concentration) as indicators of DOC quality showed that the E4 : E6 ratio was subject to extensive variation over time, and was highly correlated between surface water and pore water, suggesting that it is a useful metric to determine temporal changes in DOC quality. (iv) A repeated weekly analysis over twelve weeks showed no consistent change in UV-vis absorbance, and therefore an inferred lack of degradation of total DOC in samples that were filtered and stored in the dark at 4 degrees C.

Ditches in abandoned mucklands were ineffective in creating ground-water depression in adjacent soil, while ditches in a newly-cleared muckland were effective in doing so. Upon abandonment, drainage ditches are subject to bank erosion and sedimentation. Coupled with years of soil subsidence and an altered hydrologic regime, ditches lose effectiveness in draining and function merely as small-scale topographic depressions, providing linear zones of seasonally high water levels. Species are distributed on abandoned mucklands in association with soil moisture conditions induced by topographic variation at both small (i.e., ditches) and larger (i.e., site-wide) spatial scales. Vegetation that is usually restricted to moist or saturated soils had greater cover closer to or within drainage ditches or in other topographically low areas, while species with low fidelity to saturated soil dominated the remaining drier areas. Some shrub species had slightly greater stem densities either within or immediately adjacent to ditches, resulting in a ''parallel'' distribution (i.e., illustrating ditch-fidelity). Species having higher affinity to lower soil moisture conditions, such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), showed significantly greater stem density in areas farther away from ditches. Ground-water levels are of primary importance in affecting distribution patterns on naturally revegetating, abandoned agricultural mucklands. The accuracy of the wetland indicator status for woody and herbaceous species encountered on these abandoned mucklands is supported quantitatively by direct gradient analysis. The functioning of existing drainage ditch systems should be assessed prior to any mitigation or restoration activities.

AB Increasing DOC concentrations in rivers of boreal and sub-boreal regions have been a widely observed phenomena. However, individual studies have been limited in time and space and this has limited the ability to test hypotheses of the explanation of the observed increases. This study examines 315 records from across Britain all of which are at least 10 years in length up to 2002, but with some records extending back to 1975 and combines these with results from 198 sites from a previous study. The study covers catchment areas up to 9948 km(2). The results show that:
   (i) Of the 315 records analysed, 216 showed a significant increase but 55 showed a significant decrease. This is the first time that significant long-term decreases in DOC concentration have been documented for British rivers. Trends in DOC concentration ranged from -5.7% to 16% annual percentage change.
   (ii) Although increasing trends are predominantly in catchments with peat covered headwaters, some peat catchment also show significant decreases.
   (iii) Some sites which show significant decreases over 10-year time periods exhibit significant increases over longer term records (23 years).
   (iv) Regional trends in DOC concentration cannot be explained by spatial or temporal trends in atmospheric deposition of acidity, oxides of N, and non-marine S. Further, trends in DOC concentrations do not appear to correlate with the occurrence of droughts.
   The study concludes that there is tong-term increases in DOC are not ubiquitous for all organic soils across the UK and that even where long-term increases are apparent these trends are overprinted by changes in river flow. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Saltwater intrusion and salinization of coastal wetlands around the world are becoming a pressing issue due to sea level rise. Here, we assessed how a freshwater coastal wetland ecosystem responds to saltwater intrusion. In wetland mesocosms, we continuously exposed Cladium jamaicense Crantz (sawgrass) plants and their peat soil collected from a freshwater marsh to two factors associated with saltwater intrusion in karstic ecosystems: elevated loading of salinity and phosphorus (P) inputs. We took repeated measures using a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design (n = 6) with treatments composed of elevated salinity (similar to 9 ppt), P loading (14.66 mu mol P/d), or a combination of both. We measured changes in water physicochemistry, ecosystem productivity, and plant biomass change over two years to assess monthly and two-year responses to saltwater intrusion. In the short-term, plants exhibited positive growth responses with simulated saltwater intrusion (salinity + P), driven by increased P availability. Despite relatively high salinity levels for a freshwater marsh (similar to 9 ppt), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the elevated salinity + P treated monoliths compared to the freshwater controls. Salinity stress became evident after extended exposure. Although still higher than freshwater controls, GEP and NEP were significantly lower in the elevated salinity + P treatment than the + P treatment after two years. However, elevated salinity decreased live root biomass regardless of whether P was added. Our results suggest that saltwater intrusion into karstic freshwater wetlands may initially act as a subsidy by stimulating aboveground primary productivity of marsh plants. However, chronic exposure to elevated salinity results in plant stress, negatively impacting belowground peat soil structure and stability through a reduction in plant roots.

AB The southern Everglades and Florida Bay have experienced a nearly 50 % reduction in freshwater flow resulting in increased salinity and landward expansion of mangrove forest. Given the marine end-member is a natural source of P to this region, it is necessary to understand the interactions between inflows and P availability in controlling the exchange of materials across the mangrove ecotone. From 2007 to 2008, we used sediment core incubations to quantify fluxes of dissolved inorganic N and P and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in three ecotone areas (dwarf mangrove, pond, and bay). Experiments were repeated seasonally over 2 years involving P-enriched surface water as a factor. We saw consistent uptake of soluble reactive P (SRP), DOC, and nitrate + nitrite (N+N) by the soils/sediments and release of ammonium (NH4+) from soils/sediments to the water column across all sites and seasons. P enrichment had no discernible effect on DIN or DOC flux, suggesting that rapid P uptake may have been more geochemically mediated. However, uptake of added P occurred across all sites and seasons, reflecting high uptake capacity in this carbonate system and the potential of the mangrove ecotone to sequester P as it becomes more available.

AB Industrial development within Canada's boreal zone has increased in recent decades. Forest management activities, pulp and paper operations, electric power generation, mining, conventional oil and gas extraction, nonconventional oil sand development, and peat mining occur throughout the boreal zone with varying impacts on water resources. We review impacts of these industries on surface water, groundwater, and wetlands recognizing that heterogeneity in the dominance of different hydrologic processes (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and runoff generation) across the boreal zone influences the degree of impacts on water resources. Through the application of best management practices, forest certification programs, and science-based guidelines, timber, pulp and paper, and peat industries have reduced their impacts on water resources, although uncertainties remain about long-term recovery following disturbance. Hydroelectric power developments have moved toward reducing reservoir size and creating more natural flow regimes, although impacts of aging infrastructure and dam decommissioning is largely unknown. Mineral and metal mining industries have improved regulation and practices, but the legacy of abandoned mines across the boreal zone still presents an ongoing risk to water resources. Oil and gas industries, including non-conventional resources such as oil sands, is one of the largest industrial users of water and, while significant progress has been made in reducing water use, more work is needed to ensure the protection of water resources. All industries contribute to atmospheric deposition of pollutants that may eventually be released to downstream waters. Although most industrial sectors strive to improve their environmental performance with regards to water resources, disruptions to natural flow regimes and risks of degraded water quality exist at local to regional scales in the boreal zone. Addressing the emerging challenge of managing the expanding, intensifying, and cumulative effects of industries in conjunction with other stressors, such as climate change and atmospheric pollution, across the landscape will aid in preserving Canada's rich endowment of water resources.

AB In a study of bacterioplankton in an oligotrophic lake in northern Wisconsin, a community fingerprinting technique, automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), was used to determine the effect of resources and trophic interactions on bacterioplankton diversity. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), carbon in the form of glucose (G) or dissolved organic matter extracted from peat (DOM), and carbon and NP in combination were added to two types of experimental systems. Ten-liter mesocosms contained all components of the original aquatic community except for large zooplankton. One-liter dilution cultures were prepared so that the effects of grazers and phytoplankton were removed. During a S-day incubation, bacterial production showed the greatest response to the carbon plus NP treatment in both experimental systems, but bacterial diversity was strikingly different between them. In the mesocosms, the number of ARISA-PCR fragments averaged 41 per profile, whereas the dilution culture communities were highly reduced in complexity, dominated in most cases by a single PCR fragment. Further analysis of the mesocosm data suggested that whereas the NPDOM addition caused the greatest aggregate bacterial growth response, the addition of NP alone caused the largest shifts in community composition. These results suggest that the measurement of aggregate responses, such as bacterial production, alone in studies of freshwater bacterial communities may mask the effects of resources on bacterioplankton.

AB Ireland provides a unique setting for the study of past climates, as its climate is dominated by westerly airflow from the North Atlantic and readily responsive to changes in North Atlantic circulation patterns. Although there has been substantial research on Ireland's past environments, quantitative palaeolimnological research, especially chironomid-based research, has been lacking. In order to further develop chironomid-based palaeolimnological investigations, a calibration set was constructed to determine the dominant environmental controls on modern chironomids in western Ireland. Chironomid subfossils were collected from surface sediments of 50 lakes. The lakes were characterised with 36 environmental variables, including physical attributes, lake water characteristics, lake sediment characteristics and land cover within each catchment. In this exploratory study, no specific environmental variable was targeted and lakes were chosen to span gradients of latitude, elevation, depth and trophic status. Redundancy analysis showed that six environmental variables-mean July air temperature, lake depth, dissolved organic carbon, and percentage catchment land cover of agriculture, peat bog and scrubland-captured a large and statistically significant portion of the variance in the chironomid data. July temperature and agricultural land cover were the most dominant environmental variables, with July temperature proving the most suitable for inference model development. A classical weighted-averaging model was developed to estimate July air temperature, with a coefficient of determination (r (jack) (2) ) of 0.60 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.57 A degrees C. Results suggest that summer temperature is the dominant influence on chironomid distribution across a wide variety of lake types, and the relatively small RMSEP should allow for more accurate reconstructions of Ireland's relatively subdued Holocene temperature fluctuations.

AB Density differences are the key parameter for stratification stability. We used data from the iron-meromictic Waldsee, Germany, a lignite mine pit lake, to quantify the contribution of single solutes to water density and analyzed the density gradient. Iron meromictic lakes maintain their density gradient through chemical reactions. Hence, quantifying the contributions of separate solutes is essential for understanding the entire process. Based on solute concentrations and literature values of partial molal volumes, substance specific density contributions were quantitatively evaluated. Then, by direct measurements of the density of IHSS Waskish peat fulvic acid, we quantified the density contribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). While several solutes contributed to the density throughout the water column, only those substances that occurred at higher concentrations in the anoxic monimolimnion than in the oxic mixolimnion were crucial to sustaining the density difference between the two layers. In Waldsee, the density difference between monimolimnion and mixolimnion was attributed to dissolved Fe2+ (0.23 g/L, resulting in a 45 % of the density difference due to solutes) and to the carbonate system (HCO3 (-), about 0.16 g/L and CO2, 0.03 g/L) while Ca2+ and DOC delivered only a small contribution. In summer, total density differences were dominated by temperature differences; during winter, solutes sustained meromixis.

AB Soils associated with wet and ephemerally wet environments, i.e. wet soils, cover an area greater than 12.1 million km(2); inland wetlands deliver at least Int$27.0 trillion in tangible and intangible benefits. However, due to their intimate association with wet environments, wet soils are at risk of degradation during drought events. This review investigates the effects of drought on wet soils, with particular attention to the changes in soil geochemistry and greenhouse gas emissions. It is clear from this review that drought poses a significant threat to wet soils, a threat which can be difficult to determine before an event but which poses a catastrophic risk to some sites. Drought causes oxygen penetration to increase in wet soils, leading to an increase in oxidation of organic matter and reduced inorganic species (e.g. sulfides). Oxidation of these materials can lead to soil acidification, metal mobilization and to negative impacts on water quality. Increased oxygen in the soil profile also affects biogeochemical cycling, with increased production of nitrous oxide and decreased production of methane. Effects of drought differ between peat and mineral soil types and subtypes. Wet soils undergo major chronological transformations and biogeochemical changes in the alteration of environments occurring before, during and after drought conditions. Water conditions (i.e. subaqueous, saturated, unsaturated and resaturated) also play a major role in chronological soil transformations. Soils may not easily recover between severe droughts and instead enter alternative stable states. This review highlights substantial gaps in our understanding of the effects of drought on wet soils and shows that previous studies overrepresent relatively small geographical regions.

AB We investigated the changes of water level and vegetation in a restored cut-over raised bog in response to a hydrological protection zone established around the bog. The restoration began 1997 and techniques involved ditch blocking within and around the bog to stimulate a return to conditions of intact bog ecosystems. In order to monitor the rehabilitation of the raised bog, water levels and vegetation have been recorded since before restoration measures began. The monitoring is ongoing, but an assessment of 15 year's data (1994-2008) is presented. A hydrological protection zone with continuous high water levels could be established around the raised bog which minimizes the runoff of precipitation. Shortly after the first measures, the water levels increased significantly at all dipwells. Parallel to the increasing water levels a vascular plant species assemblage and a diverse Sphagnum community developed. In particular Sphagnum fimbriatum, S. palustre, S. recurvum and S. squarrosum spread efficiently. The cover of trees decreased significantly because of high water levels and ongoing acidification by Sphagnum spp. The high water levels have stimulated the re-vegetation and the hydrology self-regulation of the acrotelm. The successful regeneration of the acrotelm particularly became apparent in years with below-average precipitations (e.g. 2008), when the water levels in the central parts of the raised bog did not fall back to the low level reached in previous years, which had also remarkably water deficits (e.g. 2003).

AB Wetlands are one of the most important terrestrial ecosystems for land-atmosphere CH4 exchange. A new process-based, biophysical model to quantify CH4 emissions from natural wetlands was developed and integrated into a terrestrial ecosystem model (Integrated Biosphere Simulator). The new model represents a multisubstance system (CH4, O-2, CO2, and H-2) and describes CH4 production, oxidation, and three transport processes (diffusion, plant-mediated transport, and ebullition). The new model uses several critical microbial mechanisms to represent the interaction of anaerobic fermenters and homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic, and acetoclastic methanogens, and methanotrophs in CH4 production and oxidation. We applied the model to 24 different wetlands globally to compare the simulated CH4 emissions to observations and conducted a sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that (1) for most sites, the model was able to capture the magnitude and variation of observed CH4 emissions under varying environmental conditions; (2) the parameters that regulate dissolved organic carbon and acetate production, and acetoclastic methanogenesis had the significant impact on simulated CH4 emissions; (3) the representation of the process components of CH4 cycling showed that CH4 oxidation was about half or more of CH4 production, and plant-mediated transport was the dominant pathway at most sites; and (4) the seasonality of simulated CH4 emissions can be controlled by soil temperature, water table position, or combinations thereof.

AB Climate change in the UK is expected to cause increases in temperatures, altered precipitation patterns and more frequent and extreme weather events. In this review we discuss climate effects on dissolved organic matter (DOM), how altered DOM and water physico-chemical properties will affect treatment processes and assess the utility of techniques used to remove DOM and monitor water quality. A critical analysis of the literature has been undertaken with a focus on catchment drivers of DOM character, removal of DOM via coagulation and the formation of disinfectant by-products (DBPs). We suggest that: (1) upland catchments recovering from acidification will continue to produce more DOM with a greater hydrophobic fraction as solubility controls decrease; (2) greater seasonality in DOM export is likely in future due to altered precipitation patterns; (3) changes in species diversity and water properties could encourage algal blooms; and (4) that land management and vegetative changes may have significant effects on DOM export and treatability but require further research. Increases in DBPs may occur where catchments have high influence from peatlands or where algal blooms become an issue. To increase resilience to variable DOM quantity and character we suggest that one or more of the following steps are undertaken at the treatment works: a) 'enhanced coagulation' optimised for DOM removal; b) switching from aluminium to ferric coagulants and/or incorporating coagulant aids; c) use of magnetic ionexchange (MIEX) pre-coagulation; and d) activated carbon filtration post-coagulation. Fluorescence and UV absorbance techniques are highlighted as potential methods for low-cost, rapid on-line process optimisation to improve DOM removal and minimise DBPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In Finland, the new limit values of total heavy metal, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), as well as the extractable heavy metal, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fluoride, sulphate, and chloride concentrations for bed sand material used as an earth construction agent came into force in June 2009. The total heavy metal (i.e. Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Zn, As, V, Ba and Mo) concentrations in the studied bed sand material were clearly lower than the current Finnish limit values for the maximum allowable heavy metal concentrations for materials used as an earth construction agent. However, the extractable concentration of Ba (24.6 mg kg(-1); d.w.) in the bed sand material exceeded the limit value for covered structures (20 mg kg(-1); d.w.). However, in Finland, the competent environmental authority may relax the maximum limit values up to 30% in certain circumstances. Therefore, if, the environmental authority relaxes the maximum limit value for the extractable concentration of Ba by up to 30% to the value of 26 mg kg(-1) (d.w.) for covered structures, the extractable concentration of Ba (24.6 mg kg(-1); d.w.) in the bed sand material is below this relaxation.

AB Peat deposits, which outcrop in the southern Agadia region in Trabzon, Northern Turkey, were studied by using chemical, organic geochemical, petrographic and palynological characteristics of peats. Palynological data indicate that the peats were deposited in terrestrial or lacustrine environments, comprising organic matter with an average composition of 70% woody, 19.3% herbaceous and 10.7% amorphous material. The peats are Holocene-recent in age. The peat organic matter that has been interpreted as immature based on the SCI (spore color index) analyses suggests that the peat organic matter was immature.
   Rock Eval analyses show that the average total organic carbon (TOC) content of the peat is 42%, and the average HI value is 315 mgHC/gTOC, which is very high for peat. The high 01 values (avg. 134 mgCO(2)/gTOC) point that the depositional environment of peats were deposits under oxic or suboxic conditions.
   The selected sample (ABY-13) with the highest extractable yield has TAR (Terrigenous/Aquatic Ratio) and CPI (Carbon Preference Index) index values of 2.4 and 3.4, respectively. These values reflect high levels of n-alkanes, supporting a terrestrial organic matter input. The P-aq (aquatic plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.6) indicates that there was a contribution from mixtures of submerged/floating, emergent and terrestrial plant mixtures. The P-wax (vascular plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.6) is a sign of moist and wetter conditions. The TOC, ACL, Q(wood/grass):C-27/C-31, Q(wood/plant) (C-27 + C-29)/(C-27 + C-29 + C-31) and Q(grass/plant):C-31/(C-27 + C-29 + C31) values indicate that woody plants were the dominant vegetation in the peat mire was woody plants, and the climate was relatively wet and cold.
   According to the m/z 191 and m/z 217 fragments tracking from GC-MS chromatogram data obtained using biomarker analyses, the lack of C-34 and C-35 homohopanes was interpreted as that organic matter was deposited under oxic or suboxic conditions. Moretane/hopane, Tm/Ts and Tm/C-30 pentacydic triterpane ratios also point indicate oxic and acidic conditions during the formation of the peat. The absence of 17 alpha(H)-28,30-bisnorhopane from the m/z 191 chromatograms support the interpretation that the Agacbasi Yayla peat was deposited in a terrestrial or lacustrine environment under oxic or suboxic conditions. The dominance of C-29 steranes indicates significant terrestrial organic matter input. Using sterane carbon number distributions the extract of the peat sample plots in the terrigenous region. Additionally, C-30 steranes, which imply marine environments, were not detected. The Ts/(Ts + Tm), ratios also suggest that the peat contained immature organic matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Kiushitou (42degrees28' N, 141degrees9' E) is a lowland mire located in a residential area of northern Japan. We examined the 2-D distribution of hydrochemical variables and their seasonal changes in relation to plant communities in an attempt to conserve the Sphagnum fen (Sphagnum subfulvum ). This mire is gently sloping and the upper area consists of alder and ash forests, while the lower area is covered with fen communities. The grassy fen, Moliniopsis japonica , occurs throughout the lower area, whereas the Sphagnum fen is restricted to the southwest part of the mire. anova and canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the occurrence of Sphagnum fen is negatively correlated with Mg, Ca and electrical conductivity (EC). These variables indicated that water in the upper forest area contained a high concentration of minerals from the neighboring residential area. Seasonal changes in EC values revealed that the watercourse from a spring point in an upper corner to the lowest drainage ditch was divided into two, southwest and northeast, courses. Because the northeast-course spring water joins mineral-rich water flowing from a point at the upper margin, the northeast part of the lower area contains considerable Ca and Mg. In contrast, the mineral-poor spring water flowing into the southwest part of the mire ensures the survival of the Sphagnum fen. Thus, when we stop the supply of mineral-rich water from the upper margin the area of the Sphagnum fen will expand into the northeast part of the mire. Two-dimensional details of the hydrochemical regime clarify the impact of mineral inflow and the expansion mechanisms of these minerals.

AB The number of metal mines, the amount of ore processed, and thus the amount of mine wastewaters have been rapidly increasing in recent decades. Pretreated process effluent and drainage waters containing high concentrations of e.g., arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and nickel (Ni) have been purified for up to 6 years in treatment peatlands at a gold mine in Finnish Lappland prior to their release into downstream water bodies. Retention efficiencies based on monitoring of peatland inflow and outflow waters indicated that retention of As, Sb, and Ni was generally good (up to 95%) but temporarily variable. Other contaminants such as sulfate or iron were retained less efficiently or were even leaching from the peatland. Most of the As, Sb, and Ni was retained close to the wastewater distribution ditch, and there was a near-linear increase in As, Sb, and Ni concentrations in the peatlands over time. Adsorption experiments indicated the high potential of peat soils to adsorb As, Ni and especially Sb. Accumulation of contaminants has led to or will lead to concentrations exceeding higher guideline values for contaminated soils within the next 1-18 years, which indicates a limited lifetime for treatment peatlands. Leaching of contaminants is anticipated in situations where clean natural waters mix with minewaters, e.g., during snowmelt or after mine closure, and desorption experiments suggest that especially easily mobilized (i.e., loosely-bound) fractions of As, Sb, and Ni are likely to leach from the treatment peatlands. The collective data indicate (i) high purification efficiencies for As, Sb, and Ni in the peatlands, (ii) high adsorptive capacity of the peat soil for those contaminants, (iii) increased risk of contaminant leaching e.g., after mine closure, and (iv) a need for further studies of environmental parameters and retention processes affecting contaminant removal efficiencies and potential lifetimes of treatment peatlands.

AB In-stream processing of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in peat-sourced headwaters has been shown to be a significant part of the terrestrial carbon cycle, through photo- and bio-degradation, with both DOC and POC converted to carbon dioxide (CO2). This study reports a series of 70-h, in situ experiments investigating rates of degradation in unfiltered surface water from a headwater stream in the River Tees, North Pennines, UK. Half the samples were exposed to the normal day/night cycle (ambient); half were continuously dark. The study found that the DOC concentration of samples in the ambient treatment declined by 64 % over the 70 h, compared with 6 % decline for the samples kept in the dark. For POC, the loss in the ambient treatment was 13 %. The average initial rate of loss of DOC in the ambient treatment during the first day of the experiment was 3.36 mg C/l/h, and the average rate of photo-induced loss over the whole 70 h was 1.25 mg C/l/h. Scaling up these losses, the estimate of total organic carbon loss from UK rivers to the atmosphere is 9.4 Tg CO2/year which would be 0.94 % of the global estimate of CO2 emissions from streams and rivers from the 2013 IPCC report. Initial rate kinetics in the light were as high as 3rd order, but the study showed that no single rate law could describe the whole diurnal degradation cycle and that separate rate laws were required for night and day processes. The comparison of dark and ambient treatment processes showed no evidence of photo-stimulated bacterial degradation.

AB Boreal streams represent potentially important conduits for the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The gas transfer coefficient of CO2 (K-CO2) is a key variable in estimating this source strength, but the scarcity of measured values in lotic systems creates a risk of incorrect flux estimates even when stream gas concentrations are well known. This study used 114 independent measurements of K-CO2 from 14 stream reaches in a boreal headwater system to determine and predict spatiotemporal variability in K-CO2. The K-CO2 values ranged from 0.001 to 0.207 min(-1) across the 14 sites. Median K-CO2 for a specific site was positively correlated with the slope of the stream reach, with higher gas transfer coefficients occurring in steeper stream sections. Combining slope with a width/depth index of the stream reach explained 83% of the spatial variability in K-CO2. Temporal variability was more difficult to predict and was strongly site specific. Variation in K-CO2, rather than pCO(2), was the main determinant of stream CO2 evasion. Applying published generalized gas transfer velocities produced an error of up to 100% in median instantaneous evasion rates compared to the use of actual measured K-CO2 values from our field study. Using the significant relationship to local slope, the median K-CO2 was predicted for 300,000 km of watercourses (ranging in stream order 1-4) in the forested landscape of boreal/nemoral Sweden. The range in modeled stream order specific median K-CO2 was 0.017-0.028 min(-1) and there was a clear gradient of increasing K-CO2 with lower stream order. We conclude that accurate regional scale estimates of CO2 evasion fluxes from running waters are possible, but require a good understanding of gas exchange at the water surface.

AB To examine the potential influence of terrestrially derived DOM on the Baltic Sea, a year-long study of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was performed in three river catchments in Sweden. One catchment drains into the Bothnian Sea, while two southern catchments drain into the Baltic proper. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were positively correlated with discharge from forested catchments over the year. While the overall concentrations of DOC were several times higher in the southern two catchments, higher discharge in the northern catchment resulted in the annual loadings of DOC being on the same order of magnitude for all three catchments. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) was used as a proxy for the lability of carbon in the system. The range of BOD values was similar for all three catchments, however, the ratio of BOD to DOC (an indication of the labile fraction) in Ume river was four times higher than in the southern two catchments. Total annual BOD loading to the Baltic Sea was twice as high in the northern catchment than in the two southern catchments. Lower winter temperatures and preservation of organic matter in the northern catchment combined with an intense spring flood help to explain the higher concentrations of labile carbon in the northern catchment. Lower lability of DOM as well as higher colour in the southern catchments suggest that wetlands (i.e. peat bogs) may be the dominant source of DOM in these catchments, particularly in periods of low flow. With climate change expected to increase precipitation events and temperatures across the region, the supply and quality of DOM delivered to the Baltic Sea can also be expected to change. Our results indicate that DOM supply to the Baltic Sea from boreal rivers will be more stable throughout the year, and potentially have a lower bioavailability.

AB Mechanisms influencing retention, biogeochemical cycling, and release of legacy mercury within soils of forests and wetlands remain poorly understood. We quantified mercury pool size and stoichiometry with carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur across forest-wetland transects and among wetlands of different hydrogeologic settings in the Adirondack region of New York State. Average total mercury pool size in soils (to 50 cm depth) was greater in forests (17.5 mg/m(2)) than in wetlands (6.1 mg/m(2); p<0.010). The average mercury pool size (to 50 cm depth) in shallow-peat riparian wetlands (9.3 mg/m(2)) was greater than in deep-peat riparian (5.4 mg/m(2); p=0.099) or headwater wetlands (3.6 mg/m(2); p=0.046). Accumulation of mercury was enhanced at the forest-wetland interface. In mineral horizons of the forest soil and in shallow-peat riparian wetlands, mercury was positively correlated with carbon (r(2)=0.73-0.96) and nitrogen (r(2)=0.82-0.93), but not sulfur. In contrast, mercury and sulfur were strongly correlated in headwater wetland peat (r(2)=0.73). Dissolved mercury was correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water and stream water of deep-peat and shallow-peat riparian wetlands (r(2)=0.46-0.73), but not in headwater wetland pore water. In headwater outlet streams, dissolved mercury was correlated with DOC (r(2)=0.62), but the slope was only one third that in riparian streams. Hydrogeologic setting influences decomposition processes, biogeochemical cycling of mercury, and hydrologic transport that in turn, govern the size and stoichiometry of mercury pools across the upland-wetland interface and among different wetland types. Ultimately, mobilization of legacy mercury into aquatic ecosystems from forest soils and wetlands likely depends upon decomposition dynamics and hydrologic flow paths.

AB Warming climate is thawing the permafrost in arctic and subarctic regions, leading to formation of thermokarst ponds. During the formation and geomorphological succession of these ponds, carbon that has been trapped in frozen soils for thousands of years is hydrologically mobilized and returned to the active carbon cycle. We sampled 12 thermokarst ponds representing three different stages of pond succession to study the potential of microbial communities to metabolize the organic carbon in the water. We investigated the quality of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column based on the spectrophotometric and fluorometric properties of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter combined with parallel factor analysis and the potential of the microbial community for degrading these carbon compounds based on genetic markers related to carbon degradation. Our analysis showed a clear difference in the DOC quality across the different developmental stages. In the younger ponds, organic matter quality suggested that it was originating from the degrading permafrost and in the metagenomes collected from these ponds, the normalized abundance of genes related to degradation of carbon compounds was higher. There was also a shift in the degradation potential in the water column of the ponds, with higher potential for organic matter degradation in deeper, anoxic layers. In conclusion, our results show that the DOC quality and the genetic potential of the microbial community for carbon cycling change across the pond ontogeny, suggesting a capacity of the microbial communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

AB Effects of elevated CO2 on upland vegetation have been widely studied, but limited information is available on the response of wetland vegetation. A laboratory-based experiment was conducted to determine effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on the growth, root-derived DOC and phenolics, and extracellular enzyme activity for 110 days using Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Phragmites japonica, Phragmites communis, Zizania latifolia, Scirpus lacustris, Juncus effuses, and Typha latifolia. Elevated CO2 did not enhance the growth of any vegetation we assessed, but root-derived DOC and phenolics increased in the soil with M. sacchariflorus (phenolics, 45.0%, P < 0.05), P. communis (DOC, 25.5%, P < 0.1; phenolics, 52.6%, P < 0.1), Z. latifolia (DOC, 46.2%, P = 0.05; phenolics, 76.9%, P < 0.05), and S. lacustris (DOC, 142.0%, P = 0.001; phenolics, 42.9%, P < 0.05). Only a small number of enzymes exhibited changes under elevated CO2, and even such changes differed with the type of vegetation and enzymes. When all the data were combined, several enzyme activities were positively correlated with DOC in soils (phosphatase, r = 0.41, P < 0.05; arylsulphatase, r = 0.38, P < 0.05), but negatively with phenolics (beta-glucosidase, r = -0.30, P < 0.1) and the ratio of phenolics to DOC (arylsulphatase, r = -0.43, P < 0.05). Overall results of the present study suggest that elevated CO2 would not change vegetation growth but influence DOC and phenolics in soil.

AB Natural riparian forest wetlands are known to be effective in their ability to remove nitrate by denitrification and sediments with attached phosphorus via sedimentation. On the other hand, litter input and decomposition is a process of crucial importance in cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in a forest ecosystem.
   In this study we investigated the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the alder fen ecosystem through leaf litter and its decomposition and the removal capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus by measuring denitrification and sedimentation in the alder fen.
   We found an average input of leaf litter during fall 1998 of 226 g m(-2) yr(-1) DW with nutrient concentration of 0.17% P and 1.6% N. This means a yearly input of 0.4 g m(-2) yr(-1) P and 3.6 g m(-2) yr(-1) N. The decomposition of leaf litter using litter bags with small and large mesh size resulted in bags with macroinvertebrates (large mesh size) and without macroinvertebrates (small mesh size). After 57 days the litter bags with macroinvertebrates had a decomposition rate of 79%.
   Denitrification was measured in May and June of 1997 using the acetylene inhibition technique on intact soil cores and slurry-experiments. The average annual denitrification rate was 0.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) N using data from the core experiments. The denitrification rate was higher after addition of nitrate, indicating that denitrification in the riparian alder fen is mainly controlled by nitrate supply.
   The sedimentation rate in the investigated alder fen ranged from 0.47 kg m(-2) yr(-1) DW to 4.46 kg m(-2) yr(-1) DW in 1998 depending on the study site and method we used. Sedimentation rates were lower in newly designed plate traps than in cylinder traps. The alder fen also showed lower rates than the adjacent creek Briese. Average phosphorus removal rate was 0.33 g m(-2) yr(-1) P.
   Input sources for the surface water of the alder fen are sediment mineralization and decomposition of leaf litter; output sources are sedimentation and denitrification. This study showed that a nutrient input of 24.58 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) N, 8.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) P and 419 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) DOC into the surface water of the alder fen is possible. Alder fens cannot improve water quality of an adjacent river system. This is only true for a nearly pristine alder fen with the hydrology of 10 months flooded conditions and 2 months non-flooding conditions a year.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulates under lake ice in winter and degasses to the atmosphere after ice melt. This large springtime CO2 pulse is not typically considered in surface-atmosphere flux estimates, because most field studies have not sampled through ice during late winter. Measured CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) of lake surface water ranged from 8.6 to 4,290 Pa (85-4,230 mu atm) in 234 north temperate and boreal lakes prior to ice melt during 1998 and 1999. Only four lakes had surface pCO, less than or equal to atmospheric pCO(2), whereas 75% had pCO(2) > 5 times atmospheric. The delta C-13(DIC) (DIC = Sigma CO2) of 142 of the lakes ranged from -26.28 parts per thousand to +0.95 parts per thousand. Lakes with the greatest pCO(2) also had the lightest delta C-13(DIC), which indicates respiration as their primary CO2 source. Finnish lakes that received large amounts of dissolved organic carbon from surrounding peatlands had the greatest pCO(2). Lakes set in noncarbonate till and bedrock in Minnesota and Wisconsin had the smallest pCO(2), and the heaviest delta C-13(DIC), which indicates atmospheric and/or mineral sources of C for those lakes. Potential emissions for the period after ice melt were 2.36 +/- 1.44 mol CO2 m(-2) for lakes with average pCO(2) values and were as large as 13.7 +/- 8.4 mol CO2 m(-2) for lakes with high pCO(2) values.

AB The concentration and size fractionation of major and trace elements (TEs) linked to organo-mineral colloids along the landscape gradient soil water-peat mire-humic lakes-river-large oligotrophic lake have been investigated within two watersheds located in the subarctic region (Karelia, Russia) in the summer base-flow period. A large volume of natural waters was filtered in the field using cascade filtration and ultrafiltration (UF) with a progressively decreasing pore size [100, 20, 10, 5, 0.8, 0.4, 0.22, 0.1, 0.046, 0.0066 (100 kDa), 0.0031 (10 kDa) and 0.0014 mu m (1 kDa)] followed by multi-elemental ICP-MS and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis. In situ dialysis with 10 and 1 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes was also conducted. According to the TE distribution among different size fractions in the continuum soil (mire)-humic lake-river-large lake, the following groups of elements could be distinguished: (1) elements significantly bound to the colloidal (1 kDa-0.22 mu m) fraction and decreasing the proportion of this fraction from the feeding lake and stream to the terminal oligotrophic lake (Fe, Ti and U); (2) colloidally dominated (>80 %) elements exhibiting similar size fractionation in all studied settings (Y, REEs, Zr, Hf and Th); (3) elements appreciably bound to colloids (20-40 %) in organic-rich soil and bog waters and decreasing their colloidal fraction to approximately 10 % in the oligotrophic lake (Mg, Ca, Sr, Rb and Mo); and (4) elements linked to the colloidal fraction (40-80 %) and not demonstrating any systematic variation between different landscape units (Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Mn, Zn and Pb). The in situ dialysis technique produced a similar picture of the colloidal size fractionation with generally lower proportions of elements in the colloidal fraction compared to the UF. Thermodynamic modeling of trace element speciation using available codes demonstrated that complexation with dissolved organic matter and adsorption at the surface of ferric colloids can adequately model the observed colloidal speciation of divalent metals. However, the modeling could not describe the distribution of trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates (TE3+,4+) among different size fractions and cannot reproduce the experimentally observed proportion of their colloidal forms. Therefore, coprecipitation with organo-ferric colloids should be considered to account for the partitioning of TE3+,4+ between truly dissolved (<1 kDa) and various colloidal fractions. It follows from the results of this study that autochthonous processes of organic matter fractionation, such as (1) transformation of initially allochthonous soil-derived colloids via photo-and biodegradation or (2) new organic ligand production by plankton and periphyton, cannot appreciably affect the distribution of TEs among various size fractions of colloids and particles along the landscape gradient from soil water to terminal lake. Thus, even crucial changes in the environmental conditions, such as the river discharge regime and relative lake versus bog coverage, surface water pH, pCO(2) and DOC changes that are likely to occur according to the "extreme" scenario of the climate warming in the Arctic, should not affect the size fractionation and, therefore, the potential aquatic lability and biodisponibility of TEs present as organic (divalent transition metals, alkaline earth metals) and organo-mineral (Fe, Al, insoluble trivalent and tetravalent elements and U) colloids.

AB Spectral light attenuation profiles and concentrations of total and dissolved carbon (C), nutrients and chlorophyll a (Chla) were studied along transects running from the river mouth to the Kara Sea during late summer 2003 for the Yenisey and fall 2005 for the Ob estuaries. Earth Observation data were used to generate composite images of water color and Chla distribution over the estuaries and the Kara Sea to reveal the spatial impact of the river efflux in terms of optical properties.
   High levels of total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), silicate (Si) and iron (Fe), but low levels of inorganic N and P and Chla were found in the estuaries. More than 90 % of total organic C was in dissolved form (DOC). The high concentrations of DOC, mostly terrigenous, humic compounds, gave extremely high attenuation coefficients for both visible and ultraviolet light. For UV-B, Z(10%) (the depth at which 10% of surface light remains) was <10 cm, while Z(10%) for visible light (PAR) generally ranged between 1 and 3 m for both transects. The light attenuation rapidly decreases when the freshwater is mixed with the coastal water outside off the coast. This leads to a strong light limitation and low productivity in the inner estuaries, while the high load of N and P associated with DOC eventually could promote primary production in the Kara Sea and further upstream the coastal current in the Arctic Ocean as the organic matter becomes diluted and photooxidized. On the other hand, the high inputs of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) provide an efficient screening of potential harmful UV-radiation over vast areas of the Arctic Ocean. A rising trend of riverine efflux to the Arctic seas is observed, and further increases in freshwater runoff as well as eventual permafrost thawing, will accentuate the freshwater impact in the estuaries and the Kara Sea.

   CATCHMENT
AB In seasonally ice-covered lakes, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission at ice-off can account for a significant fraction of the annual budget. Yet knowledge of the mechanisms controlling below lake-ice carbon (C) dynamics and subsequent CO2 and CH4 emissions at ice-off is limited. To understand the control of below ice C dynamics, and C emissions in spring, we measured spatial variation in CO2, CH4, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon from ice-on to ice-off, in a small boreal lake during a winter with sporadic melting events. Winter melt events were associated with decreased surface water DOC in the forest-dominated basin and increased surface water CH4 in the mire-dominated basin. At the whole-lake scale, CH4 accumulated below ice throughout the winter, whereas CO2 accumulation was greatest in early winter. Mass-balance estimates suggest that, in addition to the CO2 and CH4 accumulated duringwinter, external inputs of CO2 and CH4 and internal processing during ice-melt could represent significant sources of C gas emissions during ice-off. Moreover, internal processing of CO2 and CH4 worked in opposition, with production of CO2 and oxidation of CH4 dominating at ice-off. These findings have important implications for how small boreal lakes will respond to warmer winters in the future; increased winter melt events will likely increase external inputs below ice and thus alter the extent and timing of CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere at ice-off.
   Plain Language Summary Many lakes are ice-covered for a portion of the year, where ice serves as a barrier to the atmosphere, trapping greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane. At ice-off, these greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. Yet due to difficulties associated with sampling ice-covered lakes, there is limited information about the factors that contribute to carbon dioxide and methane release at ice-off. Moreover, projected warmer winters, with increased precipitation as rain and reduced duration of ice cover, suggest that the contributing factors may change in the future. To gain insight into greenhouse gas dynamics in ice-covered lakes, we measured carbon dioxide and methane from ice-on to ice-off in a small boreal lake during a winter with sporadic melting events. We show that winter melt events alter carbon inputs below ice with implications for the timing and type of greenhouse gases released at ice-off. Our study brings new insight to greenhouse gas dynamics in ice-covered lakes and highlights challenges in understanding the implications of changing ice-cover patterns as the climate warms.

AB This is the first attempt to budget average current annual carbon (C) and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges and transfers in a subarctic landscape, the Lake Tornetrask catchment in northern Sweden. This is a heterogeneous area consisting of almost 4000 km 2 of mixed heath, birch and pine forest, and mires, lakes and alpine ecosystems. The magnitudes of atmospheric exchange of carbon in the form of the GHGs, CO2 and CH4 in these various ecosystems differ significantly, ranging from little or no flux in barren ecosystems over a small CO2 sink function and low rates of CH4 exchange in the heaths to significant CO2 uptake in the forests and also large emissions of CH4 from the mires and small lakes. The overall catchment budget, given the size distribution of the individual ecosystem types and a first approximation of run-off as dissolved organic carbon, reveals a landscape currently with a significant sink capacity for atmospheric CO2. This sink capacity is, however, extremely sensitive to environmental changes, particularly those that affect the birch forest ecosystem. Climatic drying or wetting and episodic events such as insect outbreaks may cause significant changes in the sink function. Changes in the sources of CH4 through increased permafrost melting may also easily change the sign of the current radiative forcing, due to the stronger impact per gram of CH4 relative to CO2. Hence, to access impacts on climate, the atmospheric C balance alone has to be weighed in a radiative forcing perspective. When considering the emissions of CH4 from the mires and lakes as CO2 equivalents, the Tornetrask catchment is currently a smaller sink of radiative forcing, but it can still be estimated as representing the equivalent of approximately 14 000 average Swedish inhabitants' emissions of CO2. This can be compared with the carbon emissions of less than 200 people who live permanently in the catchment, although this comparison disregards substantial emissions from the non-Swedish tourism and transportation activities.

AB Wetlands provide important ecohydrological services by regulating fluxes of nutrients and pollutants to receiving waters, which can in turn mitigate adverse effects on water quality. Turnover of redox-sensitive solutes in wetlands has been shown to take place in distinct spatial and temporal patterns, commonly referred to as hot spots and hot moments. Despite the importance of such patterns for solute fluxes the mechanistic understanding of their formation is still weak and their existence is often explained by variations in soil properties and diffusive transport only. Here we show that surface micro-topography in wetlands can cause the formation of biogeochemical hot spots solely by the advective redistribution of infiltrating water as a result of complex subsurface flow patterns. Surface and subsurface flows are simulated for an idealized section of a riparian wetland using a fully integrated numerical code for coupled surface-subsurface systems. Biogeochemical processes and transport along advective subsurface flow paths are simulated kinetically using the biogeochemical code PHREEQC. Distinct patterns of biogeochemical activity (expressed as reaction rates) develop in response to micro-topography induced subsurface flow patterns. Simulated vertical pore water profiles for various redox-sensitive species resemble profiles observed in the field. This mechanistic explanation of hot spot formation complements the more static explanations that relate hot spots solely to spatial variability in soil characteristics and can account for spatial as well as temporal variability of biogeochemical activity, which is needed to assess future changes in the biogeochemical turnover of wetland systems.

AB Questions: What are the long-term results of fen meadow restoration after topsoil removal on peatlands? What are the causes of slow fen-meadow vegetation recovery on peat soils after topsoil removal?
   Location: Drentsche Aa Nature Reserve (53 degrees 0049N, 6 degrees 3746E) in the northeast Netherlands, with extensive natural and partially restored fen meadows (ca. 10,000ha).
   Methods: Restoration measures consisted of removal of acidified and fertilized topsoil and improvement of local hydrology by blocking or removing drainage ditches. The effects of shallow (20cm) and deep (40cm) topsoil removal were compared. We monitored vegetation changes after restoration measures in permanent plots over a 13-yr period, and analysed changes in species composition over time with ordination techniques (multivariate analysis: PCA and RDA). Soil conditions over time were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA.
   Results: The vegetation and environment shifted over time in response to restoration. At first the vegetation stagnated in a species-poor phase for 5yr, but eventually fen-meadow species re-established. At the end of the observation period, after 14yr, the vegetation after both shallow and deep peat removal was similar. Soil acidification occurred immediately after topsoil removal (within the first 2-3yr) due to pyrite oxidation when the soil was exposed to air after site excavation and the peat was temporarily desiccated.
   Conclusions: We found poor re-establishment of fen-meadow vegetation and persistence of species-poor communities during the first 5yr after topsoil removal, probably resulting from internal soil acidification. After further rewetting, a rapid shift towards the target community composition was observed. The positive shift in development of fen-meadow vegetation probably occurred due to increased groundwater discharge after successful hydrological measures were applied. Appropriate hydrological conditions (strong discharge of groundwater) are important for the success of restoration of these fen meadows, especially if pyrite is present in shallow soil layers.

AB We investigated the importance of physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a peaty soil. Columns containing peat aggregates (embedded within a sand matrix) provided an experimental system in which both convective and diffusive processes contributed to DOM leaching. The use of aggregated peat avoided the problems associated with traditional batch equilibration experiments in which soil structure is destroyed. Biotic and abiotic processes operating in the columns were manipulated by working with two unsterilized columns (at 5 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and one gamma irradiation-sterilized column (5 degrees C). Continuous solute flows (< 80 hours) and periods of flow interruption (five interruptions of 6 hours to 384 hours) were applied to the columns (using a 1-mM NaCl electrolyte) to investigate mechanisms of diffusion-controlled release of DOM. For all columns, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) effluent concentrations increased after resumption of flow and the maximum concentrations increased with increased flow-interruption duration. Measurements of effluent UV absorbance (lambda = 285 nm) showed that the DOM leached immediately after the flow interruptions contained fewer aromatic moieties of lower molecular weight than the DOM leached after periods of steady flow. The sterilized column had larger DOC and DON effluent concentration spikes than those from the unsterilized column at 5 degrees C (38 mg C dm(-3) and 6.5 mg N dm(-3) versus 13 mg C dm(-3) and 6.5 mg N dm(-3) after the 384 hours flow interruption). This result suggested that the concentrations of DOM resulting from physico-chemical release mechanisms (sterilized column) were attenuated by biological activity (unsterilized columns). Our results indicate that the peat's microporous structure provides reservoirs of DOM that interact with solute in transport pores via abiotic, rate-controlled mass transport. Hence, diffusion can influence the quantity and composition of DOM leached from peat in the field depending on intensity and duration of rainfall.

AB Ditching is a common practice to dewater wetlands, including peatlands, and ditch blocking is a common method for restoring wetlands because substrate is often unavailable for filling the ditches. However, filling has many advantages compared to blocking ditches. Our goal was to test whether ditches could be filled in a Colorado sloping fen (Chattanooga Fen) using bales created from shredded aspen (Populus tremuloides) tree-fiber. We monitored water table levels before and after we filled two ditches (combined length of approximately 165 m x 3 m wide) as well as an undisturbed reference portion of Chattanooga fen. The reference site had stable water tables that rarely dropped more than 20 cm below the soil surface. The ditches had been dewatering large areas of the fen for at least 100 years. Filling the ditches with fiber bales resulted in a water table increase between 2 and 22 cm in an area up to 150 m below the ditch. Native sedges now cover the area where we filled the ditches, with no erosion or compression/settling of the ground observed and no water backing up behind the filled ditches. Filling the ditches with shredded fiber bales is a good option for restoration in wilderness areas, or areas lacking peat or mineral soil fill because it is a natural material that is easily transported and placed in the ditches.

AB During autumn 1987, 987 randomly selected lakes throughout Finland were surveyed. Drainage lakes are most common (70%), followed by headwater lakes (17%). The lakes in the survey span most of the variation in humic matter concentration found in aquatic ecosystems (total organic carbon (TOC) = 0.5-47 (mg.L-1, colour = 0-600 mg Pt.L-1. The median TOC, colour, and chemical oxygen demand (COD(Mn)) are 12 mg.L-1, 100 mg Pt.L-1, and 15 Mg O2.L-1, respectively. TOC is significantly related to other water quality parameters including the following: COD(Mn) (r2 = 0.92), colour (r2 = 0.86), total iron (r2 = 0.69), total nitrogen (r2 = 0.53), and total phosphorus (r2 = 0.41). TOC and nutrient concentrations are low in northern Finland compared with southern and central regions. Multiple linear regression shows that the proportion of the catchment area covered by peatlands is the most important catchment variable determining TC)C concentrations. In northern Finland, where catchment areas are less disturbed compared with southern regions, peatlands and latitude explain 63% of the variation in TOC. In the full set of lakes, latitude, catchment to lake area ratio, and the proportion of the catchment area covered by peatlands, upstream lakes, and fields explain 55% of the variation in TOC.

AB The paper evaluates measures taken to restore mountain Peat Bogs and their effect on hydrological regime, with the main focus on groundwater levels. The level of groundwater is a key factor in maintaining the character of mountain Peat Bogs and the main objective of restoration is to increase and stabilize the groundwater level in disturbed Peat Bogs. At the same time, the paper provides a complex overview of the topic, which is being often discussed nowadays, mostly due to a big retention potential of mountain Peat Bogs. The paper is based on detailed measurements of groundwater levels in a selected experimental drainage ditch in the catchment of the Rokytka stream. Basic statistical characteristics, the equation of Penman-Montheit or antecedent precipitation index were used to show the dependence of groundwater level on precipitation or evapotranspiration. The results show a positive influence of the restoration measures on Peat Bogs. In this case it has been confirmed that restoration measures cause increase of groundwater level and decrease its fluctuation in the Peat Bog.

AB Rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic might cause a greater release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. To study the effect of warming on GHG dynamics, we deployed open-top chambers in a subarctic tundra site in Northeast European Russia. We determined carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the concentration of those gases, inorganic nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) along the soil profile. Studied tundra surfaces ranged from mineral to organic soils and from vegetated to unvegetated areas. As a result of air warming, the seasonal GHG budget of the vegetated tundra surfaces shifted from a GHG sink of -300 to -198 g CO2 -eq m(-2) to a source of 105 to 144 g CO2 -eq m(-2). At bare peat surfaces, we observed increased release of all three GHGs. While the positive warming response was dominated by CO2, we provide here the first in situ evidence of increasing N2O emissions from tundra soils with warming. Warming promoted N2O release not only from bare peat, previously identified as a strong N2O source, but also from the abundant, vegetated peat surfaces that do not emit N2O under present climate. At these surfaces, elevated temperatures had an adverse effect on plant growth, resulting in lower plant N uptake and, consequently, better N availability for soil microbes. Although the warming was limited to the soil surface and did not alter thaw depth, it increased concentrations of DOC, CO2, and CH4 in the soil down to the permafrost table. This can be attributed to downward DOC leaching, fueling microbial activity at depth. Taken together, our results emphasize the tight linkages between plant and soil processes, and different soil layers, which need to be taken into account when predicting the climate change feedback of the Arctic.

AB The majority of C, N and P in boreal lakes are in organic form. Organically bound nutrients are released through biodegradation or photodegradation which affects the water quality, eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions of lakes. We tested whether open land-use data combined with land-use-specific export coefficients can be used to predict total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) loading and lake water concentrations. Using data from 12 lake catchments in eastern Finland, we found that land use and management of the catchment explained a substantial proportion of the variations in TOC (r (2) = 0.78), DON (r (2) = 0.55) and DOP (r (2) = 0.80) concentrations between lakes. The computation does not account for in-lake processes, which are reflected as mismatch between the predicted and observed concentrations. However, this simple practical approach is useful in ranking lakes according to their water quality. The results indicated that natural sources dominate TOC, DON and DOP exports; the background leachings accounted for 57-99 %, 48-96 % and 55-99 % of TOC, DON and DOP export, respectively. The proposed method has promise as a practical decision support tool for assessing the impacts of land use on water quality. The results showed that possibilities to control TOC, DON and DOP loading to surface waters are limited to catchments where the peatland proportion is low and anthropogenic sources significant.

AB This study of an abandoned cutover bog aims to understand the processes controlling moisture conditions that have led to distinct spatial patterns of Sphagnum recolonization, and also how substrate conditions may have changed since abandonment and the implications for plant establishment. Two (unreplicated) symmetrical 12 x 3.5 m(2) quadrats either side of the centre-line of a block-cut trench were treated by removing all recolonized vegetation, including Sphagnum, from one quadrat (REMOV), examining Sphagnum-covered (SPHAG) peat in the other, and bare peat (BARE) in both. Average volumetric soil moisture contents 0 in the peat (2 cm below the surface) of the SPHAG and REMOV substrates were similar (similar to86%), but greater than in BARE peat (similar to78%). In a location not manipulated for this experiment, where Sphagnum cushions have re-established on bare cutover peat, theta beneath the cushions was 5-14% greater than in bare cutover peat directly adjacent to it, indicating that cushions can regulate local substrate water storage, and benefit from it during periods of increased water demand. This may have assisted in the lateral expansion of sphagnum. A loosely structured 0.5 to 1.0 cm thick organic litter layer (chiefly Ericaceae) overlying the BARE peat substrate slowed the rate of drying of bare peat in a laboratory sample. The laboratory tests found the capillary fringe to be up to 26 cm above the water table. The dry conditions and the larger pore structure of this litter layer hindered upward capillary flow and, therefore, plant water availability. In (occluded) ditches and low areas, the capillary fringe remained within 5 cm of the surface, and these locations supported the most complete Sphagnum cover. In slightly higher areas, where the capillary fringe was about 20 cm below the surface, and because of the leaf litter, capillary water supply to the surface is sufficiently restricted to limit Sphagnum recolonization. These locations may have to await lateral expansion of Sphagnum cushions to achieve a full cover. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The cultivation of Sphagnum mosses on re-wetted peat bogs for use in horticulture is a new land use strategy. We provide the first greenhouse gas balances for a field-scale Sphagnum farming experiment on former bog grassland, in its establishment phase. Over two years we used closed chambers to make measurements of GHG exchange on production strips of Sphagnum palustre L. and Sphagnum papillosum Lindb. and on irrigation ditches. Methane fluxes of both Sphagnum species showed a significant decrease over the study period. This trend was stronger for S. papillosum. In contrast, the estimated CO2 fluxes did not show a significant temporal trend over the study period. The production strips of both Sphagnum species were net GHG sinks of 5-9 t ha(-1) a(-1) (in CO2-equivalents) during the establishment phase of the moss carpets. In comparison, the ditches were a CO2 source instead of a CO2 sink and emitted larger amounts of CH4, resulting in net GHG release of similar to 11 t ha(-1) a(-1) CO2-equivalents. We conclude that Sphagnum farming fields should be designed to minimise the area covered by irrigation ditches. Overall, Sphagnum farming on bogs has lower on-field GHG emissions than low-intensity agriculture.

AB The degradation and transformation of organic carbon (C) in inland waters result in significant CO2 emissions from inland waters. Even though most of the C in inland waters occurs as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), studies on particulate organic carbon (POC) and how it influences the overall reactivity of organic C in transport are still scarce. We sampled 30 aquatic ecosystems following an aquatic continuum including peat surface waters, streams, rivers, and lakes. We report DOC and POC degradation rates, relate degradation patterns to environmental data across these systems, and present qualitative changes in dissolved organic matter and particulate organic matter during degradation. Microbial degradation rates of POC were approximately 15 times higher compared to degradation of DOC, with POC half-lives of only 17 +/- 3 (mean +/- SE) days across all sampled aquatic ecosystems. Rapid POC decay was accompanied by a shift in particulate C: N ratios, whereas dissolved organic matter composition did not change at the time scale of incubations. The faster degradation of the POC implies a constant replenishment to sustain natural POC concentrations. We suggest that degradation of organic matter transported through the inland water continuum might occur to a large extent via transition of DOC into more rapidly cycling POC in nature, for example, triggered by light. In this way, particles would be a dominant pool of organic C processing across the boreal aquatic continuum, partially sustained by replenishment via flocculation of DOC.

AB Over the last decades, Arctic landscapes have experienced intense warming leading to permafrost degradation and rapid ecosystem changes. Active layer thickening, widespread melting of ground ice and thermo-erosion have affected the mobilization of organic and mineral elements. While the carbon and nitrogen cycles are intensively studied, the soil weathering has been less documented. In the present study, we monitored the chemistry of soil capillary and gravitational pore waters, rainfall and stream waters daily during the growing season in two experimental sites under tussock tundra vegetation in the low-Arctic region, in Salluit (Nunavik, Canada). We aimed to investigate the seasonal thaw controls on the evolution of concentrations of major organic and inorganic elements in the active layer (i.e., seasonally thawed surface layers) of two permafrost soils (Cryosols) differing in parental materials: an ombrotrophic bog (i.e., Histic Cryosol) and post-glacial marine sediments continuously waterlogged (i.e., Turbic Cryosol). In the Histic Cryosol, the electrical conductivity was <100 mu S cm(-1) and Cl- and Na+ were the dominant soluble ions originating from atmospheric depositions. In the Turbic Cryosol, decarbonated in the first 40 cm, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were the dominant soluble ions in the capillary water reflecting the dissolution of soil minerals, while Cl- and SO42- dominated in gravitational water, illustrating inputs from uphill. In the two soils, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations as well as Mg/Na and Ca/Na increased with depth. Along summer, the soil pore water chemistry evolved with thaw front and water table depths in the two sites. Particularly in the Histic Cryosol, electrical conductivity, solute concentrations, Mg/Na and Ca/Na ratios increased with the thaw front deepening. Our observations suggest that the active layer thickening and increasing supra-permafrost flow contribution, expected to increase with Arctic warming, could lead to a shift in chemistry of pore waters in organic and mineral permafrost soils, differently depending on permafrost landform settings.

AB Arctic tundra is a globally important store for carbon (C). However, there is a lack of reference sites characterising C exchange dynamics across annual cycles. Based on the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) programme, here we present 9-11 years of flux and ecosystem data across the period 2008-2018 from two wetland sites in Greenland: Zackenberg (74 degrees N) and Kobbefjord (64 degrees N). The Zackenberg fen was a strong C sink despite its higher latitude and shorter growing seasons compared to the Kobbefjord fen. On average the ecosystem in Zackenberg took up similar to-50 g C m(-2)yr(-1)(range of +21 to -90 g C m(-2)yr(-1)), more than twice that of Kobbefjord (mean similar to-18 g C m(-2)yr(-1), and range of +41 to - 41 g C m(-2)yr(-1)). The larger net carbon sequestration in Zackenberg fen was associated with higher leaf nitrogen (71%), leaf area index (140%), and plant quality (i.e. C:N ratio; 36%). Additional evidence fromin-situmeasurements includes 3 times higher levels of dissolved organic carbon in soils and 5 times more available plant nutrients, including dissolved organic nitrogen (N) and nitrates, in Zackenberg. Simulations using the soil-plant-atmosphere ecosystem model showed that Zackenberg's stronger CO(2)sink could be related to measured differences in plant nutrients, and their effects on photosynthesis and respiration. The model explained 69% of the variability of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, 80% for photosynthesis and 71% for respiration over 11 years at Zackenberg, similar to previous results at Kobbefjord (73%, 73%, and 50%, respectively, over 8 years). We conclude that growing season limitations of plant phenology on net C uptake have been more than counterbalanced by the increased leaf nutrient content at the Zackenberg site.

AB Permafrost strongly controls hydrological processes in cold regions. Our understanding of how changes in seasonal and perennial frozen ground disposition and linked storage dynamics affect runoff generation processes remains limited. Storage dynamics and water redistribution are influenced by the seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity of frozen ground, snow accumulation and melt. Stable isotopes are potentially useful for quantifying the dynamics of water sources, flow paths and ages, yet few studies have employed isotope data in permafrost-influenced catchments. Here, we applied the conceptual model STARR (the Spatially distributed Tracer-Aided Rainfall-Runoff model), which facilitates fully distributed simulations of hydrological storage dynamics and runoff processes, isotopic composition and water ages. We adapted this model for a subarctic catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada, with a time-variable implementation of field capacity to include the influence of thaw dynamics A multi-criteria calibration based on stream flow, snow water equivalent and isotopes was applied to 3 years of data. The integration of isotope data in the spatially distributed model provided the basis for quantifying spatio-temporal dynamics of water storage and ages, emphasizing the importance of thaw layer dynamics in mixing and damping the melt signal. By using the model conceptualization of spatially and temporally variable storage, this study demonstrates the ability of tracer-aided modelling to capture thaw layer dynamics that cause mixing and damping of the isotopic melt signal.

AB The behaviour of trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, V, Zn) was studied in five humus-rich streams (dissolved organic carbon = 14-40 mg/L) impacted by acid sulphate soils developed in marine sulphide-bearing fine-grained sediments. During heavy rainfalls in autumn, on which the study focusses, the metals Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn are extensively leached from these acidic soils (pH = 2.5-4.5), while As, Cr, Fe and V are not leached more strongly from this soil type than from areas of till and peat. A speciation experiment, based on anion and cation exchange of the stream waters in the field, showed that (1) the metals Al, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni and Zn are transported in the streams mainly as inorganic cations, (2) Cu exists mainly in cationic form but is also to a significant extent associated with dissolved humic substances, (3) Fe occurs mainly in the anionic fraction explained by organic coating on colloidal Fe oxyhydoxides and (4) the hydrochemistry of As, Cr and V is complex as these elements may exist in several unquantified anionic fractions and to a minor extent in cationic species/forms. Whereas the proportion of acid sulphate soils in the catchments had a large impact on concentrations levels of several elements in the stream waters, these soils did not have a large affect on the speciation of elements in water.

AB Peatland streams typically contain high methane concentrations and act as conduits for the release of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon analysis provides a unique tracer that can be used to identify the methane source, and quantify the time elapsed between carbon fixation and return to the atmosphere as CH4. Few studies - those that have focus largely on sites with bubble (ebullition) emissions - have investigated the C-14 age of methane in surface waters because of the difficulty in collecting sufficient CH4 for analysis. Here, we describe new sampling methods for the collection of CH4 samples from CH4-oversaturated peatland streams for radiocarbon analysis. We report the results of a suite of tests, including using methane C-14 standards and replicated field measurements, to verify the methods. The methods are not restricted to ebullition sites, and can be applied to peatland streams with lower methane concentrations. We report the C-14 age of methane extracted from surface water samples (4-13l) at two contrasting locations in a temperate raised peat bog. Results indicate substantial spatial variation with ages ranging from 400 (ditch in afforested peatland) to 3000years BP (bog perimeter stream). These contrasting ages suggest that methane in stream water can be derived from a wide range of peat depths. This new method provides a rapid (10-15min per sample) and convenient approach, which should make (CH4)-C-14 dating of surface water more accessible and lead to an increased understanding of carbon cycling within the soil-water-atmosphere system.

AB Here we present results from a field experiment in an Arctic wetland situated in Zackenberg, NE Greenland. During one growing season we investigated how dominance of the sedge Eriophorum scheuchzeri affected the below-ground concentrations of low molecular weight carbon compounds (LMWOC) and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in comparison to dominance of other sedges (Carex stans and Dupontia psilosantha). Three groups of LMWOC were analysed using liquid chromatography-ionspray tandem mass spectrometry, i.e., organic acids (OAs), amino acids (AAs) and simple carbohydrates (CHs). To identify the effect of plant composition the experiments were carried out in a continuous fen area with very little between species variation in environmental conditions, e.g., water-table and active layer thickness and soil temperature. The pool of labile LMWOC compounds in this Arctic fen was dominated by OAs, constituting between 75 and 83% of the total pore water pool of OAs. CHs and Ms. The dominant OA was acetic acid, an easily available substrate for methanogens, which constituted >= 85% of the OA pool. We estimated that the concentration of acetic acid found in pore water would support 2 -2.5 h of CH4 flux and an additional continuous input of acetic acid through root exudation that would support 1.3-1.5 h of CH4 flux. Thus, the results clearly points to the importance of a continuous input for acetoclastic methanogenesis to be sustainable. Additionally, Eriophorum had a very strong effect on parts of the carbon cycle in the Arctic fen. The mean seasonal CH4 flux was twice as high in Eriophorum dominated plots, most likely due to a 1.7 times higher concentration of OAs in these plots. Further, the ecosystem respiration was 1.3 times higher in Eriophorum dominated plots. In conclusion, the results offer further support to the importance of certain vascular plant species for the carbon cycle of wetland ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Catchment science plays a critical role in the protection of water resources in the face of ongoing changes in climate, long-range transport of air pollutants, and land use. Addressing these challenges, however, requires improved understanding of how, when, and where changes in water quantity and quality occur within river networks. To reach these goals, we must recognize how different catchment features are organized to regulate surface chemistry at multiple scales, from processes controlling headwaters, to the downstream mixing of water from multiple landscape sources and deep aquifers. Here we synthesize 30-years of hydrological and biogeochemical research from the Krycklan catchment study (KCS) in northern Sweden to demonstrate the benefits of coupling long-term monitoring with multi-scale research to advance our understanding of catchment functioning across space and time. We show that the regulation of hydrological and biogeochemical patterns in the KCS can be decomposed into four, hierarchically structured landscape features that include: (1) transmissivity and reactivity of dominant source layers within riparian soils, (2) spatial arrangement of groundwater input zones that govern water and solute fluxes at reach- to segment-scales, (3) landscape scale heterogeneity (forests, mires, and lakes) that generates unique biogeochemical signals downstream, and (4) broad-scale mixing of surface streams with deep groundwater contributions. While this set of features are perhaps specific to the study region, analogous hierarchical controls are likely to be widespread. Resolving these scale dependent processes is important for predicting how, when, and where different environmental changes may influence patterns of surface water chemistry within river networks.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to reduce the bioavailability of metals in aquatic systems. This study evaluated the effects of DOM from various sources (e.g., Little Bear Lake sediment. Suwannee River, peat noss) and various DOM fractions (humic acids, HA; fulvic acids, FA) on the bioavailability of nickel (Ni) to Hyalella azteca, a common freshwater benthic invertebrate. In particular, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of surficial sediment DOM on Ni bioavailability. Shortterm (48 h) acute toxicity tests with H. azteca conducted in synthetic water demonstrated that the aqueous Ni concentrations required for lethality were greater than what could be significantly complexed by environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC: 0.6-30.4 mg/L). At Ni concentrations sublethal to H. azteca (500 mu g/L), the bioavailability of Ni was significantly reduced in the presence of representative surface water DOC concentrations regardless of DOC source or fraction. DOC fraction (i.e., FA and HA) differentially affected Ni speciation, but had little or no effect on Ni accumulation by H. azteca. Tissue Ni was found to be strongly dependent upon the Ni2+ concentration in the exposure solutions and the Ni:DOC ratio. Overall, the concentration of DOC played a greater role than either DOC source or fraction in determining Ni speciation and hence bioavailability and toxicity to H. azteca. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Planted forests are increasing in many upland regions worldwide, but knowledge about their potential effects on algal communities of catchment lakes is relatively unknown. Here, the effects of afforestation were investigated using palaeolimnology at six upland lake sites in the north-west of Ireland subject to different extents of forest plantation cover (4-64% of catchment area). Pb-210-dated sediment cores were analysed for carotenoid pigments from algae, stable isotopes of bulk carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15), and C/N ratios. In lakes with >50% of their catchment area covered by plantations, there were two- to sixfold increases in pigments from cryptophytes (alloxanthin) and significant but lower increases (39-116%) in those from colonial cyanobacteria (canthaxanthin), but no response from biomarkers of total algal abundance (-carotene). In contrast, lakes in catchments with <20% afforestation exhibited no consistent response to forestry practices, although all lakes exhibited fluctuations in pigments and geochemical variables due to peat cutting and upland grazing prior to forest plantation. Taken together, patterns suggest that increases in cyanobacteria and cryptophyte abundance reflect a combination of mineral and nutrient enrichment associated with forest fertilization and organic matter influx which may have facilitated growth of mixotrophic taxa. This study demonstrates that planted forests can alter the abundance and community structure of algae in upland humic lakes of Ireland and Northern Ireland, despite long histories of prior catchment disturbance.

AB Ombrotrophic peats in northern England and Scotland, close to industrial areas, have substantial contents of potentially toxic metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) and of pollutant sulphur, all derived from atmospheric deposition. The peat sulphur, ordinarily in reduced form, may be converted to sulphuric acid under drought conditions, due to the entry of oxygen into the peats. The consequent lowering of soil solution pH is predicted to cause the release of metals held on ligand sites of the peat organic matter. The purpose of the present study was to explore, by simulation modelling, the extent of the metal response. Chemical variables (elemental composition, pH, metal contents) were measured for samples of ombrotrophic peats from three locations. Water extracts of the peats, and samples of local surface water, were also analysed, for pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and metals. Metal release from peats due to acidification was demonstrated experimentally, and could be accounted for reasonably well using a speciation code (WHAM/Model VI). These data, together with information on metal and S deposition, and meteorology, were used to construct a simple description of peat hydrochemistry, based on WHAM/Model VI, that takes into account ion-binding by humic substances (assumed to be the "active" constituents of the peat with respect to ion-binding). The model was used to simulate steady state situations that approximated the observed soil pH, metal pools and dissolved metal concentrations. Then, drought conditions were imposed, to generate increased concentrations of H2SO4, in line with those observed during the drought of 1995. The model calculations suggest that the pH will decrease from the initial steady state value of 4.3 to 3.3-3.6 during rewetting periods following droughts, depending upon assumptions about the amount of potentially mobile soil S. The pH decreases will be accompanied by increases in concentrations of dissolved metals (Mg, Al, Ca, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) of an order of magnitude or more, depending upon assumptions about the replenishment of soil metal pools by deposition. In the most realistic scenario for present conditions, the severity of pH depressions will gradually decline due to the relatively slow depletion of the soil S pool by droughts. However, the magnitudes of heavy metal pulses will decline quite rapidly (over two or three droughts) because current and future metal deposition is unable to compensate for leaching losses from the soil pools.

AB Humic matter (HM) is the leftover from life and at the same time the source for new life. The resulting complex system with many interactions has become a crucial part for the anthropocene and by this for the survival of mankind. Based on the results of the application of advanced analytical tools, the structures, reactions and interactions of HM are discussed.
   HM was investigated from different water samples (ground water, bog lake, waste water effluent). Fulvic acids (FA) and humic acids (HA) were isolated from a bog lake and from waste water effluent according to the XAD-method described by the International Humic Substances Society. Parameters like dissolved organic carbon (DOC), spectral absorption coefficient at lambda = 254 nm (SAK), AOX (on activated carbon absorbable organically bound halogen) and THM (trihalomethanes) were determined according to ISO standard methods. For additional characterization, size exclusion chromatography coupled with online DOC detection and solid-state NMR were applied. The degradation of HM was studied by heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide. Membrane separation, done as ultra- and nanofiltration, was used to characterize different size fractions of HM.
   The water solubility and hence the omnipresence of HM in aquatic systems opens the door for obtaining well-defined samples for experiments with meaningful results. Information on transport properties and reactivity, derived from the molecular size of HM, was obtained by using membrane filtration at different pore sizes. Photocatalytic degradation of HM was investigated by irradiation of suspensions with TiO2 as catalyst. Small organic acids (e.g. formic acid) were formed before total mineralisation occurred.
   It can be concluded that the properties of HM are well derivable from their molecular data. The resulting character of HM with respect of the human environment seems to be obviously ambivalent and asks for a sound understanding and proper management to support life in a sustainable way.

AB This work describes the hydrochemical composition of thermokarst lake and pond ecosystems, which are observed in various sizes with different degrees of permafrost influence and are located in the northern part of western Siberia within the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones. We analysed the elemental chemical composition of the lake waters relative to their surface areas (from 10 to 106 m(2)) and described the elemental composition of the thermokarst water body ecosystems in detail. We revealed significant correlations between the Fe, Al, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and various chemical elements across a latitude gradient covering approximately 900 km. Several groups of chemical elements that reflect the evolution of the studied water bodies were distinguished. Combining the data for the studied latitude profile with the information available in the current literature demonstrated that the average dissolved elemental concentrations in lakes with different areas depend specifically on the latitudinal position, which is presumably linked to (1) the elements leached from frozen peat, which is the main source of the solutes in thermokarst lakes, (2) marine atmospheric aerosol depositions, particularly near the sea border and (3) short-range industrial pollution by certain metals from the largest Russian Arctic smelter. We discuss the evolution of the chemical compositions observed in thermokarst lakes during their formation and drainage and predict the effect that changing the permafrost regime in western Siberia has on the hydrochemistry of the lakes.

AB We report chromium (Cr) isotope compositions and concentrations (and additional geochemical and physicochemical data) of bedrock, soils and river waters from two geographically distinct basaltic river catchments, the Uruguay River catchment (Uruguay) and the Glenariff River catchment (Northern Ireland, United Kingdom), to investigate the processes that control Cr mobilisation and fractionation during weathering and riverine transport to the sea. Our results show that the Cr isotope compositions of soils are a function of the modal abundance and weathering rates of Cr-bearing minerals. The accumulation of weathering resistant Cr-spinels in the soils of Northern Ireland results in soils which are enriched in Cr and have delta Cr-53 values within the range of local bedrock (delta Cr-53 value of -0.21 +/- 0.12%, 2 sigma, n = 4). By contrast, the more easily weathered Cr-silicates in the bedrock of Uruguay results in greater Cr loss from the soil and a depletion in the heavy isotopes of Cr (with average delta Cr-53 value of -0.32 +/- 0.04%, 2 sigma, n = 4) relative to the local bedrock (delta Cr-53 value of -0.22 +/- 0.08%, 2 sigma, n = 4). The river waters in both catchments are predominantly enriched in the heavy Cr-53 isotope relative to bedrock, although the range and average river water delta Cr-53 values differ significantly between each. The Uruguay rivers exhibit a restricted range in delta Cr-53 values, with a mean of +0.08 +/- 0.06% (2 sigma, n = 5) that represents a positive fractionation of +0.2% relative to bedrock, and is best explained by the unidirectional formation of Cr(VI) during weathering that has not been significantly modified by back-reduction to Cr(III). By contrast, the Glenariff stream and river waters (Northern Ireland) exhibit a wide range in delta Cr-53 values from -0.17 +/- 0.3% (2 sigma, n = 4) to +1.68 +/- 0.3% (n = 1) that appears to reflect the variable redox conditions of the catchment. In general, the values with the lowest Cr-53 enrichment have higher Cr concentrations, the lowest pH, highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and exhibit minimal Ce anomalies that is consistent with a greater proportion of Cr(III) released from more reducing (bog influenced) stream waters. The remaining waters have lower Cr concentrations, lower DOC, and more pronounced Ce anomalies, indicating that a greater proportion of Cr(VI) underwent partial back-reduction to Cr(III) either during weathering, or during riverine transport. Overall, the DOC appears to exert a control on the dissolved Cr speciation and magnitude of isotope fractionation in these river waters. The broader implications of these observations are that the prevailing redox conditions in a river catchment strongly influence the delta Cr-53 value of the river water flux emptying into seawater. Observations for this study need to be considered when developing a framework for interpreting palaeo-climates from the delta Cr-53 values of ancient authigenic marine sediments.

AB Sorption and movement of 2 ionic herbicides (2,4-D and atrazine) by 3 soil materials (Tokomaru silt loam, Egmont silt loam, mine tailings) which were amended with different levels of exogenous carbon (C) materials (poultry manure, sewage sludge, mushroom compost, peat, pig manure) were examined using C-14-labelled compounds. The sorption of herbicides was measured using a batch technique and the movement was examined using soil columns in which a pulse of C-14-labelled herbicide was leached with dissolved organic C (DOC).
   Sorption of herbicides, as measured by the distribution coefficient (K-d), increased with increasing C addition, and varied between the C sources. The difference in the effect of C sources on the sorption of herbicides was related to the difference in the amount of DOC and the pH. The increase in the K-d values per unit C addition decreased with increasing amounts of both the exogenous C addition and the indigenous C in the soil material.
   In a separate study, the addition of DOC to solutions of herbicides prior to sorption measurements decreased the sorption of herbicides, whereas the addition of DOC to soil increased the sorption of herbicides. Column studies have shown that DOC enhanced the movement of herbicides in soils. The effect of DOC on the movement of herbicides varied between the soil materials and may be related to the difference in the sorption of both the herbicides and the DOC.

AB In this study a method for the determination of low total mercury (THg) concentrations in humic-rich natural water samples using cold vapor technique coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (CV-ICP-MS) was developed and optimized. Instrumental parameters of the CV-ICP-MS system were optimized using experimental design software and the amount of oxidizing agent, bromine monochloride (BrCl), adjusted so as to be sufficient for the high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (16 - 113 mg DOC L-1) present in the field samples analyzed in this study. Method performance was assessed using spike recovery tests and analyzing certified reference material (ERM-CA615,groundwater). The detection and quantification limits of the method were 0.7 ng L-1 (3 sigma) and 2.2 ng L-1 (10 sigma), respectively. The field samples were collected from eight peatland forest catchments located in eastern Finland, six of which had been harvested for a study into the potential consequences of forest harvesting on trace metal mobility. THg concentrations in unfiltered, undiluted natural water samples determined using the optimized CV-ICP-MS method were compared with concentrations determined by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer (CV-AFS) based on the EPA method 1631. The results obtained with the two different methods were in good agreement with each other (r(2)= 0.98). The CV-ICP-MS method was found to be reliable for detecting low THg concentrations in humic-rich natural waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon emissions from fluvial systems are a key component of local and regional carbon cycles. We used floating chambers to investigate the CO2 flux from stream water to air () in the Arboleda, a stream in the lowland rainforest of Costa Rica, fed partly by old regional groundwater high in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Drifting and static chambers showed averaging 35.5 and 72.7 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1), respectively, bracketing the previously-published value of 56 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) obtained using tracer methods in this stream. These values are much higher than most data in the literature and reflect a large flux of deep crustal (non-biogenic) CO2 out of the Arboleda, a flux that does not represent a component of ecosystem respiration. Static chambers appeared to overestimate by creating artificial turbulence, while drifting chambers may have underestimated by under-sampling areas of potentially high gas exchange (e.g., riffles around coarse woody debris obstructions). Both static and drifting chambers revealed high spatial heterogeneity in at the scale of 5-30 m reaches. Some observed temporal trends were localized, e.g., among three reaches with repeated measurements through the wet and dry seasons, (1) only the reach located between the other two showed significantly lower during the dry season, and (2) the highest and lowest were consistently observed in the reaches farthest upstream and downstream, respectively. Streams like the Arboleda receiving significant inputs of high-DIC regional groundwater merit additional study as hotspots for C emissions from terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations have been measured in the waters of a semiarid freshwater wetland, the Tablas de Daimiel, Spain, when the system-characterised by variable hydroperiodicity conditions, was completely flooded (February 2011). Fluxes of DOM from the wetland soils to the overlying waters were measured by using a passive diffusion sampler (peeper). Not only dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured but refractory organic matter (ROM, usually known as humic substances) was also quantified using a novel voltammetric method. Fluorescence spectra were recorded to help in selecting the appropriate standard for ROM quantification, test the homogeneity of DOM in the waters and get an indication of their source. The results obtained show a 7-fold increase in measured ROM concentrations from the Giguela River to the outlet, which points to a net exportation of ROM from the wetland and to the existence of an internal source of ROM in the system, probably diffusion from the wetland soils. This hypothesis is confirmed by the flux of ROM from the soils to the water column measured with the peeper and by the common fluorescence characteristics of column and interstitial waters. The smaller increase in DOC concentrations along the wetland, in spite of the higher DOC fluxes from soils, suggests that there is significant turnover of organic carbon (OC) in the water column. The system acts as a major carbon sink but, when flooded, exports,OC as DOM.

AB Concentrations of CO2, CO, and CH4 were measured in beaver pond and lake ice in April 1996 near Thompson, Manitoba to derive information on possible impacts of ice melting on corresponding atmospheric trace gas concentrations. CH4 concentrations in beaver pond and lake ice ranged between 0.3-150 mmol m(-3) and 3.1-56.2 mu mol m(-3), respectively. The corresponding CO concentrations showed no significant differences between the two lakes. They varied between 50 and 250 mu mol m(-3). These CO concentrations are some of the highest determined in any aquatic system. The differences in CH4 concentrations between lake and pond can be explained by the differences in production and microbial oxidation rates between the two systems. No explanation can be given for the similar CO concentrations. Supersaturation factors for CO were 660+/-130 and 630+/-330, and 65-35000 and 0.6-13 for CH4 in the ice of the beaver pond and Troy Lake, respectively. When digging into the beaver pond ice, a continuous flow of bubbles with 0.32+/-0.06 vol% CH4, 2.2+/-0.3 vol% CO2, and 482+/-98 ppb CO coming out of the slash ice for about 20-30 minutes was noticed. Wintertime flux estimates of CH4 and CO showed that they represent at minimum 6.4 % and 2.2 % of that of the summer. It has to be noted that these wintertime fluxes will mostly be released to the atmosphere during the time of snowmelt, thus a limited time period of weeks.

AB We examined the molecular composition of forest soil water during three different seasons at three different sites, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). We examined oxic soils and tested the hypothesis that pH and season correlate with the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We used molecular formulae and their relative intensity from ESI-FT-ICR-MS for statistical analysis. Applying unconstrained and constrained ordination methods, we observed that pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and season were the main factors correlating with DOM molecular composition. This result is consistent with a previous study where pH was a main driver of the molecular differences between DOM from oxic rivers and anoxic bog systems in the Yenisei River catchment. At a higher pH, the molecular formulae had a lower degree of unsaturation and oxygenation, lower molecular size and a higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. These characteristics suggest a higher abundance of tannin connected to lower pH that possibly inhibited biological decomposition. Higher biological activity at a higher pH might also be related to the higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. Comparing the seasons, we observed a decrease in unsaturation, molecular diversity and the number of nitrogen-containing compounds in the course of the year from March to November. Temperature possibly inhibited biological degradation during winter, which could cause the accumulation of a more diverse compound spectrum until the temperature increased again. Our findings suggest that the molecular composition of DOM in soil pore waters is dynamic and a function of ecosystem activity, pH and temperature.

AB Water loss compromises functions performed by wetland ecosystems. Efforts to rehabilitate wetland function typically begin with attempts to reestablish hydrology. These activities are often not monitored, so tools to extract information from them could partly offset the lost opportunity to learn from whole-ecosystem hydrological manipulation. In 2002, groundwater abstraction was lessened by 35% throughout 1700 km(2) of west-central Florida (USA). I assembled a pathway of correlations to project how this hydrological manipulation affected water levels and soil carbon (C) storage in overlying wetlands. Parameter values and residual error in these statistical models were resampled from known variances, thereby propagating uncertainty through the pathway of relationships, and expressing the response of soil C probabilistically. Projected soil C probability distributions were most distinguishable between full and moderate (30% less) abstraction. With more severe abstraction cutbacks, gains in projected soil C became more marginal and uncertain, suggesting that wetland soil C pools are not notably impacted by low-volume groundwater abstraction. Reducing uncertainty in projected soil C will require better understanding the dynamic response of soil C to increases in the amount of time that wetland soil is inundated. The step-by-step error propagation routine presented here is a platform for assimilating information from diverse sources in order to project probabilistic responses of ecosystem function to wetland restoration attempts, and it helps identify where further certainty is most wanted in a pathway of cause-effect relationships.

TI FACTORS AFFECTING THE SOIL SORPTION OF IODINE
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Iodine-129 is an important radionuclide released from nuclear facilities because of its long radioactive half-life and its environmental mobility. Its retention in surface soils has been linked to pH, organic matter, and Fe and Al oxides. Its inorganic solution chemistry indicates I will most likely exist as an anion. Three investigations were carried out to provide information on the role of the inorganic and organic chemistry during sorption off by soil.
   Anion competition using Cl- showed that anion exchange plays a role in I sorption in both mineral and organic soils. The presence of Cl decreased the loss of I- from solution by 30 and 50% for an organic and a carbonated sandy soil respectively. The I remaining in solution was associated primarily with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The loss rate from solution appears to depend on two reactions of I with the soil solids (both mineral and organic) creating both a release to and a loss from solution, and the reaction of I with the DOC (from very low to high molecular weight). Composition analyses of the pore water and the geochemical modelling indicate that I sorption affects the double-charged anion species in solution the most, particularly SO4--. Iodide introduced to natural bog groundwater at three concentrations (10(-3), 10(-1) and 10 meg L(-1)) remained as I- and was not lost from solution quickly, indicating that the association of I with DOC is slow and does not depend on the DOC or I concentration. If sorption of I to soil solids or DOC is not sensitive to concentration, then stable I studies, which by necessity must be carried out at high environmental concentrations, can be linearly extrapolated to radioactive I at much lower molar concentrations.

AB Given the pace of climate change, it is important to better understand dissolved organic matter (DOM) storage and cycling in high-latitude rivers and its subsequent export to the Arctic Ocean. To address this concern, excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) coupled with optical indices were used to characterize the optical properties of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) and colored DOM (CDOM) in five large Arctic rivers over two seasonal cycles. Five PARAFAC components were identified and proved useful indicators for the quantitative and qualitative descriptions of DOM sources and modification processes within Arctic watersheds. In comparing Pan-Arctic relationships between the optical properties and chemical properties of DOM, three components traced terrigenous biomarkers and two components are introduced as potential indicators for microbial processing. Conversely, no individual PARAFAC component could be directly linked to a specific plant source or river and simpler absorbance indices (i.e., a(350)) proved to be better suited to quantify dissolved organic carbon and lignin phenol concentrations. Differences in FDOM character between the rivers could be explained by general watershed characteristics, including vegetation, topography, and hydrology. Based on these differences, the influence of coniferous vegetation on DOM character is most apparent in the Lena and Yenisei Rivers and bog-derived FDOM sources are more important in the Ob River. This study illustrates how increased hydrological connectivity in the Ob catchment and the abundance of lakes within the Mackenzie watershed may influence FDOM concentrations and the microbial processing of DOM within these watersheds.

AB Peatlands extend over vast areas of the northern landscape. Within some of these areas, lakes and ponds are changing in size as a result of permafrost thawing and erosion, resulting in mobilization of the carbon-rich peatland soils. Our aims in the present study were to characterize the particle, carbon and nutrient regime of a set of thermokarst (thaw) lakes and their adjacent peatland permafrost soils in a rapidly degrading landscape in subarctic Quebec, Canada, and by way of fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, production measurements and an in situ enrichment experiment, determine the bacterial characteristics of these waters relative to other thaw lakes and rock-basin lakes in the region. The soil active layer in a degrading palsa (peatland permafrost mound) adjacent to one of the lakes contained an elevated carbon content (51% of dry weight), high C : N ratios (17 : 1 by mass), and large stocks of other elements including N (3% of dry weight), Fe (0.6 %), S (0.5 %), Ca (0.5 %) and P (0.05 %). Two permafrost cores were obtained to a depth of 2.77m in the palsa, and computerized tomography scans of the cores confirmed that they contained high concentrations (> 80 %) of ice. Upon thawing, the cores released nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (from all core depths sampled), and soluble reactive phosphorus (from bottom depths), at concentrations well above those in the adjacent lake waters. The active layer soil showed a range of particle sizes with a peak at 229 mu m, and this was similar to the distribution of particles in the upper permafrost cores. The particle spectrum for the lake water overlapped with those for the soil, but extended to larger (surface water) or finer (bottom water) particles. On average, more than 50% of the bacterial cells and bacterial production was associated with particles > 3 mu m. This relatively low contribution of free-living cells (operationally defined as the < 1 mu m fraction) to bacterial production was a general feature of all of the northern lakes sampled, including other thaw lakes and shallow rock-basin lakes (average +/- SE of 25 +/- 6 %). However, a distinguishing feature of the peatland thaw lakes was significantly higher bacterial specific growth rates, which averaged 4 to 7 times higher values than in the other lake types. The in situ enrichment experiment showed no difference between organic carbon or phosphorus enrichment treatments at day 5 relative to the control, however there was an apparent increase in bacterial growth rates between days 1 and 5 in the soil and the carbon plus phosphorus enrichments. Collectively these results indicate that particles, nutrients and carbon are released by degrading permafrost peatland soils into their associated thermokarst lakes, creating favorable conditions for production by particle-based as well as free-living aquatic bacterial communities. The reduced bacterial concentrations despite high cellular growth rates imply that there is control of their population size by loss-related factors such as grazing and viral lysis.

AB Humic lakes are systems often characterized by irregular high input of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the catchment. We hypothesized that specific bacterial groups which rapidly respond to changes in DOC availability might form large populations in such habitats. Seasonal changes of microbial community composition were studied in two compartments of an artificially divided bog lake with contrasting DOC inputs. These changes were compared to community shifts induced during short-term enrichment experiments. Inocula from the two compartments were diluted 1:10 into water from the more DOC-rich compartment, and inorganic nutrients were added to avoid microbial N and P limitation. The dilutions were incubated for a period of 2 weeks. The microbial assemblages were analyzed by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and by fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. beta-Proteobacteria from a cosmopolitan freshwater lineage related to Polynucleobacter necessarius (beta II) were rapidly enriched in all treatments. In contrast, members of the class Actinobacteria did not respond to the enhanced availability of DOC by an immediate increase in growth rate, and their relative abundances declined during the incubations. In lake water members of the beta II clade seasonally constituted up to 50% of all microbes in the water column. Bacteria from this lineage annually formed a significantly higher fraction of the microbial community in the lake compartment with a higher allochthonous influx than in the other compartment. Actinobacteria represented a second numerically important bacterioplankton group, but without clear differences between the compartments. We suggest that the pelagic microbial community of the studied system harbors two major components with fundamentally different growth strategies.

AB The aim of this paper was to recognize the abundance and frequency of occurrence of neustonic organisms (i.e. bacteria and algae) and accumulation of organic matter in the surface microlayer of three lakes of various trophic status. Water samples of surface microlayer (0.5-0.6 mm) were taken (with Larsson plate) as well as from respective epilimnion layer (0.5 m deep). The samples were collected from shallow, humic (Sphagnum bog) lake (L. Flosek), shallow, eutrophic (L. Zelwazek) and deeper, mesotrophic lake (L. Kuc) in the period May-October during several years. The ratio of the organisms'. density in the surface microlayer to that in deeper (0.5 in) layer was considered as the enrichment factor (Ef). Heterotrophic bacteria accumulation in the surface microlayer was more frequent in the humic lake (75% of samples), than in meso-and eutrophic lakes (64%). Mean Ef, values for bacteria ranged from 1.3 to 1.4. Frequent, but not strong accumulation of dissolved organic matter measured as the absorbance A 254 was noted in the surface microlayer. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measured in automatic analyzer showed much stronger accumulation in microlayer, particularly in humic lake. Concentration of cblorophyll a in the surface microlayer was found as the most fluctuating and the highest mean Ef value was found in the mesotrophic lake (Ef = 6.3). An attempt was undertaken to explain these differences between the lakes in terms of variable ratio between allochthonous and autochthonous production in humic, mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes.

TI Surface Water Processes and Groundwater Flow Within a Hydrologically
   Complex Floodplain Wetland, Norfolk Broads, UK
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Catfield Fen lies on the floodplain of the River Ant,-adjacent to Barton Broad, a flooded 13th century peat cutting in East Anglia, England. There are few studies of the hydrology of floodplain mires so this paper presents the results of a study of the surface and groundwater components of a fen system within the Norfolk Broads region. The study was undertaken as part of a larger study (Gilvear et al., 1993; Gilvear et al., 1994) to ascertain the sensitivity of East Anglian fen systems to groundwater abstraction and pollution. Catfield Fen is a surface-water-dominated system maintained primarily by precipitation and flows to and from the river system. Upward groundwater flows from the Pleistocene Crag aquifer through a discontinuous clay layer to the fen and hillslope inputs also contribute nutrient rich waters to the wetland. Different areas of the marsh receive varying contributions of flow from these various sources so that spatial variations occur in surface water chemistry. The fen is hydrologically complex because a number of open drainage ditches, cut across its surface, act as preferential pathways for water movement. Part of the fen is effectively isolated from direct inundation from riverine flooding by a small embankment; thus defines an 'internal compartment' for which a tentative overall water balance is calculated. Both the drainage ditches and the embankment have modified surface and groundwater flows locally but have not altered the overall hydrological functioning or the water balance of the natural wetland system. The groundwater flow modelling demonstrates the sensitivity of the fen to groundwater abstraction. The results of the overall study suggest firstly that the site is complex and vulnerable to both surface and groundwater abstraction and pollution and secondly demonstrate the complexity and difficulty of investigations of the hydrology of floodplain mires.

AB The Arctic is warming which may potentially affect substrate availability, organic matter decomposition, plant growth, and plant species composition. This may lead to changes in the exchange of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) between the soil system and the atmosphere. Yet the correlations among substrate availability, CH4 production, and net emissions of CH4 have been scarcely studied in arctic wetlands. Presently, the impact of increasing temperatures on CH4 exchange is uncertain as the two existing reports on field warming in arctic wetlands present opposite results. We here report results on how summer warming and shrub removal affect soil water substrate (acetate, formate, oxalate, and dissolved organic carbon) concentrations as well as dissolved CH4 and CH4 emissions in a fen at Disko Island (West Greenland). The peak in dissolved CH4 followed the peak in acetate concentration, and appeared after the peak in CH4 emissions, which indicates a lack of correlation between CH4 production and emissions. The peak in CH4 emissions coincided with maximum gross ecosystem production suggesting that CH4 emissions are closely linked to photosynthesis. This was supported by an experiment with removal of the sedge Carex aquatilis ssp. stans which contributed with up to 77% of the CH4 emitted from the ecosystem. By contrast, shrub removal and summer warming did not significantly affect CH4 emissions, possibly due to the treatments impacting CH4 production more than emissions. This implies that such wetlands may be less sensitive to moderate warming and changes in shrub cover than previously assumed.

AB Climate warming is expected to mobilize northern permafrost and peat organic carbon (PP-C), yet magnitudes and system specifics of even current releases are poorly constrained. While part of the PP-C will degrade at point of thaw to CO2 and CH4 to directly amplify global warming, another part will enter the fluvial network, potentially providing a window to observe large-scale PP-C remobilization patterns. Here, we employ a decade-long, high-temporal resolution record of C-14 in dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) to deconvolute PP-C release in the large drainage basins of rivers across Siberia: Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma. The C-14-constrained estimate of export specifically from PP-C corresponds to only 17 +/- 8% of total fluvial organic carbon and serves as a benchmark for monitoring changes to fluvial PP-C remobilization in a warming Arctic. Whereas DOC was dominated by recent organic carbon and poorly traced PP-C (12 +/- 8%), POC carried a much stronger signature of PP-C (63 +/- 10%) and represents the best window to detect spatial and temporal dynamics of PP-C release. Distinct seasonal patterns suggest that while DOC primarily stems from gradual leaching of surface soils, POC reflects abrupt collapse of deeper deposits. Higher dissolved PP-C export by Ob and Yenisey aligns with discontinuous permafrost that facilitates leaching, whereas higher particulate PP-C export by Lena and Kolyma likely echoes the thermokarst-induced collapse of Pleistocene deposits. Quantitative C-14-based fingerprinting of fluvial organic carbon thus provides an opportunity to elucidate large-scale dynamics of PP-C remobilization in response to Arctic warming.

Peatland ecologists have long known the importance of the paludification process, but it has not been transferred to peatland restoration methodologies. We initiated this study to determine if wetland structure and function could be re-established on two well sites established with mineral fill within a peatland complex. At two well sites near Peace River, AB, the mineral material was lowered to near the water level of the surrounding peatland. We placed 288 plots of 2 m x 2 m in size using a series of fertilizer, water level, cultivation, and amendment treatments and then introduced a suite of wetland plants. Four questions are addressed: - (1) Will locally available peatland vascular plant species establish on these wet, compacted, mineral soils? If so: (2) are species responses affected by these treatments? (3) are plants that we did not introduce in the planting regime (weeds) a concern? and (4) will the surrounding bog water chemistry have an effect on water in contact with mineral soils? Results after two growing seasons are - (1) Carex aquatilis and Salix lutea have all successfully established at both well sites; (2) C. aquatilis plants (ramets) have increased to an average of 58.5 per plot, up from the 16 original genets planted; (3) the plant responses to amendments are not significantly different from the control plots: (4) weed abundance is significantly different among some amendment types; and (5) pad ditch water chemistry is affected by the surrounding bog waters.

AB The impacts of vegetation fires on ecosystems are complex and varied affecting a range of important ecosystem services. Fire has the potential to affect the physicochemical and ecological status of water systems, alter several aspects of the carbon cycle (e.g. above- and below-ground carbon storage) and trigger changes in vegetation type and structure. Globally, fire is an essential part of land management in fire-prone regions in, e.g. Australia, the USA and some Mediterranean countries to mitigate the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires and sustain healthy ecosystems. In the less-fire prone UK, fire has a long history of usage in management for enhancing the productivity of heather, red grouse and sheep. This distinctly different socioeconomic tradition of burning underlies some of the controversy in recent decades in the UK around the use of fire. Negative public opinion and opposition from popular media have highlighted concerns around the detrimental impacts burning can have on the health and diversity of upland habitats. It is evident there are many gaps in the current knowledge around the environmental impacts of prescribed burning in less fire-prone regions (e.g. UK). Land owners and managers require a greater level of certainty on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribed burning in comparison to other techniques to better inform management practices. This paper addresses this gap by providing a critical review of published work and future research directions related to the impacts of prescribed fire on three key aspects of ecosystem services: (i) water quality, (ii) carbon dynamics and (iii) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity). Its overall aims are to provide guidance based on the current state-of-the-art for researchers, land owners, managers and policy makers on the potential effects of the use of burning and to inform the wider debate about the place of fire in modern conservation and land management in humid temperate ecosystems.

AB Southernmost Patagonia, located at the relatively narrow passage between Antarctica and South America, is a highly sensitive region for recording meridional and zonal changes in the pattern of oceanic and atmospheric circulation. The island of Isla de los Estados, situated at 54.5 degrees S, 64 degrees W, east of Argentinean Tierra del Fuego, provides an exceptional possibility, to investigate terrestrial records of atmospheric conditions in an oceanic setting during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. Here we present geochemical and diatom analyses from 10600 to c. 1500 cal BP of one sequence (LGB) with peat, lake sediments and lagoon deposits at the northern coast of the island, and a lake sediment sequence (CAS) 3 km further inland. The data comprise TC, TN, loss on ignition analyses and continuous XRF scanning as well as age-depth modeling based on AMS-C-14 dating on both cores. Diatom analysis of the CAS record complements the geochemical proxies. During the Holocene, our two sites have been impacted by two different forcings: changes in the regional climate regime largely influenced by the varying strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW), while relative sea-level changes affected the deposits of the coastal site. In concert with the onset of the Antarctic thermal optimum, our data suggest fairly warm conditions and the establishment of denser peat and forest vegetation on the island c. 10600 cal BP. Between 8500 and 4500 cal BP geochemistry and diatoms from the CAS record indicate stronger Westerlies at this latitude, which means higher wind speed or higher storm frequency and more precipitation, resulting in more pronounced surface run-off. After 4500 cal BP, the geochemical proxies and large changes in diatom assemblages indicate a decrease in precipitation, weaker winds and possibly cooler conditions, probably as an effect of weaker SHW and/or a latitudinal shift. The depositional environment of CAS changed from gyttja to peat around 1000 cal BP. At LGB, the onset of gyttja sedimentation around 7900 cal BP shows that the former wet land with peat accumulation had become a lake with a fairly rapid sedimentation. The chemical data from LGB imply a gradually increasing marine influence, probably as an effect of both rising sea level and increased impact of storms and maximum high tides. After a marine high-stand during the mid-Holocene, the LGB site returned into a peat bog again around 3400 cal BP. Our data suggest that since then relative sea level first dropped back below present sea level followed by a rise to present day sea level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two lowland lowland catchments in the U.K. were sampled throughout 2010-11 to investigate the dominant controls on dissolved organic matter quantity and composition. The catchments had marked differences in terms of nutrient status, land cover and contrasting lithologies resulting in differences in the dominant flow pathways (groundwater vs. surface water dominated). The Upper Wylye is a chalk stream with a baseflow index of 0.98, draining a catchment dominated by intensive agricultural production. Millersford Brook is a lowland peat catchment with a baseflow index of 0.43, chaining a semi-natural catchment. with heather moorland and coniferous forest Samples were collected weekly between October 2010 and September 2011 from eleven sampling locations. Samples were analysed to determine dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fractions with DOM composition evaluated via the DOC:DON ratio, DOC:DOP ratio, specific UV absorption a1254 nm, absorbance ratio (a(250):a(365)) and the spectral slope parameter between 350 and 400 nm (S350-400). Significant differences were observed in all determinands between the catchments, over time, and spatially along nutrient enrichment and geoclimaLic gradients. Seasonal variation in preferential flow pathways mobil ising groundwater-derived DOM were identified as likely controls on the delivery of DOM in the permeable chalk dominated catchment. Steeper S350-400 values and elevated 0250:03 5 ratios in this catchment suggest material of a lower bulk aromatic C content and molecular weight delivered during the winter months when compared to the summer. DOC:DON ratios were markedly lower in the chalk catchment than the peatland catchment, reflecting the paucity of organic matter within the mineral soils of the chalk landscape, and higher fertiliser application rates. This manuscript highlights that DOM composition varies according to catchment landscape character and hydrological function. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Water extracts from soils of the Barents Sea coast (the Khaipudyr Bay) were analyzed for the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen by the method of high-temperature catalytic oxidation with non-dispersive IR registration; the contents of low-molecular-weight acids, carbohydrates, and alcohols were determined by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry. The mass fraction of inorganic carbon (HCO3-) was measured potentiometrically, and the content of inorganic nitrogen (N-NO3-, N-NH4+) was determined by photometry. In marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols (Arenic or Loamic, Epiprotosalic)), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 0.1-0.8, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.01-0.05 g/kg, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.06 omega(C-org)(H2O) + 0.01, and (C/N)(H2O) = 7-21. The content of individual components does not exceed 20 mg/kg, including carbohydrates (50-90%), acids (10-50%), and alcohols (<3%). In peat horizons of tundra soils (Cryic Histosols and Histic Cryosols), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 4-10, omega(N-org)(H2O) similar to and (C/N)(H2O) = 25-56. Litter and peat horizons accumulate both individual humus components and total dissolved organic carbon. The total weight of the identified substances is 200300 mg/kg, 80-90% of them are carbohydrates, 10-20% are acids, and 0-9% are alcohols. The accumulation of (C-org)(H2O) and (N-NH4+)(H2O) takes place above the permafrost table. It is argued that the ratios of organic forms of carbon and nitrogen in soil water extracts and the content of low-molecular weight organic compounds in soils can be used as indicators of pedogenic processes in the Far North.

AB The development of complete regional carbon (C) budgets for different biomes is an integral step in the effort to predict global response and potential feedbacks to a changing climate regime. Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a similar to 6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20% and 13% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain > 80% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1 +/- 0.1 Tg yr-1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0 +/- 0.1 Tg yr-1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12 +/- 0.06 Tg yr-1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03 +/- 0.01 Tg yr-1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.

AB Given observed trends in the concentration of DOC in surface waters in the northern hemisphere the degradation of DOC to CO2 could represent a major and increasing source of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. However, studies of DOC turnover in rivers have been predominantly based upon mass balance studies and empirical studies have focused upon lakes and estuaries which have far longer residence times than would be the case for transit via rivers. The study measured DOC loss in unfiltered river water samples across an 818 km(2) catchment every month for a year and considered total loss, photo and aphotic degradation as well as the rates of each process. The study found:
   (i) Rate of total DOC change in daylight varied from loss of 30.1 mg C/I/day to an increase of 3.5 mg C/I/day: the average loss was 73% over 10 days.
   (ii) Rate of change due to photic processes varied from decrease of 19.4 mg C/I/day to an increase of 6 mg C/I/day, i.e. net photo-induced production was possible.
   (iii) Activation energy of the degradation was estimated as 2.6 +/- 1.2 kJ/g C.
   (iv) The apparent quantum yield varied from 9.6 to -1.7 mmol C/mol photons.
   (v) Coupling models of total loss of DOC with estimates of in-stream residence times showed that annual loss rates of DOC across the 818 km(2) catchment would be between 48% and 69%, in line with estimates from mass balance studies, implying that in-stream DOC degradation represents a large, indirect source of CO2 emissions from peats and other organic soils.
   (vi) Annual rate of removal was increasing in line with increasing loss of DOC at source, implying that observed DOC trends are leading to increased CO2 emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Measurements of micrometeorological variables were made for two snow-free periods at a Restored vacuum harvested and non-restored (Comparison) section of a peatland in eastern Quebec, Canada. Measurements of evapotranspiration and surface heat fluxes were obtained using an eddy correlation energy balance system at the Restored site and a combination Priestley-Taylor and lysimeter approach at the Comparison site. At the ecosystem scale, the energy, water and gas exchange processes are strongly coupled. Through harvesting, a peatland may lose most of its surface vegetation cover, altering the thermal regime of the peat, while the drier conditions required for the harvesting drastically alters the system's hydrology. The measurements indicate that the adopted restoration practices (blockage of drainage ditches and the spreading of a surface mulch layer) reduce the loss of water from the peat leading to the regrowth of natural vegetation at the Restored site. The Restored site lost approximately 13 and 8% less water to evapotranspiration than the Comparison site in 2000 and 2001, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from agricultural land can have a large impact on the transport of N and phosphorus (P) to surface waters leading to water quality impairment. The speciation of DOM in agricultural grassland soils has received little attention thus far. Quantification of DOM speciation can improve our knowledge of its fate in these soils. Furthermore, the influence of temperature on DOM concentration and composition is still ambiguous. In this study, we determined the concentration and composition of water-extractable organic carbon (EOC), water-extractable organic N (EON), and water-extractable organic P (EOP) before and after incubation of sand, peat, and clay grassland soils at different temperatures (1.5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 20 degrees C) for 35 days. Extracted organic compounds were fractioned in three operationally defined fractions: humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and hydrophilic (Hy) compounds using a recently developed batch fractionation method. Both EON and EOP formed it major fraction of total N and P. Concentrations of EOC, EON, and EOP were different among the sand, peat, and clay soils, but their speciation was remarkably similar. The EOC and EON were mainly present in the hydrophobic form (HA and FA), whereas EOP was mainly present in the Hy fraction. An increase in temperature generally resulted in a decrease of the total EOC, EON, and EOP concentrations, whereas the speciation remained constant. The effect of temperature on the dynamics of DOM is not necessarily related to net changes in pool size of the HA, FA, and Hy fractions. Insight into the influence of incubation temperature on the dynamics of EOC, EON, and EOP can only be achieved when the processes responsible for the consumption and the production of dissolved organic nutrients are quantified.

AB Riverine fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were estimated at 23 sites on two major river systems in NE Scotland, from fortnightly measurements of concentration and flow. The annual flux of DOC and POC increased cumulatively downstream in both the R. Dee and the R. Don. At the lowest, non-tidal site the estimated annual DOC export (95% confidence limits) was 4.1 (+/-2.1) x 10(6) kg per year for the R. Dee and 2.3 (+/-1.3) x 10(6) kg per year for the R. Don. POC exports in the two rivers comprised about 10% of the total organic carbon flux in the R. Dee at 0.3 (+/-0.2) x 10(6) kg per year and 25% in the R. Don at 0.7 (+/-0.5) x 10(6) kg per year. When expressed on a unit area basis, DOC flux estimates were approximately 20 kg ha(-1) per year and POC exports were approximately 1-5 kg ha(-1) per year at main stem sites on both rivers, However, there were considerable variations in fluxes between tributary and headwater sites on the R. Dee. DOC exports ranged from 13.2 to 115.0 kg ha(-1) per year and POC exports were between 6.0 and 85.3 kg ha(-1) per year. In a sample of 11 R. Dee sub-catchments, annual fluxes of DOC and POC both showed a strong positive correlation with the cover of hill peat in the catchment area, which indicates that areas of hill peat are a major source of organic carbon to the river. In the lower parts of the R. Dee and R. Don catchments, POC export rates during non-storm how conditions also appeared to be related to the extent of arable land in the catchment.

AB Bioavailability and accumulation of sediment-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by benthic biota are closely related to their extractability by water or mild aqueous solvents. Nevertheless, PAH accumulation by benthic organisms is sometimes considerably different from predictions based on an equilibrium partition coefficient K-OC between water and bulk sedimentary organic carbon (OC). We present evidence that PAH extractability is strongly affected by the type of OC acting as a sorbent. We compared extractability of spiked [C-14] fluoranthene from a variety of natural and man-made OC matrices, including bulk sediment organic carbon, peat moss, power plant fly ash, diesel soot, petroleum/natural gas soot, coal dust, and carbon black. Artificial sediments were prepared from glass beads amended with equal weight percentages (2%) of nine different types of OC. Amended sediments were spiked with [C-14] fluoranthene and batch-extracted with seawater and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) after 65 and 12 h of equilibration, respectively. Fluoranthene extractability by seawater ranged between 0.03% and 0.9%, corresponding to a 50-fold variation of apparent K-OC, and 0.03-18% for SDS. Correlation between seawater and SDS extraction efficiencies was weak, suggesting differences in the mechanism of solubilization. These results demonstrate that use of a single value of K-OC to predict bioavailability of fluoranthene should be avoided, and that attempts to extrapolate PAH extractability from water-only extraction experiments to aqueous solutions containing surface-active dissolved organic carbon, such as the gut fluids of deposit feeding macrofauna, is very likely to lead to erroneous predictions.

AB Permafrost thaw in the Arctic is mobilizing old carbon (C) from soils to aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere. Little is known, however, about the assimilation of old C by aquatic food webs in Arctic watersheds. Here, we used C isotopes (delta C-13, Delta C-14) to quantify C assimilation by biota across 12 streams in arctic Alaska. Streams spanned watersheds with varying permafrost hydrology, from ice-poor bedrock to ice-rich loess (that is, yedoma). We measured isotopic content of (1) C sources including dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), and soil C, and (2) stream biota, including benthic biofilm and macroinvertebrates, and resident fish species (Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma)). Findings document the assimilation of old C by stream biota, with depleted Delta C-14 values observed at multiple trophic levels, including benthic biofilm (C-14 ages = 5255 to 265 years before present (y BP)), macroinvertebrates (4490 y BP to modern), and fish (3195 y BP to modern). Mixing model results indicate that DOC and DIC contribute to benthic biofilm composition, with relative contributions differing across streams draining ice-poor and ice-rich terrain. DOC originates primarily from old terrestrial C sources, including deep peat horizons (39-47%; 530 y BP) and near-surface permafrost (12-19%; 5490 y BP). DOC also accounts for approximately half of fish isotopic composition. Analyses suggest that as the contribution of old C to fish increases, fish growth and nutritional status decline. We anticipate increases in old DOC delivery to streams under projected warming, which may further alter food web function in Arctic watersheds.

AB Soil organic carbon (C) plays a critical role in supporting the productive capacity of soils and their ability to provide a wide range of ecologically important functions including the storage of atmospherically derived carbon dioxide (CO2). The present paper collates available information on Scottish soil C stocks and C losses and reviews the potential pressures on terrestrial C, which may threaten future C stocks. Past, present and possible future land use, land management practices and land use changes (LUCs) including forestry, agriculture, nitrogen (N) additions, elevated CO2 and climate change for Scotland are discussed and evaluated in relation to the anthropogenic pressures on soil C.
   The review deduces that current available data show little suggestion of significant changes in C stocks of Scottish soils, although this may be due to a lack of long-term trend data. However, it can be concluded that there are many pressures, such as climate change, intensity of land use practices, scale of LUC, soil erosion and pollution, which may pose significant threats to the future of Scottish soil C if these factors are not taken into consideration in future land management decisions. In particular, this is due to the land area covered by vulnerable peats and highly organic soils in Scotland compared with other areas in the UK. It is therefore imperative that soil C stocks for different land use, management practices and LUCs are monitored in more detail to provide further insight into the potential changes in sequestered C and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions, as advised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

AB Sulfur speciation under the influence of sample pretreatment and sewage sludge (SS) application in a continuously SS-amended soil was assessed by wet-chemical fractionation and S K-edge XANES spectroscopy. Distinct differences in S speciation among the following pretreatments including fresh, air-drying, anoxic freeze-drying, oven-drying, and conditioning (incubation at room temperature and 75% of water holding capacity for 2 wk) were detected in both topsoils and subsoils. Air-drying significantly increased available S content but decreased C-bonded S content in the soils compared with anoxic freeze-drying. Oven-drying and conditioning pretreatments showed a similar effect on S fractions to air-drying in the soils but to a lesser extent. X-ray adsorption near-edge structure analysis showed that both reduced and intermediate organic S tended to decrease while oxidized S obviously increased in the air-dried samples. In contrast, the conditioning pretreatment facilitated the transformation of intermediate S into reduced organic S. Continuous application of SS significantly increased total soil S, C-bonded S, and residual S contents but decreased available S content in the topsoil. Meanwhile, XANES analysis indicated that reduced organic S was markedly increased (over 50% of total S) in the SS-amended topsoil. No obvious effect of the application of SS on S speciation in the subsoil was observed except for the facilitated transportation of S into lower depth. Overall, our results suggest that anoxic atmospheres during the entire pretreatment process from sampling to drying, grinding, and analysis is crucial for the accurate speciation analysis of S in soils, and the anoxic freeze-drying is, therefore, highly recommended.

AB When evaluating the success or failure of ecological restoration projects, practitioners need to verify success within the first few years of the monitoring process to apply corrective measures if necessary or to reclaim environmental down payment where required. This could be achieved with ecological indicators, if they can be easily and routinely measured and are representative of the complexity of the restored ecosystems. We used peatlands restored after horticultural peat extraction in eastern Canada to test a methodological approach that predicts restoration success early after restoration implementation. The goal of restoration of these extracted peatlands is to re-establish a moss carpet typically dominated by Sphagnum mosses, the main peat-accumulating plant group in these northern ecosystems. Vegetation in a total of 152 plots in 41 peatlands restored after peat extraction activities and distributed across a span of 600 km was monitored every 2 years since the third year after restoration. The plots were clustered in three restoration outcome categories: Sphagnum-dominated, bare peat-dominated and Polytrichum-dominated, according to their characteristic vegetation composition at the time of the latest survey for each plot (4-11 years since restoration). Second, vegetation composition in the same plots from the earliest survey, 3 years since restoration, and key environmental and management variables such as summer temperature, effectiveness of ditch blockage, season of restoration works and delay in P fertilization were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain the combination of parameters that best discriminated between the restoration outcome categories. LDA correctly classified 71% of the plots of a calibration database (for which 75% of the sectors were used) and 75% of a validation database (for which 25% of the sectors were used) into the three categories. The obtained LDA models can be used to allocate new plots to one of the restoration outcome categories by providing a series of linear equations (classification functions) that are computed from the combination of ecological indicators. One additional and recently restored peatland was used to illustrate application of these equations of the LDA model to predict future restoration outcome and subsequently adapt management strategies. Such a LDA model provides an unequivocal (i.e., one new plot assigned to one and only one restoration outcome category) prediction of success based on multiple but simple, easily recognizable indicators and spares managers the complex task of interpreting many individual predictors for establishing a clear diagnosis.

AB Restoration measures (ditch blocking, bund construction, etc.) were applied to a cutover part of the Boisdes-Bel (BdB) bog peatland in autumn 1999; since then a near complete cover of Sphagnum rubellum (similar to 15 cm) has developed over the old cutover peat, along with a suite of bog vegetation. This research assesses the restored site's (RES) hydrological condition after 10 growing seasons (May 15th-August 15th, 2010) through comparison with an adjacent unrestored site (UNR) and a natural site (NAT) located elsewhere in the peatland. Evapotranspiration (ET) from RES (242 mm) has not noticeably changed since the first 3 years post-restoration (2000-2002) still maintaining lower ET rates than UNR (290 mm). The highest ET occurred at NAT (329 mm), dissimilar to RES despite similar vegetation cover. UNR generates more runoff (37 mm) than RES (7 mm), similar to the initial assessments. However, since the initial assessments the average water table has continued to rise, from -35.3 (+/- 6.2) cm (2000-2002) to -27.3 (+/- 14.9) cm (2010) below the cutover peat surface but still fluctuates predominantly within the cutover peat and not the regenerated Sphagnum. The regenerated Sphagnum at RES has increased the surface elevation by similar to 15-20 cm, and with respect to its surface the average water table was at similar to-42.3 ( +/- 20.9) cm. However, its water table was still lower (and more variable) than at NAT (33.2 +/- 9.0 cm), with respect to the moss surface. Average soil water pressures in 2010 were similar to the early post-restoration condition at depths of 10 cm (-43.0 +/- 12.2 and -44.1 +/- 13.1 mb) and 20 cm (-41.4 +/- 13.0 and -40.6 +/- 10.5 mb) below the cutover surface at RES and UNR, respectively. Volumetric soil moisture contents (theta) at 2.5, 7.5 and 17.5 cm depths were higher in the Sphagnum moss at NAT (0.23, 0.31, and 0.71) compared to RES (0.12, 0.11, and 0.23), where the underlying cutover peat had a relatively high theta of 0.74. The low moisture content in the new moss overlying the relatively moist cutover peat indicates there was restricted connectivity between the two layers. Ten years following the implementation of restoration measures and the development of a near complete 15 cm thick Sphagnum moss layer, further time is required for the moss layer to develop (increase in thickness and bulk density, hence water retention capacity) and more consistently host the water table, so that the average water content more closely mimics NAT.

AB Riparian zones (RZ) are a major factor controlling water chemistry in forest streams. Base cations' (BC) concentrations, fluxes, and cycling in the RZ merit attention because a changing climate and increased forest harvesting could have negative consequences, including re-acidification, for boreal surface waters. We present a two-year study of BC and silica (Si) flow-weighted concentrations from 13 RZ and 14 streams in different landscape elements of a boreal catchment in northern Sweden. The spatial variation in BC and Si dynamics in both RZ and streams was explained by differences in landscape element type, with highest concentrations in silty sediments and lowest concentrations in peat-dominated wetland areas. Temporal stability in BC and Si concentrations in riparian soil water, remarkably stable Mg/Ca ratios, and homogeneous mineralogy suggest that patterns found in the RZ are a result of a distinct mineralogical upslope signal in groundwater. Stream water Mg/Ca ratios indicate that the signal is subsequently maintained in the streams. Flow-weighted concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Na in headwater streams were represented by the corresponding concentrations in the RZ, which were estimated using the Riparian Flow-Concentration Integration Model (RIM) approach. Stream and RZ flow-weighted concentrations differed for K and Si, suggesting a stronger biogeochemical influence on these elements, including K recirculation by vegetation and retention of Si within the RZ. Potential increases in groundwater levels linked to forest harvesting or changes in precipitation regimes would tend to reduce BC concentrations from RZ to streams, potentially leading to episodic acidification.

AB Inorganic aluminum (Al) concentrations are critical for defining the biological effects of acidification. The landscape's role in controlling the spatial variability of Al and its speciation has received only limited attention. We analyzed the speciation of stream Al at 14 sites within a 68 km(2) boreal catchment during spring snowmelt, a period of episodic acidity. Three factors that influenced Al at these sites were landscape type (specifically the proportion of wetland areas), stream pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Forested catchment sites underlain by mineral soils had higher total Al concentrations and greater inorganic Al proportions than catchments with larger wetland areas, despite significantly higher pH. We suggest that this difference results from source limitation of Al in the peat wetlands. The control of Al solubility was dominated by organic complexes, with the organic carrying capacity exceeding Al in the majority of samples. When assessing the inorganic phase, only four percent of the samples were oversaturated with regards to commonly forming secondary Al minerals, with no samples showing supersaturation higher than 10 times with respect to any given solid phase. Inorganic Al rarely exceeded biological thresholds, except for short periods during peak flow in forested areas, despite two-thirds of the streams having minimum pH values below 4.9. Streams with a high percentage of wetland area were associated with lower Al: DOC ratios. The Al: DOC ratios were quite stable in each stream before, during, and after snowmelt, with the exception of isolated spikes in the Al: DOC ratio associated with particulate Al at a downstream site during high flow.

AB The abundant thaw lakes and ponds in the circumarctic receive a new pool of organic carbon as permafrost peat soils degrade, which can be exposed to significant irradiance that potentially increases as climate warms and ice cover shortens. Exposure to sunlight is known to accelerate the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into molecules that can be more readily used by microbes. We sampled the water from two common classes of ponds found in the ice-wedge system of continuous permafrost regions of Canada, polygonal and runnel ponds, and followed the transformation of DOM over 12 days by looking at dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM absorption and fluorescence properties. The results indicate a relatively fast decay of color (3.4 and 1.6% loss d(-1) of absorption at 320 nm for the polygonal and runnel pond, respectively) and fluorescence (6.1 and 8.3% loss d(-1) of total fluorescent components, respectively) at the pond surface, faster in the case of humic-like components, but insignificant losses of DOC over the observed period. This result indicates that direct DOM mineralization (photochemical production of CO2) is apparently minor in thaw ponds compared to the photochemical transformation of DOM into less chromophoric and likely more labile molecules with a greater potential for microbial mineralization. Therefore, DOM photolysis in arctic thaw ponds can be considered as a catalytic mechanism, accelerating the microbial turnover of mobilized organic matter from thawing permafrost and the production of greenhouse gases, especially in the most shallow ponds. Under a warming climate, this mechanism will intensify as summers lengthen.

AB Mangrove peat soils are home to a variety of microbial communities that may play a vital role in system-level elemental cycling. We examined rates of nitrogen fixation and denitrification in benthic microbial mitts on Twin Cays, Belize, a pair of oceanic mangrove islands. A tree-height gradient across the islands created distinct habitats for benthic microbes. Seawater flushing of the benthos and tree height decreased landward from tall, dense trees on the island fringe through a transition zone of high elevation and intermediate tree heights. In the center of the islands, microbial mats with dense communities of cyanobacteria and purple sulfur bacteria covered the benthic surface of shallow ponds and around dwarf trees. Wet-dry seasonality, tidal cycles and elevation controlled the extent of mat exposure to desiccation and UV radiation. Nitrogen fixation was controlled primarily by the sensitivity of nitrogenase to oxygen inhibition, whereas denitrification was limited by oxidant (nitrate) availability. Diel patterns of nitrogen fixation varied with the type of cyanobacteria dominant in each mat. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration influenced both nitrogen fixation and denitrification rates. Redox conditions contributed to variability in mat nitrogen fixation and denitrification response to nutrient addition, while dissolved organic carbon did not, Microbial mat nitrogen cycling likely contributes to the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) limitation patterns observed in the mangrove trees; in dwarf habitats, mats serve as a source of nitrogen via nitrogen fixation, while in fringe and transition habitats, mats compete with the trees for nitrogen via denitrification.

AB A spatiotemporal computation of permafrost decay covering the period from 1957 to 2009 and validated by field investigations was made over a 76 km(2) river catchment straddling the tree line, in the discontinuous permafrost zone, east of Hudson Bay, in order to estimate the amounts of sediments and organic carbon released by thermokarst. Lithalsas and palsas are the dominant permafrost landforms, whereas thermokarst ponds, landslides, active layer failures, and gullies are the main features of permafrost degradation. Results show that 21% of the existing permafrost in 1957 had disappeared in 2009, resulting in a 96% growth of the thermokarst pond cover and a 46 to 217% increase of the number of active erosion landforms. An increase of stream connectivity related with the degradation of permafrost potentially allowed for an increase of sediments and carbon delivery to the main stream by a factor of 1.6. Volume of active landslides and gullies also increased by 12 to 38%, enhancing sediment and organic matter yields. Significant differences in permafrost degradation and in sediment and carbon inputs were observed along an east-west transect, from sites located at the head of the watershed near the tree line to sites located downstream close to the Hudson Bay coast. Thermokarst ponds in the forest tundra area released 2.3 times more sediments and dissolved organic carbon per unit of area in the fluvial system than in the shrub tundra area. Despite these yields by thermokarst, the Sheldrake River catchment currently does not seem to be yielding proportionally more sediments and carbon than a permafrost-free river catchment.

AB Permafrost thawing mobilizes large quantities of organic carbon that was sequestered in Arctic regions over the last glacial cycle. Processes involved in the oxidation of this carbon need to be further assessed to estimate the fraction to be released into the atmosphere. Shallow tundra ponds are sites of active carbon turnover on the landscape and significant sources of greenhouse gases. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from thawing peat into these ponds is exposed to sunlight, with the potential to accelerate its mineralization directly into CO2 or through the production of more labile molecules. We tested the catalytic effect of sunlight on DOM mineralization in tundra ponds formed on organic-rich polygonal landscapes originating from syngenetic permafrost, including a pond exposed to active permafrost erosion. Microbial decay rates, measured as the loss of chromophoric DOM, were similar to photodecay rates (1%-3% d(-1)). Groups of fluorescing molecules were formed through microbial transformation or lost through photolysis at differing rates among studied ponds, with the erosive trough pond presenting a unique response suggesting the involvement of soil microbes. Despite the stimulation of microbial growth under sunlight and the dynamic response of DOM optical properties, the loss of dissolved organic carbon was not significant under any treatment. This suggests that microbial and photochemical mineralization of DOM was slow and potentially substrate-limited during the dry period when ponds were sampled. The static nature of tundra ponds, with their long water retention time, may thus constrain hot moments when water moves and transports carbon on the landscape.

AB The factors affecting the adaptation of downy birch (Betula pubescens) to different environmental conditions were studied in 2002-2003 by measurement of the production characteristics of saplings, which were experimentally planted in contrasting habitats at a cut-away peatland in the Sumava Mts., Czech Republic. These habitats varied in groundwater table depth. Together with this factor, we tested for the effect of shading, using shade cloth, on sapling growth. We conducted a greenhouse manipulative experiment to investigate the growth response of the downy birch saplings to varying groundwater table depths and soil types. We examined whether spatial distribution of naturally established birch stems changes along pronounced moisture gradient represented by transects placed at three distances from draining ditches. In the field, birch plants exhibited higher growth increments as well as higher leaf production under high groundwater table depth. This result is the opposite of the manipulated greenhouse experiment, which showed higher biomass increments for saplings under the low groundwater table depth. This was probably because downy birch, in principle, indicates terrestrification of peat bogs and high water table depth in greenhouse inhibited its growth. In field, birch saplings were probably stressed by drought. Positive shading effect on sapling growth was proven by leaf production measurements. The two term local variance method (TTLQV) revealed two contrasting dispersion patterns, for the birch population at drier and wetter sites of the post-mined peatbog. The aggregation was clear mainly at the drier site with lower abundance of birch plants within each sampled square. Higher abundance of individuals were found in squares of the wetter site, whereas the pattern was random there.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB Slitere National Park in Latvia is home to rich fens with many endangered and threatened plant species. This study aims to address how the hydrological systems affect vegetation biodiversity (cf. Wolejko et al. 2019) in the mire systems of the National Park: the base-rich inter-dune mires and extremely base-rich calcareous fens. Groundwater samples from these areas were collected for measurements of ion composition and natural isotopes of C, H and O. Also, we simulated groundwater flow paths from the highest local topographical point (a nearby sandy plateau) to the sea, and calculated the residence times of these groundwater flows. The results show that the inter-dune mires are supplied by a mixture of local and regional groundwater systems. The groundwater supply at one of the inter-dune mires was dominated by local groundwater flow from adjacent dunes, but we also detected a small input of calcareous water. This dominance of local groundwater may have resulted from the presence of drainage ditches and a small stream that drains into the Baltic Sea. In contrast, the extremely base-rich fens were found to be solely dependent on regional groundwater which is likely to discharge at the plateau foothills due to the presence of fault structures. Thus, the mires in Slitere National Park are not as undisturbed as was previously believed. Drainage may have affected the original hydrological flow paths. Further research on the extent of these changes is recommended to preserve the endangered species and high biodiversity of these fens. Also, in order to trace the origin of groundwater flows, further investigation into the larger landscape beyond the plateau might be required.

AB Analysis of organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively), pH, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4 and Si in similar to 100 large and small rivers (< 10 to <= 150 000 km(2)) of western Siberia sampled in winter, spring, and summer over a more than 1500 km latitudinal gradient allowed establishing main environmental factors controlling the transport of river dissolved components in this environmentally important region, comprising continuous, discontinuous, sporadic and permafrost-free zones. There was a significant latitudinal trend consisting in a general decrease in DOC, DIC, SO4, and major cation (Ca, Mg, Na, K) concentration northward, reflecting the interplay between groundwater feeding (detectable mostly in the permafrost-free zone, south of 60 degrees N) and surface flux (in the permafrost-bearing zone). The northward decrease in concentration of inorganic components was strongly pronounced both in winter and spring, whereas for DOC, the trend of concentration decrease with latitude was absent in winter, and less pronounced in spring flood than in summer baseflow. The most significant decrease in K concentration from the southern (< 59 degrees N) to the northern (61-67 degrees N) watersheds occurs in spring, during intense plant litter leaching. The latitudinal trends persisted for all river watershed size, from < 100 to > 10 000 km(2). Environmental factors are ranked by their increasing effect on DOC, DIC, delta C-13(DIC), and major elements in western Siberian rivers as follows: watershed area < season < latitude. Because the degree of the groundwater feeding is different between large and small rivers, we hypothesize that, in addition to groundwater feeding of the river, there was a significant role of surface and shallow subsurface flow linked to plant litter degradation and peat leaching. We suggest that plant-litter- and topsoil-derived DOC adsorbs on clay mineral horizons in the southern, permafrost-free and discontinuous/sporadic permafrost zone but lacks the interaction with minerals in the continuous permafrost zone. It can be anticipated that, under climate warming in western Siberia, the maximal change will occur in small (< 1000 km(2) watershed) rivers DOC, DIC and ionic composition and this change will be mostly pronounced in summer.

AB Economic development creates challenges for land-use planners in balancing between increasing the use of natural resources and safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. We developed and utilized multi-objective numeric optimization models to analyze the trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES). The approach was used in the land-use planning process in northern Finland when selecting potential peat production sites as a part of the development of the regional master plan. We first quantified Net Present Value (NPV) of peat production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water emissions of peatlands. Then we applied multi-objective optimization to examine the trade-offs between the variables as well as to determine a cost-efficient selection of potential peat production sites, that is, a selection which would simultaneously generate the greatest possible economic returns and environmental benefits. Our results showed that with a relatively small decrease in NPV, a substantial decrease in biodiversity loss and a reduction in water emissions compared to the benchmark level could be attained. However, a significant decrease in GHG emissions resulted in a substantial decrease in NPV. We conclude that it is possible to significantly improve land-use management by applying multi-objective optimization in land-use planning.

Samples were obtained from streams and ditches comprising sub-catchments of the Kiiminki River, Northern Finland. Sample sites included areas of natural mire, areas subjected to moderate disturbance (ditching to enhance forestry), and areas subjected to serious land use change (agriculture and peat excavation). The study employed a 55 day bioassay that measured the biodegradation potential of surface-water DOM. We identified release of modern (mean 6-13 year old) DOM from natural sites, and material aged up to 1,553 years from disturbed sites. The proportion of biodegradable DOC ranged from 4.1 to 17.9 %, and bacterial DOC removal was modelled using twin-pool and reactivity-continuum (beta distribution) approaches. Bacterial growth efficiency ranged from 0.11 to 0.26 between areas of different land use, and these relatively low values reflect the humic-rich DOM released from boreal peatland. Despite the range of land-use types studied, including intensive peatland excavation areas, there was no detectable relationship between the biological lability of DOM and its radiocarbon age.

AB The peat assessed in this study is Sphagnum moss that formed during the Holocene in wetland bogs around Anchorage, Alaska. Undisturbed peat in these bogs has a water content that ranges from 400 to 1,000% and averages 620%. An assessment of this peat's compressibility was made by measuring the water content, specific gravity, and degree of saturation of 10 sample sets obtained from five bogs. At four bogs, this peat had been compressed by either fill or aeolian silt for 50days to 7,500years. At the fifth bog, this peat was compressed under its own weight after being drained with ditches. Statistics were performed to calculate the average and standard deviation of water contents for each sample-set. Based on these average water contents, two characteristic stages of peat compression under a 15 to 70kPa overburden pressure are identified: noncompact compression (Ca=1.2), followed by compact compression (Ca=0.15). The transition from noncompact to compact compression occurs in 20years or less, and around an average void ratio of 3.5. For undisturbed peat, the average settlement ratio (H/Ho) is 0.6. The peat's compression can be interrupted by frost action.

AB The past similar to 40 years have seen a geometric increase (5-7% per year) in the size of the lesser snow goose (LSG; Chen caerulescens caerulescens) population and marked spatial expansion of the area they inhabit within the coastal fen ecotype of Wapusk National Park (Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Canada), raising concerns and uncertainty about the environmental effects of their activities (grubbing of vegetation, soil disturbance, deposition of feces) on the abundant shallow tundra ponds. In this study, we use conventional limnological measurements as well as water and carbon (C) isotope tracers to explore similarities and differences in seasonal patterns of hydrological, limnological, and biogeochemical conditions of 15 shallow coastal fen ponds that currently have minimal (if any) disturbance from the LSG population with one pond (WAP 20) that is subject to substantial LSG activity. Carbon isotope measurements reveal that C cycling at WAP 20 (LSG-disturbed site) is markedly different compared to the other ponds, whereas only small differences were observed in hydrological conditions and concentrations of major nutrients and chlorophyll a of pond water. A mid-summer decrease in C isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) occurred at WAP 20, likely as a consequence of high pond-water pH and intense C demand by aquatic productivity. These conditions appear to have promoted "chemically enhanced CO2 invasion," which causes strong kinetic C isotope fractionation. High C demand at WAP 20 is also suggested by mid-summer C-13 enrichment in particulate organic matter. In contrast, the ponds with little to no LSG activity exhibited expected seasonal C isotope behavior (i.e., C-13 enrichment of DIC) under conditions of increasing productivity when C is in relatively low demand. Small differences in nutrient concentrations may be due to rapid uptake by the benthic mat at WAP 20. Data from the low disturbance ponds also provide baseline information for future studies assessing potential effects of LSG.

AB The present study focuses on two Baltic-type peat bogs in Slowinski National Park, namely that at Zarnowskie and at Kluki, located in the Lake Lebsko catchment and both characterised by a centrally located dome with a very marshy fringe area featuring an emerging marshy coniferous forest (Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetum). The Zarnowskie bog is under active protection. A total of 24 flow barriers were installed in drainage ditches during the years 2006 and 2007. The purpose of these barriers was to put a halt to water outflow. In addition, 30 hectares of young pine forest were cleared in order to decrease loss of water via evapotranspiration.
   Kluki peat bog is only partially protected by Polish law. The lack of efforts to prevent outflow via the canal is due to the fact that the canal is utilised to drain meadows in the vicinity of the village of Lokciowe outside of the national park. Peat formation no longer occurs in this peat bog. The hydrological condition of the bog is catastrophic as a result of its main canal, referred to as Canal C9, which is 2.5 to 3.0 m deep and 10 m wide in places.
   Both peat bogs are monitored for fluctuations in groundwater. Research has shown that changes in water levels fluctuate based on season of the year and geographical location, which is illustrated quite well using the two studied peat bogs.
   The water retention rate of the Zarnowskie peat bog may be considered fairly high and is likely to improve due to protective measures enabled by Polish environmental laws. The water retention rate of the bog is consistently improving thanks to these measures, fluctuations in water level are small and the water level does not drop under 0.5 m below ground level even under extreme hydrometeorological conditions. This yields optimum conditions for renewed peat formation in this area. One potential threat is the Krakulice peat extraction facility, which is located in the southern part of the bog close to the boundary with the national park.

AB The potential impact of diverse inputs of organic matter (hay, maize straw, and peat) on the mobility and bioavailability of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn was examined at laboratory scale for three soils with contrasting properties and for two moisture regimes: field capacity and saturated conditions. Soil solution was characterized for total soluble metals, dissolved soil organic carbon, and ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm. Speciation analyses were performed with WHAM VI. For field capacity conditions, metal mobility increased (Pb>Cu>Zn>Cd) for all soils and treatments compared with controls and was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with dissolved organic matter (r=0.540). Solubilization of organic matter was mostly driven by Al mobilization (r=0.580, p<0.05) and variations in solution pH. The bioavailable pool of metals, estimated as free ion activities, decreased with the increasing occurrence of metalorganic matter complexes, which was accompanied by an increase in solution of highly aromatic organic matter. Soil saturation generally decreased metal mobility and the ratio of metalorgano matter complexes in solution. Consistently, such effects were accompanied by a decrease in the solubilization of organic matter and lower mobilization of Al, Fe, and Mn. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:10271032. (c) 2013 SETAC

AB Long-term monitoring data from eastern North America and Europe indicate a link between increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters over the last two decades and decreased atmospheric pollutant and marine sulphur (S) deposition. The hypothesis is that decreased acidity and ionic strength associated with declining S deposition has increased the solubility of DOC. However, the sign and magnitude of DOC trends have varied between sites, and in some cases at sites where S deposition has declined, no significant increase in DOC has been observed, creating uncertainty about the causal mechanisms driving the observed trends. In this paper, we demonstrate chemical regulation of DOC release from organic soils in batch experiments caused by changes in acidity and conductivity (measured as a proxy for ionic strength) associated with controlled SO(4)2- additions. DOC release from the top 10 cm of the O-horizon of organo-mineral soils and peats decreased by 21-60% in response to additions of 0-437 mu eq SO(4)2- l-1 sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and neutral sea-salt solutions (containing Na+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO(4)2-) over a 20-hour extraction period. A significant decrease in the proportion of the acid-sensitive coloured aromatic humic acids (measured by specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) at 254 nm) was also found with increasing acidity (P < 0.05) in most, but not all, soils, confirming that DOC quality, as well as quantity, changed with SO(4)2- additions. DOC release appeared to be more sensitive to increased acidity than to increased conductivity. By comparing the change in DOC release with bulk soil properties, we found that DOC release from the O-horizon of organo-mineral soils and semi-confined peats, which contained greater exchangeable aluminium (Al) and had lower base saturation (BS), were more sensitive to SO(4)2- additions than DOC release from blanket peats with low concentrations of exchangeable Al and greater BS. Therefore, variation in soil type and acid/base status between sites may partly explain the difference in the magnitude of DOC changes seen at different sites where declines in S deposition have been similar.

AB The polarity and molecular weight of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important factor determining the treatability of water for domestic supply. DOM in surface water and groundwater is comprised of a mixture of carbon with varying molecular weight ranges, with its composition driven by DOM sources and processing. Here, we present the largest dataset of chromatographic DOM in surface and groundwater samples (n = 246) using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). Our data represents four categories (surface water, hyporheic zone water, local groundwater, and regional groundwater) from five different sites across Australia. In all environments, high molecular weight hydrophilic DOM such as biopolymers (BP) and humic substances (HS) are present in surface waters and are processed out of groundwater as it moves from surface water and hyporheic zones into shallow local groundwater and deeper regional groundwaters. This results in a higher percentage of low molecular weight neutrals (LMWN) and hydrophobic organic carbon (HOC) in deeper regional groundwaters. Our findings indicate that the presence of sedimentary organic matter strongly influence the character of surface and groundwater DOM, resulting in groundwater with higher HS aromaticity and molecular weight, and reduced percentage of LMWNs. We also observe highly variable hydrophilic / HOC ratios in groundwater at all sites, with 9.60% and 25.64% of samples at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and non-sedimentary peat sites respectively containing only hydrophilic dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We identify average hydrophilic / HOC ratios of 4.35 +/- 3.76 and 7.53 +/- 5.32 at sites containing sedimentary peat layers and non-sedimentary peat sites respectively where both hydrophilic DOC and HOC are present. Overall our results suggest that fractured rock and alluvial aquifers in sedimentary organic carbon poor environments may contain DOC which is better suited to ozonation, biologically activated carbon filtration powdered activated carbon, suspended ion exchange treatment or magnetic ion exchange resin since DOC is more hydrophilic and of lower molecular weight and lower aromaticity. Aquifers located near sedimentary organic matter layers may benefit from pre-treatment by coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation and sand filtration which have high removal efficiency for high molecular weight and polar compounds.

AB The Bois-des-Bel Sphagnum peatland (Riviere du Loup, QC) was restored in 1999 after 20 years of abandonment. Restoration work included not only the blockage of drainage ditches, but also the reintroduction of plant material including Sphagnum remains. Following restoration, the physicochemical and microbial characteristics (biomass, activity and composition) of the peat were analysed. The goal was to investigate the functional status of the restored ecosystem. The high N:P (> 20) and N:K (> 15) ratios indicated possible K and P deficiencies in the restored and the cutover sites, which is mainly associated with the intense leaching and the high degree of decomposition of the peat in these sites. The concentrations of NH4+, P and K in the top layer of the restored site were closer to those of the natural site, which indicated a possible effect of restoration on the physicochemistry of the restored site. Microbial biomass values derived from the FE technique followed a gradient natural > restored > cutover through the profile, which was not the case with the SIR technique. Values from SIR varied overall between 0.19 and 4.88 mg C g(-1) and were significantly higher in the natural site. The natural peatland site had significantly (P < 0.05) greater cumulative C-CO2 production (surface aerobic: 4.5-8.7 mu g C-CO2 g(-1) h(-1)). The poor organic matter quality was the main explanation for the low respiration rates of the surface layer in the restored and the cutover site. All CO2 respiration data were plotted against time and the resulting curves were successfully fitted to a global kinetic model. Methane production was detected at low but measurable rates in the natural and the restored samples, but not in the cutover peat. Overall, the results confirmed the existence of a lag between the positive response of vegetation to restoration and that of the microbial compartment. This study also pointed out that some physicochemical dysfunctions remained even after three growing seasons following restoration in the subsurface horizons studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Associations between catchment characteristics (altitude, slope, proportion of peatland, site fertility, total stem volume, and its distribution among the main tree species), climatic drivers (temperature sum, latitude, precipitation and runoff) and atmospheric deposition and concentrations and export of C, N, P and Fe in 21 unmanaged boreal catchments (0.07 to 14km(2)) were examined in data sets spanning 3 to 32 years. In the entire data base including catchments from southernmost Finland to the Arctic Circle, N and P concentrations were associated with climatic drivers and deposition, while a catchment characteristic, peatland percentage, reflecting topography and site fertility was the best predictor for TOC (total organic carbon) and total Fe concentrations and export. In a subgroup of 18 catchments located in similar climatic conditions and low N deposition in eastern Finland (< 600 kg N km(-2) yr(-1)), peatland percentage accounted for 52-75% of the export of TOC, TN (total nitrogen), TON (total organic nitrogen), NH4-N and total Fe, while slope was the best predictor of TP (total phosphorus) export (r(2) = 0.56, p < 0.001). Furthermore, among these 18 catchments TOC export accounted for as much as 95 % of the variance in TON export, and 61-73% of the variance in NH4-N, total Fe and TP export. Total stem volume of the tree stands and their distribution between tree species and vegetation types were not important predictors for concentrations/export. The peatland percentage of the 21 catchments ranged widely, from 0 to 88 %, with an average value of 34 % as in entire Finland. Consequently, among the 21 catchments there was also a large variability both in average TOC and pH, 1.2-30 mg l(-1) and 4.2-7.1, respectively. The average annual TOC export was 6,200 kg km(-2) yr(-1), significantly lower values were recorded for the export of TN, TP and total Fe (130, 5 and 280kg km(-2) yr(-1), respectively). N and P export was mainly in an organic form. The TIN (total inorganic N) proportion averaged 13 % and elevated NO3-N export occurred only in fertile, high pH sites in southernmost Finland, where stream C/N ratio was lowest. On average, 97% of the TOC, 94 % of the TN and 79 % of the TP was in a dissolved form.

AB Modeling hydrological processes in certain peats requires a detailed understanding of short-term changes in soil volume and it's influence on the system's hydraulic properties. A study of cutover sites abandoned for 7-years (H92) and 2-years (H97), and an undisturbed section of the Lac Saint-Jean (LSJ) cutover bog was conducted to characterize peat volume changes and its associated hydrological behaviour. Shrinkage and compression accounted for 96-97% of seasonal volume change. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) varied linearly with peat compression; a I cm decrease in peat thickness causing a 5.2 cm d(-1) decrease in K-S at H92, and a 1.4 cm d(-1) decrease in K-S at H97. A 2-6% seasonal decrease in saturated volumetric moisture content (theta(S)) at the cutover sites was partly due to soil compression, although the development of CH4 bubbles possibly affected moisture content. In the unsaturated zone moisture retentivity (theta-Psi) was seasonally transient due to the shifting soil structure. The greater volumetric response to a change in water storage of the more porous and less decomposed peat at H97 indicates a long-term decreasing trend in peat compressibility due to irreversible losses in pore volume. Deterioration of high water storage and low water retention properties at H92 suggests that cutover sites abandoned for longer periods will become increasingly hostile to Sphagnum recolonization despite the blockage of drainage ditches.

ID FOREST SITES; DYNAMICS; STAND
AB Recent studies indicate that the most important characteristics affecting the bearing capacity of pine bogs are tree volume and the strength and moisture content of the uppermost layers of moss. From a forest operations point of view it would, therefore, be essential to understand to what extent these properties vary and what the possibilities are to predict these properties prior to operations. The aim of this study was to investigate spatial variation of a basal area, soil strength and moisture content, as well as their co-variation, of ditched pine bogs in Southern Finland. The basal area is at its highest close to the ditch and to certain extent decreases with increasing distance from the ditch. The mass of living roots logically had significant correlation with the shear strength. The relationship between the shear strength and the mass of living roots confirms the applicability of spiked shear vane as a reliable tool in assessing the bearing capacity of peat soil. Both the closest trees and distance to the nearest ditch are significant predictors of volumetric water content in the topmost peat layers.

AB The effect of energy forestry on water balance was quantified for a peat bog in central Sweden. An irrigated plantation containing a mixture of Salve, Betula and Alnus was compared over a 3-year period with a natural bog as a control area. The groundwater level and the soil water storage decreased in the cultivated area relative to the control area. Runoff during June-August was generally higher in the cultivated area, mainly in response to irrigation and ditching, which altered runoff dynamics. In September the runoff rate at the cultivated area was lower, owing to the deeper groundwater level and to the larger soil water deficit that occurred prior to the autumn rains. At the cultivated area, about 30% more snow was trapped by the stems and the frost depth was 4 cm shallower. Exapotranspiration increased by 70 mm over the period June-September compared with the undisturbed area.

ID RESTORATION
AB Mosaic fen communities with many rare plant species were outcompeted by fast-growing bryophyte stands (Sphagnum flexuosum/Sphagnum fallax and Polytrichum commune). Eutrophication and acidification were the main causes. Management experiments were carried out to set back this succession by restoring the former abiotic conditions (high pH, low nutrients). The management options investigated were: sod removal, lime application, drainage improvements (digging ditches and trenches) and combinations of sod cutting and liming, respectively, with drainage improvements.
   Four pilot projects are discussed, one in the brackish (oligohaline) peat area, one freshwater site with floating Carer-dominated fens and two freshwater sites with purple-moor grassland (Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum) in the holocenic peatlands of The Netherlands. Plant species, soil and water chemistry were monitored.
   The evaluation after five years showed that some of the desired plant species had returned, e.g. Viola palustris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, whereas others had increased in cover. e.g. Scirpus lacustris spp. tabernaemontani (brackish site), Pedicularis palustris, Calliergonella cuspidata (fen site) and Gentiana pneumonante and Carex panicea (C. dissecti-Molinietum peatland). This happened, however, only in restricted strips along trenches and ditches. In the combined measure of drainage improvement and sod cutting, the Sphagnum species declined permanently, but after sod cutting only, they recovered within three years to the previous cover of ca. 80%. The sod-cutting measure and the control treatment showed no differences in the presence of a rain water lens, whereas drainage and combination treatments showed narrow (0.5-2 m wide) zones with intrusion of surface water. Soil and water pH and Electric Conductivity (EC) showed a sharp decrease within 0.5 m from the trenches (pH from ca. 6 to ca. 4). Also the cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ and the anions Cl- and SO42- showed this sharp decline.
   Applying lime to initiate a rapid rise of the pH was only successful in combination with drainage where water conditions had been improved and the peatmoss carpet had been removed. Remarkable was that the Sphagnum carpet neutralised 1500 kg ha(-1) within 3-6 month in the liming treatment of intact vegetation.
   In conclusion: rehabilitation was successful only in areas where the top water layer was removed by drainage through trenches. This effect occurred within narrow strips bordering the trenches, not in vast areas due to the enormous resistance of peat against through flow and the floating character of the fen.

AB Climate change has resulted in warmer soil temperatures, earlier spring thaw and later fall freeze-up, resulting in warmer soil temperatures and thawing of permafrost in tundra regions. While these changes in temperature metrics tend to lengthen the growing season for plants, light levels, especially in the fall, will continue to limit plant growth and nutrient uptake. We conducted a laboratory experiment using intact soil cores with and without vegetation from a tundra peatland to measure the effects of late freeze and early spring thaw on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, methane (CH4) emissions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (N) leaching from soils. We compared soil C exchange and N production with a 30 day longer seasonal thaw during a simulated annual cycle from spring thaw through freeze-up and thaw. Across all cores, fall N leaching accounted for similar to 33% of total annual N loss despite significant increases in microbial biomass during this period. Nitrate(NO3-) leaching was highest during the fall (5.33 +/- 1.45 mgNm(-2) d(-1)) following plant senescence and lowest during the summer (0.43 +/- 0.22 mg Nm(-2) d(-1)). In the late freeze and early thaw treatment, we found 25% higher total annual ecosystem respiration but no significant change in CH4 emissions or DOC loss due to high variability among samples. The late freeze period magnified N leaching and likely was derived from root turnover and microbial mineralization of soil organic matter coupled with little demand from plants or microbes. Large N leaching during the fall will affect N cycling in low-lying areas and streams and may alter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem nitrogen budgets in the arctic.

AB Research on the ionic chemistry of rivers and weathering types provides the basis for elucidating the dynamics of river chemistry and exploring carbon cycling in river systems. There is a lack of water chemistry study in the river systems in the Tibet Plateau, especially in the streams/rivers flowing from and through glaciers and permafrost. Samples in the rivers flowing through different land covers (lakes, glaciers, permafrost, grasslands, peatlands) were collected in different months (April, June, August and October) in 2016, covering various hydrological regimes. The temporal and spatial dynamic variations of major ions and the underlying causes were explored. The results revealed that in the headwater region Ca2+ and HCO3- were the dominant ions, derived primarily from the dissolution of carbonatites and evaporates. However, the concentrations of ions from different land covers were vastly different.The high concentrations of Na+ and K+ in the lakes sample were mainly affected by evaporation and precipitation. The acid deposition caused by atmospheric pollutants resulted in high concentration of SO42- in glacial and permafrost streams. K+ concentration was high in the grassland region with frequent agricultural activities such as the planting and fertilization of highland barleys that applied nitrogen and potassium fertilizers. Although Total Dissolved Load (TDS) was higher for the lakes and streams/rivers from glaciers and permafrost, and its average (287.28 +/- 40 mg/L) over the headwater region was lower than that in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River because of low temperature. The current study provided the basis of and reference for the overall water chemistry characteristics and carbon cycling processes of the entire Yellow River.

AB Accurate soil organic carbon (SOC) maps are needed to predict the terrestrial SOC feedback to climate change, one of the largest remaining uncertainties in Earth system modeling. Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to >3000 Pg of C within the top 1m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal water sheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 PgC(to 1m) for the study region, 22% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 +/- 111 Mg C ha(-1) fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11-33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates fromtwo spatially explicit global products (Pearson's correlation: rho = .0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest. In sum our study demonstrates that CTR ecosystems represent amoisture-dependent hotspot for SOCstorage at mid-latitudes.

AB Constrained nutrient supplies to plants grown in calcareous mineral soils are expected to diminish faster under a climate change scenario; therefore, we examined the potato vegetative and physiological responses to potassium (K) humate soil amendment applied in addition to the recommended doses of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizers. Hypothetically, K-humate regulates or improves NPK soil supplies and plant uptakes and hence, growth parameters of potato. Field experiments were conducted on potato (cv. Cardinal) grown at the Vegetable Research Farm, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan for two autumns (2010-2011). We used randomized complete block design with three repeats each of the NPK (0, 50, 75 and 100% of recommended dose: 120-80-80 kg ha(-1)) and K-humate (0, 8, 12 and 16 kg ha(-1); 30% K) treatments. Individual soil NPK or K-humate application significantly improved (p <= 0.05) leaf chlorophyll content, final plant height, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance (S-c) and water-use-efficiency (WUE). We observed a significant interaction between NPK and K-humate for explaining additional significant improvements in these parameter values (except S-c; leaf chlorophyll 23%, plant height 41%, photosynthetic rate 34%, WUE 37%) as well as those of the number of leaves (55%) and leaf area (38%) per hill, and transpiration rate (27%). However, leaf chlorophyll content values in responses to 75 and 100% recommended doses of NPK did not differ significantly. Therefore, we conclude that K-humate can be used in calcareous soils in addition to the NPK fertilizer doses to mitigate the adverse effects of calcareousness (responsible for constraining the NPK uptake) by regulating the NPK soil supplies and plant uptakes, which improve potato vegetative and physiological growth parameters.

AB Light-absorbing organic carbon aerosol - colloquially known as brown carbon (BrC) - is emitted from combustion processes and has a brownish or yellowish visual appearance, caused by enhanced light absorption at shorter visible and ultraviolet wavelengths (0.3 mu m less than or similar to lambda less than or similar to 0.5 mu m). Recently, optical properties of atmospheric BrC aerosols have become the topic of intense research, but little is known about how BrC deposition onto snow surfaces affects the spectral snow albedo, which can alter the resulting radiative forcing and in-snow photochemistry. Wildland fires in close proximity to the cryosphere, such as peatland fires that emit large quantities of BrC, are becoming more common at high latitudes, potentially affecting nearby snow and ice surfaces.
   In this study, we describe the artificial deposition of BrC aerosol with known optical, chemical, and physical properties onto the snow surface, and we monitor its spectral radiative impact and compare it directly to modeled values. First, using small-scale combustion of Alaskan peat, BrC aerosols were artificially deposited onto the snow surface. UV-Vis absorbance and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of snow samples were measured for samples with and without artificial BrC deposition. These measurements were used to first derive a BrC (mass) specific absorption (m(2) g(-1)) across the UV-Vis spectral range. We then estimate the imaginary part of the refractive index of deposited BrC aerosol using a volume mixing rule. Single-particle optical properties were calculated using Mie theory, and these values were used to show that the measured spectral snow albedo of snow with deposited BrC was in general agreement with modeled spectral snow albedo using calculated BrC optical properties. The instantaneous radiative forcing per unit mass of total organic carbon deposited to the ambient snowpack was found to be 1.23 (+0.14/-0.11) W m(-2) per part per million (ppm). We estimate the same deposition onto a pure snowpack without light-absorbing impurities would have resulted in an instantaneous radiative forcing per unit mass of 2.68 (+0.27/-0.22) W m(-2) per ppm of BrC deposited.

AB Most of the once ecologically valuable and widespread peatlands in Western Europe as well as in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (North-Eastern Germany) have been drained in the course of the intensification of agricultural land use. Peat degradation and mineralisation frequently caused high nitrate-nitrogen (NO3- -N) tosses, white re-wetting may lead to elevated phosphorus concentrations in the Porewater. High concentrations of NO3--N and other solutes in a ditch draining a catchment (85 ha) dominated by degraded peatland under intensive grassland use gave reason to investigate the relationship between the spatial and temporal variability of the shallow groundwater quality on the one hand and soil properties, topography and hydrological dynamics on the other hand. Therefore, in addition to the ditch, three transects of dipwells were sampled and soil samples were taken along the transects at a high spatial resolution. Soil organic carbon C-org and total nitrogen N-t contents varied considerably from 0.8% to 40.9% and 0.08% to 2.87%, respectively. A trend surface analysis (TSA) of these soil properties showed a strong trend depending on the ground elevation and the distance to the adjacent drainage ditch, reflecting both a transition from mineral to organic soils and differences in peat formation and degradation connected to the topography and, consequently, to the depth to the groundwater table. Semivariogram analysis was performed using the normally distributed residuals of the TSA and showed for each transect a strong spatial dependence and short (5-26 m) ranges. If possible, soil sampling in peatlands should be conducted at short distance sampling intervals. The patterns of groundwater solute concentrations were complex. They were spatially and temporally very variable between as welt as within the transects, thus proving that a few groundwater samples are insufficient for a representative characterisation of the peatland status and for an evaluation of possible environmental impacts or potential consequences of re-wetting. Groundwater concentrations ranged from 0 to 65.4 mg l(-1) NO3--N and 0-1.95 mg l(-1) P-t, while during the same period, ditch water concentrations of 0-15.9 mg l(-1) NO3--N and 0.05 to 0.44 mg l(-1) P-t, respectively, were measured. Factor analysis of groundwater concentrations, topographical data, hydrological conditions and soil properties led to the identification of five factors explaining up to 80% of the observed variance of the data: (i) topography and soil chemical properties, (ii) biogeochemical processes, (iii) drainage effects, (iv) climatic effects and (v) dilution effects.

AB Soil active organic carbon responds quickly to soil disturbances and is a sensitive indicator of early changes in soil organic carbon (SOC). In order to identify the differences in the distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), SOC and their changes as affected by vegetation degradation degree along water gradient in wetland, we analyzed DOC, LFOC, and SOC in the 0-100 cm soil layer under four vegetation degradation degrees: non-degradation (ND), lightly degradation (LD), moderately degradation (MD) and heavily degradation (HD). The results showed that soil DOC, LFOC and SOC in the 0-100 cm layer of ND wetland was significantly higher than the other three degradation levels. DOC, LFOC and SOC contents decreased with increasing soil depth under the four degradation degrees and the contents of soil DOC, LFOC and SOC were mainly concentrated in the soil surface (0-20 cm). The DOC, LFOC, and SOC contents in the 0-20 cm layer under all four degradation levels showed obvious seasonal changes, while the DOC, LFOC, and SOC contents in the 20-100 cm layer showed little fluctuation over the plant growing season. There was a significant positive correlation between soil DOC and SOC, and between LFOC and SOC, with correlation coefficients of 0.948 and 0.911, respectively. There was also a very significant correlation between DOC and LFOC(R-2 = 0.904). Soil DOC and LFOC in the 0-100 cm layer under the four degree of degradation were linearly correlated with SOC. While there was a linear correlation between DOC and LFOC in the non-degradation wetland soils, DOC and LFOC in the three degradation soils correlated exponentially correlated with SOC.

AB Observations of increased water colour have been made in lakes and rivers all across the northern mid-latitudes of Europe and North America, particularly during the last 10-20 yr. This water browning or brownification has been attributed to the increased organic carbon concentrations due to climate change and decreased add atmospheric deposition. Given that iron (Fe) may also increase water colour, the contribution of Fe to water brownification has received small attention. Our aim was to study the temporal trends of Fe in forested headwater catchments in eastern Finland, where an increasing air temperature and total organic carbon (TOC) trend had been observed in an earlier study. We found a statistically significant increasing trend also in stream water Fe concentrations and a strong correlation between the trends of TOC and Fe. The average increase in TOC and Fe concentrations between 1995 and 2006 was 0.5 mg l(-1) yr(-1) (2.5%), and 34.6 mu g 1(-1) yr(-1) (3.5%), respectively. These results indicate that the increased water colour or brownification in Northern Europe may not only be due to increased concentrations of organic matter but also increased concentrations of Fe. The change in precipitation and temperature conditions, particularly during late autumn and early winter periods, appeared to be the main environmental factor behind increasing Fe trends. The strong correlation between the trends of Fe and TOC indicated that the increased Fe-organic matter complexation is the mechanism behind increasing Fe trends, but further research is needed to assess the chemical forms of increased Fe that coupled with increased TOC concentrations would enhance water brownification.

AB The chemical composition of thermokarst lake ecosystem components is a crucial indicator of current climate change and permafrost thaw. Despite high importance of macrophytes in shallow permafrost thaw lakes for control of major and trace nutrients in lake water, the trace element (TE) partitioning between macrophytes and lake water and sediments in the permafrost regions remains virtually unknown. Here we sampled dominant macrophytes in thermokarst lakes of discontinuous and continuous permafrost zones in the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL) and measured major and trace elements in plant biomass, lake water, lake sediments and sediment porewater. All six plant species (Hippuris vulgaris L. Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb. Comarum palustre L. Ranunculus spitzbergensis Hadac, Carex aquatitis Wahlenb s. str., Menyanthes trifoliata L.) sizably accumulated macronutrients (Na, Mg, Ca), micronutrients (B, Mo, Nu, Cu, Zn, Co) and toxicants (As, Cd). Accumulation of other trace elements, including rare earth elements (REE), in macrophytes relative to pore waters and sediments was highly variable among species. Using miltiparametric statistics, we described the behavior of TE across two permafrost zones and identified several group of elements depending on their sources in the lake ecosystems and their affinity to sediments and macrophytes. Under future climate warming and shifting the permafrost border to the north, we anticipate an increasing uptake of heavy metals and lithogenic low mobile elements such as Ti, Al, Cr, As, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ga, Zr, and REEs by macrophytes in the discontinuous permafrost zone and Ba, Zn, Pb and Cd in the continuous permafrost zone. This may eventually diminish transport of metal micronutrients and geochemical tracers from soils to lakes and rivers and further to the Arctic Ocean. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this laboratory study using microcosms with seedlings of silver birch (Betula pendula), we explored whether Cognettia sphagnetorum (Enchytraeidae) can retain its important role of accelerating decomposition processes in soils and stimulating primary production under disturbance. We established systems with or without wood ash amendment (first-order disturbance) in the soil, either in the presence or absence of C. sphagnetorum. To test whether the systems treated with wood ash are more sensitive to an additional disturbance than the ash-free systems, the microcosms were later on disturbed by drought. To determine the influence of two disturbances on the enchytraeids and populations of other fauna, and the possible changes in the system functioning, measurements were made of the growth of birch seedlings, foliar N concentration, composition and biomass of soil microbial communities and leaching of N and dissolved organic carbon from the microcosms. Both wood ash application and drought exerted a clear negative influence on the populations of C. sphagnetorum. However, populations of this species were very resilient and recovered rapidly after drought in the ash-free soils. In the ash-free soils C. sphagnetorum tended to improve birch growth, increased the N content of the birch leaves, and decreased the root to shoot ratio. However, in the ash-treated soils enchytraeids had negative effects on these parameters. C. sphagnetorum impacted on neither N and C leaching nor soil microbes, whereas wood ash decreased microbial biomasses and changed their community structure (as determined by phospholipid fatty acids method and denaturing gel electrophoresis) and substrate utilisation potential (Biolog method). It was concluded that C. sphagnetorum can retain its influential role under varying environmental conditions, but that the stimulating or retarding effects of this species on system functioning can be context dependent.

AB Shallow groundwaters were collected over and near buried kimberlites in the Attawapiskat River region of the James Bay Lowlands, Ontario, Canada in order to study the impact kimberlites have on CO2-CH4 systematics. Groundwaters collected from boreholes in kimberlites and limestone, and from groundwaters in overlying Tyrell Sea sediment (TSS) were analyzed for delta C-13(DIC), delta H-2(H2O), delta O-18(H2O), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and metal concentrations. Methane gas samples from borehole and TSS groundwaters were analyzed for concentration, delta C-13(CH4), and delta H-2(CH4). The CH4 concentrations and Delta C-13(DIC-CH4) (isotope separation) values indicate biological carbonate reduction in TSS groundwaters overlying kimberlites. Whereas, Delta C-13(DIC-CH4) values from TSS groundwaters over limestone and from boreholes within limestone and kimberlite indicate the biological consumption of methane (oxidation). The delta H-2(H2O) values from TSS over kimberlites are consistent with the variation in Delta C-13(DIC-CH4), as they are less negative compared to where they should fall on the local meteoric water line, suggesting that methanogens are using lighter delta H-2(H2O) values to produce CH4. Biological DIC reduction requires H+ ions from H2O to form CH4. There is evidence in the water geochemistry to support the isotopic results, as the ratio of methane to calculated Fe3+ (as amorphous Fe hydroxide), SO42-, and O-2(aq) is largest in the majority of TSS groundwaters over kimberlites (where Delta C-13(DIC-CH4) values indicate CH4 production). Low temperature serpentinization of olivine in kimberlite is not considered for CH4 production, as redox conditions in kimberlite groundwaters do not support abiogenic methane production. The findings here suggest that kimberlites are indirectly influencing the CO2-CH4 system by consuming oxidized ions in the overlying TSS, thereby creating a favorable environment for methane producing bacteria. In contrast, isotopes and geochemistry suggest methane oxidation in areas overlying limestone. The broader implication of this study is that variable lithology underlying sediment cover may impact biological methane production or consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Among the global coordinated patterns in soil temperature and methane emission from wetlands, a declining trend of optimal soil temperature for methane emissions from low to high latitudes has been witnessed, while the corresponding trend along the altitudinal gradient has not yet been investigated. We therefore selected two natural wetlands located at contrasting climatic zones from foothill and mountainside of Nepal Himalayas, to test: (1) whether the optimal temperature for methane emissions decreases from low to high altitude, and (2) whether there is a difference in temperature sensitivity of methane emissions from those wetlands. We found significant spatial and temporal variation of methane emissions between the two wetlands and seasons. Soil temperature was the dominant driver for seasonal variation in methane emissions from both wetlands, though its effect was perplexed by the level of standing water, aquatic plants, and dissolved organic carbon, particularly in the deep water area. When integrative comparison was conducted by adding the existing data from wetlands of diverse altitudes, and the latitude-for-altitude effect was taken into account, we found the baseline soil temperatures decrease whilst the altitude rises with respect to a rapid increase in methane emission from all wetlands, however, remarkably higher sensitivity of methane emissions to soil temperature (apparent Q(10)) was found in mid-altitude wetland. We provide the first evidence of an apparent decline in optimal temperature for methane emissions with increasing elevation. These findings suggest a convergent pattern of methane emissions with respect to seasonal temperature shifts from wetlands along altitudinal gradient, while a divergent pattern in temperature sensitivities exhibits a single peak in mid-altitude.

AB C-14 measurements of CH4 in environmental samples (e.g. soil gas, lake water, gas hydrates) can advance understanding of C cycling in terrestrial and marine systems. The measurements are particularly useful for detecting the release of old C from climate sensitive environments such as peatlands and hydrate fields. However, because C-14 CH4 measurements tend to be complex and time consuming, they are uncommon. Here, we describe a novel vacuum line system for the preparation of CH4 and CO2 from environmental samples for C-14 analysis using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The vacuum line is a flow-through system that allows rapid preparation of samples (1 h for CH4 and CO2, 30 min for CH4 alone), complete separation of CH4 and CO2 and is an easy addition to multipurpose CO2 vacuum lines already in use. We evaluated the line using CH4 and CO2 standards with different C-14 content. For CH4 and CO2, respectively, the total line blank was 0.4 +/- 0.2 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 mu g C, the C-14 background 51.1 +/- 1.2 and 48.4 +/- 1.5 kyr and the precision (based on pooled standard deviation) 0.9 parts per thousand and 1.3 parts per thousand. The line was designed for sample volumes of ca. 180 ml containing 0.5-1% CH4 and CO2, but can be adjusted to handle lower concentration and larger volume samples. This rapid and convenient method for the preparation of CH4 and CO2 in environmental samples for C-14 AMS analysis should provide more opportunities for the use of C-14 CH4 measurements in C cycle studies.

TI Colloidal organic carbon and trace elements in peat porewaters across a

SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
AB The majority of organic carbon (OC), nutrients, and dissolved trace elements in soil porewaters are present in the form of colloids which determine element transport, bioavailability, and overall impact on ecosystems. Climate warming and permafrost thaw in high latitudes will primarily affect the soil liquid phase thereby modifying delivery of colloids to the hydrological network and their role in C transport and emission. Here we studied colloids in peat porewaters across a natural gradient of sporadic, isolated, discontinuous and continuous permafrost zone in the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL), the largest peatland in the world. The depth of sampling and the microrelief (mounds and hollows) had a generally weak impact on the proportion of colloidal forms (3 kDa - 0.45 mu m) of OC, major (Fe, Al, P, alkali and alkaline-earth metals) and trace elements (TE) including micronutrients (Zn, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu), toxicants (Sb, As, Cd, Pb) and geochemical tracers (trivalent and tetravalent cations). Considering all micro-landscapes together, there was no sizable change in the proportion of colloidal fraction of OC, Fe, Al, P, micronutrients and toxicants across the permafrost zones. The majority of colloidal forms of all elements of these groups were represented by a size fraction between 3 and 30 kDa and were essentially Fe-Al-organic compounds with an average Fe:Al:OC molar ratio of 1.9:1:308. Overall, the degree of impact from environmental factors on OC and metal distribution among various colloidal fractions can be classified as depth <= permafrost type < microlandscape. Applying a substitution "space for time scenario" for the climate warming and permafrost thaw in Western Siberia, we do not expect sizable changes in C and element colloidal status during active layer thickness increase and permafrost boundary shift northward. Future studies of colloids in peat ice (below the active layer) are needed to assess possible changes in delivery of C and metals from soil to rivers and onward into the Arctic Ocean under massive permafrost thawing in the WSL.

AB Drainage is a globally common disturbance in forested peatlands that impacts peat soils, forest communities, and associated ecosystem functions, calling for informed hydrologic restoration strategies. The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in other degraded forested peatlands more broadly.

AB Human land-use activities, especially in the peatlands, are under consideration as the mitigation and lowering of CO2 emissions from land-use practices is needed to address climate change. In Finland, approximately one third of the land surface is covered by peatlands, and around 50% of peatlands are ditched for forestry. Another 3% of peatlands are used for agriculture and approximately 1% for peat extraction. The effects of these different land-use practices, including changes in sediment depositional rates and sediment quality, need to be identified. This study analyzed 51 lakes that were subdivided into two groups: (1) a group of impacted lakes in which peat was recently extracted from the catchments and (2) a reference group consisting of lakes where peat had not been extracted from the basin, but in which other land-use activities had occurred. The overall aim of the study was to investigate if peat extraction caused excessive delivery and deposition of dry and organic matter in lakes that are located in their immediate downstream catchment areas. Differences in sediment accumulation were defined by comparing the overall sediment thickness and recent (post 1986) sedimentation levels to identify if there were differences in the sediment chemical composition or rate of organic matter deposition between groups and to identify possible land-use stressors that could explain the possible differences in sediment chemical assemblages or sedimentation rates. The results show moderate (cm scale) sedimentation rates in both impacted and reference lakes after 1986, while sediment chemical assemblages indicated the erosion and input of mineral soils to all of the studied lakes, rather than the input of organic materials. No statistically significant correlations were observed between selected environmental variables and the recent accumulation rates of carbon and dry matter. Moreover, significant changes in the stressors potentially affecting the chemical assemblages of pre- and post-disturbance sediments were not observed.

AB In the boreal and subarctic zone, the moss and peat interactions with rainwater and snowmelt water in shallow surface ponds control the delivery of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and metal to the rivers and further to the Arctic Ocean. The transformation of peat and moss leachate by common aquatic microorganisms and the effect of temperature on DOM mineralization by heterotrophs remain poorly known that does not allow predicting the response of boreal aquatic system to ongoing climate change. We used experimental approach to quantify the impact of boreal aquatic bacteria P. reactans, and two culturable bacteria extracted from a thaw lake of the permafrost zone (Bolshezemelskaya tundra, NE Europe): Iodobacter sp. and cyanobacterial associate dominated by order Chroococcales (Synechococcus sp). The interaction of these bacterial cultures with nutrient-free peat and moss leachate was performed in order to (1) quantify the impact of temperature (4, 25 and 45 A degrees C) on peat leachate processing by heterotrophs; (2) compare the effect of heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacterial associate on moss and peat leachate chemical composition, and (3) quantify the DOC and metal concentration change during cyanobacterial growth on leachate from frozen and thawed peat horizon and moss biomass. The efficiency of peat DOM processing by two heterotrophs was not modified by temperature rise from 4 to 45 A degrees C. The DOC concentration decreased by a factor of 1.6 during 3 days of moss leachate reaction with Iodobacters sp. or cyanobacterial associate at 25 A degrees C. The SUVA(245) increased twofold suggesting an uptake of non-aromatic DOM by both microorganisms. The growth of cyanobacteria was absent on peat leachate but highly pronounced on moss leachate. This growth produced tenfold decrease in P concentration, a factor of 1.5-2.0 decrease in DOC, a factor of 4 and 100 decrease in Fe and Mn concentration, respectively. Adsorption of organic and organo-mineral colloids on bacterial cell surface was more important factor of element removal from organic leachates compared to intracellular assimilation and/or Fe oxyhydroxide precipitation. Overall, we demonstrate highly conservative behavior of peat leachate compared to moss leachate in the presence of culturable aquatic bacteria, a lack of any impact of heterotrophs on peat leachate and their weak impact on moss leachate. A very weak temperature impact on DOM processing by heterotrophs and lack of difference in the biodegradability of DOM from thawed and frozen peat horizons contradict the current paradigm that the warming of frozen OM and its leaching to inland waters will greatly affect microbial production and C cycle. Strong decrease in concentration of P, Fe and Mn in the moss leachate in the presence of cyanobacterial associate has straightforward application for understanding the development of thermokarst lakes and suggests that, in addition to P, Fe and Mn may become limiting micronutrients for phytoplankton bloom in thermokarst lakes.

AB On Brier Island in eastern Canada, ditching of Big Meadow Bog resulted in predictable shifts in the plant community as shrubs and trees proliferated across the drained landscape. The attraction of nesting gulls to the ditched bog and their daily foraging at distant mink farms was not predictable. To better understand the impacts of the nesting gulls, we performed a retrospective analysis of plant community disruption and recovery succession. Areas of gull-bared peat within Big Meadow Bog were colonized in succession by exotic grasses (e.g. Holcus lanatus) and annuals; raspberry (Rubus spp.) canes and biotically-dispersed Rosaceae shrubs; and wind-dispersed Ericaceae, fern, and tree species. There was no evidence of a persisting bog-species seedbank in the soil to aid post-gull revegetation, nor was there evidence of an exotic-weed seedbank to interfere with plant-community regeneration. The exotic-weed seedbank (6 thousand seeds m(-2)) declined to zero after 33years (half-life=3.6years). In contrast, a secondary, native (mainly Juncus spp.) seedbank of similar magnitude, persisted. The recovered plant communities had swamp features (i.e., trees, ferns, tall shrubs). Whether or not Big Meadow Bog regains ombrotrophy will depend upon whether blocked ditches and reinstated water tables deter nesting gulls.

AB The relevance of the research is related to the intensive economic development of the Arctic part of the European North of Russia, which entails a sharp increase in anthropogenic pressure on vulnerable ecosystems of the Far North. At climate warming, melting of permafrost can provoke the formation of new thermokarst lakes and subsidence, which in its turn facilitates the removal of organic matter from peat into natural environments.
   The main aim is to reveal the features of composition of dissolved organic matter and its possible sources in the waters of thermokarst lakes of the Bolshezemelskaya tundra (near Naryan-Mar), with different water-mirror areas and at different stages of evolution.
   Methods. Analysis of the dissolved organic matter content in the waters of thermokarst lakes was carried out in the laboratory of geo-resources and the environment of Toulouse by the method of complete burning of dissolved organic carbon. In the laboratory of physicochemical methods of analysis of the Institute of Petroleum Chemistry of the SB RAS (Tomsk), by a three-step extraction at various pH the chloroformed concentrates were obtained. They contain dissolved organic matter. Organic structures were studied by Infrared spectroscopy. The structural-group composition of dissolved organic matter was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method.
   Results. Organic compounds in the waters of thermokarst lakes of Bolshezemelskaya tundra are mainly represented by hydrocarbons of aliphatic structure, carboxylic acid esters and aromatic compounds belonging to three homologous series. It was found, that low-molecular n-alkanes predominate in the small acid lake BZ-12, the main sources are bacteria, lower plants (unicellular algae) and phytoplankton. In the more mature and less acidic lake BZ-13, the main contribution belongs to higher terrestrial plants and coast marine algae. Phytoplankton also plays an important role in enriching water with dissolved organic matter. Accordingly, with evolution of the lake ecosystem during recycling of a layer of peat sediments, the organic matters in waters are changed from the autochthonous to the allochthonous. lakes,

We separated monoculture of Pseudomonas saponiphila from a boreal creek and allowed it to react with boreal Fe-rich peat leachate of approximate colloidal (3 kDa-0.45 mu m) composition C1000Fe12Al3.3Mg2Ca3.7P1.2Mn0.1Ba0.5 in nutrient-free media. The total net decrease of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) concentration over 4 day of exposure was within 5% of the initial value, whereas the low molecular weight fraction of C-org (LMW< 3 kDa) yielded a 16%-decrease due to long-term bio-uptake or coagulation. There was a relative depletion in Fe over C-org of 0.45 mu m, colloidal and LMW fraction in the course of peat leachate interaction with P. saponiphila. Al, Mn, Ni, Cu, Ga, REEs, Y, U were mostly affected by bacterial presence and exhibited essentially the adsorption at the cell surface over first hours of reaction, in contrast to Fe, Ti, Zr, and Nb that showed both short-term adsorption and long-term removal by physical coagulation/coprecipitation with Fe hydroxide. The low molecular weight fraction (LMW< 3 kDa) of most TE was a factor of 2-5 less affected by microbial presence via adsorption or removal than the high molecular weight (HMW) colloidal fractions (< 0.45 mu m and < 50 kDa). The climate change-induced acceleration of heterotrophic bacterial activity in boreal and subarctic waters may lead to preferential removal of Fe over DOC from conventionally dissolved fraction and the decrease of the proportion of LMW < 3 kDa fraction and the increase of HMW colloids. Enhanced heterotrophic mineralization of organo-ferric colloids under climate warming scenario may compensate for on-going ''browning" of surface waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Small water bodies, such as temporary ponds, have a high carbon processing potential. Nevertheless, despite the global occurrence of these systems, the carbon effluxes from such water bodies have been largely overlooked. In this study, we examined the intra- and intersystem variability of carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes from a set of Mediterranean temporary ponds during the flooding phase, a hot-spot for biogeochemical cycling in temporary systems. The CO2 effluxes showed higher variability among the various sections of each pond (i.e., inundated, emerged-unvegetated and emerged-vegetated) than among the ponds. The emerged-vegetated sections showed the highest CO2 effluxes per unit area and tended to drive the total effluxes at the whole-ecosystem scale. The mean CO2 efflux (121.3 +/- 138.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was in the upper range for freshwater ecosystems. The CO2 effluxes were not related to catchment properties but rather to the organic content of the sediments, especially in the emerged sections of the ponds. Our results indicate that temporary ponds, especially their emerged sections, are important sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, highlighting the need to include the dry phases of these and other temporary aquatic systems in regional carbon budgets.

AB Multiple and rapid environmental changes in the Arctic have major consequences for the entire ecosystem. Soil water chemistry is one component with important implications for understanding climate feedbacks, plant growth, microbial turnover and net greenhouse gas emissions. Here we assess the contrasting growing season soil water chemistry in a Low arctic Greenlandic mesic tundra heath and a fen, which have been subjected to factorial treatments of summer warming using open top chambers (OTCs), snow addition using snow fences, which increase soil temperature in late winter, and shrub removal mimicking herbivory attack. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and plant nutrients, including NO3-, NH4+, PO42+ and total dissolved N were measured during multiple growing seasons (2013-2016) to quantify the treatment effects on nutrient availability in two dominating, but contrasting, vegetation types.
   Ambient nutrient concentrations in the mesic tundra heath decreased throughout the growing season and increased during senescence, while concentrations were highest during peak growing season in the fen. The content of NH4+ and DOC were highest in the fen, whereas NO3- was highest in the mesic tundra heath. The fen had no seasonal pattern.
   Summer warming in the mesic tundra heath did not change the availability of nutrients, but in combination with shrub removal, both NO3- and DOC concentrations increased, likely due to reduced plant uptake. Shrub removal alone increased NO3- in one growing season, and, combined with snow addition, increased DOC. Significant effects of shrub removal were mostly found in 2016. Snow addition combined with summer warming increased DOC and total N concentrations and highlights the potential loss of dissolved C from the ecosystem.
   In the fen, shrub removal alone and combined with summer warming decreased DOC. Snow addition alone and in combination with summer warming similarly decreased DOC.
   In the mesic tundra heath, shrub removal caused higher soil water contents in all years. In the dry and warm 2016, it meant <10% soil water content in controls and 15-20% in shrub removal plots during the peak growing season, which may have relieved soil moisture limitation on mineralization rates in the latter.
   We conclude that soil water chemistry is vegetation-specific, and that treatment effects are surprisingly limited when comparing multiple years with contrasting precipitation patterns. Herbivory may have larger impact in very dry, warm summers and, together with extreme weather events, exert similar or larger effects than four years of temperature manipulations. The effects of summer warming or increased winter snow depend on ecosystem type and moisture status of the soil. The combination of multi-year and multi-site studies therefore seem important for understanding future biogeochemical dynamics in Arctic landscapes.

AB Zoige alpine peatland as the highest and largest peat swamp area in the world plays an important role in regulating global climate change and stabilizing GHG emissions, and GHG emissions are getting more and more concern due to water table decline induced by the combined effects of climate warming and digging ditches in Zoige alpine peatland. Therefore, emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O were investigated in situ along different water table transects in Zoige peatland. Results showed that the CO2 and N2O fluxes increased along the reduced water table gradient except the lowest water table sites, while CH4 flux was decreased. Meanwhile, the global warming potential decreased from 798.6 to 430.9 g CO2 eq m(- 2) h(- 1) with the declined water table. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that SOC was the primary factor explaining the variations of CO2 and N2O fluxes across different water table levels, and soil water content was the most important factor to explain the CH4 flux. Water table was the primary driver to determine the GHG fluxes, and the CO2 and N2O emissions were also dependent on the SOC variations. Overall, our results would be beneficial to understand the mechanism of water table effect on GHG emission in alpine peatland ecosystem and provide supports for alpine peatland management in the future.

AB [ 1] We used a simple hydrological-biogeochemical mixing model to test the hypothesis that export of total organic carbon occurring mainly during spring in taiga and tundra watersheds might be compensated by production and export of bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) from groundwater during the rest of the year. The investigated watersheds are located in northern Sweden close to the Arctic Circle. An elevated spring flow peak due to snowmelt characterizes the hydrology of boreal and arctic river systems. During this snowmelt, total organic carbon (TOC), previously stored as soil carbon, is flushed and exported from the watersheds, and can be released to the atmosphere via heterotrophic remineralization during riverine transport to the sea, thereby contributing to atmospheric CO(2). The TOC yields of the watersheds investigated increased with vegetation and peat cover and ranged across watersheds from 0.5 to 2.8 tons km(-2) yr(-1). During frozen periods, streamflow is dominated by "old'' groundwater. This water has percolated through the soils and is rich in DSi and bicarbonate; that is, atmospheric carbon that has been "consumed'' in chemical weathering processes is partly exported as bicarbonate to the sea, where carbon is stored as CaCO(3) for geological time. The bicarbonate export of the watersheds investigated was between 0.4 and 1.2 tons C km(-2) yr(-1) corresponding to 15 - 73% of the TOC export. Very likely, global warming will affect water flow through the soils in taiga and tundra ecosystems and thus will have an effect on watershed carbon budgets. This bicarbonate export may compensate for significant amounts of the exported TOC, thereby reducing the positive feedback to atmospheric CO(2).

AB The Florida Everglades ecosystem is composed of the largest deposit (9600 km(2)) of near neutral peat in the world extending south of Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. The federal Central and South Florida Flood Control Project (C-and-SF) has sectioned the historic Everglades with a system of canals and levees to control water for urban and agricultural development, resulting in pronounced hydrologic modifications to the natural system. As a part of a comprehensive ecological risk assessment of mercury (Hg) contamination in the Everglades ecosystem, a pilot study of canals was initiated in September 1993 to determine the extent and magnitude of total (HgT) and methylmercury (MeHg) in water, sediment and fish. A probability-based random sampling grid was used to obtain consistent estimates of Hg contamination over this large geographic area. Two hundred canal sampling locations were selected as probability samples by associating grid points on the sampling frame with specific canal sections for independent sampling cycles. Of this number 50 locations were randomly selected for sampling in this pilot study. The selected canal points were sampled from north to south during a six day period. Cumulative distributions with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and used to determine a canal system median concentration for selected water, sediment and fish constituents. The percent exceedance of each median, by hydrologic subarea, was determined to demonstrate the existence and direction of spatial gradients in the system. North to south (high to low) gradients were apparent for total phosphorus (TP), sulfate (SO4), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), conductance, HgT and MeHg in water. However, the gradients were reversed from south to north for HgT in sediments and fish (Gambusia sp.) The greatest Hg concentrations in Gambusia sp. occurred in the same canals where largemouth bass had previously been found to be most contaminated.

AB Boreal wetlands play an important role in global carbon balance. However, their ecosystem function is threatened by direct anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Oil sands surface mining in the boreal regions of Western Canada denudes tracts of land of organic materials, leaves large areas in need of reclamation, and generates considerable quantities of extraction process-affected materials. Knowledge and validation of reclamation techniques that lead to self-sustaining wetlands has lagged behind development of protocols for reclaiming terrestrial systems. It is important to know whether wetlands reclaimed with oil sands process materials can be restored to levels equivalent to their original ecosystem function. We approached this question by assessing carbon flows and food web structure in naturally formed and oil sands-affected wetlands constructed in 1970-2004 in the postmining landscape. We evaluated whether a prescribed reclamation strategy, involving organic matter amendment, accelerated reclaimed wetland development, leading to wetlands that were more similar to their natural marsh counterparts than wetlands that were not supplemented with organic matter. We measured compartment standing stocks for bacterioplankton, microbial biofilm, macrophytes, detritus, and zoobenthos; concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and residual naphthenic acids; and microbial production, gas fluxes, and aquatic-terrestrial exports (i.e., aquatic insect emergence). The total biomass of several biotic compartments differed significantly between oil sands and reference wetlands. Submerged macrophyte biomass, macroinvertebrate trophic diversity, and predator biomass and richness were lower in oil sands-affected wetlands than in reference wetlands. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that wetland age and wetland amendment with peat-mineral mix mitigate effects of oil sands waste materials on the fully aquatic biota. Although high variability was observed within most compartments, our data show that 20-year-old wetlands containing oil sands material have not yet reached the same level of function as their reference counterparts.

AB Boreal wetlands are significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, and are vulnerable to freezing-thawing cycles (FTC). Nonetheless, the underlying factors that induce CH4 emission in boreal wetlands during FTC are still unclear. Our goal was to characterize soil CH4 emission potential from a freshwater marsh as impacted by FTC and to determine the corresponding mechanisms. We collected soil samples from two soil layers (0-20 and 2040 cm) of an undisturbed freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, and subjected them to various freezing (6 to -6 degrees C) and thawing (-6 to 6 degrees C) cycles. Soil CH4 emission, DOC, and the aromaticity and complexity of DOC indexes were monitored. The results showed that FTC significantly increased CH4 emission potential in the 0-20 cm surface soil layer. The maximum hourly CH4 emission rate was 55.0 mg C m(-2) h(-1), approximately 19 times as high as that of the unfrozen control sample (2.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). However, the peak intensity of CH4 emission decreased when the numbers of FTC increased. Meanwhile, FTC not only increased the quantity of DOC released, but also enhanced its instability via increasing the contribution of relatively small, readily degradable organic molecules. Additionally, the CH4 emission potential was significantly correlated with the aromaticity and complexity of DOC, indicating that the release of labile substrates under FTC was one important factor controlling the microbial production of CH4 and the high emissions upon thawing. Our study suggested that global warming-induced increases in seasonal FTC in boreal wetlands may increase CH4 emissions beyond what would occur from long-term temperature increases alone.

AB Sorption of humic acid (HA) oil mineral surfaces has a profound interest regarding the fate of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) and carbon sequestration in soils. The objective of our study is to determine the fractionation behavior of HA upon sorption oil mineral surfaces with varying surface properties. HA was coated sequentially oil kaolinite (1:1 clay), montmorillonite (2:1 clay), and goethite (iron oxide) for four times. The unadsorbed HA fractions were characterized by elemental analysis, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT), and solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The mineral-HA complexes were characterized by DRIFT. Polarity index [(N+O)/C] revealed higher polarity of the unadsorbed HA fractions after coating oil kaolinite, reflecting that relatively higher polarity fractions of HA remain unadsorbed. Sorption of aliphatic alcohol fraction along with carbohydrate was prominent on kaolinite surface. DRIFT results of the unadsorbed HA fractions indicated more sorption of aliphatic moieties oil both kaolinite and montmorillonite. DRIFT results of the unadsorbed HA fractions after sorption oil kaolinite and goethite showed the sorption of the proteinaccous fractions of HA. The HA fractions obtained after coating on goethite showed significant sorption of carboxylic moieties. The results mentioned above comply reasonably well with the DRIFT spectra of the mineral-HA complexes. 13C NMR results showed higher sorption of anomeric C oil kaolinite surface. Higher sorption of paraffinic fraction was observed oil montmorillonite. NMR data inferred the sorption of carboxylic moieties on goethite surface. Overall, this study showed that aliphatic moieties of HA preferentially sorbed oil kaolinite and montmorillonite. while carboxylic functional groups play a significant role in sorption of HA oil goethite. The sorbed fractions of HA may modify the mineral surface properties, and thus, the interaction with organic contaminants.

AB Effects of 27 different humic materials on the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were studied for crustacean Daphnia magna. Sources included isolated humic acids, fulvic acids, and their combination from soil, peat, and freshwater. The PAH used were pyrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene. The observed reduction in toxicity of PAH in the presence of humic substances (HS) was shown to be a result of the detoxification effect caused by the chemical binding of PAH to HS and of the direct effect of HS on D. magna. An approach was developed to quantify the detoxifying impact of humic materials related to their chemical binding to PAH with a use of the "constant of detoxification" or "toxicological partition coefficient" K-OC(D). The latter was proposed to determine by fitting the experimental relationships of the detoxification effect versus concentration of HS. The obtained K-OC(D) values were well tracked by the corresponding partition coefficients determined by the fluorescence quenching technique (K-OC(fq)): K-OC(D) = b x K-OC(fq), b (mean +/- Cl, n = 26, P = 95%) = 2.6 +/- 0.3, 4.6 +/- 0.6, and 6.0 +/- 1.4 for pyrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene, respectively. The predictive relationships between the structure and detoxifying properties of humic materials in relation to PAH were developed. It was shown that the magnitude of the K-OC(D) values correlated closely with the aromaticity of humic materials characterized with the C-13 NMR descriptors (SigmaC(Ar), SigmaC(Ar)/SigmaC(Alk)) and atomic H/C ratio. The obtained relationships showed the highest detoxifying potential of the humic materials enriched with aromatics and allowed a conclusion on the chemical binding as the governing mechanism of the mitigating action of HS on the toxicity of PAH.

AB A prominent, middle Miocene (17.5-13.5 Ma) carbon isotope excursion ubiquitously recorded in carbonate sediments has been attributed to enhanced marine productivity and sequestration of C-13 depleted organic carbon in marine sediments or enhanced carbon burial in peat/lignite deposits on land. Here we test the hypothesis that the marine delta C-13 record reflects a change in productivity with proxy records from three Atlantic Ocean sites (Deep Sea Drilling Program Site 608 and Ocean Drilling Program Sites 925 and 1265). Our multiproxy approach is based on benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates, elemental ratios (Ba/Al and P/Al), the delta C-13 of bulk sedimentary organic matter, and dissolution indices. We compare these proxies to benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values measured on the same samples. Our results indicate that marine paleoproductivity in the Atlantic Ocean is not related to the benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 excursion. A numerical box model confirms that marine productivity cannot account for the delta C-13 maximum. The model shows that sequestration of 1.5 x 10(18) mol C in the terrestrial realm over a period of 3 Ma leads to a 0.9 parts per thousand delta C-13 increase in the deep ocean, which is near the observed records. Therefore, an increase in continental organic carbon sequestration is the most plausible way to enrich the ocean's carbon pool with C-13, which is consistent with coeval lignite deposits worldwide. The delta C-13 values of bulk sedimentary organic matter parallel the delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon as reflected by benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values suggesting no significant change in atmospheric pCO(2) levels over the investigated period.

AB Diatom, magnetic susceptibility and loss-on-ignition (LOI) analyses of a 9-metre sediment core from Heygsvatn (Suduroy, the Faroe Islands) were used to investigate the response of lake and catchment to mid-Late Holocene environmental change. A 30-lake training set from Faroese lakes was also used to explore the relationships between diatoms and environmental variables and assist in the interpretation of the diatom stratigraphy. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that lake depth, light penetration, total phosphorus (TP), pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were the most significant variables affecting diatom distribution in Faroese lakes (p < 0.06). Nine C-14 AMS dates indicated that the sediment record covered the last similar to 5700 years. Exceptionally high rates of sediment accumulation, an increase in LOI and magnetic susceptibility and inversion of radiocarbon dates suggested that a period of elevated soil erosion occurred at Heygsvatn ca. 1700-1200cal. yr. BP. Because this erosion pre-dates the arrival of humans the most likely cause is climate deterioration (cooler, wetter conditions). The diatom stratigraphy supports this hypothesis by showing that during the period of erosion the lake was deeper or/or more depauperate in TP, consistent with the climate becoming wetter and leading to increased lake flushing. Subsequently, with sustained sediment erosion, the lake became more shallow and pH increased as the lake infilled. In combination, the proxies support the idea that the climate became wetter ca. 1700-1200cal. yr. BP in the Faroe Islands, but that the response of the landscape was partly dependent on the increased development of peat initiated during the onset of Neoglacial cooling after 5000cal. years BP.

AB Relevance. Macrophytes are one of the key participants in accumulation of chemical elements in lake ecosystems, but despite this, the issue of elemental composition of macrophytes of thermokarst lakes in Western Siberia and accumulation of chemical elements relative to the sediments and pore water remains practically unexplored.
   The aim of the research is to describe the formation of elemental composition of macrophyte species of thermokarst lakes in the north of Western Siberia and to identify the possibility of their use in biomonitoring.
   The objects of research were macrophyte plants (Hippuris vulgaris L., Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb., Comarum palustre L., Ranunculus spitzbergensis Hadac, Carex aquatilis Wahlenb s. Str., Menyanthes trifoliata L.), sediments and pore waters of thermokarst lakes of the north of Western Siberia.
   Methods. The elemental composition of the samples was studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent Technologies, 7500 se), the concentration of anions in water samples was determined by liquid chromatography (Dionex ICS-2000), the dissolved organic carbon was defined by infrared spectroscopy TOC-VCSN, Shimadzu), the organic carbon content of the sediments was determined by infrared spectrometry (Horiba Jobin Yvon Emia-320V C/S Analyzer). Statistical processing of data was carried out using the STATISTICA 6.0 software package.
   Results. The coefficients of biological accumulation of chemical elements in macrophytes relative to sediments and pore water were calculated for four key thermokarst lakes. It has been shown that macronutrients (Na, Mg, Ca), some heavy metals and metalloids (Ni, Cu, Zr, Co, As, Cd), as well as B and Mo are actively accumulated in water plants of thermokarst lakes of Western Siberia. High coefficients of accumulation of heavy metals indicate a significant phytoremediation function of macrophytes in a given territory.

AB In peatlands, fluvial erosion can lead to a dramatic decline in hydrological function, major changes in the net carbon balance and loss of biodiversity. Climate and land management change are thought to be important influences on rates of peat erosion. However, sediment production in peatlands is different to that of other soils and no models of erosion specifically for peatlands currently exist. Hence, forecasting the influence of future climate or spatially-distributed management interventions on peat erosion is difficult. The PESERA-GRID model was substantially modified in this study to include dominant blanket peat erosion processes. In the resulting fluvial erosion model, PESERA-PEAT, freeze-thaw and desiccation processes were accounted for by a novel sediment supply index as key features of erosion. Land management practices were parameterized for their influence on vegetation cover, biomass and soil moisture condition. PESERA-PEAT was numerically evaluated using available field data from four blanket peat-covered catchments with different erosion conditions and management intensity. PESERA-PEAT was found to be robust in modelling fluvial erosion in blanket peat. A sensitivity analysis of PESERA-PEAT showed that modelled sediment yield was more sensitive to vegetation cover than other tested factors such as precipitation, temperature, drainage density and ditch/gully depth. Two versions of PESERA-PEAT, equilibrium and time-series, produced similar results under the same environmental conditions, facilitating the use of the model at different scales. The equilibrium model is suitable for assessing the high-resolution spatial variability of average monthly peat erosion over the study period across large areas (national or global assessments), while the time-series model is appropriate for investigating continuous monthly peat erosion throughout study periods across smaller areas or large regions using a coarser-spatial resolution. PESERA-PEAT will therefore support future investigations into the impact of climate change and management options on blanket peat erosion at various spatial and temporal scales.

AB Blocking drainage ditches and creating bunds to limit surface water losses are important for restoring abandoned peat-extraction sites in North America. However, these runoff control techniques have not been well characterized, particularly during the snowmelt period. Therefore, patterns of runoff timing and magnitude were evaluated in a peatland (Bois-des-Bel, Quebec, Canada) undergoing restoration (restored site), in comparison with an unrestored section of the same peatland (unrestored site). Snowmelt dominated runoff, representing over 79% of the April to August runoff for both sites in 2001. Low (25-35 cm) bunds constructed on the restored site detained water for much of the melt period, but some water loss occurred where bunds were breached. Overland flow and surface ponding were prevalent at the restored site, but were not evident at the unrestored site. At the restored site, the presence of bunds and frozen, saturated (thus impermeable) ground contributed to differences in snowmelt runoff patterns relative to the unrestored site. In the post-snowmelt period (May-August 2001 and 2002), restored site runoff was reduced to 25% of that lost at the unrestored site. Both hydrometric and chemical hydrograph separation analysis using electrical conductivity indicated that blocked ditches restricted water losses from much of the restored site during the summer months, when the bunds had little effect on runoff. However, discharge peaks were greater at the restored site relative to the unrestored site and generally occurred more quickly following rainfall, because of the wetter antecedent conditions.

AB This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability in dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]), natural organic matter (-NOM) weight average molecular weight and absorptivity at 280 nm (epsilon(280), an estimator of aromaticity) at McDonalds Branch, a first-order stream that is a fen wetland. When ground-water discharge to the stream was predominant, the [DOC], M-w and were all relatively low. When soil pore water represented an important contribution to streamflow, not only was the [DOC] higher, but also the M-w and Hence, the contribution of soil pore water relative to ground water controlled not only the concentration but also the average physicochemical characteristics of the NOM. Combined field and laboratory experiments suggested that preferential adsorption of higher M-w more aromatic NOM components to mineral surfaces, most likely within the lower soil horizons, resulted in a lower M-w more aliphatic ground-water NOM pool, This process ultimately affected surface water as ground water discharged to the lower reaches of the stream. Within the stream, higher molecular weight, more aromatic components were susceptible to photo-aggregation and photo-degradation, in the presence of Fe. Results from this small watershed study provide insight into climatic effects on surface-water NOM characteristics in a small freshwater fen. Low flow periods resulted in lower M-w more aliphatic NOM derived primarily from ground-water discharge to the stream, whereas higher flow periods resulted in a higher M-w (by 150-500 Da, i.e., increased by as much as 25%), more aromatic downstream surface-water NOM pool, Hence, during future summer drought periods, as suggested by climate-change models for much of North America, surface-water NOM likely will be lower molecular weight, more aliphatic, and more hydrophilic with lesser metal binding and hydrophobic organic carbon (HOC) uptake abilities [Environ. Sci, Technol, 34 (2000) 1103]. along with decreased ability to attenuate UV radiation. Because NOM plays an important role in attenuating UV radiation, research on climate-induced effects on aquatic ecosystems needs to consider not only decreases in NOM concentration and photochemistry but also hydrology-induced changes to the NOM physicochemical characteristics.

AB Identifying the landscape and climate factors that control nutrient export by rivers in high latitude regions is one of the main challenges for understanding the Arctic Ocean response to ongoing climate change. This is especially true for Western Siberian rivers, which are responsible for a significant part of freshwater and solutes delivery to the Arctic Ocean and are draining vast permafrost-affected areas most vulnerable to thaw. Forty-nine small- and medium-sized rivers (10-100,000 km(2)) were sampled along a 1700 km long N-S transect including both permafrost-affected and permafrost-free zones of the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL) in June and August 2015. The N, P, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively), particular organic carbon (POC), Si, Ca, K, Fe, and Mn were analyzed to assess the role of environmental parameters, such as temperature, runoff, latitude, permafrost, bogs, lake, and forest coverage on nutrient concentration. The size of the watershed had no influence on nutrient concentrations in the rivers. Bogs and lakes retained nutrients whereas forests supplied P, Si, K, Ca, DIC, and Mn to rivers. The river water temperature was negatively correlated with Si and positively correlated with Fe in permafrost-free rivers. In permafrost-bearing rivers, the decrease in T northward was coupled with significant increases in PO4, P-tot, NH4, pH, DIC, Si, Ca, and Mn. North of the permafrost boundary (61 degrees N), there was no difference in nutrient concentrations among permafrost zones (isolated, sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous). The climate warming in Western Siberia may lead to a permafrost boundary shift northward. Using a substituting space for time scenario, this may decrease or maintain the current levels of N, P, Si, K, Ca, DIC, and DOC concentrations in rivers of continuous permafrost zones compared to the present state. As a result, the export flux of nutrients by the small- and medium-sized rivers of the Western Siberian subarctic to the Arctic Ocean coastal zone may remain constant, or even decrease.

AB We used enclosures to quantify wetland-water column nutrient exchanges in a dwarf red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) system near Taylor River, an important hydraulic linkage between the southern Everglades and eastern Florida Bay, Florida, USA. Circular enclosures were constructed around small (2.5-4 m diam) mangrove islands (n=3) and sampled quarterly from August 1996 to May 1998 to quantify net exchanges of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The dwarf mangrove wetland was a net nitrifying environment, with consistent uptake of ammonium (6.6-31.4 mu mol m(2) h(-1)) and release of nitrite + nitrate (7.1-139.5 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) to the water column. Significant flux of soluble reactive phosphorus was rarely detected in this nutrient-poor, P-limited environment. We did observe recurrent uptake of total phosphorus and nitrogen (2.1-8.3 and 98-502 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively), as well as dissolved organic carbon (1.8-6.9 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) from the water column. Total organic carbon flux shifted unexplainably from uptake, during Year 1, to export, during Year 2. The use of unvegetated (control) enclosures during the second year allowed us to distinguish the influence of mangrove vegetation from soil-water column processes on these fluxes. Nutrient fluxes in control chambers typically paralleled the direction (uptake or release) of mangrove enclosure fluxes, but not the magnitude. In several instances, nutrient fluxes were more than twofold greater in the absence of mangroves, suggesting an influence of the vegetation on wetland-water column processes. Our findings characterize wetland nutrient exchanges in a mangrove forest type that has received such little attention in the past, and serve as baseline data for a system undergoing hydrologic restoration.

AB Solutions containing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from a depressional wetland that receives agricultural drainage water were incubated in pure quartz sands with FeCl3 added as the main electron acceptor. The effects of three factors (the water, DOC, and Fe contents) on the CO2 and CH4 production rates, integrated cumulative C emissions and Fe-OC co-precipitation were studied. The results showed that CO2 production during the DOC mineralization process was facilitated by Fe(III) reduction at the expense of CH4 production. Additionally, the cumulative CO2 emissions determined by integrating the temporal curves of CO2 production were negatively correlated with those of CH4 (r = -0.48, p < 0.01). Extremely large ratios of the CO2:CH4 production rate (13,762 and 44,885 under two soil water conditions: saturation and flood conditions of twice the saturation level) were observed. These ratios were likely caused by simultaneous anaerobic fermentation, microbial respiration, and methanogenesis suppression triggered by iron reduction. The effects of exogenous Fe(III) inputs on total C emissions (as the sum of integrated cumulative CO2 and CH4) were only dependent on soil water conditions during the initial period of the experiment, and flooded conditions increased total C emissions by as much as double. Increased ratios of Fe inputs to C contents were found to proportionally increase the total C emissions (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.01). Under saturated conditions, the co-precipitation of Fe-OC complexes prevented the remainder of the DOC from undergoing mineralization. In terms of DOC, we concluded that wetland saturation with introduced Fe(III) can reduce total C emissions from anaerobic respiration and promote C sequestration.

AB A combined hydrological and chemical investigation was undertaken in a small moorland catchment at Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, to determine both the dominant runoff generation mechanisms and the controls of storm runoff chemistry. Natural soil pipes, overland flow from peat soils and streamflow were gauged and catchment waters were intensively sampled during five storm events. Samples were analysed for total monomeric and non-labile monomeric aluminium. The stormflow response appears to be dominated by overland flow with a significant contribution from pipeflow, particularly during small events. Pipes appear to be the major source of Al during storms, and contribute to increased concentrations of both organic and inorganic complexes of Al in the stream during high flow. However, for a given stream discharge, a wide range of Al concentrations was observed. Highest concentrations (maximum 0.477 mg l-1) were observed in throughflow from the mineral soil, but the contribution of throughflow to stream discharge appears to be limited. Al was rarely detected in overland flow. The Al chemistry varied considerably between pipe and throughflow water. Al concentrations in these waters reflect the availability of Al in pipe and throughflow source areas and are not primarily dependent on hydrogen ion content, Concentrations in pipe water varied with antecedent conditions; highest inorganic Al was observed after a long flow-free period, whereas in very wet conditions both inorganic and organic Al became depleted. In contrast, the highest concentrations in throughflow were observed after the wettest antecedent conditions. The Al-hydrogen ion relationship in stream water also showed considerable scatter. Al concentrations in the stream reflected contributions from pipeflow and throughflow but were greater than the levels suggested by the storm runoff generation hypothesis. This indicates that further sources of Al may exist. Organic Al is strongly related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in individual events, but there was great variation between events.

AB It is generally assumed that terrestrial humic matter contains a high density of metal complexing ligands spanning a wide range of stability constants. From equilibrium modelling it would be anticipated that carboxyl groups, which are known to be abundant in humic matter, should be capable of binding Cu quantitatively in humic-rich estuarine systems such as the river plume outflow of River Thurso, on Scotland's north coast, where concentrations along the full mixing gradient typically range for Cu: 1 25 nM and for DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon): 150-1500 mu M. Using a combination of reverse and forward titrations monitored by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV), we show that terrestrial humic substances were the likely source of high-affinity (class 1), low abundance ligands (1-4 nM) found throughout the coastal plume, but that weaker (class 2), more abundant ligands (90-170 nM) appeared to be produced largely in situ, probably as a biological response to Cu inputs into the estuary. Conditional stability constants for Cu-binding were respectively log K-1' = 14.9-15.9 and log K-2' = 11.8-12.6. Class 2 ligands were evenly distributed between the low and high molecular weight fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM), both in March and May. Class 1 ligands were more abundant in the low molecular weight fraction in March, but not in May. The latter could be related to seasonal differences in the nature of peatland derived organic matter carried by River Thurso. Since class 1 ligands (terrestrial, humic) were saturated with Cu throughout the plume, it effectively fell upon class 2 ligands (marine, biological) to control Cu speciation in Thurso Bay, in particular keeping the free Cu concentration [Cu2+] within a relatively narrow range (10(-13.6) M to 10(-12.4). NI) On the other hand, class 1 ligands were responsible for solubilising small amounts of Cu derived from this peatland catchment and effectively transporting Cu, in dissolved and colloidal forms, to the ocean.

AB The study concerns the possible changes in the molecular characteristics of humic materials isolated from the same source as a function of time. A great deal of data has been reported concerning the contrast in molecular characteristics of humic substances isolated from different environments. This has primarily been an attempt to identify source-specific molecular characteristics. However, data presented in this paper suggests that humic substances isolated from a single catchment have significant changes in molecular characteristics over time. Two naturally occurring peat pools (X and Y) situated upon a small organic catchment on Great Dun Fell, Cumbria, UK were sampled monthly between November 1994 and November 1996. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the pool water samples was fractionated using macroporous nonionic resins (XAD8 and 4), and the humic, fulvic and hydrophilic acids were collected. These fractions were analysed for elemental composition (C, H and N), weight average molecular weight, functional group content and adsorption (340 nm) of a 1 g 1(-1) solution measured in a 1-cm spectrophotometer cell. The molecular characteristics were compared to those of natural DOM described by Scott et al. (1998). Scott et al. reported that drought conditions and seasonal climatic changes could have appreciable effects upon molecular characteristics of natural DOM. Results showed that the atomic H/C ratio of the humic substances increased immediately after strong drought conditions experienced in the summer of 1995. This change was temporary with atomic H/C ratio decreasing gradually over the following months. A similar decrease was observed in the carboxyl group content of the isolated compounds. The data set suggested that atomic H/C ratio in the fulvic and hydrophilic fractions exhibited seasonal characteristics of higher ratios during the late summer/early autumn months. This was not observed in the humic fraction. Humic acids exhibited a seasonal pattern of higher weight average molecular weight during the summer months. These trends were explained in terms of summer production of DOM in the catchment soils, their sequestering in the soil due to limited soil water movement during the summer months and their relative ease of dissolution when rainfall and soil water movement increased during the late summer/early autumn period. The results were found to support seasonal and long-term patterns observed in natural DOM as reported by Scott et al. (1998). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effects of natural factors (drought and forest fire), and experimental perturbations (fertilization and acidification) on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and ratios to other nutrients in lakes of the Experimental Lakes Area are examined using data obtained over a period of 20 years. DOC concentration, and the ratio of dissolved iron to DOC in lakes of the area were strongly correlated with the relative size of the catchment to the lake.
   DOC in many lakes of the area declined over 20 years, due to increased water residence times caused by increasing average temperature and decreasing precipitation. Inexplicably, Lake 382 was an exception to this general observation. Acidification of Lake 302S to below pH 5.0 also caused DOC to decrease. The lesser acidification of Lake 223 (min. pH 5.0) did not significantly affect DOC. Experimental acidification of a small peatland also caused a temporary decline in DOC concentrations in bog pools. Changes in DOC appear to affect the availability of mercury for methylation. Addition of aluminum to a small acidic lake caused a two-fold decline in DOC.
   Fertilization of Lake 227 caused a considerable increase in DOC, and in ratios of DOC to other carbon fractions. New stable ratios did not occur for a decade after fertilization began. Lake 226N, fertilized at a lower rate, showed similar but less pronounced increases in DOC, but the experiment was terminated after only eight years. Phosphorus fertilization caused a dramatic increase in the lability of the DOC pool in Lake 226N, where the autochthonous carbon pool was labelled with DIC-14. A large increase in autochthonous production of DOC and increased microbial utilization of allochthonous DOC appear to have occurred.
   DOC concentrations in streams were higher after drought, but concentrations were unrelated to flow volume during wet periods. Due to lower streamflows in drought years, annual yields of DOC from streams were unaffected by drought.
   Mesocosm experiments showed that DOC's primary effect on iron is to inhibit sedimentation, possibly by suppressing flocculation reactions that are known to control the cycles of many metals.
   The changes of DOC in lakes brought about by changes in water renewal, acidification, or other perturbations can have major effects on the cycles of metals, lake transparency, and phytoplankton production and standing crop.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeo-chemical reactions, global carbon cycling, heavy metal transport, water treatability and potability. One source of DOM to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge. Changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas, which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and DOM treatability. In order to investigate potential changes in groundwater DOM character after rainfall recharge, we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat-rich sand aquifer in New South Wales, Australia, during an extended period of low precipitation (average daily precipitation rate < 1.6 mm day(-1) over the 8 months prior to sampling), and after two heavy precipitation events (84 mm day(-1) and 98 mm day(-1) respectively). We assess changes in DOM composition after correcting for dilution by a novel combination of two advanced analytical techniques: liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We also assess changes in water chemistry pre- and post-rainfall. Post-rainfall, we show that the dilution-corrected amount of highly aromatic DOM molecular formulae (i.e. those categorised into the groups polyphenolics and condensed aromatics) were 1.7 and 2.0 times higher respectively than in pre-rainfall samples. We attribute this to the flushing of peat-derived DOM from buried organic material into the groundwater. We also identify that periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic/HOC ratios in groundwater (median = 4.9, n = 14). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to compare the HOC fraction with FT-ICR MS compound groups. We show that HOC has a more aromatic character in pre-rainfall samples, and is less similar to the aromatic groups in post-rainfall samples. This suggests that the decline in water-borne hydrophobics observed post-rainfall could be associated with preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic aromatic DOM, making post-rainfall samples less treatable for potable water supply. Post-rainfall we also observe significant increases in arsenic (leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the World Health Organisation drinking water limit of 10 mu g/ L). Increases in coastal rainfall due to climate change may therefore alter the composition of groundwater DOM in coastal peatland areas in ways that may impact DOM bioavailability, and increase arsenic concentrations, reducing the ease of water treatment for human consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the chemical and molecular changes of shallow groundwater DOM pre-rainfall and post-rainfall in a sedimentary organic carbon rich environment through multiple analytical techniques.

AB Natural and seminatural terrestrial ecosystems (unmanaged peatlands and forests and extensive and intensive grasslands) have been under-represented in the UK greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. Mechanistic studies of GHG fluxes and their controls can improve the prediction of the currently uncertain GHG annual emission estimates. The source apportionment of N2O emissions can further inform management plans for GHG mitigation. We have measured in situ GHG fluxes monthly in two replicated UK catchments and evaluated their environmental controlling factors. An adapted N-15-gas flux method with low addition of N-15 tracer (0.03-0.5kg(15)Nha(-1)) was used to quantify the relative contribution of denitrification to net N2O production. Total N2O fluxes were 40 times higher in the intensive grasslands than in the peatlands (range: -1.32 to 312.3gNm(-2)h(-1)). The contribution of denitrification to net N2O emission varied across the land use types and ranged from 9 to 60%. Soil moisture was the key parameter regulating the partitioning of N2O sources (r(2)=0.46). Total N2O fluxes were explained by a simple model (r(2)=0.83) including parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen, organic carbon, and water content. A parsimonious model with the soil moisture content as a single scalar parameter explained 84% of methane flux variability across land uses. The assumption that 1% of the atmospherically deposited N on natural ecosystems is emitted as N2O could be overestimated or underestimated (0.3-1.6%). The use of land use-specific N2O emission factors and further information on N2O source partitioning should help constrain this uncertainty.

AB Depth to water table is a simple, commonly used measure of hydrological function in raised bogs. The maximum depth of the water table or the average annual water table is often monitored over the long term to track the hydrological trajectory of the ecosystem. These measures, however, may not take into account the duration of the moisture deficit period. The annual water table moisture deficit (WTMD) at 67 sites in a single disturbed raised bog was calculated using the amount of time that the water table was at each depth below the surface during the moisture deficit season. The calculated value estimates a linearly developing deficit that dewaters the acrotelm during the moisture deficit season. At each site, plant species composition was assigned to one of eight plant community types. The approximate threshold above which bog plant communities will begin transitioning into drier types with taller shrubs and trees was a WTMD of 62 m-days. An annual climatic moisture deficit (CMD) was calculated using daily air temperature, spatially interpolated precipitation and estimated potential evapotranspiration for each site. Mixed-effects modelling of WTMD as a function CMD indicated a positive linear relation for most vegetation types, which was affected by the presence of drainage ditches, ditch blocking, fire and evapotranspiration by shrubs and trees. Tracking the WTMD and its relation to CMD may be useful for assessing ecosystem health and serve as a basis for estimating moisture deficit thresholds for bogs of conservation concern.

AB Specific discharge variations within a mesoscale catchment were studied on the basis of three synoptic sampling campaigns. These were conducted during stable flow conditions within the Krycklan catchment study area in northern Sweden. During each campaign, about 80 individual locations were measured for discharge draining from catchment areas ranging between 0.12 and 67 km(2). These discharge samplings allowed for the comparison between years within a given season (September 2005 versus September 2008) and between seasons within a given year (May 2008 versus September 2008) of specific discharge across this boreal landscape. There was considerable variability in specific discharge across this landscape. The ratio of the interquartile range (IQR) defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the specific discharges to the median of the specific discharges ranged from 37% to 43%. Factor analysis was used to explore potential relations between landscape characteristics and the specific discharge observed for 55 of the individual locations that were measured in all three synoptic sampling campaigns. Percentage wet area (i.e., wetlands, mires, and lakes) and elevation were found to be directly related to the specific discharge during the drier September 2008 sampling while potential annual evaporation was found to be inversely related. There was less of a relationship determined during the wetter post spring flood May 2008 sampling and the late summer rewetted September 2005 sampling. These results indicate the ability of forests to "dry out" parts of the catchment over the summer months while wetlands "keep wet" other parts. To demonstrate the biogeochemical implications of such spatiotemporal variations in specific discharge, we estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports with available data for the May 2008 and September 2008 samplings using both the spatially variable observed specific discharges and the spatially constant catchment average values. The average absolute difference in DOC export for the various subcatchments between using a variable and using a constant specific discharge was 28% for the May 2008 sampling and 20% for the September 2008 sampling.

AB Concentrations and compositions of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC, respectively) and aromatic compounds including lignin were analyzed in water samples from 17 rivers flowing into Hudson Bay, northern Canada. These rivers incorporate basins to the south with no permafrost to basins in the north with continuous permafrost, and dominant vegetation systems that include Boreal Forest, the Hudson Plains, Taiga Shield, and Tundra. Major latitudinal trends in organic carbon and lignin concentrations and compositions were evident, with both DOC and dissolved lignin concentrations dominating over their particulate counterparts and exhibiting significant correlations with total dissolved and suspended solids, respectively. The composition of lignin reaction products in terms of the syringyl, cinnamyl, and vanillyl compositions indicate mixed sources of vascular land plant-derived organic carbon, with woody gymnosperms contributions dominating in the southern river basins whereas nonwoody angiosperm sources were more important in the most northerly rivers. The composition of nonlignin aromatic compounds, which provides a tracer for nonvascular plant contributions, suggests stronger contributions from Sphagnum mosses to dissolved organic matter in rivers below the tree line, including those with large peat bogs in their basins. Acid/aldehyde ratios of the lignin products together with C-14 data for DOC in selected rivers indicate that DOC has generally undergone greater alteration than POC. Interestingly, several northern rivers exhibited relatively old DOC according to the C-14 data suggesting that either old DOC is being released from permafrost or old DOC survives river transport in these rivers.
   Plain Language Summary Dissolved and particulate compounds characteristic of plants have been examined at the outflows of 17 rivers entering Hudson Bay. The river basins, which occupy a wide expanse in latitude, range from no permafrost to complete permafrost, and a wide varied of vegetation types depending on the climate within the basins. The data clearly distinguish between rivers draining areas south of the treeline and those draining tundra to the north. Carbon-14 data for DOC in 8 rivers suggests that old material is being released into several rivers including the most northerly. The baseline provided by these data should help to understand the rapid change this region is going through as warming thaws permafrost and promotes vegetation changes.

AB The manager of the Lavours Natural Reserve attends since the late eighties to a drying of parts of the peat bog. To better understand the ecological processes, a better understanding of the hydrological functioning is necessary. The reserve was prospected to upgrade the cartography of the drainage network and to provide a vision of the water flow dynamic. Further, the evolution of network drainage through time was explained by digitalizing historic maps available. Historical values of altitude were compared to recent data to estimate the subsidence of the peat bog. The overall results show the significant impact of recent developments on the drying of peat, whether across the marsh (ditches, valves) or larger scale (channelization of the Rhone River). Highlighting hydrological processes in the reserve can guide the manager in his actions to preserve the environment.

AB Wetlands have been identified as important sites of mercury methylation in catchments, but the range of wetland types and their geographic distribution for which methylmercury fluxes are reported in the literature are limited. Linkages among wetland hydrology, total mercury and methylmercury concentrations and fluxes, and other water quality parameters were assessed in a temperate forested swamp in Southern Ontario, Canada. Two hydrogeomorphically distinct stream reaches within the wetland exhibited differences in wetland-stream hydrologic connectivity, which strongly influenced mercury dynamics. Total mercury flux from both reaches to the downstream was highest during flow conditions in which the wetland and stream were hydrologically connected. The wetland as a whole was a net sink for total mercury and a net source for methylmercury to the downstream system. Both total mercury and methylmercury concentrations were related to dissolved and particulate organic carbon in stream waters, but these relationships were dependent upon the sampling location and flow conditions. Throughout the wetland, methylmercury concentrations exhibited temporal relationships with sulfate concentrations. Further, despite short surface water residence times, periods of wetland and stream disconnect and high pH (approx. 8) in surface water, methylmercury fluxes from this wetland to the downstream were similar to those from more stagnant and acidic wetlands.

AB We designed artificial neural networks to model daily total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (N-tot) and total phosphorus (P-tot) concentrations in streamwater and used the simulated concentrations to predict future fluxes under scenarios of climate change. The streams drain two forested catchments located in southern and eastern Finland. In the period 1990-2000, observed TOC, N-tot and P-tot concentrations were in the range 2-60 mg C L-1, 0.1-1.4 mg N L-1 and 1-60 mu g P L-1 with mean discharge per unit area in the range of 10-15 L s(-1) km(-2) for the three streams.
   Artificial neural networks consisting of 13 input variables, 1 hidden layer with 7 nodes and 1 output variable each were trained with the backpropagation algorithm to estimate the concentration of TOC, N-tot and P-tot in streamwater. Daily air temperature, precipitation and runoff observations were included in the input variables as well as catchment characteristics such as catchment area and the area of lakes and peatland within the catchment. The networks performed well in comparison with the alternative method, i.e. flow-weighted average concentrations. Artificial neural networks are a useful method for creating blackbox models of streamwater quality in cases where the involved processes are too complex to simulate directly.
   Projected changes in monthly temperature and precipitation under a changing climate were used to generate daily temperature and precipitation series for the 2050s. Daily runoff values for this hypothetical year were produced with an operational runoff model. Carbon and nitrogen loads were calculated for the 2050s using the neural network models of TOC, N-tot and P-tot concentrations. The low change scenario resulted in annual fluxes close to present fluxes, while the high change scenario gave an increase of approximately 26% of annual TOC, N-tot and P-tot fluxes.

AB 1. Modern records of 165 species of wetland beetle (Haliplidae, Hygrobiidae, Noteridae, Dytiscidae, Gyrinidae, Georissidae, Hydrochidae, Helophoridae, Hydrophilidae, Hydraenidae, Scirtidae, Dryopidae, Elmidae, Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae) were assembled for analysis.
   2. Two hundred and eighty nine modern lists of seven or more species of water beetle from sites in Ireland were subjected to multivariate analysis.
   3. Ten assemblage types were identified using TWINSPAN. Habitats typical of these assemblages are: A. deep rivers; B. rivers with riffles; C. puddles; D. canals and lakes with rich vegetation; E. ponds and ditches; F. turloughs; G. natural, minerotrophic fens; H. base-flushed cutover bogs; I. peat bogs; J. montane flushes. The distribution of these types is discussed.
   4. Ordination of site data by DECORANA indicated that the important environmental variables dictating water beetle assemblage type in Ireland were: flow; water permanence; exposure; type of substratum. Acidity could not be isolated as a determinant, except within the analysis of assemblage types conducted using TWINSPAN. DECORANA isolated one brackish site as an outlier but salinity was not otherwise a major factor, probably because few brackish sites were included in the analysis.
   5. The number of modern records for each species was used to provide a provisional set of species-quality scores. A simple rationale was devised to weight these scores in favour of relict species and against elusive species, species with short-lived adults and species primarily associated with man-made habitats.
   6. The average species-quality score per site and the number of species recorded were used to rank sites within each TWINSPAN end-group. The most diverse sites with the highest quality were some turloughs, rich fens and base-flushed peat cutting complexes. Some montane lakes and flushes with relatively few species had high species-quality scores.

AB Quantifying the contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to C sequestration in soils requires knowledge about extent and rate of its biodegradation. Since degradation experiments are time consuming, estimating the biodegradability of DOM by more easily measurable properties seems valuable. Our goal was therefore to investigate the biodegradation of DOM of different origin and to relate its extent and rate to properties such as UV absorbance, synchronous and emission scan fluorescence, XAD-8 sorption chromatography and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. We extracted DOM from 13 different samples (maize straw, forest floors, peats, agricultural soils) and carried out a 90-day liquid incubation experiment. DOM biodegradation was quantified by CO(2) evolution. Rapidly and slowly mineralizable portions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a measure of labile and stable DOC and the respective mineralization rate constants and half-lives were calculated by a double exponential model. The extent and rate of DOM biodegradation from less humified organic material (straw, litter and fermentation layers of forest floors) were high resulting in 61-93% of DOC being mineralized. The labile fraction comprised 59-88% of total DOC. DOM extracted from agricultural soils was of an intermediate biodegradability with a CO(2) evolution comprising 17-32% of total DOC. Labile DOC represented 14-25% of total DOC. DOM extracted from peats and Oa forest floor layers was relatively stable (mineralization of 4-9% of total DOC, labile DOC: 3-6%). The half-life of the labile DOC pool was short (2-5 days), whereas that of the stable DOC pool ranged from 0.2 years (DOM from less humified material) to 8.6 years (DOM from the Oa layer under spruce). Extent and rate of DOM biodegradation were closely but nonlinearly related to DOM properties. Solutions exceeding a threshold value of UV absorbance, aromaticity, XAD-8 adsorbable C or of humification indices derived from fluorescence spectra or having carbohydrate contents below a certain level were stable against biodegradation. Relatively simple methods like UV spectroscopy, XAD-8 fractionation and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were suitable to estimate the biodegradation of DOM.

AB Temporal and longitudinal variations in the chemistry of two tributary streams of Woods Lake in the Adirondack Mountains of New York were monitored before and after a watershed CaCO3 application. One subcatchment of the lake had a large beaver pond and wetland at its headwaters, while the second was free-flowing. Treatment of both subcatchments with CaCO3 resulted in an immediate increase in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) associated with Ca2+ release. The extent and duration of the response to the treatment were greater in the wetland-impacted stream. Aluminum was retained and complexed with organic solutes generated within the beaver-pond. In the free-flowing stream, NO3- concentration increased significantly after the manipulation; this pattern was not evident in the wetland-impacted stream. Net retention of SO42- was evident in the beaver pond prior to and following treatment, and this response was enhanced after the watershed liming. Comparisons of beaver pond inlet/outlet concentrations, mass balance calculations, and in-pond profiles of chemical parameters revealed patterns of retention of SO42-, NO3- and Al, and release of Fe2+, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NH4+ in the wetland during the summer before CaCO3 treatment. Post-treatment releases df Ca2+ from the near-sediment zone in the beaver pond corresponded to anoxic periods in mid- to late-summer and under ice in winter. These findings demonstrate the importance of increased microbial processing of organic matter, along with high partial pressure of CO2 (Pco(2)) in facilitating the dissolution of the applied CaCO3. Dissolved silica (H4SiO4) was retained in the wetland during the summer prior to treatment but was released after the manipulation. This phenomenon may reflect the dissolution of diatom frustules or silicate minerals in the wetland at higher pH and DOC concentrations. Within two years of the CaCO3 treatment 60% of the CaCO3 applied to the beaver pond and surrounding wetland was dissolved and transported from the pond, in contrast to only 2.2% of the CaCO3 applied to the upland subcatchment draining into the wetland. These results, coupled with high quantities of exchangeable Ca2+ found in sediments and on Sphagnum mosses in the pond, demonstrate the importance of hydrologic source areas and wetlands in facilitating the dissolution of added CaCO3, and in regulating the production of chemical species important in ANC generation.

AB Episodic acidification during snowmelt is a natural phenomenon that can be intensified by acidic deposition from heavy industry. In Canada's oil sands region, acid deposition is estimated to be as much as 5% of the Canadian total and large tracks of northeastern Alberta are considered acid-sensitive because of extensive peatland habitats with poorly weathered soils. To identify the frequency, duration and severity of acidification episodes during snowmelt (the predominant hydrological period for delivery of priority pollutants from atmospheric oil sands emissions to surface waters), a 25-year record (1989 to 2014) of automated water quality data (pH, temperature, conductivity) was assembled for 3 rivers along with a shorter record (2012-2014) for another 2 rivers. Acidic episodes (pH < 7, ANC < 0) were recorded during 39% of all 83 snowmelt events. The severity (duration x magnitude) of episodic acidification increased exponentially over the study period (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01) and was strongly correlated (P < 0.01) with increasing maximum air temperature and weakly correlated with regional land development (P = 0.06). Concentrations of aluminum and 11 priority pollutants (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se, Ag, TI and Zn) were greatest (P <0.01) during low (<6.5) pH episodes, particularly when coincident with high discharge, such that aluminum and copper concentrations were at times high enough to pose a risk to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although low pH (pH < 6.5) was observed during only 8% of 32 acidification episodes, when present, low pH typically lasted 10 days. Episodic surface water acidification during snowmelt, and its potential effects on aquatic biota, is therefore an important consideration in the design of long-term monitoring of these typically alkaline (pH = 7.72 +/- 0.05) rivers.

AB High-latitude environments store approximately half of the global organic carbon pool in peatlands, organic soils and permafrost, while large Arctic rivers convey an estimated 18-50 Tg Ca-1 to the Arctic Ocean. Warming trends associated with climate change affect dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from terrestrial to riverine environments. However, there is limited consensus as to whether exports will increase or decrease due to complex interactions between climate, soils, vegetation, and associated production, mobilization and transport processes. A large body of research has focused on large river system DOC and dissolved organic matter (DOM) lability and observed trends conserved across years, whereas investigation at smaller watershed scales show that thermokarst and fire have a transient impact on hydrologically mediated solute transport. This study, located in theWolf Creek Research Basin situated similar to 20 km south of Whitehorse, YT, Canada, utilizes a nested design to assess seasonal and annual patterns of DOC and DOM composition across diverse landscape types (headwater, wetland and lake) and watershed scales. Peak DOC concentration and export occurred during freshet, as is the case in most northern watersheds; however, peaks were lower than a decade ago at the headwater site Granger Creek. DOM composition was most variable during freshet with high A254 and SUVA(254) and low FI and BIX. DOM composition was relatively insensitive to flow variation during summer and fall. The influence of increasing watershed scale and downstream mixing of landscape contributions was an overall dampening of DOC concentrations and optical indices with increasing groundwater contribution. Forecasted vegetation shifts, enhanced permafrost and seasonal thaw, earlier snowmelt, increased rainfall and other projected climate-driven changes will alter DOM sources and transport pathways. The results from this study support a projected shift from predominantly organic soils (high aromaticity and less fresh) to decomposing vegetation (more fresh and lower aromaticity). These changes may also facilitate flow and transport via deeper flow pathways and enhance groundwater contributions to runoff.

AB Over the next century, near-surface permafrost across the circumpolar Arctic is expected to degrade significantly. particularly for land areas south of 70 degrees N. This is likely to cause widespread impacts on arctic hydrology, ecology, and trace gas emissions. Here. we present a review of recent Studies investigating linkages between permafrost dynamics and river biogeochemistry in the Arctic, including consideration of likely impacts that warming-induced changes in permafrost may be having (or will have in the future) oil the delivery of organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and major ions to the Arctic Ocean. These interacting processes can be highly complex and undoubtedly exhibit spatial and temporal variabilities associated with current permafrost conditions, sensitivity to permafrost thaw, mode of permafrost degradation (overall permafrost thaw, active layer deepening, and/or thermokarst processes), and environmental characteristics of watersheds (e.g. land cover, soil type, and topography). One of the most profound consequences of permafrost thaw projected for the future is that the arctic terrestrial freshwater system is likely to experience a transition from a Surface water-dominated system to a groundwater-dominated system. Along with many other cascading impacts from this transition, mineral-rich groundwater may become an important contributor to streamflow, in addition to the currently dominant contribution from mineral-poor surface water. Most Studies observe or predict an increase in major ion, phosphate, and silicate export with this shift towards greater groundwater contributions. However, we see conflicting accounts of whether the delivery of inorganic nitrogen and organic matter will increase or decrease with warming and permafrost thaw. It is important to note that uncertainties in the predictions of the total flux of biogeochemical constituents are tightly linked to future uncertainties in discharge of rivers. Nonetheless, it is clear that over the next Century there will be important shifts in the river transport of organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and major ions. which may in turn have critical implications for primary production and carbon cycling oil arctic shelves and in the Arctic Ocean basin interior.

AB We show that sediment respiration is one of the key factors contributing to the high CO2 supersaturation in and evasion from Finnish lakes, and evidently also over large areas in the boreal landscape, where the majority of the lakes are small and shallow. A subpopulation of 177 randomly selected lakes (< 100 km(2)) and 32 lakes with the highest total phosphorus (P-tot) concentrations in the Nordic Lake Survey (NLS) data base were sampled during four seasons and at four depths. Patterns of CO2 concentrations plotted against depth and time demonstrate strong CO2 accumulation in hypolimnetic waters during the stratification periods. The relationship between O-2 departure from the saturation and CO2 departure from the saturation was strong in the entire data set (r(2)=0.79, n=2 740, P < 0.0001). CO2 concentrations were positively associated with lake trophic state and the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment. In contrast, CO2 concentrations negatively correlated with the peatland percentage indicating that either input of easily degraded organic matter and/or nutrient load from agricultural land enhance degradation. The average lake-area-weighted annual CO2 evasion based on our 177 randomly selected lakes and all Finnish lakes > 100 km(2) (Rantakari & Kortelainen, 2005) was 42 g C m(-2) LA (lake area), approximately 20% of the average annual C accumulation in Finnish forest soils and tree biomass (covering 51% of the total area of Finland) in the 1990s. Extrapolating our estimate from Finland to all lakes of the boreal region suggests a total annual CO2 evasion of about 50 TgC, a value upto 40% of current estimates for lakes of the entire globe, emphasizing the role of small boreal lakes as conduits for transferring terrestrially fixed C into the atmosphere.

AB Stable isotope measures in organic matter are frequently used as indicators of past climate change. Although such analyses can provide valuable information, there is considerable uncertainty associated with studies of organic-rich sediments, especially those from Arctic lakes and bogs. We studied stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and magnetic properties in a sediment core from a small alkaline lake with a high sedimentation rate, Lake Nattmalsvatn, Norway. There is good correspondence among the different sediment variables during the late glacial, and they seemingly reflect major climate variations such as the Allerod Interstade and the Younger Dryas, as well as the transition into the current interglacial. During the early Holocene, however, these relationships are more complex and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values do not stabilize until similar to 7,500 cal year BP. A significant excursion in all variables occurs between 6,850 and 6,500 cal year BP and is interpreted to represent climate deterioration. Holocene delta C-13 values vary little and indicate that isotopically-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake, possibly influenced by methanotrophy and high pCO(2), dominated the lake's carbon cycle. Holocene delta N-15 is similarly muted, likely due to the availability of abundant dissolved nitrogen. Bulk organic matter is probably dominated by phytoplankton remains produced beneath the ice cover in late spring and during ice breakup when isotopically-depleted DIC, pCO(2) and ammonium availability were maximal. Thus, use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 as indicators of Holocene paleoclimate and paleoproductivity variation can be challenging in a lake such as Nattmalsvatn, where ice cover isolates the basin for large parts of the year, allowing dissolved respiratory gases to accumulate in the water column. In contrast, magnetic variables appear to better track climate variations. In particular, runoff-driven influx of minerogenic sediments shows high variability that can be attributed to regional changes in Holocene winter precipitation. The most striking shifts occur between 4,000 and 2,300 cal year BP.

AB Aquatic humic substances (HS) from a bog lake water, a river water, and a groundwater were isolated after enrichment on XAD 8 columns and added to a Czapek-Dox nutrient broth which was used either in full strength or without glucose and/or NaNO3. The individual flasks were inoculated with natural microbial populations of corresponding water samples or with a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain isolated from groundwater. The presence of HS resulted In an increase of bacterial numbers in nearly all cultures incubated for 3 weeks at 25 degreesC on a shaker. HS reisolated from cultures without glucose or NaNO3 showed no or only minor quantitative differences as compared to those from sterile controls. In full strength nutrient broth up to 27% of HS were utilized. Data obtained by spectroscopic methods (UV/vis/FTIR) and elemental analysis indicated a decrease in particle size and a loss in aromaticity and aliphatic carbon in HS reisolated from the microbial cultures. Simultaneously an increase in the N content of HS was observed, which probably originated from some constituents of microbial biomass such as proteins and amino sugars. The NMR data also documented that significant transformations of HS occurred in the individual microbial cultures. After incubation, increased amounts of aromatic acids were detected in some liquid media and residual HS by GC/MS or capillary electrophoresis. H-1 NMR spectroscopy was less effective in indicating structural differences in the HS than C-13 NMR but revealed considerable detail of the,microbial degradation of riverine HS, when limited sample was available. The newly developed NMR increment analysis provided substantial detail of aromatic structures in a microbially altered HS. The microbial degradation of HS strongly depended on the composition of the HS, the species selection of the microorganisms, and to a lesser extent on the culture conditions. For any series of identical inoculum and HS, full broth media initiated the most extensive alteration of HS.

AB The regional-scale trends (south, central and north Finland) in key acidification parameters over the period 1990-2003 were studied in lakes used for monitoring of acidification (157 lakes), and the catchment characteristics that best discriminate between lakes showing recovery (significant increase in alkalinity) and those not showing recovery (no significant increase) were determined. A significant decline in sulphate concentrations occurred in 82-98% of the lakes, depending of the region. Base cation (BC) concentrations decreased for most lakes, but to a lesser extent than those Of SO4. Consequently, a significant increase in Gran alkalinity occurred in 40-92% of the lakes. The recovery from acidification has been strongest in lakes in south Finland, where both levels and decrease of S (and N) deposition have been higher compared to other regions. A significant increase in pH was detected in about 50% of the lakes in the south. Here labile aluminium concentrations also decreased in the most acidic lakes. Recovery has occurred most strongly in lakes which have SO4 as a dominant acid anion, whereas recovery has been weaker in acidified humic lakes which have organic anion as a dominant acid anion. The non-recovering lakes in south Finland have higher proportion of exposed bedrock in the catchment, and higher TOC and lower BC concentrations. In central Finland the proportion of peatland and TOC concentrations were higher and the decrease of BC concentration was steeper in non-recovering lakes than in recovering lakes. In north Finland, catchment characteristics, trend slopes and concentrations did not separate the recovering and non-recovering lakes. The non-recovering lakes were also located in regions which are acid-sensitive based on bedrock type, soil properties, weathering rate and runoff. These factors have resulted in lower concentrations and steeper downward trends for base cations. Climate change may increase the mineralization of soil organic matter and change the frequency and magnitude of runoff and organic acid episodes. An increase of these types of confounding effects on pH and alkalinity recovery may therefore be anticipated in the future.

AB Humid tropical forests have the fastest rates of organic matter decomposition globally, which often coincide with fluctuating oxygen (O-2) availability in surface soils. Microbial iron (Fe) reduction generates reduced iron [Fe(II)] under anaerobic conditions, which oxidizes to Fe(III) under subsequent aerobic conditions. We demonstrate that Fe (II) oxidation stimulates organic matter decomposition via two mechanisms: (i) organic matter oxidation, likely driven by reactive oxygen species; and (ii) increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) availability, likely driven by acidification. Phenol oxidative activity increased linearly with Fe(II) concentrations (P < 0.0001, pseudo R-2 = 0.79) in soils sampled within and among five tropical forest sites. A similar pattern occurred in the absence of soil, suggesting an abiotic driver of this reaction. No phenol oxidative activity occurred in soils under anaerobic conditions, implying the importance of oxidants such as O-2 or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in addition to Fe(II). Reactions between Fe(II) and H2O2 generate hydroxyl radical, a strong nonselective oxidant of organic compounds. We found increasing consumption of H2O2 as soil Fe(II) concentrations increased, suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced by Fe(II) oxidation explained variation in phenol oxidative activity among samples. Amending soils with Fe(II) at field concentrations stimulated short-term C mineralization by up to 270%, likely via a second mechanism. Oxidation of Fe(II) drove a decrease in pH and a monotonic increase in DOC; a decline of two pH units doubled DOC, likely stimulating microbial respiration. We obtained similar results by manipulating soil acidity independently of Fe(II), implying that Fe(II) oxidation affected C substrate availability via pH fluctuations, in addition to producing reactive oxygen species. Iron oxidation coupled to organic matter decomposition contributes to rapid rates of C cycling across humid tropical forests in spite of periodic O-2 limitation, and may help explain the rapid turnover of complex C molecules in these soils.

AB Humic-rich hydrocolloids and their metal loading in selected Gen-nan bog-waters have been characterized by a novel on-site approach. By use of an on-line multistage ultrafiltration (MST-UF) unit equipped with conventional polyethersulfone (PES)-based flat membranes (nominal cut-off 0.45, 0.22, and 0.1 mum, or 100, 50, 10, 5, 3 kDa) the hydrocolloids could be fractionated on-site in both sub-particulate and macromolecular size ranges. Characterization (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metals) of the colloid fractions obtained this way was performed off-site by use of conventional instrumental methods (carbon analyzer, AAS, ICP-OES, and TXRF (total reflection X-ray fluorescence)). Major DOC fractions of the hydrocolloids studied were found to be in the size range <5 kDa. The assessed metals (Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn) were, however, predominantly enriched in the macromolecular and sub-particulate range, depending on the metal and the sample, respectively. In addition, metal species bound to these hydrocolloids were kinetically characterized on-site by use of competitive ligand (EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate)) and metal (Cu(II)) exchange; the EDTA complexes formed and the metal ions exchanged were separated by means of a small time-controlled tangential-flow UF unit (cut-off I kDa). Bound metal fractions, in particular Al and Fe, reacted only slowly (500 to 1000 min) with EDTA; the conditional availability was 60-99%, depending on the hydrocolloid. In contrast, the Cu(II) exchange of colloid-bound metal species approached equilibrium within 5-10 min, with characteristic exchange constants, K-ex, of the order of 0.01 to 90 for the metals (Fe < Al < Zn < Mn approximate to Ca approximate to Mg). The results were clearly dependent on the water investigated. Thus detailed information on the conditional kinetic and thermodynamic stability of colloid-bound metal species could be obtained from competitive EDTA and Cu(II) exchange under on-site conditions.

AB A large bog-flow was triggered on the slopes of Carntogher, in the Sperrin Mountains of Northern Ireland, on the 10th September 1993, following a period of above average monthly rainfall and a high magnitude rainfall event on the preceding day. It is believed that high pore-water pressures were established in the peat mass as a consequence of this antecedent rainfall and the transfer of additional wafer to the site by drainage ditches and seepage. The humified basal peat liquefied and breached the surface mat of fibrous peat. Disturbed peat extended 1 km downslope and a further 1.5 km along the floodplain of the stream into which the flow became confined. A significant amount of water was released by the flow, as demonstrated by hydrographs for a gauging station 23 km downstream. Rough grazing ground and fencing were destroyed by the bog-flow and a number of sheep were kilted. Hydro-electric power to a linen mill, and fish stocks were also affected, with a total fish kill for a distance of 8 km downstream. Since the event, fish have partially recolonised this reach of the river by spawning.

AB The nitrogen (N) composition of streams draining four upland regions of Scotland was compared in samples collected monthly between April 1997 and April 1998. Stream samples were analysed for total N (TN), particulate N (PN), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Concentrations of TN were small, generally less than 1 mg l(-1), dominated by dissolved forms of N, and varied significantly between upland regions. Nitrate accounted for most of the variability in TN; largest concentrations were observed in the Southern Uplands and smallest concentrations were observed in the Highlands. Nitrate concentrations were positively correlated with the percentage cover of improved grasslands and brown forest soils and negatively correlated with the percentage cover of peat. Concentrations of DON also varied between regions, but to a lesser extent than those of NO3. Largest concentrations occurred in SW Scotland and smallest concentrations in the Cairngorms. Although a significant positive correlation between DON and DOC was observed, stream water DON content was not related to the percentage cover of peat in the catchment, as was the case for DOG. The average DOC:DON ratio was narrower for streams in the Southern Uplands than for those in the Cairngorms and Highlands. Nitrate and DON displayed contrasting seasonal trends; NO3 concentrations were larger in the winter while DON concentrations were larger in the summer. Only a small proportion, < 8% and < 7%, of TN was PN and NH4, respectively, the majority of N was present as either NO3 or DON. Nitrate was the dominant fraction (58-65%) in all regions except the Highlands where DON accounted for 57% of TN. However, the relative importance of the DON component increased in the summer in all regions. This study has demonstrated that the DON fraction is an important component of the total N transported by streams from upland catchments in Scotland. Thus, assessments of anthropogenic impacts on N losses from upland ecosystems need to consider not only the dissolved inorganic species but also DON. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Thermokarst lakes, formed during permafrost thaw in Western Siberia Plain over past tens to hundreds years, cover overall territory close to million km(2) and may represent significant source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. These acidic (3 < pH < 6) and humic [10 < dissolved organic carbon (DOC) < 50 mg/L] lakes are essentially inhabited by heterotrophic bacterioplankton with rare phytoplankton bloom occurring during warm periods. In order to understand possible effects of phytoplankton bloom on thermokarst lake hydrochemistry under climate warming scenario, we cultured pure cyanobacterium (Gloeocapsa sp.) and native cyanobacterial associate separated from the natural lake water. As substrates, sterilized thermokarst lake water and peat leachate from western Siberia were used. In these laboratory microcosm experiments which lasted 10 days, we monitored daily pH, biomass, DOC, and 40 major and trace elements. Despite significant variation of pH (4 to similar to 10.5) and biomass (a factor of 3-5), very few dissolved elements responded to massive cyanobacterial growth. The DOC varied within a factor of 1.2-1.5, exhibiting slow increase due to exometabolite production in thermokarst lake water and an initial decrease due to photodegradation in peat leachate. Elements appreciably affected by photosynthesis in both lake water and peat leachate substrates were P, Zn, Mn, and, in a lesser degree, Cd, K, Rb, Sr, Ba, Cr, Al, and U. While P, K (Rb), Mn, and Zn removal from solution during cell growth could be linked to biological demand by cyanobacteria, the adsorption of Cd, Sr, Ba, Al, Cr, U on the cell surface in response to the pH rise is most likely. Many other trace elements did not exhibit any significant evolution of the concentration during 10-day experiment either due to their strong complexation with allochthonous organic matter and essentially organic/organo-mineral colloidal status (Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Pb, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) or due to the lack of element interaction with cyanobacterial cells, via both adsorption and intracellular uptake (B, Si, V, Mo, As, Sb, Cs). Therefore, possible intensification of cyanobacterial bloom in thermokarst lakes caused by leaching of thawing peat will likely affect only few macronutrients and micronutrients such as P, K, Mn, and Zn, while the majority of trace elements bound to allochthonous DOC in the form of organic and organo-mineral colloids will not be affected by cyanobacterial biomass production and pH rise due to photosynthesis. Cyanobacterial bloom in organic-rich (20 mg DOC/L) thermokarst lakes exhibited significant potential of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, which is more than an order of magnitude higher than the CO2 evasion due to heterotrophic plankton respiration of allochthonous DOC.

AB Numerous studies report increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during the last two decades in boreal lakes and streams in Europe and North America Recently a hypothesis was presented on how various spatial and temporal factors affect the DOC dynamics It was concluded that declining sulphur deposition and thereby increased DOC solubility is the most important driver for the long-term DOC concentration trends in surface waters If this recovery hypothesis is correct the DOC levels should increase both in the soil solution as well as in the surrounding surface waters as soil pH rises and the ionic strength declines due to the reduced input of SO42- ions In this project a geochemical model was set up to calculate the net humic charge and DOC solubility trends in soils during the period 1996-2007 at two integrated monitoring sites in southern Sweden showing clear signs of acidification recovery The Stockholm Humic Model was used to investigate whether the observed DOC solubility is related to the humic charge and to examine how pH and ionic strength influence it Soil water data from recharge and discharge areas covering both podzols and riparian soils were used The model exercise showed that the increased net charge following the pH increase was in many cases counteracted by a decreased ionic strength, which acted to decrease the net charge and hence the DOC solubility Thus the recovery from acidification does not necessarily have to generate increasing DOC trends in soil solution Depending on changes in pH ionic strength and soil Al pools the trends might be positive negative or indifferent Due to the high hydraulic connectivity with the streams the explanations to the DOC trends in surface waters should be searched for in discharge areas and peat lands (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Worldwide, fens and peat lakes that used to be peat-forming systems have become a significant source of C, N and P due to increased peat decomposition. To test the hypothesis that net nutrient mineralization rates may be uncoupled from decomposition rates, we investigated decomposition and net mineralization rates of nutrients in relation to sediment and pore water characteristics. We incubated 28 non-calcareous peat sediments and floating fen soils under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We also tried to find a simple indicator to estimate the potential nutrient mobilization rates from peat sediments to the water layer by studying their relation with sediment and pore water characteristics in 44 Dutch non-calcareous peat lakes and ditches.
   Decomposition rates were primarily determined by the organic matter content, and were higher under aerobic conditions. However, highly decomposed peat sediments with low C: P and C:N ratios still showed high net nutrient mineralization rates. At Fe:PO4 ratios below 1 mol mol(-1), PO4 mobilization from the sediment to the water layer was considerable and linearly related to the pore water PO4 concentration. At higher ratios, there was a strong linear correlation between the Fe:PO4 ratio and PO4 mobilization. Hence, measuring Fe and PO4 in anaerobic sediment pore water provides a powerful tool for a quick assessment of internal PO4 fluxes. Mobilization of mineral N was largely determined by diffusion. Total sediment Fe:S ratios gave an important indication of the amount of Fe that is available to immobilize PO4. Pore water Fe concentrations decreased at ratios <1 mol mol(-1), whereas pore water PO4 concentrations and PO4 mobilization to the water layer increased.
   As PO4 mobilization rates from the sediment to the water layer contribute to almost half of the total P load in Dutch peat lakes and fens, it is of pivotal importance to examine the magnitude of internal fluxes. Dredging of the nutrient-rich upper sediment layer will only be a useful restoration measure if both the influx of P-rich water and its internal mobilization from the newly exposed, potentially more reactive peat layer are sufficiently low.

AB Stable and radiocarbon isotopic contents of dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), particulate organic C (POC) and plants were used to examine the source and turnover rate of C in natural and constructed wetlands in the Florida Everglades. DOC concentrations decreased, with P concentrations, along a water quality gradient from the agriculturally impacted areas in the northern Everglades to the more pristine Everglades National Park. delta C-13 values of DOC in the area reflect contributions of both wetland vegetation and sugarcane from agriculture. Radiocarbon ages of DOC, POC and DIC in the Everglades ranged from 2.01 ka BP to ">modern". The old C-14 ages of DOC and POC were found in impacted areas near the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in the northern Everglades. In contrast, DOC and POC in pristine marsh areas had near modern or ">modern" C-14 ages. These data indicate that a major source of POC and DOC in impacted areas is the degradation of historic peat deposits in the EAA. In the pristine areas of the marsh, DOC represents a mix of modern and historic C sources, whereas POC comes from modern primary production as indicated by positive A C-14 values, suggesting that DOC is transported farther away from its source than POC. High A C-14 values of DIC indicate that dissolution of limestone bedrock is not a significant source of DIC in the Everglades wetlands. As a restored wetland moves towards its "original" or "natural" state, the C-14 signatures of DOC should approach that of modern atmosphere. In addition, measurements of concentration and C isotopic composition of DOC in two small constructed wetlands (i.e., test cells) indicate that these freshwater wetland systems contain a labile DOC pool with rapid turnover times of 26-39 days and that the test cells are overall net sinks of DOC.

AB Riparian zones have been investigated in order to determine the processes that control the removal of agriculturally derived nitrate from groundwater: however, many gaps exist in our understanding of the functioning of riparian zones as regulators of nitrate fluxes in shallow groundwater. In this study, a reactive-transport model is applied to simulate organic carbon, nitrate, and nitrogen isotope behavior during denitrification in a river riparian zone. The model includes the reactive-tran sport processes presented by MacQuarrie and Sudicky [J. Contam. Hydrol. 47 (2001) 53], but has been extended to compute nitrogen isotope fractionation during biogeochemical reactions. Numerical simulation results have been compared to field data from a well-characterized river riparian aquifer and the comparison shows that the model captures the essential reactive-transport processes for major reactive species, including delta(15)N. A surficial peat zone is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the supply of this DOC to underlying sands and gravels by hydrodynamic processes controls the denitrification of upland nitrate flowing into the riparian zone. The model results support the previously proposed conceptual models for denitrification in riparian aquifers in that enriched delta(15)N, declining DOC, and declining groundwater NO3--N concentrations all occur within a relatively thin (1.5 m) zone. The simulated isotope enrichment factors for selected locations within the model domain range from -2% to -8parts per thousand. and it is noted that these values are significantly lower than the value specified in the model input. This suggests that it would be very difficult to derive accurate isotopic enrichment factors from a limited number of piezometers in such riparian aquifers. Numerical sensitivity analyses show that denitrification can occur at depths as great as 4 m below the ground surface, but the overall nitrate mass removal capacity of the riparian zone will decrease as the groundwater flow system becomes thicker.

AB This study assesses the major chemical processes leading to acid extremes in a small, moorland stream in mid-Wales, UK, which has been monitored since 1979. Results suggest that base cation (mainly calcium) dilution, the "sea-salt effect", and elevated nitrate pulses, are the major causes of seasonal/episodic minima in acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and that the relative importance of these drivers has remained approximately constant during 25 years of decreasing acid deposition and associated long-term chemical recovery. Many of the chemical variations causing short-term reductions in stream acidity, particularly base cation dilution and organic acid increases, are closely related to changes in water-flowpath and therefore to stream discharge. Changes in the observed pH-discharge relationship over time indicate that high-flow pH has increased more rapidly than mean-flow pH, and therefore that episodes have decreased in magnitude since 1980. However a two-box application of the dynamic model MAGIC, whilst reproducing this trend, suggests that it will not persist in the long term, with mean ANC continuing to increase until 2100, but the ANC of the upper soil (the source of relatively acid water during high-flow episodes) stabilising close to zero beyond 2030. With climate change predicted to lead to an increase in maximum flows in the latter half of the century, high-flow related acid episodes may actually become more rather than less severe in the long term, although the model suggests that this effect may be small. Two other predicted climatic changes could also detrimentally impact on acid episodes: increased severity of winter "sea-salt" episodes due to higher wind speeds during winter storms; and larger sulphate pulses due to oxidation of reduced sulphur held in organic soils, during more extreme summer droughts. At the Gwy, the near-coastal location and relatively small extent of peat soils suggest that sea-salt episodes may have the greatest influence.

AB It is widely recognised that wetlands play an important role in the hydrological cycle, influencing groundwater recharge, low flows, evaporation and floods. This has led to policies being formulated world-wide to conserve and manage wetlands to deliver these key services, especially flood risk reduction. Generic statements have often been published about wetland hydrological services but the term "wetlands" covers many land types, including wet woodlands, reedbeds, peat bogs, fens, and salt marshes. Each of these wetland types can have a hydrological function that is subtly different, making it difficult to generalise the flood reduction services of wetlands. In this paper we focus on two example wetland types (upland rain-fed wetlands and floodplain wetlands) to demonstrate why there are differences in flood functions both within and between wetland types. Upland wetlands generally tend to be flood generating areas while floodplain wetlands have a greater potential to reduce floods. However, landscape location and configuration, soil characteristics, topography, soil moisture status and management all influence whether these wetlands provide flood reduction services.

AB The biogeochemical cycle of arsenic (As) has been extensively studied over the past decades because As is an environmentally ubiquitous, nonthreshold carcinogen, which is often elevated in drinking water and food. It has been known for over a century that micro-organisms can volatilize inorganic As salts to arsines (arsine AsH3, mono-, di-, and trimethylarsines, MeAsH2, Me2AsH, and TMAs, respectively), but this part of the As cycle, with the exception of geothermal environs, has been almost entirely neglected because of a lack of suited field measurement approaches. Here, a validated, robust, and low-level field-deployable method employing arsine chemotrapping was used to quantify and qualify arsines emanating from soil surfaces in the field. Up to 240 mg/ha/y arsines was released from low-level polluted paddy soils (11.3 +/- 0.9 mg/kg As), primarily as TMAs, whereas arsine flux below method detection limit was measured from a highly contaminated mine spoil (1359 +/- 212 mg/kg As), indicating that soil chemistry is vital in understanding this phenomenon. In microcosm studies, we could show that under reducing conditions, induced by organic matter (OM) amendment, a range of soils varied in their properties, from natural upland peats to highly impacted mine-spoils, could all volatilize arsines. Volatilization rates from 0.5 to 70 mu g/kg/y were measured, and AsH3, MeAsH2, Me2AsH, and TMAs were all identified. Addition of methylated oxidated pentavalent As, namely monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), to soil resulted in elevated yearly rates of volatilization with up to 3.5% of the total As volatilized, suggesting that the initial conversion of inorganic As to MMAA limits the rate of arsine and methylarsines production by soils. The nature of OM amendment altered volatilization quantitatively and qualitatively, and total arsines release from soil showed correlation between the quantity of As and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil porewater. The global flux of arsines emanating from soils was estimated and placed in the context of As atmospheric inputs, with arsines contributing from 0.9 to 2.6% of the global budget.

AB Human-induced salinization and trace element contamination are widespread and increasing rapidly, but their interactions and environmental consequences are poorly understood. Phytoaccumulation, as the crucial entry pathway for biotoxic Cd into the human foodstuffs, correlates positively with rhizosphere salinity. Hypothesising that organic matter decreases the bioavailable Cd2+ pool and therefore restricts its phytoextraction, we assessed the effects of four salinity levels (0, 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl) and three Cd levels (0.3, 5.5 and 10.4 mg kg(-1)) in peat soil on mineral accumulation/distribution as well as vegetative growth and fruit yield parameters of muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) in a greenhouse. Salt stress reduced shoot biomass and fruit production, accompanied by increased Na and Cl and decreased K concentration in above-ground tissues. A 25- and 50-day exposure to salinity increased Cd accumulation in leaves up to 87% and 46%, respectively. Accumulation of Cd in the fruits was up to 43 times lower than in leaves and remained unaltered by salinity. Soil contamination by Cd enhanced its accumulation in muskmelon tissues by an order of magnitude compared with non-contaminated control. in the drainage solution, concentrations of Na and Cl slightly exceeded those in the irrigation solution, whereas Cd concentration in drainage solution was lower by 2-3 orders of magnitude than the total amount added. Chemical speciation and distribution modelling (NICA-Donnan) using Visual MINTEQ showed predominance of dissolved organic ligands in Cd chemisorption and complexation in all treatments; however, an increase in salt addition caused a decrease in organic Cd complexes from 99 to 71%, with free Cd 2, increasing up to 6% and Cd-chlorocomplexes up to 23%. This work highlights the importance of soil organic reactive surfaces in reducing trace element bioavailability and phytoaccumulation. Chloride salinity increased Cd accumulation in leaves but not in fruit peel and pulp. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental fate of arsenic (As) is of utmost importance as the public and political debate continues with the USEPA's recent proposal to tighten the As drinking water standard from 50 to 10 mug L-1. In natural systems, the presence of dissolved organic C (DOC) may compete with As for adsorption sites on mineral surfaces, hence increasing its potential bioavailability. Accordingly, the adsorption of arsenate [As (V)] and arsenite [As (III)] on goethite (alpha -FeOOH) was investigated in the presence of either a peat humic acid (Hap), a Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (FA) (international Humic Substances Society, St. Paul, MN), or citric acid (CA). Adsorption edges and kinetic experiments were used to examine the effects of equimolar concentrations of organic adsorbates on As adsorption. Adsorption edges were conducted across a pH range of 3 to 11, while the kinetic studies were conducted at pH 6.5 for As (V) and pH 5.0 for As (III). Both Hap and FA decreased As (V) adsorption, while CA had no effect. Humic acid reduced As (V) between pH 6 and 9 by approximate to 27%. Fulvic acid inhibited As (V) adsorption between pH 3 and 8 by a maximum of 17%. Arsenite adsorption was decreased by all three organic acids between pH 3 and 8 in the order of CA > FA approximate to Hap. The different pH regions in which Hap and FA decreased As (V) adsorption suggest that more than one functional group on these complex organic polymers may be responsible for binding to the alpha -FeOOH surface. Similarly, the relative surface affinity of the As(Ill or V) species and that of the competing organic ligand as a function of pH may play a major role in the outcome of As adsorption on alpha -FeOOH. The results of these experiments suggest that DOC substances are capable of increasing the bioavailability of As in soil and water systems in which the dominant solid phase is a crystalline iron oxide.

AB The area of wet grasslands on peat soil in the Netherlands is slowly increasing at the expense of drained, agriculturally used grasslands. This study aimed (i) to assess the contribution of wet grasslands on peat soil to methane (CH(4)) emissions, and (ii) to explain differences among sites and between years in order to improve our understanding of controlling factors. For these purposes, a field study was conducted in the period 1994-1996 in the nature preserve "Nieuwkoopse Plassen", which is a former peat mining and agricultural area. Net CH(4) emissions were measured weekly to monthly with vented closed flux chambers at three representative sites, and at ditches near these sites. Three-years average of CH(4) emissions was 7.9 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) for Drie Berken Zudde, 13.3 for Koole, and 20.4 for Brampjesgat. Ditches near the sites emitted 4.2-22.5 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1). The time-course of CH(4) emissions for all experimental sites and years was fit with a multiple linear regression model with ground water level and soil temperature as independent variables. Lowering or raising the ground water level by 5 cm could decrease or increase CH(4) emissions by 30-50%. Therefore, ground water level management of these grasslands should be done with care.

AB Understanding spatial variability of water table depth (WTD) in larger peatland area is crucial for peat conservation. This study investigated spatial patterns of WTDs in a peatland watershed of about 0.151 km(2), located in the Zoige basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Using conventional dipwells, we measured WTDs on 5/ 17/2017, 5/20/2017, 5/23/2017, 7/17/2017, and 9/18/2017 at 114, 103, 105, 77, and 81 locations, as well as peat depths (H) and elevations at 119 and 831 locations over the watershed, respectively. Then, we performed hotspot analysis and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling, showing (1) highly localized spatial patterns of WTDs, H, and S (slope gradient, calculated from elevations), and (2) the area that had statistically significant local coefficients for H ranged between 51 and 57% of the total watershed area, while that for S was only < 11%. These complex spatial patterns of WTDs were further illustrated by our results of examining WTD changes in the lateral and longitudinal directions for two types of channels, deep gullies whose beds are deep and cut through the peat layer and shallow artificial ditches. The findings suggested that spatial and temporal changes of WTDs at the watershed scale may only be examined by collecting in situ samples, which may be achieved using an efficient sampling method provided in this study.

AB Creating ditches to drain forests to improve timber production is often overlooked as an ecosystem modifier; the practice is commonplace and not easy to see, and it changes the ecosystem slowly. However, a closer look reveals a complex of feedback-regulated, largely indirect, and wide-ranging impacts of the changed hydrology on biodiversity. Our synthesis of those fragmentarily studied impacts highlights a frequent formation of unprecedented biotic assemblages with unclear long-term prospects and consequences for the ecosystem functioning. We present a context-dependent framework to support harmonizing the ditching practices with sustainable forest management a challenging but scientifically exciting task that requires novel approaches to landscape planning, silviculture, and wetland restoration.

AB This paper compares the effects of single and repeated fertilisation on the contents of potassium, Cs-134 and Cs-137 in different Scots pine compartments at different levels above ground and in the peat profile 9 years after the Chernobyl disaster. The material was collected from a ditch spacing and fertilisation experiment in Finland. Above a needle potassium concentration of 3.0 mg g(-1) in composed crown samples, Cs-137 and Cs-134 concentrations remained at about the same level but below that the values were higher on average. This potassium value corresponded to the potassium concentrations of 3.5-3.6 mg g(-1) in the current-year needles of two topmost whorls. The result indicates an enhanced radiocaesium uptake by pine trees under severe potassium deficiency. Fertilisation with potassium-containing fertilisers decreased the caesium uptake considerably. The inhibiting effect of fertilisation on caesium uptake by trees seemed to be fairly long lasting. Fertilisation had sped up the penetration of caesium downwards in the peat profile and its moving out of the active circulation of elements between soil and plants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In regions with intensive agriculture, water level fluctuation in wetlands has generally become constricted within narrow limits. Water authorities are, however, considering the re-establishment of fluctuating water levels as a management tool in biodiverse, base-rich fens ('rich fens'). This includes temporary inundation with surface water from ditches, which may play an important role in counteracting acidification in order to conserve and restore biodiversity. Inundation may result in an increased acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) for two reasons: infiltration of base-rich inundation water into peat soils, and microbial alkalinity generation under anaerobic conditions. The main objectives of this study were to test whether short-term (2 weeks) summer inundation is more effective than short-term winter inundation to restore the ANC in the upper 10 cm of non-floating peat soils, and to explain potential differences. Large-scale field experiments were conducted for five years in baserich fens and Sphagnum-dominated poor fens. Winter inundation did not result in increased porewater ANC, because infiltration was inhibited in the waterlogged peat and evapotranspiration rates were relatively low. Also, low temperatures limit microbial alkalinity generation. In summer, however, when temperature and evapotranspiration rates are higher, inundation resulted in increased porewater Ca and HCO3- concentrations, but only in areas with characteristic rich fen bryophytes. This increase was not only due to stronger infiltration into the soil, but also to higher microbial alkalinity generation under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, porewater ANC did not increase in Sphagnum-plots as a result of the ability of Sphagnum spp. to acidify their environment. In both rich and poor fens, flooding-induced P-mobilization remained sufficiently low to safeguard P-limited vegetation. NO3- and NH4+ dynamics showed no considerable changes either. In conclusion, short-term summer inundation with base-rich and nutrient-poor surface water is considered beneficial in the management of non-floating rich fens, and much more effective than winter inundation.

AB Restoration of rich fens is commonly attempted through local-scale measures, such as removal of sod or blockage of ditches. However, regional-scale restoration measures, that aim to re-establish the original hydrology in which rich fens developed, might have a more long-lasting effect. We investigated the effect of local- and regional-scale restoration measures on a vulnerable rich fen in the Naardermeer nature reserve in the Netherlands. We compared water quality and vegetation composition of the fen before and after the restoration measures, almost 30 years apart. Overall rich fen species increased and although this indicates the desired increased supply of fresh mineral-rich groundwater to the fen, continued succession towards poor fen vegetation has not been prevented in the entire fen. Despite sod layer removal, we observed an increase in aPolytrichum-dominated vegetation in patches that are primarily fed by rainwater. Our findings confirm results from a previous study which showed that brackish palaeo-groundwater is still contributing substantially to the water balance of the fen, especially in periods of precipitation deficit. We conclude that the local- and regional-scale restoration measures have been successful in increasing the abundance of rich fen species in parts of the fen. However, considering the pressures of climate change and high atmospheric N-deposition on the fen, it is uncertain whether rich fen species can be sustained in quite nutrient-poor conditions in the future. Therefore, there is a need for continued management that keeps the nutrient-poor and mineral-rich conditions of the fen intact.

   SLOPE; FIRE; VEGETATION
AB Rapid climate change at high latitudes is projected to increase wildfire extent in tundra ecosystems by up to fivefold by the end of the century. Tundra wildfire could alter terrestrial silica (SiO2) cycling by restructuring surface vegetation and by deepening the seasonally thawed active layer. These changes could influence the availability of silica in terrestrial permafrost ecosystems and alter lateral exports to downstream marine waters, where silica is often a limiting nutrient. In this context, we investigated the effects of the largest Arctic tundra fire in recent times on plant and peat amorphous silica content and dissolved silica concentration in streams. Ten years after the fire, vegetation in burned areas had 73% more silica in aboveground biomass compared to adjacent, unburned areas. This increase in plant silica was attributable to significantly higher plant silica concentration in bryophytes and increased prevalence of silica-rich gramminoids in burned areas. Tundra fire redistributed peat silica, with burned areas containing significantly higher amorphous silica concentrations in the O-layer, but 29% less silica in peat overall due to shallower peat depth post burn. Despite these dramatic differences in terrestrial silica dynamics, dissolved silica concentration in tributaries draining burned catchments did not differ from unburned catchments, potentially due to the increased uptake by terrestrial vegetation. Together, these results suggest that tundra wildfire enhances terrestrial availability of silica via permafrost degradation and associated weathering, but that changes in lateral silica export may depend on vegetation uptake during the first decade of postwildfire succession.
   Plain Language Summary Climate change in the Arctic is leading to more frequent and severe wildfire in Arctic tundra ecosystems. Studying the silica (SiO2) cycle in Arctic ecosystems is important because the amount of silica exported from land to sea can control uptake by marine primary producers in Arctic coastal waters. We investigated how tundra wildfire affects silica cycling by returning to a large Arctic wildfire 10 years after the burn to collect samples of stream water, vegetation, and peat. We found that plants growing on burned landscapes contained 73% more silica in their aboveground biomass compared to unburned areas nearby. While the fire thawed permafrost underneath it, we did not observe increased levels of silica in streams draining burned areas. This pattern indicates that elevated rates of silica uptake via plants may prevent increased silica export to marine waters following tundra wildfire. We conclude that the effect of tundra fire on silica cycling depends on the recovery trajectories of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic.
   Key Points
   After the largest Arctic tundra fire in recent times, burned vegetation had 73% more silica in aboveground biomass, due to higher plant silica concentration in bryophytes and increased prevalence of silica-rich gramminoids in burned areas Wildfire redistributed peat silica stocks, with higher concentrations, but 29% lower total stocks due to shallower peat layer postburn Dissolved silica concentration in tributaries draining burned catchments did not differ from unburned catchments, indicating that accelerated vegetation uptake may limit lateral silica export during the first decade of post wildfire succession

AB In contrast to good understanding of chemical composition of the river suspended matter (RSM) of large rivers, small rivers remain strongly understudied, despite the fact that they can provide valuable information on mechanisms of RSM generation and transport depending on key environmental parameters of the watershed. This is especially true for permafrost-affected boreal and subarctic territories, subjected to strong modification due to permafrost thaw and landscape changes under climate warming. We selected Earth's largest frozen peatland zone, the western Siberia Lowland (WSL) in order to test an impact of climate warming, permafrost thaw and landscape zone changes on riverine transport of particulate material from mainland to the Arctic Ocean. We sampled 33 small and medium size WSL rivers during spring flood, summer baseflow and autumn flood over a 1700 km gradient of climate and permafrost. Major and trace elements in particulate (>0.45 mu m) and dissolved (<0.45 mu m) fraction were analyzed. We hypothesize that future increase in active layer thickness and the change of dominant landscape from bogs and lakes to forest can be predicted via analyzing the actual pattern of RSM chemical composition across various permafrost zones and landscape parameters of WSL river watershed. We observed a minimum concentration of Li, Mg, Na, K, Rb, V, Cr, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Al, Ga, Y, REEs, Nb, W, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th and U in RSM collected from isolated and sporadic permafrost zones. Considering all seasons together, the presence of forest in the permafrost-bearing zone increased particulate concentrations of all alkalis and alkaline-earth elements, B, As, Nb, Mn, Co, Al, Ga, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th. This is consistent with element mobilization from mineral horizons that become available for interacting with soil fluids under forested regions. Lakes retained particulate alkaline-earths, Fe, Mn, Co, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates (TE3+, TE4+). The concentration of lithogenic low-soluble elements (TE3+, TE4+) in the RSM strongly increased with the river size (watershed area).
   Compared to the world RSM average, the WSL rivers exhibited lower concentrations of all elements except Mn and P and a low share of suspended elements relative to total (suspended + dissolved) forms of trace metals and of low-mobility (lithogenic) elements. Likely reasons for these features are: (i) low runoff and low RSM concentration as there is no rock and mineral substrate exposed to physical weathering in WSL peatland; (ii) organic, rather than mineral, nature of surrounding "solid" substrates and as a result, organic rather than silicate nature of RSM, and (iii) high DOC and Fe concentration leading to high concentrations of typically low-solubilty elements in the dissolved (<0.45 mu m) fraction due to colloids.
   From a climate warming perspective, the increase in active layer thickness and involvement of mineral horizons into soil fluid migration in discontinuous to continuous permafrost zone will likely increase the share of particulate fraction in total element transport for many soluble (labile) elements and also lithogenic elements in WSL rivers. At the same time, permafrost boundary shift northward may decrease particulate concentrations of most major and TE in rivers of discontinuous permafrost zone. The lake drainage and forest colonization of tundra and bogs in the permafrost-affected part of WSL may increase the concentration of alkali and alkaline-earth elements, divalent metals and trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates. As a result, export of particulate metal micronutrients and toxicants from the WSL territory to the Arctic Ocean may increase. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to recognize the vertical variability in the content of different forms of carbon and nitrogen in Histosols of a forest spring niche located in the upper course of the Kamienna Creek (the Slupia River catchment). Soil samples were taken from three profiles and analyzed with standard methods used in the soil science. Analyses included the degree of peat mass decomposition, content of soil organic matter, pH, content of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and forms of carbon and nitrogen after sequential extraction in 0.25 mol KCl dm(-3), 0.25 mol H2SO4 dm(-3) and 2.5 mol H2SO4 dm(-3). The following fractions were isolated: nonhydrolyzable carbon (NHC) and nitrogen (NHN), weakly hydrolyzable carbon (WHC) and nitrogen (WHN), easy hydrolyzable carbon (EHC) and nitrogen (EHN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and its ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) form.
   The Histosols were t up to 0.9 m hick. The degree of peat mass decomposition was 3-9. The content of organic matter ranged from 317.3 to 829.0 g kg(-1), and TOC from 162.2 to 459.5 g kg(-1). The soils were acid at pH(H2O) equal 5.6-6.5. The NHC form predominated in TOC. The content of the form was 117.3-399.7 g kg(-1), and contribution in TOC 72.3-89.2%. Soils contained 17.1-41.7 g kg(-1) of WHC (4.5-10.6% in TOC), and 27.3-62.2 g kg(-1) EHC (6.4-17.2% in TOC). The soils were rich in total nitrogen (TN), whose content was 11.1-33.6 g kg(-1). The content of NHN was 5.50-18.89 g kg(-1) (37.18-69.84% in TN), WHN 4.28-14.17 g kg(-1) (21.23-43.72 in TN), EHN 1.16-8.02 g kg(-1) (8.06-24.32% in TN), and DON ranged from 0.029-0.394 g kg(-1) (0.10-1.20% in TN). The concentration of NH4-N was 0.043-0.337 g kg(-1), and NO3-N 0.003-0.012 g kg(-1). Similar regularities in the vertical distribution of the investigated forms of carbon and nitrogen were observed in every soil profile. In general, an increase in the nonhydrolyzable forms of carbon and nitrogen and a decrease in EHC, EHN, DON and NH4-N were observed with depth. The maximum concentration of EHC, EHN, DON and NH4-N found in bog horizons is probably an effect of the highest intensity of biochemical processes in the topsoil and the influx of fresh litterfall. A constant underground low of water and leaching are the factors which caused a low contribution of labile forms of C and N in lower parts of the soil profiles.

AB Upland waters are located upstream of the areas of direct human disturbance and intensive land use through industry, agriculture and urbanisation and are valued particularly as sources of potable water and as biodiverse freshwater habitats. Nonetheless, the impact of human activity can be detected even in some of the most remote lakes on the planet due to the effects of long-range transport of air pollutants and global climate change. In the UK, upland waters are threatened by a range of pressures including not only atmospheric deposition of acidic compounds, trace metals and organic pollutants, but also climate change, nutrient enrichment by deposited nitrogen and changing land-use or land management regimes. The threat from acid deposition has declined sharply since the 1980s but its legacy remains a major concern; recovery is taking place but even assuming a complete chemical and biological recovery to a pre-industrial baseline were possible, dynamic models suggest that this could take another 100 years. However, current climate change projections suggest that by then, UK upland waters will become much warmer, with lower summer streamflows, higher winter streamflows and a much reduced or even absent influence of snowfall and lake ice-cover. Hence there is no rationale for aspiring to the return of pre-industrial "reference" conditions because climate change is likely to shift the climatic baseline at an unprecedented rate. Meanwhile, expansion of forest planting, changing grazing regimes and management measures for peatland restoration, among other land-use pressure, will affect upland catchments in the UK with potentially major repercussions for aquatic ecosystems, both positive and negative. The challenge for scientists, policymakers and other stakeholders in the uplands is to determine not only the trajectory of change in upland waters, but also to define the ecological endpoints needed to provide the optimum range of ecosystem services for society. Integrated monitoring of the kind exemplified by the papers in this volume is a fundamental prerequisite in this regard. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the source of water supplying high-altitude wetlands in Colorado has gained importance as water supply demands increase in the region. The fens of South Park are rare in their very high water nutrient concentrations and they support a valuable ecosystem dependent on groundwater discharge. Chemical and stable isotopic techniques are applied to determine the proportion of surface water and groundwater discharging at Tarryall Mire and Link Ditch Fen. The major ion chemistry of the fens can be evolved from either surface water or groundwater using a reasonable sequence of reactions driven by decomposition of organic matter, reduction of pH and dissolution of carbonate minerals, resulting in large increases in calcium and bicarbonate concentrations in the fens. The water chemistry alone is a poor indicator of fen-water origin because biologically mediated reactions alter the water chemistry. By contrast, the absence of geothermal exchange reactions and evaporative effects allow the stable isotopic composition of the water to be an excellent tracer in this environment. The stable isotopic data indicate that local groundwater contributes significantly to the fens, providing over three-quarters of the water. A high degree of variability in the contribution of groundwater to the fens is observed both spatially and temporally. By late summer, streams in the wetland appear to be gaining and exhibit characteristics of discharged groundwater.

AB 1. Boreal headwater streams typically receive large contributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from wetland and forest soils and can exhibit high CO2 effluxes, but little is known about how stream biofilm respiration of DOM responds to carbon and nutrient substrates in boreal catchments.
   2. The aim of this study was to assess (i) the response of heterotrophic biofilms to increased availability of labile carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and (ii) how this response varies across sites differing in the source of catchment organic matter.
   3. Normalised biofilm respiration rates (R-Biofilm) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of DOM sources derived from wetland, deciduous forest and ponds were up to 10 times greater than for coniferous forest DOM. Experimental additions of bog- and pond-derived DOM stimulated R-Biofilm in coniferous forest sites (1.5-2.5 times), adding further weight to the evidence for differing responses to stream DOM sources in this boreal catchment.
   4. Mineralisation of added glucose by the biofilms was only increased by added N and P, coinciding with a reduction in mineralisation of the extant stream DOM. These findings suggest that increases in labile C, N and P can reduce biofilm mineralisation of stream dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus, perhaps due to the greater energy required to access the more complex DOM.
   5. In 15 of 19 experiments, the addition of glucose had no effect on biofilm mineralisation of stream DOC (R-DOC). In the presence of added N and P, however, R-DOC decreased by 30 to 38% with the addition of glucose at sites with the most active biofilms in summer. When glucose was added alone, conversely, R-DOC was stimulated (40-50%) at these same sites in autumn, when biofilm respiration was lower and DOM more aromatic and less carbohydrate-rich. Combined, these results suggest labile C sources, such as algal exudates, may (i) compete as a source of energy and/or stimulate the incorporation rather than mineralisation of the more N- and P-rich stream DOM or (ii) stimulate the mineralisation of stream DOM, potentially depending upon nutrient availability and the composition of stream DOM.

AB Agricultural peatlands are essential for a myriad of ecosystem functions and play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle through C sequestration. Management of these agricultural peatlands takes place at different spatial scales, ranging from local to landscape management, and drivers of soil microbial community structure and function may be scale-dependent. Effective management for an optimal biogeochemical functioning thus requires knowledge of the drivers on soil microbial community structure and functioning, as well as the spatial scales upon which they are influenced. During two field campaigns, we examined the importance of different drivers (i.e., soil characteristics, nutrient management, vegetation composition) at two spatial scales (local vs. landscape) for, respectively, the soil microbial community structure (determined by PLFA) and soil microbial community functional capacity (as assessed by CLPP) in agricultural peatlands. First, we show by an analysis of PLFA profiles that the total microbial biomass changes with soil moisture and relative C:P nutrient availability. Secondly, we showed that soil communities are controlled by a distinct set of drivers at the local, as opposed to landscape, scale. Community structure was found to be markedly different between areas, in contrast to community function which showed high variability within areas. We further found that microbial structure appears to be controlled more at a landscape scale by nutrient-related variables, whereas microbial functional capacity is driven locally through plant community feedbacks. Optimal management strategies within such peatlands should therefore consider the scale-dependent action of soil microbial community drivers, for example by first optimizing microbial structure at the landscape scale by targeted areal management, and then optimizing soil microbial function by local vegetation management.

AB Advective flows of seawater and fresh groundwater through coastal aquifers form a unique ecohydrological interface, the subterranean estuary (STE). Here, freshly produced marine organic matter and oxygen mix with groundwater, which is low in oxygen and contains aged organic carbon (OC) from terrestrial sources. Along the groundwater flow paths, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is degraded and inorganic electron acceptors are successively used up. Because of the different DOM sources and ages, exact degradation pathways are often difficult to disentangle, especially in highenergy environments with dynamic changes in beach morphology, source composition, and hydraulic gradients. From a case study site on a barrier island in the German North Sea, we present detailed biogeochemical data from freshwater lens groundwater, seawater, and beach porewater samples collected over different seasons. The samples were analyzed for physico-chemistry (e.g., salinity, temperature, dissolved silicate), (reduced) electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen, nitrate, and iron), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOM was isolated and molecularly characterized via soft-ionization ultra high-resolution mass spectrometry, and molecular formulae were identified in each sample. We found that the islands' freshwater lens harbors a surprisingly high DOM molecular diversity and heterogeneity, possibly due to patchy distributions of buried peat lenses. Furthermore, a comparison of DOM composition of the endmembers indicated that the Spiekeroog high-energy beach STE conveys chemically modified, terrestrial DOM from the inland freshwater lens to the coastal ocean. In the beach intertidal zone, porewater DOC concentrations, lability of DOM and oxygen concentrations, decreased while dissolved (reduced) iron and dissolved silicate concentrations increased. This observation is consistent with the assumption of a continuous degradation of labile DOM along a cross-shore gradient, even in this dynamic environment. Accordingly, molecular properties of DOM indicated enhanced degradation, and "humic-like" fluorescent DOM fraction increased along the flow paths, likely through accumulation of compounds less susceptible to microbial consumption. Our data indicate that the high-energy beach STE is likely a net sink of OC from the terrestrial and marine realm, and that barrier islands such as Spiekeroog may act as efficient "digestors" of organic matter.

AB Peat-mineral soil mix (PMM) over tailings sand (TS) or overburden (OB) is a commonly used prescription for oil sands reclamation. The TS and OB (the substrates) often have unfavorable conditions such as high salinity, soil compaction, low nutrient availability in OB, and low nutrient and water availabilities in TS, which may limit tree growth. The objective of this study was to identify limiting factors for growth of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) on PMM over TS and white spruce (Picea glauca) on PMM over OB in the Athabasca oil sands region, Alberta, Canada. In the pine sites, mean annual growth of height (HG), diameter at breast height (DBHG) and aboveground biomass (ABG) were significantly correlated with volumetric water content (VWC) in PMM and foliar delta C-13 in current-year needles. Sites with high productivities had the lowest foliar delta C-13 relative to sites with low and medium productivities. The VWC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) together explained 80% of the variation in both the current annual increment of height (HI) (p = 0.007) and aboveground biomass (ABI) (p = 0.008). In the spruce sites, foliar potassium (K) and foliar and soil nitrogen (N) concentrations were positively correlated with HG, DBHG and ABG, consistent with patterns in K and inorganic N (the sum of NH4+-N and NO3-N) concentrations in PMM in those sites. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density (Db) were greater in low than in medium and high productivity sites. The Db and inorganic N concentration together explained 67% of the variation in HI (p = 0.037), while Db and EC together explained 79% of the variation in ABI (p = 0.009). In conclusion, lodgepole pine trees planted on PMM over TS sites were limited by low water availability, while low soil N availability and high salinity limited the growth of white spruce trees planted on PMM over OB sites. Reclamation practices need to addresswater and nutrient limitations to ensure the success of reclaiming disturbed areas in the oil sands region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A vast number of organic compounds are present in soil organic matter (SOM) and play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, facilitate interactions between organisms, and represent a sink for atmospheric CO2. The diversity of different SOM compounds and their molecular characteristics is a function of the organic source material and biogeochemical history. By understanding how SOM composition changes with sources and the processes by which it is biogeochemically altered in different terrestrial ecosystems, it may be possible to predict nutrient and carbon cycling, response to system perturbations, and impact of climate change will have on SOM composition. In this study, a sequential chemical extraction procedure was developed to reveal the diversity of organic matter (OM) in different ecosystems and was compared to the previously published protocol using parallel solvent extraction (PSE). We compared six extraction methods using three sample types, peat soil, spruce forest soil and river sediment, so as to select the best method for extracting a representative fraction of organic matter from soils and sediments from a wide range of ecosystems. We estimated the extraction yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by total organic carbon analysis, and measured the composition of extracted OM using high resolution mass spectrometry. This study showed that OM composition depends primarily on soil and sediment characteristics. Two sequential extraction protocols, progressing from polar to non-polar solvents, were found to provide the highest number and diversity of organic compounds extracted from the soil and sediments. Water (H2O) is the first solvent used for both protocols followed by either co-extraction with methanol-chloroform (MeOH-CHCl3) mixture, or acetonitrile (ACN) and CHCl3 sequentially. The sequential extraction protocol developed in this study offers improved sensitivity, and requires less sample compared to the PSE workflow where a new sample is used for each solvent type. Furthermore, a comparison of SOM composition from the different sample types revealed that our sequential protocol allows for ecosystem comparisons based on the diversity of compounds present, which in turn could provide new insights about source and processing of organic compounds in different soil and sediment types.

AB Variation in the organic matter content associated with suspended particulate matter (SPM) is an often overlooked component of carbon cycling within freshwater riverine systems. The potential biogeochemical reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) that affect its interactions and fate, i.e. respired and lost to the atmosphere along river continua or ultimately exported to estuarine and oceanic pools was assessed.
   Eleven contrasting sites draining nested catchments (5-1837 km(2)) in the River Dee basin, NE Scotland were sampled during summer 2008 to evaluate spatio-temporal variations in quantity and quality (biogeochemical reactivity) of SPM during relatively low flow conditions. Mean SPM concentrations increased from 0.21 to 1.22 mg L-1 between the uppermost and lowest mainstem sites. Individually, POC concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 0.55 mg L-1 and accounted for ca. 3-15% of total aqueous organic carbon transported. The POC content was partitioned into autotrophic (2.78-73.0 mg C g(-1) SPM) and detrital (119-388 mg C g(-1) SPM) biomass carbon content. The particulate respired CO2-C as a % of the total carbon associated with SPM, measured by MicroResp (TM) over 18 h, varied in recalcitrance from 0.49% at peat-dominated sites to 3.20% at the lowermost mainstem site. Significant (p<0.05) relationships were observed between SPM biogeochemical reactivity measures (% respired CO2-C; chlorophyll alpha; bioavailable-phosphorus) and arable and improved grassland area, associated with increasing biological productivity downstream.
   Compositional characteristics and in-stream processing of SPM appear to be related to contributory land use pressures, that influence SPM characteristics and biogeochemistry (C:N:P stoichiometry) of its surrounding aqueous environment. As moorland influences declined, nutrient inputs from arable and improved grasslands increasingly affected the biogeochemical content and reactivity of both dissolved and particulate matter. This increases the potential for recycling of the organic matter that is either transported from upstream or entering further along the riverine continuum. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contains organic acid charge groups that contribute organic alkalinity (OrgAlk) to total alkalinity (TA). These effects are often ignored or treated as a calculation uncertainty in many aquatic CO2 studies. This study evaluated OrgAlk variability, sources, and characteristics in estuarine waters exchanged tidally with a groundwater-influenced salt marsh in the northeast USA. OrgAlk provided a biogeochemical link between organic and inorganic carbon cycling through its direct effects on pH, and thus CO2 system speciation and buffer capacity. Two main charge groups were identified including carboxylic and phenolic or amine groups. Terrestrial groundwater and in-situ production within salt marsh peat contributed OrgAlk to the tidal creek, with the former being a more significant source. Groundwater entering the marsh complex contained exceptionally high OrgAlk (> 150 mu mol kg(-1)), and these compounds were preferentially preserved within the DOC pool during groundwater transport and mixing with coastal water. OrgAlk:DOC ratios in groundwater and marshinfluenced water varied across space and time. This highlights the insufficiency of using a fixed proportion of DOC to account for organic acid charge groups. Accounting for OrgAlk altered H+ concentrations by similar to 1-41 nmol kg(-1)(equivalent to a pH change of similar to 0.03-0.26), pCO(2) by similar to 30-1600 mu atm and buffer capacity by similar to 0.00-0.14 mmol kg(-1) at the relative OrgAlk contributions of 0.9-4.3% of TA observed in the marsh-influenced tidal water. Thus, OrgAlk may have a significant influence on coastal inorganic carbon cycling. Further theoretical calculations confirm that these concentrations of OrgAlk would have sizable impacts on both carbonate speciation and, ultimately, air-sea CO2 fluxes in different coastal environments, ranging from estuarine to shelf waters. A new conceptual model linking organic and inorganic carbon cycling for coastal waters is proposed to highlight the sources and sinks of organic acid charge groups, as well as their biogeochemical behaviors and mechanistic control on the CO2 system.

AB Concomitant with farmland development in the Ishikari Peatland of northern Japan, deterioration of water chemistry has become increasingly evident at mire pools there. Using spatial analysis methods with a geographic information system and a statistical methodology, this study examined the effects of agricultural land use on the pool water chemistry. A water chemistry survey of several pools showed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended-solid concentrations were remarkably higher than those in pools that had been undisturbed or less-disturbed by land-use development. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to summarize water chemistry variables. Correlation analysis was conducted between the principal component (PC) scores and land-use variables to clarify land-use effects. Results of the PCA showed that the water chemistry variances were accounted for by the first two PCs: PC1 included farmland subsurface drainage containing nitrogen, specifically nitrate, and mineral ions; PC2 included farmland surface drainage containing soil particles and ammonium nitrogen. These PC scores were also affected by the number of inflow ditches and the total area of farmland located within the drainage catchment of inflow ditches leading to the pools. Results suggest that farmland subsurface and surface drainage water flowing into the pools degraded the water chemistry. The extent of the effects of drainage water depended on agricultural practices such as fertilizer application and paddy-field puddling (i.e., mechanical homogenization of water-saturated soil). Accordingly, water chemistry of the study pools was affected by agricultural practices and by the amount of farmland in the drainage basin, engendering eutrophication, and the deterioration of water chemistry. Therefore, preservation of water chemistry necessitates changes in agricultural practices, such as improving fertilizer application methods, along with measures related to land-use planning such as changing the drainage ditches' flow direction.

AB Height growth, needle mass and needle concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Cu were determined for black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) 2 years, 4 years and 6 years after planting on an ombrotrophic domed bog. Experimental treatments included four ditch spacings (3 m, 5 m, 7 m and lj m), two surface preparation treatments (tilled, untilled), and 2 fertilization treatments (PK, unfertilized), contained within five blocks. The most effective treatment for early growth of black spruce was a 3-m and/or 5-m ditch spacing that had been tilled and fertilized with PK, The effects of tilling alone on growth and nutrient uptake were minimal. However, in many instances, growth was increased by the combined effects of tilling and PK fertilization or tilling and drainage. Fertilization with PK significantly increased needle concentrations of P and K as well as N. Because concentrations of K were above ''optimum'' levels, et-en within the unfertilized treatments, uptake was accounted for by luxury consumption, thereby precluding the need for K fertilization. Thus, improved height growth and needle mass in the PK-fertilized treatments can be attributed to addition of P, and the subsequent increase in N uptake. Needle concentrations of Mg were slightly increased by PK-fertilization treatments in 1987. However, over the 6-year period, concentrations of Ca, Cu. and Mg, were generally not affected by treatments.

TI Effects of pipe outlet blocking on hydrological functioning in a

AB Peatland restoration practitioners are keen to understand the role of drainage via natural soil pipes, especially where erosion has released large quantities of fluvial carbon in stream waters. However, little is known about pipe-to-stream connectivity and whether blocking methods used to impede flow in open ditch networks and gullies also work on pipe networks. Two streams in a heavily degraded blanket bog (southern Pennines, UK) were used to assess whether impeding drainage from pipe networks alters the streamflow responses to storm events, and how such intervention affects the hydrological functioning of the pipe network and the surrounding peat. Pipeflow was impeded in half of the pipe outlets in one stream, either by inserting a plug-like structure in the pipe-end or by the insertion of a vertical screen at the pipe outlet perpendicular to the direction of the predicted pipe course. Statistical response variable eta(2) showed the overall effects of pipe outlet blocking on stream responses were small with eta(2) = 0.022 for total storm runoff, eta(2) = 0.097 for peak discharge, eta(2) = 0.014 for peak lag, and eta(2) = 0.207 for response index. Both trialled blocking methods either led to new pipe outlets appearing or seepage occurring around blocks within 90 days of blocking. Discharge from four individual pipe outlets was monitored for 17 months before blocking and contributed 11.3% of streamflow. Pipe outlets on streambanks with headward retreat produced significantly larger peak flows and storm contributions to streamflow compared to pipe outlets that issued onto straight streambank sections. We found a distinctive distance-decay effect of the water table around pipe outlets, with deeper water tables around pipe outlets that issued onto straight streambanks sections. We suggest that impeding pipeflow at pipe outlets would exacerbate pipe development in the gully edge zone, and propose that future pipe blocking efforts in peatlands prioritize increasing the residence time of pipe water by forming surface storage higher up the pipe network.

AB We studied the effect of ditch blocking on vegetation composition and water-table depths in a blanket peatland. Measurements were made for a period of four years (water tables) and five years (vegetation) in the inter-ditch areas of three experimental treatments: (i) open ditches, (ii) ditches blocked with closely-spaced dams and (iii) ditches partially infilled with peat and blocked with dams. It is often assumed that ditch blocking will lead to an increase in the abundance of Sphagnum and, potentially, a reduction in the abundance of sedges, particularly the cotton grasses. However, our data show no treatment effects on the abundance of either group. We did find an effect of time, with the abundance of both sedges and Sphagnum spp. varying significantly between some years. For the sedges there was no systematic change over time, while for the Sphagnum spp. abundance tended to increase through the study period. This systematic change was not related to a measure of the vigour of the sedges, although vigour was lower towards the end of the study compared to the beginning. Our vegetation data are consistent with our water-table data. As with plant type abundance, we did not find any statistically significant differences in water-table depths between treatments, both for annual averages and summer averages. We comment on why ditch blocking does not seem to have affected water tables and vegetation composition at our study site.

   ABSORPTION; NUTRIENTS; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; INDICATORS; PEATLANDS
AB River water is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Arctic Ocean. DOC plays an important role in the Arctic carbon cycle, and its export from land to sea is expected to increase as ongoing climate change accelerates permafrost thaw. However, transport pathways and transformation of DOC in the land-to-ocean transition are mostly unknown. We collected DOC and a(CDOM)(lambda)/samples from 11 expeditions to river, coastal and offshore waters and present a new DOC- a(CDOM)(lambda)/model for the fluvial-marine transition zone in the Laptev Sea. The a(CDOM) (lambda)/characteristics revealed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in samples of this dataset are primarily of terrigenous origin. Observed changes in a(CDOM)(443) and its spectral slopes indicate that DOM is modified by microbial and photodegradation. Ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) provides the absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)(lambda)/(sat)) at lambda = 440 or 443 nm, which can be used to estimate DOC concentration at high temporal and spatial resolution over large regions. We tested the statistical performance of five OCRS algorithms and evaluated the plausibility of the spatial distribution of derived a(CDOM)(lambda)/(sat). The OLCI (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) neural network swarm (ONNS) algorithm showed the best performance compared to in situ a(CDOM)(440) (r(2) = 0 : 72). Additionally, we found ONNS-derived a(CDOM)(440), in contrast to other algorithms, to be partly independent of sediment concentration, making ONNS the most suitable a(CDOM)(lambda)/sat algorithm for the Laptev Sea region. The DOC-a(CDOM)(lambda)/model was applied to ONNS-derived a(CDOM)(440), and retrieved DOC concentration maps showed moderate agreement to in situ data (r(2) = 0.53). The in situ and satellite-retrieved data were offset by up to several days, which may partly explain the weak correlation for this dynamic region. Satellite-derived surface water DOC concentration maps from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data demonstrate rapid removal of DOC within short time periods in coastal waters of the Laptev Sea, which is likely caused by physical mixing and different types of degradation processes. Using samples from all occurring water types leads to a more robust DOC-a(CDOM)(lambda)/model for the retrievals of DOC in Arctic shelf and river waters.

AB Recent evidence suggests that the degree of degradation of peatlands is substantial, and that there is a significant potential to enhance the delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services by investing in peatland restoration. However, little is known about the social welfare impacts of peatland restoration and in particular how to spatially target restoration activities to maximise net benefits from investments in restoration. This paper investigates the steps required to conduct a spatially explicit economic impact assessment of peatland restoration, and highlights and discusses key requirements and issues associated with such an assessment. We find that spatially explicit modelling of the biophysical impacts of restoration over time is challenging due to non-linear effects and interaction effects. This has repercussions for the spatially explicit assessment of costs and benefits, which in itself is a demanding task. We conclude that the gains of investing in the research needed to conduct such an assessment can be high, both in terms of advancing science and in terms of providing useful information for decision makers.

AB Lake basins (similar to 2.7 X 10(6) km(2), about 0.8% of the ocean surface or 2% of the land surface) bury a surprisingly high amount of atmospheric carbon (similar to 70 X 10(6) t/a) which reaches more than one fourth of the annual atmospheric carbon burial in the modern oceans. This is mainly accomplished by the rapid accumulation of lacustrine sediments and a very high preservation factor (on average 50 times higher than that in the oceans). Lakes with relatively large drainage areas commonly display the highest carbon accumulation rates. In most cases, burial of organic matter is more important than that of carbonate carbon produced by silicate weathering, in contrast to the oceans where the burial of atmospheric carbonate carbon almost reaches the same amount as that of organic carbon. Exceptions to this rule are closed lake basins in arid to semiarid climate which precipitate a major part of their atmosphere-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as carbonate. These results are demonstrated in some detail for L. Qinghai, China, (low contribution of atmospheric carbonate carbon) and L. Turkana, East Africa, (high contribution from silicate rocks). Further data are gained by estimates for a number of closed and open lakes. The drainage areas of the lakes withdraw atmospheric carbon at rates of mostly 1-4 g/m(2)/a, calculated from the lacustrine carbon burial. Carbon burial rates in lakes commonly increase with change to wetter and warmer climate (partially larger lake surfaces, higher rates of seasonal carbonate precipitation, trend to stratified lake waters with oxygen-deficient bottom water). Anthropogenic influence mostly enhances the production and preservation of organic carbon in lake basins (often by a factor of 3-4). After the last glacial maximum, the joint action of the globally spreading vegetation, peat growth, and carbon burial in lakes would have been able to reduce the atmospheric carbon pool to one third to one half of its present amount within a time period of 1 ka. However, CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean has brought about an overall increase in the atmospheric CO2 during the Holocene. The contribution of lakes and artificial reservoirs in counteracting matt-made CO2 emissions should not be neglected. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we evaluated the magnitude and seasonal variations of natural and anthropogenic fluxes of inorganic (NO3-, NH4+, and PO43-) and organic (DON and dissolved organic carbon) nutrients delivered by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and rivers to the fourth largest estuary in the USA, Mobile Bay in Alabama. To identify the sources of SGD-nutrient in the estuary and their subsurface biogeochemical transformation, we applied a multimethod approach that combines geochemical nutrient (N and P) mass-balances, stable isotopes (nitrate delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) and sediment organic matter delta C-13(org) and delta N-15(org)) signatures, microbial sequencing analyses, dissolved organic matter source-composition, and shallow estuarine sediment lithological analyses. We found that during dry seasons SGD delivered nearly a quarter of the total nutrient inputs to Mobile Bay. These SGD fluxes were anoxic and N was delivered to the bay almost entirely as NH4+ and DON, which represented more than half of the total NH4+ and almost one fifth of the total DON inputs to the bay. We further observed that these significant SGD-derived N fluxes occurred exclusively to the east shore of Mobile Bay, historically impacted by hypoxia and large-scale fish kills known as ``Jubilees''. We demonstrate here that although the Mobile Bay coastal area is largely developed and anthropogenic influences are well documented, a shallow peat layer identified only on the east shore serves as the main source of the exceptionally high NH4+ and DON fluxes. We found that the high groundwater NO3- concentrations observed further inland from overfertilization also identified by previous studies, decreased dramatically as groundwater percolated through the intertidal zone of the coastal aquifer. The microbial community identified in the coastal sediments suggests that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were the main processes responsible for this extensive removal and transformation of anthropogenic N, respectively. Furthermore, we found no significant anthropogenic inputs from manure or sewage waste to the bay. These findings show that natural sources of nutrients can outcompete anthropogenic inputs despite extensive development of the coastal area. We hypothesize that similar subsurface biogeochemical nutrient transformations can occur in other shallow estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico and worldwide.

AB The chemical composition and carbon isotope signature of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five boreal forest catchments in Scandinavia were investigated. The DOM was isolated during spring and fall seasons using a reverse osmosis technique. The DOM samples were analyzed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, solid-state CP-MAS C-13-NMR, and C-1s NEXAFS spectroscopy. In addition, the relative abundance of carbon isotopes (C-12, C-13, C-14) in the samples was measured. There were no significant differences in the chemical composition or carbon isotope signature of the DOM sampled in spring and fall seasons. Also, differences in DOM composition between the five catchments were minor. Compared to reference peat fulvic and humic acids, all DOM samples were richer in O-alkyl carbon and contained less aromatic and phenolic carbon, as shown by FT-IR, C-13-NMR, and C-1s NEXAFS spectroscopy. The DOM was clearly enriched in(14)C relative to the NBS oxalic acid standard of 1950, indicating that the aquatic DOM contained considerable amounts of organic carbon younger than about 50 years. The weight-based C:N ratios of 31 +/- 6 and the delta C-13 values of -29 +/- 2 parts per thousand indicate that the isolated DOM is of terrestrial rather than aquatic origin. We conclude that young, hydrophilic carbon compounds of terrestrial origin are predominant in the samples investigated, and that the composition of the aquatic DOM in the studied boreal forest catchments is rather stable during low to intermediate flow conditions.

AB Mineral particles in rivers have been shown to cover adnate algal species, promoting motile and filamentous species. Such effects and the role of detrital particles have not been studied in stagnant waters. In degraded peat lands, detrital particles are very prominent and therefore we studied the interaction of organic particles and attached algae. Field grown communities were translocated to microcosms and exposed to organic particles in the laboratory. Colonization of substrate was also studied in field enclosures that allowed settlement of particles. We compared algal settlement under low particle regime (enclosures) with settlement at high particle concentrations (outside). Suspended particles were found to be trapped by attached algae in proportion to the concentration of particles. The presence of particles in the incubations and field enclosures modified species composition, reducing the share of low-profile forms. These experimental results were verified in a field survey with a wide range of turbidity. The share of low-profile species was lowest in turbid ditches while motile and planktonic algae dominated, in agreement with the results from experiments. It is argued that the strong interactions of attached algae and suspended organic matter found in peat land ditches is a characteristic feature of detritus rich waters.

AB Drained thaw lake basins (DTLB's) are the dominant land form of the Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska. The presence of continuous permafrost prevents drainage and so water tables generally remain close to the soil surface, creating saturated, suboxic soil conditions. However, ice wedge polygons produce microtopographic variation in these landscapes, with raised areas such as polygon rims creating more oxic microenvironments. The peat soils in this ecosystem store large amounts of organic carbon which is vulnerable to loss as arctic regions continue to rapidly warm, and so there is great motivation to understand the controls over microbial activity in these complex landscapes. Here we report the effects of experimental flooding, along with seasonal and spatial variation in soil chemistry and microbial activity in a DTLB. The flooding treatment generally mirrored the effects of natural landscape variation in water-table height due to microtopography. The flooded portion of the basin had lower dissolved oxygen, lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and higher pH, as did lower elevation areas throughout the entire basin. Similarly, soil pore water concentrations of organic carbon and aromatic compounds were higher in flooded and low elevation areas. Dissolved ferric iron (Fe(III)) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas and responded to the flooding treatment in low areas, only. The high concentrations of soluble Fe(III) in soil pore water were explained by the presence of siderophores, which were much more concentrated in low elevation areas. All the aforementioned variables were correlated, showing that Fe(III) is solubilized in response to anoxic conditions. Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas, but showed only subtle and/or seasonally dependent effects of flooding. In anaerobic laboratory incubations, more CH4 was produced by soils from low and flooded areas, whereas anaerobic CO2 production only responded to flooding in high elevation areas. Seasonal changes in the oxidation state of solid phase Fe minerals showed that net Fe reduction occurred, especially in topographically low areas. The effects of Fe reduction were also seen in the topographic patterns of pH, as protons were consumed where this process was prevalent. This suite of results can all be attributed to the effect of water table on oxygen availability: flooded conditions promote anoxia, stimulating dissolution and reduction of Fe(III), and to some extent, methanogenesis. However, two lines of evidence indicated the inhibition of methanogenesis by alternative e- acceptors such as Fe(III) and humic substances: (1) ratios of CO2:CH4 evolved from anaerobic soil incubations and dissolved in soil pore water were high; (2) CH4 concentrations were negatively correlated with the oxidation state of the soluble Fe pool in both topographically high and low areas. A second set of results could be explained by increased soil temperature in the flooding treatment, which presumably arose from the increased thermal conductivity of the soil surface: higher N mineralization rates and dissolved P concentrations were observed in flooded areas. Overall, these results could have implications for C and nutrient cycling in high Arctic areas where warming and flooding are likely consequences of climate change.

AB Peatland soils contain large amounts of nitrogen (N) in the soil and mineralization can contribute substantially to the annual mineral N supply of grasslands. We investigated the contribution of N mineralization from peat with respect to the total annual N uptake on grasslands with anthropogenic A horizons and submerged tile drains. The study included i) a pot experiment to determine potential N mineralization from the topsoil and the subsoil, ii) a 1-year field experiment to study herbage yields and N uptake under fertilized and non-fertilized conditions and iii) a 3-year field study where herbage yield and N uptake from the top 30 cm and the entire soil profile were monitored. The 3-year field study yielded an average N uptake of 342 kgha(-1) under non-fertilized conditions but the contribution of subsoil peat N mineralization to the total N uptake was found to be negligible. Our calculations demonstrate that peat N mineralization contributed only 10% to 30% to the total N-uptake, mainly coming from the top 30 cm. Most of the N uptake under unfertilized conditions appears to be largely the result of mineralization from long-term inputs of dung, ditch sludge, farmyard manure, cow slurry and non-harvested herbage.

AB Climate change affects peatlands directly through increased air temperatures and indirectly through changes in water-table level (WL). The interactions of these two still remain poorly known. We determined experimentally the separate and interactive effects of temperature and WL regime on factors of relevance for the inputs to the carbon cycle: plant community composition, phenology, biomass production, and shoot:root allocation in two wet boreal sedge-dominated fens, southern at 62 degrees N and northern at 68 degrees N. Warming (1.5 degrees C higher average daily air temperature) was induced with open-top chambers and WL drawdown (WLD; 3-7cm on average) by shallow ditches. Total biomass production varied from 250 to 520 g/m(2), with belowground production comprising 25%-63%. Warming was associated with minor effects on phenology and negligible effects on community composition, biomass production, and allocation. WLD clearly affected the contribution of different plant functional types (PFTs) in the community and the biomass they produced: shrubs benefited while forbs and mosses suffered. These responses did not depend on the warming treatment. Following WLD, aboveground biomass production decreased mainly due to reduced growth of mosses in the southern fen. Aboveground vascular plant biomass production remained unchanged but the contribution of different PFTs changed. The observed changes were also reflected in plant phenology, with different PFTs showing different responses. Belowground production increased following WLD in the northern fen only, but an increase in the contributions of shrubs and forbs was observed in both sites, while sedge contribution decreased. Moderate warming alone seems not able to drive significant changes in plant productivity or community composition in these wet ecosystems. However, if warming is accompanied by even modest WL drawdown, changes should be expected in the relative contribution of PFTs, which could lead to profound changes in the function of fens. Consequently, hydrological scenarios are of utmost importance when estimating their future function.

AB In a similar to 60 m long record reflecting the period from 284 ka to 27 ka we analysed grain size distributions (GSD), organic carbon content, and aquatic pollen assemblages at 1-cm increments. The 4768-points time series show with similar to 60 yr resolution the dynamic history of Lake Fuquene (2540 m alt., 4 degrees N lat.) of the northern Andes during two full interglacial-glacial cycles. GSD show proportions of clay, fine silt, coarse silt, and sand evidencing the location of the sediment source (proximal vs distal) in relation to the drilling site, and available energy to transport sediments in the catchment area. Loss-on-ignition (LOI) values reflect estimates of the abundance of organic matter (OM) in the sediments. Aquatic pollen were grouped into assemblages characteristic of deep water, shallow water, swamp, and wet lake shore environments, reflecting a hydrological gradient sensitive for lake level changes.
   The End-Member Modelling Algorithm (EMMA) showed that 4 end-members (EMs) explain an optimal proportion (70%) of the observed variation. EMMA is able to unmix GSD of lacustrine sediments in a genetically meaningful way allowing EMs to be interpreted in past depositional and environmental settings. Most unexplained variability is located in the fraction of coarse sediment. OM content was estimated on the basis of LOI data and formed a fifth EM that mainly indicates presence of peat. Changes concur with submillennial-scale variability established in other proxies from this record (Groot et al., 2011). Periods with distinct sediment compositions are 284-243 ka (mainly MIS 8), 243-201 ka (mainly MIS 7), 201-179 ka (mainly MIS 7/6 transition), 179-133 ka (mainly MIS 6), 133-111 ka, (mainly MIS 5e) 111-87 ka (mainly MIS 5d-5b), 87-79 ka (mainly MIS 5a), 79-62 ka (mainly MIS 4), and 62-27 ka (MIS 3) showing sedimentological regimes are climate driven.

AB For the conservation and restoration of biodiverse rich fens, base-rich and nutrient-poor conditions are vital. In wetlands with artificially stable surface water levels, the re-introduction of temporary water level fluctuations has been postulated to restore the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of fens during inundation and to reduce surface water P-input during episodes with drought. This is the first study testing this hypothesis in large-scale field manipulation experiments in rich fens with threatened rich fen mosses, rich fens with Calliergonella, and poor fens with Sphagnum. Five different experiments were conducted: 2 weeks of raised levels (+ 10 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during winter, 2 weeks of high levels in a non-floating fen during summer, and 2 weeks of lowered levels (-15 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during summer. For floating fens, both lowered and raised surface water levels in adjacent ditches did not show any effect on water tables, soil ANC or nutrient levels in fens. For non-floating fens, raised surface water levels led to inundation in all vegetation types, without affecting nutrient concentrations or vegetation. Although redox potentials decreased immediately in upper soils, ANC was generally not enhanced in winter due to limited infiltration into the waterlogged soils. In summer, in contrast, ANC increased because accelerated evapotranspiration led to enhanced infiltration of inundation water and higher temperatures resulted in microbial alkalinity generation. Short-term lowering of surface water levels in summer led to lower water tables in non-floating fens, but only when precipitation rates were low. Vegetation, ANC and nutrient concentrations were, however, not affected. The effectiveness of short-term surface water level fluctuation to restore ANC strongly depends on peat buoyancy, water saturation of soils, season and weather conditions. This explains why short-term inundation in winter is often inadequate, while short-term inundation in summer does increase ANC. Short-term droughts do not affect the ANC or nutrient availability. Our results are not only important for the hydrological management of fens, but also have implications for future management since short-term extreme weather events will occur more frequently due to climate change.

AB This study provides an assessment of the spatial variability of the long-term leaching of nutrients, total organic carbon (TOC) and iron (Fe-tot) from 22 forested catchments (0.69-56 km(2)), distributed across all but the northernmost areas of Finland. The natural, unmanaged Kruunuoja catchment is located in a national park, while the other catchments represent Finnish forestry land. The average leaching of P-tot (4.2 kg km(-2) yr(-1)) from the Kruunuoja catchment was small compared to the catchments representing forestry land (on average 10 kg km(-2) yr(-1)). Moreover, P fertilization was the most important predictor for the spatial variation in P-tot leaching (r(2) = 0.45). Leaching of TOC, Fe-tot and N compounds was not closely related to forestry practices. Median C/N ratio in the study streams was high (range 34-66). The average inorganic N proportion and leaching of NO3--N were lowest in the Kruunuoja catchment (7.3 % and 2.8 kg km(-2) yr(-1), respectively) and highest in the southernmost Teeressuonoja catchment (54 % and 100 kg km(-2) yr(-1), respectively) located in the highest N deposition area. The most important forestry practices since the 1960's have affected about 2.4 % of the area of study sites per year (cf. 2 % in the entire country in 1991). Moreover, the mean annual runoff from the catchments (230-430 mm yr(-1)) agrees with the mean annual runoff from Finland (301 mm yr(-1)). Consequently, the results of the study catchments can be used to estimate average total annual leaching from Finnish forestry land: 2,700 t of P-tot, 48,000 t of N-tot, 110,000 t of Fe-tot and 1.5 million t of TOC.

AB The emission fluxes and the distribution of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were determined for 11 sampling stations in two hydroelectric reservoirs (flooded since 1978 and 1993) located in the James Bay territory of northern Quebec. The measured benthic fluxes for the two greenhouse gases were found to be either higher or similar to those determined at the water-air interface during the ice-free sampling periods. I;or the 2 year duration of the study, emission fluxes of CH4 to the atmosphere generally varied between 5 and 10 mg m(-2) d(-1), while those for CO2 ranged from 500 to 1100 mg m(-2) d(-1). Furthermore, through the use of static chambers at the water-air interface, we determined that the emission fluxes for the gases are controlled by molecular diffusion. Our calculated fluxes have been separated into two groups: (1) regular emission fluxes and (2) above-average emission fluxes. The first type comprises the majority of fluxes measured during the sampling periods (i.e., 88% for CH4 and 87% for CO2). The second group reflects unusual sampling conditions (e.g., strong winds, water column depths of less than 1 m, or flooded peatland mats floating at the surface). Although data for this group are limited, our preliminary results suggest that they may be an important component in an atmospheric emissions budget for large reservoirs. Concentration profiles for CH4 and CO2 dissolved in the water column clearly show that oxidation and/or horizontal advection of these gases are controlling factors in their subsequent release to the atmosphere. Most of the CH4 is oxidized within the first 25 cm above the flooded soil-water interface. Consequently, neither benthic emissions of CH4 and CO2 nor the type of flooded soil appear to control atmospheric emissions of these gases from hydroelectric reservoirs.

TI An Evaluation of Mitigation Measures to Reduce Impacts of Peat

ID DRAINAGE; QUEBEC; MODEL
AB Tie evaluation of impacts of peat harvesting on riverine ecosystems is essential to the implementation of adequate mitigation measures. The objective of the present study was to determine the potential impacts of peat harvesting on the physical (e.g., flow, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water temperature) and biological (fish abundance) parameters of the East Branch Portage River, New Brunswick. This study was initiated in 2005 and a before and after study design was used to assess impacts. When the operational activities were initiated (spring 2007), 19 ha of peatland (15% of the total area scheduled for harvesting) was drained. Tie exploited area was drained through a network of ditches which emptied into a sedimentation pond. Drained water subsequently flowed into a 250 m vegetated buffer zone and discharged into the East Branch Portage River. Drained water did not diffuse throughout the buffer zone as expected. Rather, water tended to concentrate in a natural depression (channel) in the buffer zone, thus connecting the outflow of the sedimentation pond directly to the river. Two main results deserve attention. First, elevated SSC events were recorded in the East Branch Portage River downstream of the confluence of the channel formed in the buffer zone and the river. Periods of elevated SSC Could be attributed to poor maintenance of the sedimentation pond. However, elevated SSC events were also recorded after pond maintenance and were concurrent with the timing of ditching activities within the peatland. Secondly, fish abundance was lower in 2007 compared to 2006 (pre-development period). However, potential impacts of peatland development on fish abundance Should be interpreted with caution at this stage of the study.

AB Methane (CH4) production, oxidation, and emission were studied in ponds of the permafrost-affected polygonal tundra in northeast Siberia. Microbial degradation of organic matter in water-saturated soils is the most important source for the climate-relevant trace gas CH4. Although ponds and lakes cover a substantial fraction of the land surface of northern Siberia, data on CH4 fluxes from these water bodies are scarce. Summer CH4 fluxes were measured with closed chambers at the margins of ponds vegetated by vascular plants and in their centers without vascular plants. Furthermore, CH4 and oxygen concentration gradients, stable carbon isotope signatures of dissolved and emitted CH4, and microbial CH4 production and CH4 oxidation were determined. Mean summer fluxes were significantly higher at the margins of the ponds (46.115.4mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)) than at the centers (5.98.2mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)). CH4 transport was dominated by diffusion in most open water sites, but substantial ebullitive fluxes (12.08.1mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)) were detected in one pond. Plant-mediated transport accounted for 70 to 90% of total CH4 fluxes above emerged vegetation. In the absence of vascular plants, 61 to 99% of the CH4 produced in the anoxic bottom soil was consumed in a layer of the submerged moss Scorpidium scorpioides, which covered the bottoms of the ponds. The fraction of CH4 oxidized was lower at sites with vascular plants since CH4 was predominantly transported through their aerenchyma, thereby bypassing the CH4 oxidation zone in the moss layer. These results emphasize the importance of moss-associated CH4 oxidation causing low CH4 fluxes from the studied Siberian ponds.

The research was carried out in Outer Flysh Carpathians, the area of the Babiogrski National Park (Poland) in 2011-2014. It was established that the degraded communities showed positive reaction to an attempt to restore the original groundwater level. The increase in the groundwater level changed chemical properties of soil and water of the community such as: pH, sorption properties and the ionic composition of groundwater. Changes in habitat conditions resulted in different species composition of soil mesofauna and plants growing in the restorative community.

AB Purpose: We evaluated the influence of acetate and sulphate addition on methanogenesis in sediment layers of cores of different carbon and sulphate concentrations from the littoral region colonized by Typha domingensis Pers. (area 1) and from the limnetic region (area 2) of a tropical coastal lagoon separated from the sea by a sandbar. We hypothesized that area 1 presents a proportionally smaller potential methane production (PMP) on sulphate addition than area 2. We further hypothesized that acetate addition stimulates proportionally greater PMP in area 2 sediment layers than in area 1.
   Materials and methods: The PMP rates were measured in sediment samples from three depths (0-2, 2-6, and 6-10 cm) in areas 1 and 2 for 89 days. The sediment incubations were prepared with additions of acetate (1 mM), sulphate (10 mM), and acetate plus sulphate (1 and 10 mM, respectively); the control treatment had no addition of acetate and/or sulphate. We also measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbohydrates, and sulphate in the interstitial water.
   Results and discussion: PMP responded differently to acetate and sulphate addition. In general, PMP in area 2 was proportionally more stimulated by the addition of acetate and less inhibited by the addition of sulphate. In the 0-2-cm layer, the addition of acetate did not stimulate PMP in relation to the control in area 1, reaching a rate of 376.11 nmol CH4 g(-1) day(-1). In area 2, PMP was 5-fold higher in relation to the control, reaching 5.4 nmol CH4 g(-1)day(-1). Contrarily, in the 6-10-cm layer, sulphate addition inhibited PMP by 127.8-fold in relation to the control in area 1, reaching 0.6 nmol CH4 g(-1) day(-1). In area 2, PMP decreased 3.2-fold in relation to the control, reaching a value of 3.7 nmol CH4 g(-1) day(-1). These results agreed with the higher amounts of carbohydrates and lower amounts of sulphate in area 1 in the experiment beginning.
   Conclusions: Acetate and sulphate are effective PMP regulators in the sediment of two areas of a tropical coastal lagoon. Acetate increased PMP more in area 2, due to the lower sediment carbon availability. In contrast, sulphate decreased PMP more in area 1, due to the lower sulphate availability. The metabolic responses of methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria to natural and anthropogenic changes in carbon and sulphate availability are important for understanding the functioning of continental aquatic ecosystems, especially in scenarios of global climate change.

AB Total arsenic, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), iron, major cations and anions were measured in tube-well waters used for drinking by people to investigate the geochemical condition of subsurface aquifer, source of arsenic and mechanism of arsenic release to groundwater of Bangladesh. Solid phases of total arsenic, iron, manganese and aluminum oxide and organic carbon (TOC) content in sediments were determined to find out their interrelation ships. Arsenic concentrations in groundwaters vary from 0.03 to 0.75 mg/l with the mean value of 0.41 mg/l that exceed the maximum permissible limit of WHO (0.01 mg/l) and Bangladesh (0.05 mg/l) for drinking water. Arsenic concentrations demonstrate negative covariation with the concentrations of sulfate and nitrate but correlate weakly with iron concentrations and positively with those of ammonium ions. Dissolved iron exhibits a negative covariance with the concentrations of sulfate. Very low concentrations of nitrate and sulfate and high concentrations of dissolved iron and ammonium ions demonstrate the reducing condition of subsurface aquifer. These relationships suggest that oxidation of arsenic-rich pyrite is not responsible for the increased concentrations of arsenic but reflect the dependence of As concentration on the reductive processes. Arsenic is strongly correlated with DOC concentrations. Borehole data demonstrate the arsenic enrichment in organic matter-rich fine-grained clayey silt and silty sand than in sandy sediments. Arsenic contents are well correlated with those of iron, manganese and aluminum oxides in fine particle fraction of sediments, whereas arsenic is significantly correlated with TOC in large particle fraction. Sequential chemical leaching exhibits that arsenic is mainly present in three phases: (1) oxide phase of Fe and Mn, (2) organic matter and (3) sulfide and silicate phases. Since the distribution of arsenic in the subsurface sediments is not solely controlled by a single solid phase, the dissolution-desorption from different phases contributes to the total arsenic concentrations in groundwater. Microbial oxidation of organic matter (including localized peat layer) and reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide are the important processes to mobilize arsenic. The combined effects of NaHCO3 and high pH values also play a significant role to mobilize arsenic from surface of iron oxides, other minerals and subsurface sediments. The very strong relationship between arsenic and bicarbonate concentrations in groundwater of Bangladesh and high pH values (8.03-8.7) of the Ganges sediments support the hypothesis. This paper reports first about arsenic leaching by the combined effects of NaHCO3 and high pH values in Bangladesh. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous-cover forestry (CCF) is expected to reduce the negative environmental impacts of peatland forestry in comparison with rotation forestry (RF), but the unknown profitability of CCF on peatlands limits its application in practice. The profitability of CCF was analyzed by simulating management scenarios with a process-based ecosystem model, EFIMOD, which was complemented to describe the interplay between tree growth and water table depth, which is typical of peatland forests. A variety of harvest intervals and post-harvest basal areas for a mature Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stand was simulated on a nutrient-rich peatland site. Conventional RF was simulated for comparison. CCF provided a higher profit than RF. The best financial performance was obtained with a 15-year harvest interval regardless of interest rate, although the overall profitability of CCF depended on the interest rate used. Ditch network maintenance was needed to maintain the stand growth only when the post-harvest basal area was smaller than 10 m(2).ha(-1). There were many CCF scenarios in which the difference in the net present value of harvest revenues was within 10% compared with the best CCF scenario. Hence, there are many relatively profitable CCF harvesting alternatives for forest management in boreal spruce-dominated peatland forests.

AB Iron cycling in wetlands is important because it plays an important role in interactions among wetland soils/sediments, plants and microorganisms. The seasonal variation of iron (Fe) distributed in two freshwater peatland ecosystems dominated by Calamagrostis angustifolia (CA) and Carex lasiocarpa (CL), was observed in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The compartmentalization of the Fe cycle including storage in the atmosphere, litter, soil, and above- and below ground plant material was determined. The results showed that the Fe input from rain was 0.06 g m(-2) a(-1), and the total Fe mass in the peatland ecosystem was 5.18 x 10(3) for CA and 1.40 x 10(3) g m(-2) for CL. The major Fe pools were soils (98.6% and 97.1% for CA and CL, respectively). The Fe fluxes between each compartment resulted in the increase of the belowground Fe pool and decrease of the litter Fe pool currently both for CA and CL. CL has greater uptake coefficient (0.024) and cycle coefficient (0.034), but smaller use coefficient (0.58) than that of CA (0.02, 0.006, and 0.77, respectively). Peatland conversion for agriculture affected the former natural Fe cycle processes and mass balance to a certain extent in long term, because the Fe assimilated by soybean and rice are less than that of CA and CL, and cannot return to soils from harvesting. Drainage and ditch excavation for agricultural conversion caused considerable Fe loss via aqueous movement, so that Fe was likely lost and transported downstream by these ditch networks.

AB The depth of the water table was measured before and after the digging of drainage ditches with 20-, 40-, and 60-m spacings in a black spruce wild holly bog. The peat is mesic with the exception of the top 10 cm which is fibric. The hydraulic conductivity of the 20- to 40-cm layer is low in relation with other Quebec sites under study. The extremely low conductivity under the 40-cm depth and the impermeable mineral soil layer at the bottom of the ditches creates the horizontal profile between ditches. The mean water table depths during the 3 years of the study were 42, 29, and 22 cm, respectively, for the 20-, 40-, and 60-m spacings. The corresponding lowering of the water table was in the order of 25, 13, and 6 cm. The water table was maintained 100, 70, and 40% of the time below the 20 cm deep root zone for the 20-, 40-, and 60-m spacings respectively, compared with 23% for the undrained situation (by simulation). The water table is significantly lowered below the 40-cm threshold for the 20-m spacing only.

AB Understanding the sea-level change in the geological past is helpful for the future coastal protection. Information of sea-level changes has been documented in various archives in the coasts. In this study, the well-preserved peat in three representative Holocene ditches in Dayanghe Plain in the Yellow Sea China were investigated using radiocarbon dating and diatom analysis. The widely distributed buried peats at elevation of ca. 2-10 m above sea-level (a.s.l.) in Dayanghe Plain are classified as marsh and limnological peats, which were formed after seawater receding from the drowned ditches. The peat layers lower than 4 m a.s.l., overlain the marine sediments conformably, correspond to the late -Holocene regression. Timing of the highstand sea-level in North Coast of North Yellow Sea is limited to 6182-5466 cal. a BP by radiocarbon dating. Shell banks at west of the Dagu Mountain which was at a 7-10 m height were thought not to be indicative of the Holocene highstand sea-level.

AB In this study, we evaluated flow structure, effective flow area (A(eff)) and effective porosity (theta(eff)) in three peatlands using the stable isotope O-18/O-16 ratio and tracer tests. We also applied the readily available groundwater modelling MODFLOW code for wetland flow modelling and simulated in one study site how the hydraulic performance of the wetland will be improved by changing the design of the distribution ditch. Preferential flow paths occurred in all three studied wetlands and A(eff) varied from 40% to 90% of total wetland area while theta(eff) was 0.75-0.99. Constructed flow models accurately simulated the hydraulic head across wetlands (r(2)=0.95-0.99). Similarities between the flow models and the stable isotope distributions observed in this study suggest possibilities in using MODFLOW to design peatlands. The improvement of the inlet ditch configuration (ditch length/wetland width > 0.45) can prevent or reduce short-circuiting and dead zones in peatlands treating wastewater. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Active processes of permafrost thaw in Western Siberia increase the number of soil subsidencies, thermokarst lakes and thaw ponds. In continuous permafrost zones, this process promotes soil carbon mobilisation to water reservoirs, as well as organic matter (OM) biodegradation, which produces a permanent flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. At the same time, the biogeochemical evolution of aquatic ecosystems situated in the transition zone between continuous permafrost and permafrost-free terrain remains poorly known. In order to better understand the biogeochemical processes that occur in thaw ponds and lakes located in discontinuous permafrost zones, we studied 30 small (1-100,000 m(2)) shallow (< 1 m depth) lakes and ponds formed as a result of permafrost subsidence and thaw of the palsa bog located in the transition zone between the tundra and forest-tundra (central part of Western Siberia). There is a significant increase in dissolved CO2 and methane (CH4) concentration with decreasing water body surface area, with the largest supersaturation with respect to atmospheric CO2 and CH4 in small (< 100 m(2)) permafrost depressions filled with thaw water. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), conductivity, and metal concentrations also progressively increase from large lakes to thaw ponds and depressions. As such, small water bodies with surface areas of 1-100 m(2) that are not accounted for in the existing lake and pond databases may significantly contribute to CO2 and CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, as well as to the stocks of dissolved trace elements and organic carbon. In situ lake water incubation experiments yielded negligible primary productivity but significant oxygen consumption linked to the mineralisation rate of dissolved OM by heterotrophic bacterioplankton, which produce a net CO2 flux to the atmosphere of 5 +/- A 2.5 mol C m(2) year(-1). The most significant result of this study, which has long-term consequences on our prediction of aquatic ecosystem development in the course of permafrost degradation is CO2, CH4, and DOC concentrations increase with decreasing lake age and size. As a consequence, upon future permafrost thaw, the increase in the number of small water bodies, accompanied by the drainage of large thermokarst lakes to the hydrological network, will likely favour (i) the increase of DOC and colloidal metal stocks in surface aquatic systems, and (ii) the enhancement of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the water surface to the atmosphere. According to a conservative estimation that considers that the total area occupied by water bodies in Western Siberia will not change, this increase in stocks and fluxes could be as high as a factor of ten.

AB The aim of this study was to assess spider diversity among habitats that are typically used for afforestation in Ireland, and to identify habitat parameters which could potentially be used as indicators of their biodiversity value. Ground-dwelling spiders were surveyed in 24 sites across Ireland, with eight sites of each of the following habitat types: improved grassland, wet grassland and peatland. The spiders were sampled using pitfall traps which were located within the major vegetation types present in each site as well as within supplementary habitat features which may add to biodiversity value of the whole site such as hedgerows, flushes and the edges of ditches and streams.
   Each habitat supported distinct spider assemblages that reflect major differences in both environmental conditions and management regime. The improved grasslands had low spider species richness and low variation in assemblage structure which is probably related to the intensive management of this habitat. In this case hedgerows maybe an important aspect of the spider diversity within agricultural landscapes. The peatlands, and to a lesser extent wet grasslands, supported a diverse and specialist spider fauna, including a number of rare species; this may be due to differences in soil moisture and plant architecture. Indicators of biodiversity value identified included wet flushes in the peatlands and low grazing pressure in the wet grasslands. This study suggests that in terms of biodiversity value improved grassland is the preferable habitat for afforestation, because of the poor baseline spider diversity. However, it may be unrealistic to expect land owners to afforest their most productive agricultural land, so the management and habitat indicators identified in this study may be of use for assessing habitat quality among the wet grassland and peatlands to allow sites with lower biodiversity value to be identified.

AB Peatland rewetting aims to restore biomass accumulation from peat-forming plants for climate change mitigation, biotope conservation and water purification purposes. Boreal spruce swamp forests in Europe have suffered heavily from drainage for forestry and are now a focus of restoration efforts. We measured Sphagnum height and biomass increment by allowing Sphagnum to grow through mesh nets located in nine undrained, nine drained and 18 rewetted boreal spruce swamp forests. At the moss patch level, rewetting led to a recovery of Sphagnum growth: height increment and biomass increment at the rewetted sites (5907cmyear(-1) and 14715gm(-2)year(-1), meanSE) were similar to increment at the undrained sites (49 +/- 05cmyear(-1) and 128 +/- 12gm(-2)year(-1)), while remnant patches of Sphagnum at the drained sites showed smaller increment (28 +/- 08cmyear(-1) and 76 +/- 19gm(-2)year(-1)). Sphagnum in the ditches at the drained sites showed similar increment as the moss at the undrained and rewetted sites, while ditches at the rewetted sites had the greatest increment (87 +/- 07cmyear(-1) and 183 +/- 16gm(-2)year(-1)). A higher water-table increased Sphagnum growth, and Sphagnum riparium grew more rapidly than the other species. At the ecosystem level, where information on moss cover was utilized, rewetting had increased Sphagnum production to values close to the undrained sites. At the drained sites, biomass production was 8 +/- 17g (mean +/- SE) m(-2)year(-1), at the rewetted sites 42 +/- 15gm(-2)year(-1) and at the undrained sites 66 +/- 12gm(-2)year(-1). Sphagnum cover was the most important variable that determined Sphagnum production in the ecosystem.Synthesis and applications. Drained spruce swamp forests appear to be a suitable target for restoration as they respond readily to rather inexpensive rewetting. The result points out that even in boreal conditions, restoration results can be achieved in a time-scale of years rather than decades. At the ecosystem level, rewetting had resulted in a biomass gain of 34gm(-2)year(-1) when compared to drained sites.

AB Headwater streams export CO2 as lateral down-stream export and vertical evasion from the stream surface. CO2 in boreal headwater streams generally originates from adjacent terrestrial areas, so determining the sources and rate of CO2 transport along the hillslope-riparian-stream continuum could improve estimates of CO2 export via the aquatic pathway, especially by quantifying evasion at higher temporal resolutions. Continuous measurements of dissolved CO2 concentrations and water table were made along the hillslope-riparian-stream continuum in the Vastrabacken sub-catchment of the Krycklan catchment, Sweden. Daily water and CO2 export from the hillslope and riparian zone were estimated over one hydrological year (October 2012-September 2013) using a flow-concentration model and compared with measured lateral downstream CO2 export.
   Total water export over the hydrological year from the hillslope was 230 mmyr(-1) compared with 270 mmyr(-1) from the riparian zone. This corresponds well (proportional to the relative upslope contributing area) to the annual catchment runoff of 265 mmyr(-1). Total CO2 export from the riparian zone to the stream was 3.0 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1). A hotspot for riparian CO2 export was observed at 30-50 cm depth (accounting for 71 % of total riparian export). Seasonal variability was high with export peaks during the spring flood and autumn storm events. Downstream lateral CO2 export (determined from stream water dissolved CO2 concentrations and discharge) was 1.2 g CO2-C M-2 yr(-1). Subtracting downstream lateral export from riparian export (3.0 g CO2-C m-2yr(-1)) gives 1.8 gCO(2)-C m-2yr(-1) which can be attributed to evasion losses (accounting for 60 % of export via the aquatic pathway). The results highlight the importance of terrestrial CO2 export, especially from the riparian zone, for determining catchment aquatic CO2 losses and the importance of the CO2 evasion component to carbon export via the aquatic conduit.

AB A temperate peatland located in the St. Lawrence lowlands (Southern Quebec) was studied in order to specify the past influence of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on its postglacial development. Seven profiles were analysed for pollen, macroremains, microfossils, macro- and microcharcoal, and loss-on-ignition. Fire incidence was important between 9300 and 8200 cal B.P. and during the last 300 years. The Early Holocene fires were contemporaneous with local waterlogged conditions, which prevented the destruction of peat. In contrast, the effects of the recent fires were enhanced by surface dryness resulting from the creation of at least six successive ditch networks over the entire peatland. The modification of the local hydrology and the regular occurrence of fire induced profound vegetation changes. The bryophytic carpet notably regressed in favour of a shrubby coverage, dominated by Chamaedaphne calyculata, Aronia melanocarpa and Betula populifolia. The results obtained suggest that rehabilitation of such an ecosystem is realistic, although relatively urgent in order to preserve the relict populations of endangered species, such as Woodwardia virginica and Dendroica palmarum.

TI Application of Rosgen analysis to the New Jersey Pine Barrens
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
DE surface water hydrology; wetlands; New Jersey Pine Barrens; peatlands
AB Rosgen analysis, developed for assessing channel stability in streams from the western United States, is applied to the Oswego River watershed in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The Rosgen method requires calibration to local conditions due to the impact of peat substrates on channel morphology. In particular, the presence of peat induces low width to depth ratios and greater channel confinement, reversing typical downstream morphologic trends observed in other rivers. Therefore peat is added to those substrates already evaluated by Rosgen. A consistent sequence of Rosgen stream types develops along the Oswego River and its tributaries created by spatially overlapping processes of water table emergence, peat development, and channel formation. This sequence delineates a "natural" transition of stream channel morphology downslope through the watershed. First, as the water table reaches the surface of dry sloughs, Sphagnum growth is stimulated and peat substrates result. These substrates have lower permeability than the underlying gravelly sands. Next, surface runoff, through braided pathways over the peat, eventually erodes mainly anastomosing channels into the peat. Finally, single-thread channels develop in underlying gravelly sands further downslope. This downslope sequence, expressed as Rosgen stream types, begins generally with DA7 streams arising from dry sloughs. These pass to E7, C7 or DA5 stream types that in turn pass to B5c, C5 and C4 stream types. Departures from the "natural" stream type sequence occur along the course of the Oswego and its tributaries due to human activities such as the construction of dams, bridges and drainage ditches, stream bank erosion at streamside camping and picnic areas and the clear-cutting of adjacent stands of Atlantic white cedar.

AB As potential outcomes of climate change, we examined the effects of environmental warming and drying on instantaneous CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in three sedge fens situated in the northern and middle boreal zones. Warming was induced by means of open top chambers (OTCs) and drying through drainage via ditching. OTCs raised the air temperature by 0.2-2 degrees C, whereas short-term drainage dropped the water-table level (WTL) by 5-10 cm and long-term drainage by 10-30 cm. The impact of simulated warming was rather negligible as warmer and drier conditions caused net ecosystem exchange (NEE) to decrease only at one of the two mid-boreal sites. Otherwise, the temperature rise alone or paired with WTL drawdown did not alter gas fluxes at any of the sites. Instead, the drainage effect overrode that of warming. Primarily WTL drawdown accounted for the differences in fluxes detected, but this was more apparent at the mid-boreal sites than our northern-boreal one. Notably, the northernmost Lompolojankka sedge fen, which was both the coolest and wettest of the three sites, was least sensitive to temperature rise and drainage; there, only CH4 emissions were affected by WTL drawdown.

AB Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas controlled by both biotic and abiotic processes. Few studies have investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, and climate change-induced shifts in CH4 flux and the overall carbon budget are therefore largely unknown. Hence, there is an urgent need for long-term in situ experiments allowing for the study of ecosystem processes over time scales relevant to environmental change. Here we present in situ CH4 and CO2 flux measurements from a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden subjected to 16 years of manipulations, including summer warming with open-top chambers, birch leaf litter addition, and the combination thereof. Throughout the snow-free season, the ecosystem was a net sink of CH4 and CO2 (CH4 -0.27 mg C m(-2) d(-1); net ecosystem exchange -1827 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), with highest CH4 uptake rates (-0.70 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during fall. Warming enhanced net CO2 flux, while net CH4 flux was governed by soil moisture. Litter addition and the combination with warming significantly increased CH4 uptake rates, explained by a pronounced soil drying effect of up to 32% relative to ambient conditions. Both warming and litter addition also increased the seasonal average concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the soil. The site was a carbon sink with a net uptake of 60 g Cm-2 over the snow-free season. However, warming reduced net carbon uptake by 77%, suggesting that this ecosystem type might shift from snow-free season sink to source with increasing summer temperatures.
   Plain Language Summary: Much attention has been directed toward methane (CH4) dynamics in peatlands and wet ecosystems at high latitudes, which are considered net CH4 sources which intensify the greenhouse effect and lead to further warming. However, few studies have hitherto investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, which likely exhibit both CH4 production and uptake. Therefore, climate-induced changes in CH4 exchange and the overall carbon balance are largely unknown. In this unique long-term field experiment, we investigated the response of biological CH4 uptake (microbial CH4 consumption) to increased summer warming by open-top chambers and deciduous leaf litter input in a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden, representative of a large proportion of the tundra landscape. We found that leaf litter addition significantly increases CH4 uptake rates due to a pronounced soil drying effect, which is intensified in combination with warming. Warming enhances CO2 release, while CH4 uptake is controlled by soil moisture. The study demonstrates the sensitivity and capacity of a wet heath ecosystem to function as a net CH4 sink. However, it was also shown that higher summer temperatures might shift the ecosystem toward a net carbon source due to an increase in CO2 release, thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect.

AB A cutover bog contaminated with seawater in New Brunswick, Canada remained barren 5 years after peat extraction operations ceased despite the proximity of natural seed sources. The aim of the study was to identify abiotic stresses impeding plant establishment and test transplanting of salt-tolerant wetland plants. The site consisted of long cambered rectangular fields that sloped down (2%) to the drainage ditches on both sides. Across this slope, zones were delineated based on moisture gradient as: Up-areas (drier), Mid-areas (moist) and Low-areas (wet). Juncus balticus was transplanted to these zones in August 2004 whereas Spartina pectinata was reintroduced in June 2005. Plant material was collected from nearby marshes. Survival of J. balticus in August 2005 was poorest at the Low-areas probably because of the early season flooded conditions of that zone. S. pectinata survival in June 2006 was good in all zones having better adaptation to early season waterlogged conditions. Early season waterlogged conditions resulted from a perched water table (May-June) and were alleviated only upon the complete thaw of the frozen peat layer on 8 July. Thereafter, important changes in peat characteristics occurred: lowered water table depths that increased redox potentials, decreased moisture content (theta) that increased dry bulk density (rho), and increased electrical conductivity (EC) that decreased pH. Waterlogged conditions were of greater magnitude and duration at the Low-areas but salinity levels were highest in the Up-areas and Mid-areas. We conclude that local conditions of waterlogging (especially in the Low-areas) and high salinity and low pH (notably in the Up- and Mid-areas) favoured the survival of S. pectinata in all areas and J. balticus in Up- and Mid-areas only.

AB Many of the peatlands that used to extend over large parts of Northern Europe have been reclaimed for agriculture. Human influence continues to have a major impact on the hydrology of those that remain, affecting river flow and groundwater levels. In order to understand this hydrology it is necessary to analyze and assess the groundwater and surface water system as a whole. The SIMGRO model was developed for such situations: it simulates groundwater flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones and also surface water flow. Being physically-based, it is suitable for application to situations with changing hydrological conditions and for practical aspects of water management in peatlands. This paper describes the application of the model to different hydrological situations in the Netherlands, Poland and Lithuania. The 3 cases deal with aspects of flooding, natural flow regime and flood storage in relation to suitable conditions for agriculture and nature. The calibration of the model for the cases was limited, but the simulation results show that the estimates of the discharges and groundwater levels were satisfactory, demonstrating that the model is an adequate tool for simulating the hydrological system, and has the potential to assess the impact of different measures. The Dutch case demonstrates that lowland basins where the groundwater has been lowered by extensive land drainage can be restored by restricting the inflow of surface water from the upper parts of the basin: peak flows are significantly reduced. For the Polish case, the damming of ditches in the valley of the Biebrza River could significantly improve the water regime in the peatlands of this floodplain. For the Lithuanian case, the flow regime for the Dovine River could be made more natural if sluice gates were replaced by overflow spill weirs. Understanding the hydrological system is crucial for sustainable land development and effective soil and nature conservation. The different measures simulated in the 3 cases illustrate SIMGRO's potential to simulate hydrological measures.

AB After 30 years of abandonment, a block-cut peatland near Cacouna, Quebec, Canada, has naturally regenerated Sphagnum mosses on < 10% of its area, typical for these disturbed systems. Distinct hydrologic conditions were observed where Sphagnum has successfully recolonized, providing a basis for establishing thresholds that can be targeted by peatland restoration managers. Sites where Sphagnum mosses recolonized were characterized by high water table (mean-24.9<plus/minus>14.3 cm), soil moisture (theta) > 50%, and soil-water pressure (Psi) >-100 mb. These hydrologic indicators were spatially organized according to the morphology of block- cut trenches, which typically include raised baulks, shallow ditches, and the convex skag (unused turf) deposits along the central axis of the trench. Topographically low areas like the shallow ditches (D) and lower parts of the skag (LS) adjacent to the ditches maintained theta and Psi > 50% and -100 mb, respectively, for 100% of the summer period. About 83% of all Sphagnum recolonization that occurred in the study trench did so in these areas. In more raised areas like the mid- and center portion of the skag, a and Psi eventually fell below these thresholds, and these areas generally did not support Sphagnum, except in a few localized microtopographic depressions in the lower (downslope) end of the trench. While this lower end of the trench had all the Sphagnum species that were present in the trench, even there it was only 38% of the total area. It seems that even short periods of low Psi may restrict Sphagnum reestablishment in an otherwise favorably wet site.

AB Runoff water quality from a peat mine was studied during 1995 and 1996 in Central Finland. Water samples from three drained sub-catchments and groundwater were analysed for all the standard physio-chemical parametres including different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. The annual leaching of phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended solids was estimated to be 16-38 kg km(-2), 1073-1500 kg km(-2), and 2-8 t km(-2), respectively. The variation in nutrient concentrations could be best explained by the relative volumes of new water (5-day sum of rainfall), ditchwater temperature and conductivity. Heavy rainfall caused new water to infiltrate washing nitrate out of the unsaturated peal layer resulting in high concentrations in ground- and ditchwater. Ditchwater phosphorus concentrations always decreased with increased runoff and peaked, as did COD and colour, after dry spells when old groundwater dominated runoff. A large part of the suspended solids load occurred during snowmelt, whereas disserved solids and nitrogen loads peaked during summer flows. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The scale of changes in the areas occupied by laggs or covered by spruce varied with reference to local conditions. The changes were caused by a lowered water level in the peat bogs due to the erosion activity Of the river and streams, artificial lowering of the water level by means of draining ditches, as well as reduced water retention and raised runoff from the adjacent areas resulting from large-area deforestation and changes in the forest stand structure and density.

AB In this paper concerned with soil water dynamics in a managed cutover peat field, the microscale hydrological processes and parameters governing water flow and storage through variably saturated peat are investigated. An open water ditch-reservoir enhanced wetting of adjacent cutover peat, maintaining the water table depth above 43 cm during the summer, surface soil moisture above 45%, and water tension in the surface layer above -45 mbar. Desaturation of pores was noted in the -2 and -10 cm depths, but at -30 and -50 cm a decrease in moisture content of several percent was associated with compression of the peat as the water table dropped. Air entry occurred only at pressures below -15 mbar. Seasonal subsidence resulted in cumulative vertical displacement in excess of 10 cm during the study period. Typical settlements in the peat ranged between 11 and 23% of the lowering of the water table. Considerable hysteresis was observed, and vertical displacement was 5 times greater in response to water loss, compared to rewetting. The specific storage (S-s) in the 180 cm thick deposit averaged 9.4 x 10(-4) cm(-1) during drying periods but averaged only 2.6 x 10-4 cm(-1) on rewetting. S-s was more important than specific yield (S-s) in the overall aquifer storativity. Transient hydraulic properties resulted from the shifting soil structure. The increase in peat bulk density caused by drying increased the water retention capacity and decreased hydraulic conductivity. Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity was 15 cm d(-1) and decreased 2 orders of magnitude as the degree of saturation dropped from 1 to 0.4. The horizontal/vertical anisotropy ratio was 4. The changing surface elevation in response to seasonal subsidence had a profound influence on the nature of the storage changes and hydraulic parameters of the peat soil.

AB The objective of this study was to analyse the conditions for forest production on open, low-production peatlands in Sweden with respect to climate, and water and nutrient regimes.  The study focused on survival and growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings, planted 18 yrs ago in five experimental areas evenly distributed between south and north Sweden.  Different ditch spacing and NPK fertilizer treatments were combined systematically in all experiments.  Survival was positively correlated with temperature sum, fertilization and drainage intensity.  Tree growth was not influenced by variations in temperature sum after merely draining, but in combination with fertilization, growth was strongly correlated with climate.  In the southern experiments, fertilization increased stand growth eight to nine times, whereas stands on the northern sites did not respond to fertilization.  The most important fertilizer element was P.  The application of N had no effect on growth.  More intensive drainage increased stand growth by 60%.  In the southern areas, height development in the most intensive drainage and fertilizer treatments indicates a mean annual increment of 6-7 m3 ha-1, and no sign of decline in growth was seen.  Turf-planting had positive effects on both survival and growth, especially in less intensively drained plots.  A large proportion of damaged trees was observed in the experiment.  The frequency of damaged trees was positively correlated with treatment intensity but negatively correlated with temperature sum.  The results show clearly that merely draining is not sufficient for successful afforestation of low-production peatland sites.  Fertilization by P and K is a necessary prerequisite, but the effect of fertilization varies with climatic conditions, probably owing to the amount of plant-available N.

AB A variety of approaches have previously been developed to estimate the fraction of terrestrial or marine organic carbon present in aquatic sediments. The task of quantifying each component is especially important for the Arctic due to the regions' sensitivity to global climate change and the potential for enhanced terrestrial organic carbon inputs with continued Arctic warming to alter carbon sequestration. Yet it is unclear how each approach compares in de. ning organic carbon sources in sediments as well as their impact on regional or pan-Arctic carbon budgets. Here, we investigated multiple methods: (1) two end-member mixing models utilizing bulk stable carbon isotopes; (2) the relationship between long-chain n-alkanes and organic carbon (ALKOC); (3) principal components analysis (PCA) combined with scaling of a large suite of lipid biomarkers; and (4) ratios of branched and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (the BIT index) to calculate the fraction of terrestrial organic matter components preserved in Arctic marine sediments.
   Estimated terrestrial organic carbon content among approaches showed considerable variation for identical sediment samples. For a majority of the samples, the BIT index resulted in the lowest estimates for terrestrial organic carbon, corroborating recent suggestions that this proxy may represent a distinct fraction of terrestrial organic matter; i.e., peat or soil organic matter, as opposed to markers such as n-alkanes or long-chain fatty acids which measure higher plant wax inputs. Because of the patchy inputs of n-alkanes to this region from coastal erosion in the western Arctic, the ALKOC approach was not as effective as when applied to river-dominated margins found in the eastern Arctic. The difficulties in constraining a marine delta C-13 end-member limit the applicability of stable isotope mixing models in polar regions. Estimates of terrestrial organic carbon using the lipid-based PCA method and the bulk delta C-13 mixing model approach varied drastically at each site, suggesting that organic matter fractions such as amino acids or carbohydrates may affect bulk organic matter composition in a manner that is not captured in the lipid-based analysis. Overall, terrestrial organic matter inputs to the Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas using the average of the methods at each site ranged from 11% to 44%, indicating that land-derived organic matter plays a substantial role in carbon dynamics in the western Arctic Ocean.

AB Questions: Ecological restoration has traditionally been evaluated with analyses focused on species identities and abundances. These analyses provide no ecological explanation to why certain species change in abundance. One solution may be a functional trait analysis. We asked whether shifts in functional traits could explain vegetation changes in fens restored through tree cutting and rewetting, and how the functional traits in the restored sites compare to those of the reference site?
   Location: Three former rich fens in east-central Sweden.
   Methods: Tree cutting and rewetting were applied in a factorial design, and species and abundance data were recorded for 8yrs. Abundance data and trait data of canopy height, specific leaf area (SLA) and diaspore mass were used to calculate functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional dispersion (FDis) and community-weighted mean (CWM) of functional traits. Data were analysed in a linear mixed effect model for vascular plants and bryophytes jointly, and for vascular plants separately. Results of restoration treatments were compared to data from a reference site.
   Results: Among vascular plants, tree cutting caused a decrease in SLA, as shade-sensitive species increased. In accordance with the change in SLA, FDis increased. In the joint analysis, tree cutting led to increased FDis, FDiv and FRic, indicating reduced filtering caused by the removal of the shading canopy, which allowed shade-sensitive species to establish. The comparison to the reference site shows that even after 8yrs, the restoration treatments have higher trait diversity than the reference site, indicating that the restoration sites have a too relaxed trait filter compared to conditions in an undisturbed fen. Our interpretation is that this is primarily caused by insufficient rewetting (and increased nutrient availability) that allow species of both natural and degraded fen conditions to co-exist, and which failed to suppress the regrowth of trees.
   Conclusions: Analysis of functional diversity improves our understanding of the ecological mechanisms affecting restoration results, and allows comparison among regions and communities with different species composition.

AB The Environmental Ministry of Schleswig-Holstein has implemented a novel peatland management strategy in order to utilize the high nutrient retention potential of degenerated peatlands, and to improve the habitat at the same time. The effect of raised water levels and passive land use management on hydraulic properties of heavily vegetated and groundwater-fed open ditches was investigated at the 'Eider River Valley'. The flow properties of selected representative open ditches were regularly assessed at different discharge levels during different vegetation cover periods. The hydraulic residence time is predominantly a function of the open ditch geometry and the overall obstruction cover including the presence of macrophytes. Typical mean discharges measured ranged between 0.2 and 2.5 l/s. Within-ditch vegetation and other hydraulic obstructions, like accumulated silt and organic debris, slow down the hydraulic residence time. The experimental results were evaluated to acquire more realistic values for total bed-roughness under different hydraulic flow regimes. Further findings show that the lower parts of the open ditches were flooded by the Eider River due to the absence of a mowing scheme. Typical water level increases were 0.5 m. This led to a reduction of the velocity and an increase of the dispersion within the ditch. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Zoige peatland is the largest alpine peatland in the world, and it is suffering the threat of water table decline. Plant productivity and species composition are important to ecosystem carbon sequestration and soil carbon input in peatlands. We examined the responses of plant community composition and biomass accumulation to water table decline to better understanding the responses of this peatland to environmental changes. A four-year in situ field experiment was conducted involving three treatments: deep, shallow, and control water tables, which were achieved by experimental drainage with 50 cm, 20 cm, and 0 cm deep ditches, respectively. Experimental drainage decreased the annual mean height of water table by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the control) in the shallow and deep water table treatments, respectively, over the four years. The response of aboveground plant biomass (APB) to water table decline declined in the first year, remained unchanged in the second year and increased during the third and fourth years. However, water table decline had a non-significant effect on belowground plant biomass. This duration-dependent response of APB can be attributed to the changes in community species composition during the study years. Specifically, the negative effect of water table decline in the first year was due to the significant decrease in APB of hygrophytes (sedges and rushes). In the second year, although water table decline significantly increased APB of mesophytes (grasses and forbs), this increase was offset by the decrease in APB of hygrophytes, leading to a neutral effect. In both the third and fourth years, the extent of the increase in APB of mesophytes (typically the forb species Anemone trullifolia var. linearis) was greater than that of the decrease in APB of hygrophytes, leading to a positive effect. Our results indicate that short-term decline of the water table may increase the primary productivity by shifting dominant species of hygrophytes to mesophytes in the Zogie peatland.

AB Degassing of terrestrially-respired CO2 from streams and small rivers appears to be a significant component in watershed carbon budgets. Here we propose an original approach to quantify CO2 degassing in small headwater bodies using pCO(2), DIC (or total alkalinity, TA) and delta C-13-DIC data in stream waters that avoids the difficulty of measuring or choosing a gas transfer velocity. Our inversed model applies to acidic, non-buffered (humic-type) waters and relies on two main assumptions, i.e., the stable isotopic composition of DIC in groundwater seeping to surface water (CO2 from respired soil organic carbon and HCO3- from weathering) and on kinetic fractionation at the water-air interface ((CO2)-C-12 degases to the atmosphere more rapidly than (CO2)-C-13). We first consider both the soil organic matter isotopic composition and the isotopic fractionation of CO2 in the soil, to derive the delta C-13-CO2 in that soil and groundwater. From the HCO3- concentrations in streams, we estimate the relative contribution of silicate and carbonate weathering (the latter being minor in these waters) to the HCO3- and its associated isotopic composition. Model calculations start from the delta C-13-DIC value computed by the aforementioned method and consist of two interlocked iterative procedures. The first procedure simulates the decrease in pCO(2) and the increase in delta C-13-DIC that occur along the stream watercourse during degassing, starting from an assumed initial soil pCO(2) and ending at the in situ pCO(2) or delta C-13-DIC. The second iteration procedure consists of adjusting the initial soil pCO(2) until pCO(2) and delta C-13-DIC simultaneously reach the in situ measured values. After convergence is obtained, the model computes a theoretical concentration of DIC, [DIC](ex.), that has been lost as CO2 to the atmosphere from the headwater to the sampling point in the river. [DIC](ex). can be multiplied by the river discharge to derive the quantity of carbon degassed from the river surface. The model was tested on seasonal field datasets from three small rivers draining sandy podsols in southern France and gave annual areal degassing rates comparable to those reported in other studies, though somewhat larger (upper half range in two rivers, similar to 10 times the average in one stream). Part of this discrepancy might have been caused by an intense degassing in the vicinity of groundwater seeps, which was accounted for our integrative method but not by classical methods based on stream water pCO(2) and gas transfer velocity. The sensitivity of the model results on the assumption of the importance of carbonate weathering might also explain part of this high degassing rate. The model reproduced consistent values and seasonal trends of soil pCO(2) (maximal in summer) and gas transfer velocity (maximal at high water flow). We discuss the sensitivity of the model to the different parameters and assumptions and propose some improvements including groundwater sampling, for better constraining the computed degassing rates.

AB The town of Carquefou, some 10 km northeast of Nantes on the left bank of the river Erdre, occupies a site long associated with human activity. During road construction east of the town, ditches, enclosures and post holes characteristic of the late la Tene were discovered at the locality of "Le Clouet", which led us to obtain core samples from a nearby peat bog. These investigations indicated the changes in vegetation since 3915 +/- 95 uncal B.P., [2828 (2459) 2074 cal B.C.]. The slopes in the surroundings of the bog have been relatively treeless since the Bronze Age, but a very open woodland vegetation composed of Tilia, Corylus and Quercus has been maintained until the present day. In the area around the bog, an Alnus wood with an undergrowth of Cyperaceae was the dominant vegetation, despite some changes probably related to human occupation since the Bronze Age. Beginning at 955 +/- 35 uncal B.P. [1004 (1036, 1144, 1146) 1181 cal A.D.], in the Middle Ages, the alders disappeared almost totally, apparently because of clearance or an increase in water level. Human presence led to intensified cultivation of different crops including Cannabis and especially Cerealia. Finally, the presence of a variety of anthropogenic indicator plants (Cichorioideae, Asteraceae, Plantago lanceolata, etc.) suggests that cattle were reared in the vicinity of the site.

AB In October 1998 a multiple peat slide occurred on the northern slopes of Cuilcagh Mountain, Co. Fermanagh, in response to a high-magnitude rainfall event. Few peat slides have been recorded in Ireland, and a detailed field survey and investigation of the failure was undertaken within four weeks of the event. The morphological evidence indicated a distinct sequence of events which appeared to begin with the failure of a small segment of slope above a degraded transverse drainage ditch which was cut less than ten years previously. This segment of slope was no more than 42 m wide and 25 m long, with 0.7 m of peat overlying up to 0.5 m of a pale coloured clay, the latter containing small pipes and resting on the surface of a darker coloured loamy material. The failure surface was located at or near the base of the pale clay layer. Finite element software was used to model hydrological conditions within the upper segment of slope and to calculate factors of safety for different slope configurations including the presence or absence of a drain or a subsurface pipe. Using the peak shear strength of the pale clay, as determined in the laboratory, both the drain and subsurface pipes were required to obtain a factor of safety of 1.0 or less. Allowing for the uncertainties associated with the hydrological modelling of the pipes, it is suggested that the cutting of the drain and the hydrological impacts of its subsequent degradation are ultimately responsible for the failure.

AB To examine the mechanisms of carbon mobilization and biodegradation during permafrost thawing and to establish a link between organic carbon (OC) and other chemical and microbiological parameters in forming thermokarst (thaw) lakes, we studied the biogeochemistry of OC and trace elements (TEs) in a chronosequence of small lakes that are being formed due to permafrost thawing in the northern part of western Siberia. Twenty lakes and small ponds of various sizes and ages were sampled for dissolved and colloidal organic carbon, metals and culturable heterotrophic bacterial cell number. We observed a sequence of ecosystems from peat thawing and palsa degradation due to permafrost subsidence in small ponds to large, km-size lakes that are subject to drainage to, finally, the khasyrey (drained lake) formation. There is a systematic evolution of both total dissolved and colloidal concentration of OC and TEs in the lake water along with the chronosequence of lake development that may be directly linked to the microbial mineralization of dissolved organic matter and the liberation of the inorganic components (Fe, Al, and TEs) from the organo-mineral colloids.
   In this chronosequence of lake development, we observed an apparent decrease in the relative proportion of low molecular weight < 1 kDa (1 kDa similar to 1 nm) OC concentration along with a decrease in the concentration of total dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) OC. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in the small size organic ligands (probably autochthonous exometabolites produced by the phytoplankton) and a simultaneous decrease in the proportion of large-size organic (humic) complexes of allochthonous (soil) origin. This evolution may be due to the activity of heterotrophic bacterioplankton that use allochthonous organic matter and dissolved nutrients originating from peat lixiviation. Most insoluble TEs demonstrate a systematic decrease in concentration during filtration (5 mu m, 0.45 mu m) exhibiting a similar pattern among different samples. At the same time, there is an increase in the relative proportion of large size particles over the < 1 kDa fraction for most insoluble elements along the chronosequence of lake evolution. TEs are likely to be bound to colloidal OC and coprecipitate with the mineral (Fe, Al) part of the colloids. Upon progressive consumption of dissolved OC by the heterotrophic bacteria, there is liberation of Fe, Al, and insoluble TEs in the water column that may be subjected to coagulation in the form of particles or large-size mineral colloids.

AB Spirosphaera cupreorufescens is described as a new aeroaquatic fungus. It inhabits leaves of deciduous trees submerged in small ditches or puddles in slightly minerotrophic bogs and mires. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of partial nLSU and of the ITSI-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequences are given to reveal its phylogenetic position. Although it is morphologically clearly attributable to the anamorph genus Spirosphaera, LSU rDNA sequence data show that it is not related to the type species of the genus, Spirosphaera floriformis. Whereas Spirosphaera floriformis is phylogenetically placed within the unitunicate Leotiomycetidae sensu lato, Spirosphaera cupreorufescens is embedded within the bitunicate Dothideomycetes. The genus Spirosphaera in its current circumscription is shown to be polyphyletic; however, lack of morphologically discriminating features prevent generic splitting, and the genus Spirosphaera is maintained as an anamorph form-genus. A key to all described species of Spirosphaera is provided.

ID DENITRIFICATION; NITROGEN; MACROPHYTES; SYSTEMS; SCALE
AB The Environmental Ministry of Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany) has implemented a novel peatland rehabilitation programme to utilise the high denitrification potential of degenerated, minerotrophic peatlands for the reduction of nitrate input into aquatic ecosystems, and to simultaneously improve the habitat conditions. Realisation of both goals requires changes to the water management adapted to the site-specific geohydrological conditions. The effect of raised groundwater levels and extensive land use on the water quality of heavily vegetated and groundwater-fed ditches was investigated in a riparian peatland located in the River Eider Valley (a nationally important wetland case study area). The water quality of the selected representative ditches was regularly assessed at different discharge levels during different flow obstruction cover periods. The hydraulic residence time was predominantly a function of the ditch geometry and the overall flow obstruction. A better understanding of the effect of ditch vegetation on the temporal flow patterns and the hydraulic residence times is of high environmental interest, especially for improving nutrient standards in lowland rivers such as the River Eider. Within-ditch vegetation and other hydraulic flow obstructions such as accumulated silt and organic debris increased the hydraulic residence time and led to an improvement of the water quality (e.g. reduction in nitrate content) along the ditch. While ortho-phosphate and ammonia concentrations were acceptable to German water quality standards, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations were frequently elevated due to high discharges despite high flow obstruction cover. Further findings show that the lower stretches of the ditches were flooded by the River Eider due to the absence of a macrophyte-mowing scheme that led to increased water levels during late summer.

AB Forest management practices in boreal peatlands increase nutrient export and suspended solids to watercourses calling for development of new water protection methods. One potential solution could be adsorption-based purification of runoff water using biochar. The aim of this study was to determine the adsorption rate and capacity for Norway spruce and silver birch biochars to design a biochar-filled reactor for a ditch drain. In a 10-day laboratory experiment, biochar was stirred with runoff water from a clear-cut peatland forest, and changes in water pH, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus, and total organic carbon concentrations were measured. Based on the concentration changes, adsorption was quantified and adsorption model containing the adsorption rate and capacity was fitted to the data. Our results indicate that biochar effectively adsorbs both inorganic and organic nitrogen from runoff water. Birch biochar had higher adsorption capacity of nitrogen than spruce biochar. This study demonstrates that the adsorption of nitrogen compounds onto biochar surfaces increases with increasing initial concentrations. Thus, aquatic ecosystems exposed to high nutrient loads from fertile peatlands would particularly benefit from biochar-based water purification.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often considered the most labile portion of organic matter in soil and to be negligible with respect to the accumulation of soil C. In this short review, we present recent evidence that this view is invalid. The stability of DOM from forest floor horizons, peats, and topsoils against microbial degradation increases with advanced decomposition of the parent organic matter (OM). Aromatic compounds, deriving from lignin, likely are the most stable components of DOM while plant-derived carbohydrates seem easily degradable. Carbohydrates and N-rich compounds of microbial origin produced during the degradation of DOM can be relatively stable. Such components contribute much to DOM in the mineral subsoil. Sorption of DOM to soil minerals and (co-)precipitation with Al (and probably also with Fe), especially of the inherently stable aromatic moieties, result in distinct stabilization. In laboratory incubation experiments, the mean residence time of DOM from the Oa horizon of a Haplic Podzol increased from <30 y in solution to >90 y after sorption to a subsoil. We combined DOM fluxes and mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to minerals and a subsoil horizon, and (co-) precipitated with Al to estimate the potential contribution of DOM to total C in the mineral soil of a Haplic Podzol in Germany. The contribution of roots to DOM was not considered because of lack of data. The DOM-derived soil C ranges from 20 to 55 Mg ha(-1) in the mineral soil, which represents 19%-50% of the total soil C. The variation of the estimate reflects the variation in mineralization rate constants obtained for sorbed and (co-) precipitated DOM. Nevertheless, the estimates indicate that DOM contributes significantly to the accumulation of stable OM in soil. A more precise estimation of DOM-derived C in soils requires mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to all relevant minerals or (co-)precipitated with Fe. Additionally, we need information on the contribution of sorption to distinct minerals as well as of (co-)precipitation with Al and Fe to DOM retention.

ID SAMPLES; C-14; AGE
AB Several complications are encountered in radicarbon dating of limnological samples.  The contamination problem is obvious.  Since lake sediments are usually composed of both allochthonous and autochthonous material the origin must be considered.  The organic content may give some guidance.  Graphite in the catchment area and a low organic content indicate a potential risk of major errors in the dates.  Organic material from the surroundings may be displaced into a lake by creeks, snowslides and wind.  Such material may be older than, or contemporaneous with the sediment deposited at the same time.  Water-level changes and wave action may cause erosion and thus admixture of old material.  Such contamination can sometimes be traced via different fractions extracted mechanically or chemically.  The accelerator technique has made it possible to date small samples and thus macrofossils can be selected as the material to be used for dating far more frequently than is possible with the conventional technique for activity measurement.
   Another problem is the reservoir effect - thus the lower C-14 activity of the dissolved bicarbonate and carbon dioxide than of the atmosphere.  There may be several reasons besides dissolved carbonates in hard-water lakes.  Some plants even use carbon dioxide in the sediment.  It is thus to be expected that submerged plants will be dated too old.  Selection of plant remains for dating is thus no gurantee of an accurate date.  The material to be preferred is terrestrial, such as tree leaves or remains of emergent plants.
   Bioturbation must be forgotten since this means that old material may be found too high in a sediment, and young material can be brought downwards in the sediment.  A single date may be very misleading.  Under rather stable conditions the sediment accumulation rate can be roughly estimated and acceptable dates obtained despite the complications.
   It may be worth sieving gyttja samples to remove roots and rootlets.  Roots in peat should also be removed.  Diagrams are available of the errors due to certain degrees of contamination by younger or older material.
   The C-13 content must be measured to allow a normalisation.  The present knowledge of the secular variations of the C-14 activity allows calibration of dates made on wood etc.  The same curves cannot be used for submerged material because of the lower C-14 activity.  Sudden changes of the atmospheric C-14 activity are smoothed.  Certain age ranges gives better resolution than others.  Recent curves indicate that strange results are to be expected for Holocene samples with a real age of 7000 years or older.  Finally bacterial influence during storage may influence the isotopic composition.

AB In a ground-water discharge fen that supports species-rich herbaceous vegetation, the chemistry of the shallow ground water was monitored over two distinct periods. The fen is situated on a thick sandy aquifer in a region that is known for its acid soils. An irrigation ditch supplies the aquifer with alkaline water just upstream of the fen. Three water types of different origin contribute to the hydrochemical pattern in the en. Recently infiltrated acid ground water is present on higher grounds, neutral-to-alkaline irrigation water discharges at the upper fen margin, and deep ground water that is rich in iron discharges in the lower parts. The soil chemistry and species distribution are in accordance with this pattern: rich fen at the upper margin and poor fen in lower parts. However, we detected considerable hydrochemical variability due to varying influence of water types and temporal acidification of the shallow ground water. The latter leads to anionic dominance shifts from HCO3- to SO42- and the release of base cations in the soil solution. This hydrochemical variability is an additional source of environmental heterogeneity and may thus be partly responsible for the species richness.

AB Floating fens are species-rich succession stages in fen areas in the Netherlands. Many of these fens are deteriorating due to acidification; Sphagnum species and Polytrichum commune build 10-25 cm thick moss carpets, and the species diversity decreases. Earlier experiments in wet ecosystems indicate that successful restoration of circum-neutral and mesotrophic conditions requires a combination of hydrological measures and sod removal. In an acidified fen recharged by rainwater in the nature reserve Ilperveld (The Netherlands), a ditch/trench system was dug for the purpose of creating a run-off channel for acid rainwater in wet periods and to enable circum-neutral surface water to enter the fen in dry periods. Moreover, the sod was removed in part of the fen. Ditch/trench creation or sod cutting had no effect individually, but a combination of the two measures led to a change in the abiotic conditions (higher pH and Ca), and in turn to an increase of species-richness and the reestablishment of a number of characteristic species. Reestablishment of rare vascular plant species and characteristic bryophytes might be a long-term process because of incomplete recovery of site conditions and constraints in seed dispersal.

   Bog in Bath township, Ohio: Towards restoration and enhancement
SO OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The current state of the Bath Tamarack Bog has raised concern about the health and function of the system. Only 6 tamarack (Larix laricina) trees remain, while deciduous trees, particularly red maple (Acer rubrum) and invasive species such as glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), dominate the bog. Our purpose was to assess the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the tamarack bog. Environmental and biological properties of Bath Tamarack Bog were measured from May 2001 through November 2002. In 2001, the center of the bog experienced water levels below those typically found in bogs, yet experienced normal water levels in the following year. Water chemistry results indicate the pH is much greater than that characteristic of a typical bog, ranging from 5.94 to 7.41. Nutrient levels fluctuated and were generally higher for calcium, potassium, and phosphate than a typical bog, while nitrogen levels remained low. These results indicate that the bog is not functioning normally and is in decline. The degradation of the bog is most likely due to anthropogenic activity. Ditching occurred between 1963 and 1969 and seems to have induced the progression of red maple trees and invasive species into the bog by lowering water levels. Since 1938, the first aerial photo we have record of, the bog has reduced to approximately a third of its size, which is approximately 1.99 hectares. The bog appears to be in a late successional stage, rapidly changing to a forested wetland. We discuss possible management and restoration efforts needed to restore or enhance the tamarack bog, including 1) planting Sphagnum mats, 2) introducing tamarack seedlings, 3) controlling invasive species, and 4) maintaining the hydrology close to the soil surface. All of these measures are suggested in association with educational outreach.

The lakes and ditches acted as CO2 and CH4 sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1 +/- A 8.2 (mean +/- A SE) and 61.5 +/- A 7.1 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CO2 and 33.7 +/- A 9.3 and 3.9 +/- A 1.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87% of the variation in CH4 could be explained by PO4 (3-) concentration in the sediment and Fe2+ concentration in the water, and 89% of the CO2 flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these water bodies.

AB In 2015, Chara papillosa was found in a depression in a quaking bog in the Stobberibben, but this population was soon gone. The next year, however, the species was found again in a ditch in the Woldlakebos, where it occurred for three consecutive years. The areas of the Stobberibben and the Woldlakebos are adjacent to each other and belong to the Weerribben, a nature reserve in the northwest of the Province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. The only previous record of C. papillosa in the Netherlands dates from c. 1920, when material of this was species was collected in or near Huissen, Province of Gelderland, unfortunately without any further details about the precise location.
   In the depressions and ditches of the Stobberibben, several other charophyte species have been recorded: Chara aspera, C. contraria var. contraria, C. globularis var. globularis, C. hispida (syn. C. major), C. virgata, C. vulgaris var. vulgaris and var. papillata, Nitella flexilis, and Tolypella glomerata. In the ditch in the Woldakebos, C. papillosa was accompanied by Potamogeton alpinus, P. mucronatus, C. virgata, C. globularis, Sparganium emersum, and Myriophyllum verticillatum.
   This short communication describes the ecology of Chara papillosa, its distribution in Europe, as well as a few identification characters of this species.

AB The restoration of wetlands as bird habitats often involves the maintenance of a fluctuating water regime by careful, localised ditch water management using pumps and sluices. However, there is evidence in the literature to Suggest that alternate flood/drainage cycles can accelerate nutrient cycling and transport within the soil and, therefore, pose a threat to water quality through the process of eutrophication. This study focused on the dynamics and losses of soil P in a recently re-wetted, eutrophic fen peat developed on alluvium ill South west England. During the 2-year Study (2001 and 2002), soil water tensiometry revealed that the field water table (fluctuating annually between +20 and 60 cm relative to ground level) was extensively influenced across most of the 8.4 ha field site by the management of the adjacent ditch water levels. This conservation-led, prescribed water balance was facilitated by the high hydraulic conductivity (1.1 x 10(-s) ms(-1)) of the lower (70-140 cm), degraded layer of peat. However, only during a 7-day period of water table drawdown by intermittent pump drainage, approximately 45 g ha(-1) of dissolved reactive P (DRP) entered the pumped ditch from the field via this degraded layer. Summer rainfall events >35 mm d(-1) also coincided with significant peaks ill ditch water P concentration (up to 200 mu g L-1 DRP). Even larger peaks (Up to 700 mu g L-1 DRP) Occurred With the annual onset of autumn reflooding. These episodic P loss events pose a serious potential threat to biological water quality.

AB Methane and carbon dioxide fluxes were quantified for 14 ditches and larger water bodies in Dutch peatlands, surrounded by different habitat types, using concentration changes in floating flux chambers. Average fluxes from these waters were 11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SE) mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (n = 66) and 86 +/- 21 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) (n = 55). Variability among water bodies was substantial in both gases and could be explained by water depth and surrounding habitat. Ditches in intensively used dairy land or rough pastures had significantly higher CH4 emission rates (17 +/- 6 and 18 +/- 8 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) than those in reed and sedge beds or open water (7 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Bubbles contributed between 34 and 69% to the total CH4 flux, with higher proportions observed in ditches sheltered by tall vegetation. Observed day-time CO2 fluxes were either positive (shaded ditches in reed and sedge stands or rough pasture; 120-150 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) or did not differ from zero (open water, ditches in intensively managed pasture). Since these peatlands have substantial areas of permanent surface water (6-43%), landscape-scale carbon flux estimates are improved by incorporating specific flux estimates for these waters.

AB Water table decline is a major threat to soil organic carbon in peatlands worldwide principally because it may largely increase soil CO2 emission (SCE). This study is to determine the response of SCE to water table decline in the Zoige peatland of Tibetan Plateau, which has experienced rapid decline of water table due to climate change and anthropogenic drainage. We conducted a field in situ drainage experiment consisting of low (plots surrounded by 50 cm deep ditches), intermediate (20 cm deep) and high (intact) water table levels. The experiment lasted for about four years, during which we measured SCE rate and associated variables including soil temperature and moisture with a higher frequency in the growing season (May-September) than the non-growing season (October-April). Experimental drainage decreased water table height by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the intact) and soil moisture (at 5 cm soil) by 6% and 12% (relative to 45% in the intact) on average in intermediate and low water table treatments, respectively, but it did not affect soil temperature during the experimental years.
   The effect of drainage on SCE varied with season. In the non-growing season, the drainage effect was nonsignificant in each measurement possibly because the low-temperature effect overrode the drainage effect on SCE. In the growing season, the drainage mostly increased the emission except for several cases, in which a negative effect was observed. The negative effect of drainage could be due to the low soil moisture (< 25%) in the drained treatments. Provided that the magnitude and the duration of the SCE increase were greater than those of the decrease, it can be estimated that drainage increased SCE by 17% and 20% on average in the low and the intermediate water table treatments, respectively, over the experimental years. Our results suggest that water table decline may facilitate net carbon emission and hence decrease soil carbon storage in the Zoige peatland. We call for artificial filling of the ditches that were historically created by both human beings and storm waters to increase water table in the Zoige peatland.

The new species are compared with similar species (H. conifer arum with H. fuscum, H. cumbriense, H. multiseptatum and H. pinicola; H. longitubulosum with H. tubulosum and H. longisporum). In addition, ecology and substrates are recorded: Whereas H. coniferarum was isolated from pine litter submerged in oligotrophic peat bog ditches, H. longitubulosum grew on an oak leaf submerged in a eutrophic woodland pond. The presence of microconidia in H. longitubulosum is discussed.

AB Sinking groundwater levels and increasing dryness in wetlands and water bodies due to climate and land-use changes are being noticed ever more frequently in the northeast German Lowlands. The following paper describes an investigation concerning the nature reserve Lake Luchsee and its nearby fen, a mesotrophic sour fen of about 55 ha of surface with an open-water surface of approximately 8 ha (SUCCOW & JOOSTEN 2001). Sinking levels of groundwater and fen-water lead to advancing degradation of the fen body and spreading of trees into the fen area. Many efforts have been taken to stop this degradation, because the fen was categorized as protective zone 1 in the Biosphere Reserve Spreewald.
   Measures supposed to stop this development range from rising the water levels in nearby lakes, removing drainage ditches in a polder area close to the Lake Luchsee, thinning out and restructuring the surrounding forests, (mainly pine stands to be converted to mixed forests) to checking and - if necessary - adjusting the maximum permissible groundwater pumping of a nearby waterworks. The measures chosen for implementation must be as efficient as possible, because of financial constraints and time pressure. Therefore, a water-balance model was set up to calculate and evaluate the measures regarding their effects on the water balance. The modelling system ArcEGMO (PFUTZNER 2002) combined with the soil-water and vegetation module PSCN (KLOCKING & SUCKOW 2003) and the groundwater model ASM (KINZELBACH & RAUSCH 1995) served to calculate scenarios that describe the effects of the envisaged measures.

AB Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are proliferating but are challenged by insufficient attention to spatial and temporal inter-dependencies, interactions between different ecosystems and their services, and the need for multi-level governance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to the development and implementation of PES schemes that incorporates multilevel governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based PES scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's UK Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers' preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around (sic)2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair price per tonne of CO2 equivalent from (sic)11.18 to (sic)15.65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively. The Peatland Code was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders at catchment, landscape and national scales, enabling multi-level governance of the management and delivery of ecosystem services across these scales. Place based PES schemes can mitigate negative trade-offs between ecosystem services, more effectively include cultural ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance.

AB Land subsidence in low-lying peatlands can be caused by shrinkage and organic matter oxidation. When these areas have networks of ditches and canals for drainage purposes, the sediments that accumulate in the waterways can be used to reverse the process of land subsidence. The objective of this study is to understand how dredged sediments can be used to reverse the process of land subsidence by analysing the contribution of shrinkage and organic matter mineralization to the subsidence observed in an upland deposit. A deposit of dredged sediments in the Wormer-en Jisperveld-North Holland, the Netherlands- was characterized during 17 months in terms of subsidence of the sediments, subsidence of the soil underlying the deposit, geotechnical water content, organic matter content, type of organic matter and nutrients. The deposit was filled to a height of 195 cm, and after 17 months, the subsidence of the sediments was 88 cm. In addition, a subsidence of 19.5 cm of the underlying soil was observed. Subsidence could be attributed to shrinkage since no significant changes in the organic matter content and total organic carbon were observed. The type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification until winter 2014, stabilized from winter 2014 to spring 2015 and changed in the direction of mineralization after the spring of 2015. Subsidence of dredged sediments in upland deposits is caused by shrinkage during the first 17 months. The solution of spreading thinner layers of sediments over the land to decrease the subsidence rates should be explored since the pressure of the deposit on the underlying soil caused an extra subsidence of 19.5 cm.

AB Conservation organizations have most often focused on land-use change, climate change, and invasive species as prime threats to biodiversity conservation. Although air pollution is an acknowledged widespread problem, it is rarely considered in conservation planning or management. In this synthesis, the state of scientific knowledge on the effects of air pollution on plants and animals in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States is summarized. Four air pollutants (sulfur, nitrogen, ozone, and mercury) and eight ecosystem types ranging from estuaries to alpine tundra are considered. Effects of air pollution were identified, with varying levels of certainty, in all the ecosystem types examined. None of these ecosystem types is free of the impacts of air pollution, and most are affected by multiple pollutants. In aquatic ecosystems, effects of acidity, nitrogen, and mercury on organisms and biogeochemical processes are well documented. Air pollution causes or contributes to acidification of lakes, eutrophication of estuaries and coastal waters, and mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. In terrestrial ecosystems, the effects of air pollution on biogeochemical cycling are also very well documented, but the effects on most organisms and the interaction of air pollution with other stressors are less well understood. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence for effects of nitrogen deposition on plants in grasslands, alpine areas, and bogs, and for nitrogen effects on forest mycorrhizae. Soil acidification is widespread in forest ecosystems across the eastern United States and is likely to affect the composition and function of forests in acid-sensitive areas over the long term. Ozone is known to cause reductions in photosynthesis in many terrestrial plant species. For the most part, the effects of these pollutants are chronic, not acute, at the exposure levels common in the eastern United States. Mortality is often observed only at experimentally elevated exposure levels or in combination with other stresses such as drought, freezing, or pathogens. The notable exceptions are the acid/aluminum effects on aquatic organisms, which can be lethal at levels of acidity observed in many surface waters in the region. Although the effects are often subtle, they are important to biological conservation. Changes in species composition caused by terrestrial or aquatic acidification or eutrophication can propagate throughout the food webs to affect many organisms beyond those that are directly sensitive to the pollution. Likewise, sublethal doses of toxic pollutants may reduce the reproductive success of the affected organisms or make them more susceptible to potentially lethal pathogens. Many serious gaps in knowledge that warrant further research were identified. Among those gaps are the effects of acidification, ozone, and mercury on alpine systems, effects of nitrogen on species composition of forests, effects of mercury in terrestrial food webs, interactive effects of multiple pollutants, and interactions among air pollution and other environmental changes such as climate change and invasive species. These gaps in knowledge, coupled with the strong likelihood of impacts on ecosystems that have not been studied in the region, suggests that current knowledge underestimates the actual impact of air pollutants on biodiversity.
   Nonetheless, because known or likely impacts of air pollution on the biodiversity and function of natural ecosystems are widespread in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, the effects of air pollution sould be considered in any long-term conservation strategy. It is recommended that ecologically relevant standards, such as "critical loads," be adopted for air pollutants and the importance of long-term monitoring of air pollution and its effects is emphasized.

AB Across Europe, the majority of afforestation is carried out on former agricultural land. Given this current planting trend it is important to assess the impact that afforestation will have on the flora and fauna of habitats typically used for afforestation. The study aim was to investigate the initial effects of afforestation (5 years after planting) on the ground-dwelling spider fauna within three habitats (peatlands, improved grasslands and wet grasslands) in Ireland. A paired sampling approach was used where 24 pairs of unplanted and planted sites (eight within each habitat type) were matched for habitat, vegetation type, soil properties, and geographical location. The planted sites were comprised of 5-year-old stands of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Within each habitat pitfall traps were established in areas of vegetation cover representative of the site as a whole, as well as in supplementary features which may also contribute to the biodiversity of a site, for instance in hedgerows, wet flushes, and the edges of ditches or streams.
   During the study 33,157 spiders were collected in 189 species and 18 families. Forty species sampled were associated with open habitats whereas 15 species were associated with forested habitats, 54 species were associated with wet habitats whereas two species were associated with dry habitats. Across the habitats fewer wet-associated species and fewer rare species were supported after afforestation. In particular areas of wet flush in the peatlands supported a unique and diverse spider fauna which was lost after afforestation. In contrast, the planted improved grasslands were more species rich, and supported a greater number of spider species associated with low vegetation than comparable unplanted sites. The hedgerow spider fauna did not differ notably in assemblage composition between the unplanted and planted sites. This study suggests that even in the early stages of the forest cycle (first 5 years) there is a change in the spider fauna, with the rare or specialist species being replaced by habitat generalists or species associated with forested habitats. It is also suggested that peatlands are particularly sensitive to afforestation, indicating that in terms of biodiversity loss, this habitat is the least suitable for afforestation.

AB A vast, ground-water-supported sedge fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA was ditched in the early 1900 s in a failed attempt to promote agriculture. Dikes were later constructed to impound seasonal sheet surface flows for waterfowl management. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which now manages the wetland as part of Seney National Wildlife Refuge, sought to redirect water flows from impounded C-3 Pool to reduce erosion in downstream Walsh Ditch, reduce ground-water losses into the ditch, and restore sheet flows of surface water to the peatland. A water budget was developed for C-3 Pool, which serves as the central receiving and distribution body for water in the affected wetland. Surface-water inflows and outflows were measured in associated ditches and natural creeks, ground-water flows were estimated using a network of wells and piezometers, and precipitation and evaporation/evapotranspiration components were estimated using local meteorological data. Water budgets for the 1999 springtime peak flow period and the 1999 water year were used to estimate required releases of water from C-3 Pool via outlets other than Walsh Ditch and to guide other restoration activities. Refuge managers subsequently used these results to guide restoration efforts, including construction of earthen darns in Walsh Ditch upslope from the pool to stop surface flow, installation of new water-control structures to redirect surface water to sheet flow and natural creek channels, planning seasonal releases from C-3 Pool to avoid erosion in natural channels, stopping flow in downslope Walsh Ditch to reduce erosion, and using constructed earthen dams and natural beaver dams to flood the ditch channel below C-3 Pool. Interactions between ground water and surface water are critical for maintaining ecosystem processes in many wetlands, and management actions directed at restoring either ground- or surface-water flow patterns often affect both of these components of the water budget. This approach could thus prove useful in guiding restoration efforts in many hydrologically altered and managed wetlands worldwide. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel faunistic data are presented from the poorly explored area of northern Lapland and comparisons are made between the present day ostracod diversity and historical records from a century ago. Twenty sites were sampled across Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish Lapland: eight to the west of the Scandinavian Mountain range, where the climate is milder under the influence of the Gulfstream, and 12 sites in the slope area east of these mountains, where the impact of the continental climate is stronger The sample sites were mainly peat bogs fed by springs (the dominant habitat type in the study area), but also included helocrene springs, ditches, ponds and the littoral zone of lakes.
   In total 4376 individuals belonging to 16 species were collected. The most widespread and abundant species were Cyclocypris ovum, Candona candida and Pseudocandona rostrata, whereas Cyclocypris serena, Cryptocandona vavrai and Eucypris pigra were least abundant. The diversity of the ostracod assemblages to the west and to the east of the Scandinavian Mountains was significantly different, as measured by the Shannon diversity index. Mean values were 0.36 (western slopes) and 0.84 (eastern slopes).
   Three assemblage types were distinguished using UPGMA cluster analysis, with C. ovum, C. candida and P. rostrata as the three characteristic species. However, no statistically significant differences were revealed between the ostracod site assemblages when grouped geographically into west and east of the Scandinavian Mountains. Our results did not show any significant correlation between the Bray-Curtis similarity of the ostracod assemblages and the geographical separation between sites.
   The most marked difference in ostracod diversity between the present data and the records from the beginning of the 20th century seems to be a retreat of some Arctic species from the Lapland area and a shift of a few eurytopic species further to the north of Lapland. Possible factors influencing this shift are discussed.

AB A novel peatland management strategy to utilise the high nutrient-retention potential of degenerated peatlands has been implemented in Northern Germany. The effect of raised water levels and extensive land-use management on hydraulic properties, water quality and vegetation characteristics of heavily vegetated and groundwater-fed open ditches, was investigated at the River Eider Valley - a notionally important wetland case study. A better understanding of the effect of vegetation on the temporal flow patterns and the hydraulic retention times is of high scientific interest, especially for improving nutrient standards in lowland rivers. Within-ditch vegetation and other hydraulic obstructions, including accumulated silt and organic debris, increase the hydraulic retention time and lead to an improvement of the water quality along the open ditch. Lower ports of the open ditches were flooded by the River Eider, due to the absence of a mowing scheme during late summer.

AB This paper presents the results of a project in which the seasonal changes in the chemistry of groundwater in dipwells at Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve were investigated for the first time. Thirteen dipwells arranged in two roughly perpendicular transects across Wicken Fen were sampled for groundwater on a monthly basis between April 2010 and April 2011. Surface water from a drainage ditch (Gardiner's Drain) and groundwater from a further location (dipwell 17) were also sampled at the same interval. The water samples were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major solutes (Ca, Na, Mg, S), nutrients (N, P, K) and trace elements (Al, Fe, Mn) in the laboratory. Measurements of pH and electrical conductivity were also taken from the soil at the fourteen dipwell locations. The results of these analyses are compared to borehole data, groundwater levels and precipitation data to form a new conceptual model of the spatial and temporal variations in groundwater chemistry at Wicken Fen, which have important implications for future hydrological and vegetation management regimes.

AB This study quantified the temporal properties of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in the Zoige basin of the Yellow River source region, China during the 1967-2011 period, as well as their influence to the area reduction of peatland. We extracted areas of different land-use and land-cover (LULC) types and obtained daily precipitation data. Then, we calculated annual precipitation (AP) and specific cumulative precipitation (SCP), which is the sum of precipitation to the date when an image was taken, and showed that the peatland areas were strongly affected by SCP. Using a modified Penman-Monteith equation, we calculated ETa for each LULC type and the area-weighted ones to show that the area-weighted total ETa was mainly contributed from grassland and peatland, which was between 450 and 550 mm. Temporal trends of the ratio of SCP to evapotranspiration showed that precipitation was generally greater than evapotranspiration rate not only during the summer but also over the 1967-2011 period. This trend failed to completely explain the continuous decrease of peatland area in the Zoige basin in decades. The draining effect of artificial ditches and natural gullies might play an additional role in causing peatland degradation but requires further process-based studies.

AB Rising air temperatures in the Arctic may destabilize a large pool of organic carbon stored in permafrost, thereby causing a positive feedback to global climate warming. Permafrost thaw could also deepen hydrologic flow paths and expose previously frozen rock and mineral fragments to chemical weathering. Future shifts in the inorganic solute geochemistry of Arctic rivers may signal changes in soil processes that also affect organic carbon storage. Tracing permafrost thaw with dissolved riverine loads requires understanding the spatial and seasonal variation of chemical weathering reactions and other biogeochemical phenomena that affect elemental mass-transport. To help identify connections between mineral weathering and active layer processes, we studied the major ion and isotope (delta(34) S-SO4, delta(13) C-DIC, Sr-87/Sr-86, delta(44/40) Ca, and delta(44/42) Ca) geochemistry of fivestreams draining the North Slope of Alaska. Continuous permafrost underlies all streams, but the Atigun River, Roche Moutonnee Creek, and Trevor Creek primarily drain bare bedrock outcrops in the Brooks Range, while the Upper Kuparuk River and Imnavait Creek primarily drain tundra. In total, we collected 546 water samples spanning the spring freshet through fall freeze-up in 2009 and 2010. We also analyzed snow, rock, sediment, soil, and plant samples.
   Major ion ratios and delta(13) C-DIC values point to the overall dominance of carbonate weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids, with additional influences from atmospheric deposition, plant decay, sulfate salt dissolution, and silicate weathering by carbonic acid. delta(13) CDIC values may also reflect partial equilibration with soil and atmospheric CO2. All streams display large seasonal variations in major ion ratios and delta(13) C-DIC values that are consistent with progressive deepening of the seasonally thawed zone over the summer. In the mountain watersheds, carbonate weathering dominates during the spring and summer, while sulfate salt (primarily CaSO4 and MgSO4) dissolution dominates during the fall. Riverine delta S-34(SO4) values reveal that the sulfate salts are secondary precipitates. We propose a conceptual model where cryoconcentration in soils during the late fall and winter causes secondary mineral formation at depth and re-exposure during subsequent thaw seasons produces the observed geochemical signals in rivers. The tundra streams lack definitive evidence for sulfate salt dissolution, presumably because thick peat soils limit the exposure and weathering of underlying glacial sediment where the salts are expected to form and dissolve. Appearance of a sulfate salt dissolution signal in tundra streams may correlate with future permafrost degradation. Carbonate weathering dominates riverine Sr-87/(86) Sr ratios, but the compositional heterogeneity of bedrock limits interpretation of the data. All rivers have higher delta(44/40) Ca values compared to bedrock, likely due to plant uptake of lighter Ca isotopes. In the tundra watersheds, freshet delta(44/40) Ca values were 0.10-0.20% lower than summer and fall values. These trends likely reflect contributions from plant decay, as comparison between delta(44/40) Ca and delta(44/42) Ca values suggests that all isotopic variation is mass-dependent with minimal radiogenic Ca-40 inputs from the weathering of old silicate minerals with high K/Ca ratios.

ID MECHANISMS; EROSION; FLOOD
AB Two shallow translational slides occurred in blanket peat on Skerry Hill, Co. Antrim, in November 1991 at sites adjacent to slides activated c. 25 years ago. Heavy rainfall, degraded drainage ditches and slope morphology are considered to have been important factors contributing to peat instability. The failure planes are located close to the peat base, at the boundary between less compact fibrous peat above and more compact humified peat below. The preservation of large blocks and rafts of intact peat and the limited amount of liquefied peat in the debris tongues is thought to reflect the degree of peat humification. There is also some evidence to suggest that the peat was probably undersaturated at the time of failure and this may have assisted preservation of intact peat blocks. Tension cracks, resulting from either short-term desiccation or long-term slow mass movement, are thought to have facilitated the rapid transfer of heavy rain to the subsurface peat, causing high pore-water pressures and lubrication of the failure planes. Vegetation recolonization will probably follow a pattern similar to that observed on the adjacent earlier slides.

ID WETLAND; RUNOFF; AREA
AB Linear regression analysis and weekly water level measurements were used to study the hydrological balance of a groundwater discharge fen. The main water flows pertain to rainfall, evapotranspiration, and groundwater discharge. Owing to the high water table in depressions, rainfall is transformed partly to direct runoff. This process depends on the landform of the study area and on the daily distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration. During very dry summers, evaporation causes a drop in the water table. Such events may be important for plant life in the fen. Protection of the regional groundwater flow and regulation of the ditches are potential measures for hydrological management of the site.

AB An Euastrum species (Conjugatophyceae, Streptophyta) was found in an agricultural ditch fed by a rheocrenic, slightly-hot spring 'Ain El-Balad' in the El-Farafra Oasis, Western Desert of Egypt. Morphotaxonomic diagnosis and autecology of this desmid species are hereby documented in detail and compared to other morphologically similar species and infraspecific taxa, particularly those of the species complex E. spinulosum. As compared to most other species of that complex, the newly described Euastrum species is mainly characterized by its distinctive small-sized cells, rather shallow and widely open invaginations between the semicell lobes and less pronounced apical lobes. Moreover, the basal lobes are broadly rounded and larger than the lateral lobes. We have named this interesting species E. elfarafraense sp. nov. after the type locality, the El-Farafra Oasis.

AB We present the 10-year results of a forest drainage experiment conducted in a pre-mature uneven-aged black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) stand, in Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada. The set up included 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 m ditch spacings, and the data were pooled in three diameter classes, <= 4 cm (small stems), 6-10 cm (medium-size stems) and >= 12 cm (large stems), in order to take into account stand structure in the analysis. The diameter growth of large stems (dominant cover, height similar to 8-12 m) was not improved by drainage. Medium-size stems (intermediate story, similar to 4-8 m) showed a better growth at a 5-10 m distance from the ditches, while small stems (understory similar to 1-4 m) reacted well to drainage, proportionally to ditch closeness. Generally, growth and gain attributable to drainage increased with the live crown ratio, from one third of the total tree height. We did not detect any effect of drainage or distance from the nearest ditch on the nutrient content of the current year foliage of the large stems. For small stems, even the individuals located at 25-30 m from the ditches showed a growth increase compared to the control, although the understory did not benefit from full light conditions. Results suggest that drainage aiming at correcting watering-up following harvesting could permit a rapid growth increase of advance growth.

AB Many wetlands are heavily modified and identifying the environmental drivers of indicator groups like aquatic insects is complicated by multiple stressors and co-varying environmental factors. Yet, incorporating data from other biological groups, such as microbial communities, potentially reveals which environmental factors are underpinning insect community composition. In the present study we investigated the application of benthic microbial community composition, as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, alongside aquatic insect data in 25 peatland ditches in the province of North Holland, The Netherlands. We applied clustering and principal component analysis to a matrix of 26 PLFAs to group ditches by the microbial community. Generalized linear models were used to examine correlations between microbial PLFAs, insects, vegetation (emergent and submerged) and abiotic factors. The ratio of heterotrophic (e.g. sulphate reducing bacteria) to autotrophic (e.g. algae and cyanobacteria) derived PLFAs could be estimated as the ratio between saturated and branched to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (SB/MP). SB/MP was correlated with insect community composition, differences in water chemistry (in particular bicarbonate, sulphate and nutrients) and vegetation cover in the ditches. Moreover, ditches distinguished by their microbial communities differed in the number of insects they supported with differences most pronounced for Odonata, Trichoptera and Chironomus larvae. This study demonstrates that integrating microbial and aquatic insect community data provides insight into key environmental drivers in modified aquatic ecosystems and may facilitate the development of remediation strategies for degraded wetlands.

AB We examined factors that influence the expansion of alder forests in a wetland isolated by dikes and drainage ditches in northern Japan. Using aerial photographs, airborne laser scanner data, and existing elevation data, we described the spatial distribution and heights of alder forest in 2002 and the spatial distribution in 1977. We also measured water level and water quality in 2002. The mean water level was slightly lower than the ground surface, and water level fluctuation was minimal. The study site was mesotrophic, but salt concentration was high. The alder forest expanded around the area adjacent to the alder forests present in 1977, and the canopy cover ratio increased over a wide area. A generalized linear model suggested that water level and quality and the previous distribution of reproductively mature trees controlled the expansion pattern of the alder forest. A decrease in water level fluctuation promoted initial establishment, while an increase in fluctuation promoted height growth. A decrease in salt concentration or acidity promoted both initial establishment and growth. Flood protection by dikes may change spatial distribution of alder trees by narrowing water level fluctuation, restricting fruit dispersal, and reducing tree mortality.

AB Erosion of deposited organic peat sediments from peat harvesting ditches was studied in both laboratory and field conditions. Peat sediments were placed in a recirculation flume at controlled pH levels and allowed to stabilize from 15 min to 10 d. Afterward, different flow velocities were applied and the peat erosion was measured. The erosion rate was related to the physical properties of peat: the particle size and form, settling velocity, peat type and degree of decomposition (von Post). The mean average settling velocity for the peat was measured to be 0.87 m h(-1). The median sediment particle size was 42 mm, which indicates that the peat sediment is partly cohesive. The deposited sediment formed a loose layer overlaid by more stabilized layers. Critical shear stress for the surface of the loose peat layer was 0.01 N m(-2) and for the more consolidated layer was 0.059 N m(-2) after a stabilization of three days. The erosion coefficients determined during laboratory study varied between 3.7.10(-4) and 4.1.10(-6) kg m(-2) s(-1). The determined erosion and sedimentation rates were used to calibrate sediment erosion and deposition models. A new approach was then developed for the uses of these models to simulate peat sediment delivery from field ditches. The model was tested against measured values which were in accordance to observed sediment transport rates.

AB 1. Drainage ditches are a common aquatic habitat in the lowland agricultural landscape of north-western Europe. The invertebrate fauna of these waters is poorly known compared with that of the semi-natural wetland fragments found in this region. While most wetlands are designated as nature reserves, drainage ditches are generally viewed purely as hydrological infrastructure in support of agriculture.
   2. To assess the conservation value for aquatic invertebrates of these man-made habitats compared with that of wetland fragments, the taxonomic composition and life-history characteristics of invertebrate assemblages inhabiting nine small lakes and nine ditches in peatlands in the Netherlands were compared, as well as the environmental characteristics potentially influencing assemblage structure.
   3. Although ditches comprised a smaller water volume, contained less diverse vegetation, displayed larger fluctuations in nutrient concentrations and were regularly managed, the total number of invertebrate taxa recorded per taxonomic group was comparable with that in small lakes, as was the number of nationally uncommon to very rare taxa.
   4. Similarity in life-history characteristics between the two water-body types was high, except that a higher proportion of atmospheric air breathers was found in ditches, and more plant miners and collectorfilterers in small lakes.
   5. On a regional scale, a relatively high inter-ditch taxon dissimilarity was observed, resulting in total diversity estimates for ditches exceeding those of small lakes.
   6. This study showed that drainage ditches can be a significant habitat type for aquatic invertebrates. In the Netherlands, water bodies in peatland agricultural areas can contain a diverse invertebrate fauna, similar to that of water bodies in nearby nature reserves.

AB In Canada, Bog Bird's-foot Trefoil, Lotus pinnatus, is confined to vernally wet meadows, creek margins, ditches and seepages, where underground water comes to the surface. Seven localities, within a small area on the east coast of Vancouver Island near Nanaimo, British Columbia, have been confirmed in recent years. At two others it is considered extirpated. The lack of protection on private land, alterations to hydrology, and erosion arising from intensive recreational use of primary habitat by off-road vehicles as well as the appearance of invasive, species are the main concerns for British Columbia populations.

AB Shallow landslides involving loss of blanket peat are relatively uncommon but can nevertheless be environmentally and geomorphologically significant. This paper describes a cluster of 40 shallow landslides, including significant peat failures, which occurred within 2.5 kin 2 on Dooncarton Mountain (Republic of Ireland) in the evening of 19 September 2003 during an exceptional rainfall event. It examines two hypotheses: (i) that the combination of topography and local soil catena characteristics were the primary site factors that led to the occurrence of most of the failures, and (ii) that anthropogenic disturbance to the slopes in the form of boundary ditches or peat-cutting activities may have contributed to three of the largest peat failures. All of the landslides were mapped and sampled within 4 months of the event. Physical, hydrological and geotechnical properties of the slope materials were determined from samples obtained from nine representative failures. Possible controls on the stability of the slopes were investigated by modelling seven of the landslides and a series of hypothetical slopes using standard limit equilibrium methods. The humified blanket peat was underlain by a dominantly sandy mineral material, including a buried soil horizon, derived from weathering of the mainly schist bedrock. Direct shear tests established the respective shear strengths to be phi'= 50 degrees, c'= 0 (buried soil) and phi'=21-25 degrees, c'= 8-11 kPa (basal peat), although back-analyses suggested that the average peat cohesion was lower than this on the failed slopes. Analyses of separate slope segments of the landslides showed that the main slope convexity, where the peat cover gives way to thin peaty soil, defined the zone of minimum stability. Failure of the slope segment immediately above the convexity was controlled by the depth of peat and the hydrostatic or possibly artesian water pressures within the slopes. Thus catena characteristics coupled with local topography (gradient and peat depth) were important determinants of slope instability. Two of the failed slopes were crossed by boundary ditches but, contrary to accounts from elsewhere, stability analyses suggested that these ditches did not contribute significantly to the landslides. Stability analysis of a slope affected by peat extraction also suggested no direct causal association, but the hydrological conditions developed in the vertical tine cuts did probably contribute to a large peat slide. At other locations, therefore, similar anthropogenic factors should be incorporated in landslide hazard assessments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A major after-use option for former peat harvesting areas has been afforestation. The profitability of afforestation with Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) was studied in two 31-32-year old experiments in southern and northern Finland. The stands were established by seeding and planting, and various fertilization treatments and drainage intensities were tested. The financial performance for each plot was assessed in three steps. First, the costs occurred during the measurement time were summed up according to their present value. Then, for the rest of the rotation (i.e., from the age of 31/32 onwards) the stand management was optimized in order to maximize the net present value (MaxNPV). Finally, bare land values (BLVs) were calculated by summing up the present value of costs and the MaxNPV and converting the sum of the series into infinity. The afforestation method did not affect the mean annual increment (MAI; 9.2-9.5 m(3) ha(-1)a(-1)) in the southern experiment. In the northern experiment the afforestation method. ditch spacing and fertilization had significant effects on the MAI of the stands. The average MAI of the planted pines was 8.9 m(3) ha(-1)a(-1)., and for seeded pines it was 7.5 m(3) ha(-1)a(-1). The BLV at an interest rate of 3% was positive for all stands in both regions. In the northern region afforestation method, ditch spacing and fertilization also had a significant effect on the BLV. When the interest rate was 5%, almost two thirds of the stands had a negative BLV in both regions.

AB The socio-economic and ecological value of wetland ecosystems is widely acknowledged. As a result, considerable efforts are now being made to rehabilitate and in some cases recreate wetlands throughout Europe. An option for the restoration of worked-out peat pits is to establish reed beds. Ham Wall, located in Somerset in the UK, comprises reed bed and a mosaic of other wetland habitats that has been constructed as a wildlife area. Since 1996, water chemistry has been monitored for a 16.5 ha wetland compartment planted with reeds in July 1995. Water is pumped into the reed bed from Ham Wall Rhyne, a drainage ditch supplied with nutrient-rich runoff from the surrounding agricultural land. The principal objectives of the research described in this paper were to investigate differences in the chemistry of water from different locations in the vicinity of the wetland and to evaluate seasonal changes and trends in water quality as the reeds matured. The results obtained provide insight into the biogeochemical functioning of the wetland system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling the subsidence of peat soils in the Dutch coastal area
SO GEODERMA

DT Article
DE Elevation; Oxidation; Decomposition; Organic soils; Water management
ID NETHERLANDS
AB In large parts of the western coastal region of the Netherlands peat soils occur. Historic land use resulted in decomposition of organic matter and compaction of these soils and as a consequence the land surface subsided. Along with sea level rise and tectonic subsidence since the end of the Weichselian ice-age, this resulted in a country where one-third of the land lies below mean sea level. Global warming will accelerate the sea level rise and land subsidence due to peat oxidation, leading to elevated risks of flooding and increasing upward seepage of brackish and nutrient rich ground water. In the Polder Groot-Mijdrecht near Amsterdam the land surface is currently between 5 and 6.5 m below sea level. For this polder we calibrated a model for the land surface subsidence. The subsidence rate is modeled using a differential equation accounting for the peat oxidation and other processes causing land surface subsidence. The model input consists of information on (i) the thickness of peat layers derived from soil surveys in 1964 and 1967; (ii) the regulated surface water levels in a network of drainage ditches, and (iii) the initial elevation measured between 1954 and 1968 at 1423 locations. The model was calibrated on the elevation measurements in 2005 and on the peat thickness from a recent soil survey in 2005. The subsidence between 1954 and 2005 as predicted with the model was validated with a subsample of 100 points out of the 1423 locations. The average rate of predicted subsidence between 1954 and 2005 was approximately 5 mm year(-1). In soils containing peat layers the predicted subsidence rate due to peat oxidation was up to 8 mm year(-1). On the contrary, at locations without peat the predicted subsidence rate was only 0.7 mm year(-1). The model accounted for 78% of the variance of the historic subsidence, and the root mean squared error of the predicted elevation in 2005 was 94 mm. Model forecasts of the cumulative subsidence between 2005 and 2020 for the eastern half of the study area where still thick peat layers occur, were over 80 cm. In areas where peat layer in the soil profile are absent the forecasted cumulative subsidence was 10 mm. The case study shows that the simple process model, when calibrated on local data, can help in evaluating flooding risks and in taking long-term strategic decisions on water management and land use in peat areas.

AB This paper presents the deformation and pore-water pressure response within peat foundations below three different railway embankments in response to cyclic heavy axle loading. The study sites include two at Canadian National (CN) Railway's Edson and Lac-La-Biche subdivisions in northern Alberta, and one at CN's Levis subdivision in southeastern Quebec. The three sites were instrumented to monitor the spatial distribution of strain, pore pressure generation, and stress, and the distribution of horizontal cyclic displacement with depth during the passage of trains. The horizontal cyclic displacement with depth was measured using a ShapeAccelArray (SAA). An analysis was conducted to determine how close the peat is to yielding under heavy axle loads. This analysis was based on the elastic response determined from undrained triaxial testing, a constitutive model developed for peat, and finite element modelling. The field response and the numerical modelling suggest that the embankments at the northern Alberta sites are stable under current loading conditions. The highest potential for yielding at these sites occurs just beneath the embankment and at the interface between the peat and underlying stiffer soil. At the Levis site the analysis suggests that a recently constructed ditch concentrates shear stress at a location where the principal stress orientation corresponds to a reduced strength of peat and may have increased the potential for yielding.

AB This study deals with the exploration of oospores morphometric variability according to various types of water reservoirs of Poland by the self-organizing maps (SOM). The SOM integrates morphometrical features in order to distinguish genera and species and to explore their natural environmental habitats. The data set covered 575 oospores collected in Poland and contained measurements of largest polar axis (LPA), largest equatorial diameter (LED), isopolarity index, number of ridges and width of fossa (WF) of 15 Chara and Nitella species. Biometric analysis of oospores revealed that Chara and Nitella genera could be easily distinguished by the SOM. LPA and LED of C. contraria oospores collected from lakes were higher than in case of those found in peat bogs. LPA, LED and WF of C. globularis that were found in lakes were higher than the ones of charophytes from ponds and ditches. The most taxonomically useful morphometrical features for oospores identification are LPA. LED and WF. The advantages of SOM algorithm in the form of exceptional visualization, dimension reduction and exploration abilities are stressed.

AB Question: Which are the success and failure of restoration measures, particularly sod-cutting and hydrological measures, in small wetlands on mineral soils in The Netherlands.
   Location: Twente. in the eastern part of The Netherlands.
   Methods: Success or failure of restoration measures has been assessed by comparing experimental plots with that in reference plots for (1) species richness, (2) re-establishment of endangered species and (3) species composition, including life forms and Red List species. In total 119 samples were taken in 42 permanent plots in fen meadows, small-sedge marshes, wet heathlands. and soft-water pools. Topsoil samples were analysed for pH. Ca. Mg. Na, K and Cation Exchange Capacity. Gradient analysis was carried out by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis.
   Results: Sod-cutting. in combination with re-wetting measures (infilling of ditches and drains), led to restoration of communities of soft-water pools and small sedge marshes within five years. This rapid recovery is probably related to the presence of persistent seed banks of the component species of these communities. Complete restoration of fen meadows took longer (10-15 yr). Apparently, many species of fen meadows have short-lived seed banks. Sod-cutting of a degraded wet heathland and a soft-water pool was only successful temporarily. probably as a consequence of low water tables.
   Conclusions: To prevent depletion of (persistent) soil seed banks. sod-cutting in nutrient-poor wetlands is not recommended in areas where the groundwater regime and the base status of the soil can not be restored to levels required by plant communities of wet heathlands.

AB Fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) estimated by empirical models based on small-scale chamber measurements were compared to large-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements for CH4 and to a combination of EC measurements and EC-based models for CO2. The experimental area was a flat peat meadow in the Netherlands with heterogeneous source strengths for both greenhouse gases. Two scenarios were used to assess the importance of stratifying the landscape into landscape elements before up-scaling the fluxes measured by chambers to landscape scale: one took the main landscape elements into account (field, ditch edge ditch), the other took only the field into account. Non-linear regression models were used to up-scale the chamber measurements to field emission estimates. EC CO2 respiration consisted of measured night time EC fluxes and modeled day time fluxes using the Arrhenius model. EC CH4 flux estimate was based on daily averages and the remaining data gaps were filled by linear interpolation. The EC and chamber-based estimates agreed well when the three landscape elements were taken into account with 16.5% and 13.0% difference for CO2 respiration and CH4, respectively. However, both methods differed 31.0% and 55.1% for CO2 respiration and CH4 when only field emissions were taken into account when up-scaling chamber measurements to landscape scale. This emphasizes the importance of stratifying the landscape into landscape elements. The conclusion is that small-scale chamber measurements can be used to estimate fluxes of CO2 and CH4 at landscape scale if fluxes are scaled by different landscape elements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Major factors affecting sediment erosion from peat mines were assessed to provide information on the peat delivery mechanism. Surface runoff and erosion from three plots of 100 m(2) were measured in the field using three different rainfall intensities varying from 0.58-4.38 mm/min. The settling of peat was studied in the laboratory using a settling column. The settling of peat increased with the wetness of the pest. Within the range of the characteristics studied, water temperature and sediment concentration did not change the settling velocity. The erosion process exhibits three different time dependent stages. First, the sediment concentration decreases rapidly from the onset of runoff due to a decrease in erosion by rainfall as more water is added to the surface. During constant surface runoff and rainfall, the erosion decreases due to a decrease in rill development. When the precipitation ceases, the decrease is more pronounced. Ditch erosion is highest in ditches where there is floating peat or the bed material consists of mineral soils. Results obtained in this study suggests that efficient sediment control procedure includes runoff detention during the early stage of a runoff event and the continuous pounding of water above the erodible bed deposits.

AB We compared genetic variability and clonal diversity in the closely related sedges Carex lasiocarpa and C. pellita using allozyme markers at 12 loci. Both species produce spreading rhizomes, occur in open habitats, and can form large clones; C lasiocarpa primarily along lakeshores, or in bogs, fens, or marshes, and C pellita more commonly along riverbanks and ditches or in wet meadows. Polymorphism was high in both species, similar to that of other rhizomatous Carex and to other species with comparable growth forms and life histories. Total gene diversity was higher for C lasiocarpa (H(T) = 0.266) than for C pellita (H(T) = 0.248), but the coefficient of differentiation among populations was lower. Rare alleles usually occurred as heterozygotes rather than homozygotes, and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found at few loci, suggesting that both species are predominantly outcrossing. Mean clone size, diversity, and evenness were not significantly different between the two species, although populations varied from monoclonal to those where nearly every sampled shoot belonged to a different clone. No significant differences in genetic variation or clone size of C pellita were found when comparisons were made between groups based on climate (warmer vs. cooler) or successional stage (pioneer vs. established). However, within C lasiocarpa, genetic variability decreased and clone size increased in cooler climates and at established sites.

AB Peatland buffer zones with sedimentation ponds are established with the intention of capturing solids and nutrients liberated in drained forestry catchments. As noted in earlier fertilization experiments, added nitrogen (N) immediately increases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in such buffers, and we expected the same to happen after disturbances in the catchment caused by clear-cutting, soil preparation, and ditch cleaning. We measured N2O fluxes, water table dynamics, and vegetation cover from a wetland one year before and two years after the clear-cut and buffer establishment. The low pre-harvest emissions did not increase, but N2O emissions from the sedimentation pond exceeded those from humic lakes with a high N load. In the soil profile, N2O concentrations were high, indicating a potential to produce N2O in the buffer. In one sub-site the soil N2O concentration was below the atmospheric level, which was in accordance with the high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The change in vegetation along the overland flow paths could be explained by a shift in the species thriving in wet conditions but not in those requiring higher nutrient levels. In spite of the apparent potential of soil to produce N2O, the fluxes to the atmosphere remained low. Transformation of N2O to unobserved N-2 may explain some of the low N emissions, together with the low concentrations entering the buffer.

AB Drainage to increase timber production is a major cause of degradation of boreal peatlands in Europe. As a consequence of the forestry drainage, the area of pristine spruce swamp forests has declined drastically in northern Europe over the past century. In restoration by rewetting, drainage ditches are blocked to restore the pre-disturbance hydrological regime and, ultimately, the biodiversity values and ecosystem functions of pristine spruce swamp forests. In this study, we quantify vegetation recovery and examine mechanisms behind the changes in plant community composition. For this, we surveyed the understorey vegetation of 9 undrained, 9 drained and 18 rewetted spruce swamp forest sites in southern Finland. The vegetation survey was accompanied by water table (WT) position and tree stand measurements. Sphagnum cover decreased after drainage and increased after rewetting. Drainage increased the cover of the unvegetated ground surface, while the cover of moss species other than Sphagnum and feather mosses was highest in the rewetted group. A constrained ordination analysis shows that following rewetting, species composition had developed towards the undrained reference state. Regarding their plant community composition, the rewetted sites were situated in the middle of the undrained-drained axis, differing significantly from both the undrained and the drained sites. Similarity to the undrained reference state depended on current WT and was driven by the Sphagnum mosses. Among the rewetted sites, which varied in their rewetting age from 1 to 14 years, similarity to undrained was not dependent on time since rewetting. The most important predictors for the between-site variation in plant community composition were the division between the undrained and the other (drained or rewetted) sites, WT position and birch volume. Species diversity was lower in the undrained than in the drained and rewetted sites, mainly due to lower species evenness. It appears that the competitive superiority of the Sphagnum mosses in wet conditions results in a lower species diversity in the undrained reference state. The less optimal conditions for Sphagna that result from drainage enable higher diversity by opening space for other species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge regarding the seed dispersal of alien species is crucial to manage invasion risk in fragmented natural habitats. Focusing on wind dispersal, this study assessed the spatial and quantitative extents to which a remnant natural fen receives the seeds of alien species dispersed from adjacent hay meadows in Hokkaido, northern Japan. I established a total of 80 funnel seed traps in the fen at distances of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 m from the meadows. The proportion of alien species in the seed rain at each distance was quantified, and the 99th-percentile dispersal distance from the meadows was estimated for each alien species by constructing dispersal kernels. Despite the presence of a marginal ditch and an elevational difference between the fen and the meadows, five alien species, including four grasses that do not have modified seed structures for wind dispersal, dispersed their seeds into the fen. These alien species accounted for up to 65.9% of the seed rain in terms of quantity. The 99th-percentile dispersal distances of the alien species ranged from 3.8 m to 309.3 m, and these distances were longer than the values predicted on the basis of their functional traits, such as terminal velocity. The results of this study demonstrated that numerous seeds of farmland-derived alien species were transported into the remnant vegetation via wind dispersal, and that simple predictions of dispersal distance based on functional traits could underestimate the potential area that alien species can reach. Continuous management both in farmland (to reduce seed escape) and in remnant vegetation (to prevent the establishment of alien species) is necessary to protect native vegetation from biological invasion in agricultural landscapes.

AB In Europe, agriculture on managed peat wetlands is often a balance between maximising farming production, whether hay harvest or cattle production or both, and a desire to maintain a threatened ecological landscape with its flora and fauna. Because of the large amount of carbon stored in peat soils, the management of peat wetlands to minimise the production of atmospheric greenhouse gases is also now a priority. Eddy correlation and allied radiation and soil physics measurements were made continuously over several years at a wetland meadow peat site that is subject to a water level management scheme, at Tadham Moor in the Somerset Levels and Moors, UK. These measurements provided estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and, through established models, estimates of Gross Photosynthetic Production (GPP), and separate soil and plant respiration. A relationship between depth to the water table and soil respiration was established that showed increasing ecosystem respiration with increasing depth to the water table. Annual results are presented for 2002, which also incorporate harvest and cattle carbon gains and losses. In 2002, the site had a significant loss of soil carbon of 59 gC m(-2) y(-1) compared to the historical long-term carbon uptake of natural peat-lands. However, it is shown that the current implementation of the management scheme is ineffective in maintaining the prescribed water levels in the ditches. A consequence of this is that desired water levels in the field are not achieved. Controlling the management scheme for in-field water levels (rather than channel levels) is shown to decrease markedly the annual soil respiration and hence help to maintain the current soil carbon stocks without affecting the current farming practice.

AB While the location and identification of archaeological features from vegetative responses on "dry-sites" is well understood in a British context, its application to wet sites is less well explored. Following the recovery of Glasson Moss, Cumbria, from a major fire in 1976, and a programme of hydrological restoration, a pattern of circular and linear features was observed during a field survey in the mid-1990s. Assessment of the archaeological significance of these features was undertaken in 1996 and 1997 using aerial photography, fieldwork and historical research. The results suggest that during the Early Mediaeval period, natural pools within the moss were used for hemp retting. It appears that water levels within the pools were controlled by the construction of narrow ditches with possible simple sluice systems. One pool was examined in detail; it was used for retting from c.7th century AD until it dried out during the late 12th to mid-13th centuries. Disruption to the mire hydrology, possibly combined with trampling activity around the pool and ditch, appears to have instigated vegetation succession, which resulted ultimately in the colonization of the edges of both pool and ditch by swathes of Calluna vulgaris (heather). The time scale involved in these changes is unknown, although similar responses were noted as beginning to occur at the site of nearby tithe apportionment boundaries (narrow ditches) dating from 1816. This process of vegetation change is examined. Copyright 2001 Academic Press

AB Isolated wetlands occur in many hydrogeomorphic settings, and while they appear to be physically isolated from other water bodies, they are almost never completely decoupled from surface-water or groundwater systems. In this paper, we examine water-quality data for isolated wetlands in three hydrogeomorphic classes (depressions, slopes, flats). Some isolated wetlands are dominated by atmospheric exchanges and have little ground-water or surface-water connections with adjacent systems. Other isolated wetlands are dominated by ground-water inputs and have intermittent or continuous hydrologic connections to adjacent systems. Water-quality characteristics of isolated wetlands are highly variable and depend primarily on the sources of water, substrate characteristics, and land uses associated with the wetland watershed. We were unable to identify any general pattern of water-quality characteristics within or between isolated wetlands in the three hydrogeomorphic classes. Alteration of hydrologic conditions (e.g., ditching, filling), however, usually results in increased nutrient export to downstream systems. From a water-quality perspective, we conclude that so-called isolated wetlands are rarely isolated, and isolation is a term that is not very useful from an ecosystem perspective. Isolated wetlands are nutrient sinks and, because most are hydrologically connected to other waters and wetlands, the loss of isolated wetlands would potentially have negative impacts on the water quality of downstream systems.

AB Patterns of adult and larval Odonata distribution in relation to ditch management cycles were studied at Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve. The ditches are strikingly different in terms of their utilisation by Odonata. Newly excavated sites,vith little shading from bankside vegetation are favoured by territorial males and ovipositing females, densely reeded sites are rarely used by adults. However, ditches with abundant submerged and floating macrophytic growth support more larvae than newly excavated or deeply shaded sites with poor plant development. Rotational clearance of ditches allows good displays of adult Odonata and breeding success to be achieved simultaneously on a reserve. Management implications for the conservation of Odonata are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SETTLEMENT
AB The large Middle Anglo-Saxon site at West Fen Road, Ely, represents one of the most extensively investigated English archaeological sites of the long eighth century. Recent investigations have significantly expanded its known extent, providing important insights into the origins, development and the nature of the site and modifying previous interpretations. The evidence demonstrates the existence of three separate extensive areas of ditched enclosures used primarily for stock management dating to c. 720/50-825/50, although craft activities and occupation also took place. These enclosures were connected by a network of routeways and droveways and have extensive open areas between them, linked to arable agriculture. The scale of activity and evidence for grid planning indicate that this agriculture landscape was controlled by the contemporary monastic community at Ely.

AB In an unusual combined nested and paired catchment experiment in northern England, the 1.5-km(2) Coalbum catchment (90% mature plantation forest with a dense drainage ditch network) is paired with the 1.4-km(2) Flothers catchment (64% peat grassland), both being nested within the 6.9-km(2) Throssburn mixed forest and peat grassland catchment. In only the second such UK quantification, a 100% forest cover reduces annual runoff relative to a 100% grassland cover by 24%. The study provides rare field (as opposed to model) evidence showing that the impact of land use on flood peaks is moderated by catchment saturation and by extreme rainfall. Flood frequency curves differ according to land use at the smaller return periods but the data are not sufficient to confirm that the pattern extends to the highest floods. Against conventional expectation, flood peaks tend to be larger and flashier in the forest catchment, apparently the consequence of the forest ditching. Springtime monthly runoff/rainfall ratios in the peat grassland catchment may reach 100%, representing a seasonal sponge effect which is eliminated from the forest catchment through the effects of the ditches. Combination of the paired and nested catchments provides a highly unusual opportunity to show that, at the annual scale, the integrated catchment response can be obtained by combining the responses of the separate land covers according to the proportions of the catchment that they occupy, an assumption widely made but rarely, if ever, tested.

AB The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) strongly emphasizes that all water polluting sectors must enhance the protection of water bodies in a cost-effective way. River Basin Management Plans need to be made to achieve a good environmental status for all water bodies by 2027 at the latest. This article examines three principal water protection measures used in forestry: buffer zones, overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds. We analytically develop marginal abatement cost functions for each of these measures and apply them numerically for the Finnish forestry. We find that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using buffer zones in clear-cut mineral soil forests are very high, as they entail leaving financially mature and uncut trees. In contrast, the marginal costs of using overland flow fields in conjunction with ditch cleaning and clear-cutting in peatlands are very low. Furthermore, for sediments using overland flow fields as a water protection measure entails significantly lower abatement costs than does using sedimentation ponds in conjunction with ditch cleaning in peatland forests. A cost-effective solution in a river basin entails that the highest nutrient reductions are made in agriculture but that forestry also does its share. A cost-effective allocation of abatement measures entails that the proportions of the overall nutrient reduction are 3% (1%) in forestry and 97% (99%) in agriculture when the reduction target is set as 10% (30%).

DE swampy forests; peat thickness; pool of organic matter; surface drainage
ID ECOSYSTEMS
AB The results of stationary studies of swampy southern taiga forests in Yaroslavl oblast are presented. Estimates of changes in the thickness of peat horizon in peat podzolic gley soils (Folic Albeluvisols) of forests subjected to clearcutting and further intensive forest management in the past 30 years are given. The mean annual precipitation in these three decades has been 116 mm higher than that during the preceding three decades, which has led to a progressive swamping of spruce stands on heavy loamy soils within virtually flat (with slopes up to 0.0035) surfaces and an increase in the organic matter storage in the peat soil horizon with the mean annual rate of 22-68 g/m(2). On more pronounced slopes (0.0050), no swamping of spruce and pine stands growing on sandy soils has taken place. Surface drainage of swampy forests through the network of shallow ditches has led to an increase in the productivity of forests; in most cases, the pool of organic matter in the peat horizon has been decreasing with the mean annual rate of 32-46 g/m(2). This attests to the reversible character of swamping in dependence on climatic fluctuations and forestry measures. Changes in the carbon pool of swampy soils during short (several years) excessively wet or excessively dry periods may be significantly higher than the average values for 30 years in different types of forests. This allows us to consider swampy forests as the source of significant errors in the estimates of the current contribution of biota to the carbon cycle, because their role (as well as the role of other forests) is assessed without taking into account considerable short-term fluctuations in the carbon pool of their soils.

AB Bog rush (Juncus effusus L.) plants growing along a CO2 concentration gradient in a natural CO2 spring within a roadside ditch were examined. The concentration gradient of CO2 within the ditch, measured at soil surface, varied from few percents to few tenths of percent, at the vent and at 23 m distance, respectively. Biometrical examination of Juncus plants revealed that besides total shoot height also stem width changed with the distance from the main vent, with the shoots being taller and broader with increasing distance. The degree of stem slenderness (Schlankheitsgrad; ratio between stem width and stem length) was much higher at the vent (11.5) than at a distance of 23 m (3.5). The stem cross section area, the epidermal thickness, and the number and area of sclerenchymal bundles increased with increasing CO2. The sclerenchymal index, defined as the ratio between the area of the sclerenchymal and chlorenchymal tissue, ranged from round 0.04 near the vent to 0.15 at maximum distance. Mechanical properties of the shoots, i.e tensile strength (resistance to tearing forces) also varied with the distance from the vent, being lower at the sites closer to the CO2 spring. No significant difference was found in the lignin content of differently exposed plants.

TI Sediment transport from a peatland forest after ditch network
   maintenance: a modelling approach
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this study was to describe erosion, sedimentation and transportation processes of erodible material in peatland forests after ditch network maintenance. A sediment transportation model was developed to simulate bed elevation changes in ditches and concentration of suspended solids in water. The model was suitable for simulating short-term effects (the first two years) of ditch network maintenance. The modelled spatial differences in sediment concentration were related to variation in the ditch bottom slope. The temporal variability in concentration was influenced by the water discharge rate. Other factors controlling the erosion and sedimentation in the model were the particle size of the material in bed and in suspension, the roughness height of the bed, and the Manning coefficient. Further development of the model calls for testing against comprehensive field measurements of sediment load and changes in channel dimensions.

AB Landscape representations based on land cover databases differ significantly from the real landscape. Using a land cover database with high uncertainty as input for emission inventory analyses can cause propagation of systematic and random errors. The objective of this study was to analyze how different land cover representations introduce systematic errors into the results of regional N2O emission inventories. Surface areas of grassland, ditches, and ditch banks were estimated for two polders in the Dutch fen meadow landscape using five land cover representations: four commonly used databases and a detailed field map, which most closely resembles the real landscape. These estimated surface areas were scaled up to the Dutch western fen meadow landscape. Based on the estimated surface areas agricultural NO emissions were estimated using different inventory techniques. All four common databases overestimated the grassland area when compared to the field map. This caused a considerable overestimation of agricultural N2O emissions, ranging from 9% for more detailed databases to 11% for the coarsest database. The effect of poor land cover representation was larger for an inventory method based on a process model than for inventory methods based on simple emission factors. Although the effect of errors in land cover representations may be small compared to the effect of uncertainties in emission factors, these effects are systematic (i.e., cause bias) and do not cancel out by spatial upscaling. Moreover, bias in land cover representations can be quantified or reduced by careful selection of the land cover database.

ID DRAINAGE
AB The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS) is a 45,000-ha state and federally protected Coastal Plain peatland located on the border of North Carolina and Virginia that contains stands of Bald cypress and the globally threatened Atlantic white cedar. Centuries of drainage and logging have substantially altered the hydrology of the GDS, negatively affecting its ecosystem structure and function. To restore a seasonally flooded, saturated hydrologic regime to portions of the swamp, adjustable water control structures (WCS) were installed at strategic locations within existing drainage ditches. The objective of this study was to determine if the installation of the WCSs significantly altered the hydropatterns of two target restoration areas, resulting in hydrologic conditions comparable to nearby reference sites with desired forest communities. The water table (WT) was monitored for three years prior to WCS installation (pre-WCS) and three years after WCS installation (post-WCS). Comparison of WT data from the pre and post-WCS periods, using jurisdictional wetland criteria and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), indicated increased saturated conditions within the target restoration areas following installation of the WCS. Paired Before-After Control-Impact (BACIP) statistical analysis revealed the WCS installation had a significant positive impact on WT levels in the target restoration areas relative to the reference sites. Hydrologic restoration will aid the effort to restore target forest communities within the swamp, reduce fire susceptibility, prevent peat oxidation, maintain carbon storage, and reduce non-target vegetation competition.

AB . 1. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were used to assess the conservation value of created and undrained fenland on Wicken Fen, UK. We investigated whether the number of years since agricultural use affected the numbers of Nationally Scarce and wetland ground beetles on created fens. We also compared the created wetland with ancient undrained fenland. 2. Common wetland ground beetles increased with time since agricultural use. However, Nationally Scarce ground beetles did not increase over time. All areas of created wetland had fewer Nationally Scarce and common wetland ground beetles than undrained fenland except for the area not used for agriculture for 60 years. This area had fewer Nationally Scarce ground beetles than undrained fenland but not significantly fewer common wetland ground beetles. 3. The proportion of wetland ground beetles with high dispersal abilities did not vary in relation to time since agricultural use or distance from the nearest drainage ditch, indicating that dispersal did not limit colonisation. Therefore, proximity between the created wetland and established fenlands was not essential for wetland species to colonise the new habitat. 4. The ground beetle assemblage was influenced by soil moisture, cover of grasses and vegetation density. Of these variables, high soil moisture and low vegetation density increased the abundance of Nationally Scarce and common wetland ground beetles. High vegetation density was more detrimental to Nationally Scarce ground beetles than to common wetland beetles. Decreasing the vegetation density by increasing the grazing intensity on created wetland may increase the abundance of Nationally Scarce ground beetles.

AB Excess water in the rooting zone critically reduces tree growth and may even kill trees; however, the relative importance of damage to roots versus aboveground parts and the time course of damage are not well understood. We studied the dynamics of fine-root growth and mortality of 7-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) saplings affected by a 5-week period of waterlogging (WL) during the growing season. Two out of six WL-exposed saplings survived the treatment. After 1-2 weeks of WL, the mortality of the first-order short roots (usually mycorrhizas) started to increase and the production of these roots started to decrease. WL decreased the longevity of short and long roots. Total root length (especially of fine roots with a diameter < 0.5 mm), specific fine-root length, total root dry mass (including stump), and reverse-flow root hydraulic conductance were lower in WL saplings than in control saplings at the end of the experiment; however, several root traits were similar in control and surviving WL saplings. Because of the high importance of fine roots for tree growth and carbon sequestration, their responses to elevated water tables should be considered in sustainable use and management of boreal peatland forests, for example, by continuous cover forestry and (or) ditch network maintenance.

AB 1. We have limited knowledge of the effects of land use in general and of drainage ditching in particular on macrophyte communities in lakes. I quantified catchment land use, including drainage ditching, as well as water quality and the number of macrophyte species in 17 Swedish lakes in summer 2005.
   2. Land use within 1 km of the studied lakes was analysed in a geographic information system. The following variables were included: areas of forests, mires, agricultural land and urbanization, length of drainage ditches (classified according to the use of the land they drained), and shortest distance from lake to an urban area. To extract and analyse general trends in the data sets, redundancy analysis was used.
   3. Water quality was explained mainly by three land-use related variables: the lengths of agricultural, forest and mire ditches. The length of agricultural ditches was positively correlated with lake water conductivity, total dissolved solids, Ca, N and total organic carbon (TOC). The lengths of forest and mire ditches were positively correlated with lake water characteristics, especially TOC.
   4. The number of species representing different macrophyte life forms was explained by three environmental variables: conductivity, and lengths of forest and agricultural ditches. The numbers of isoetids, nymphaeids, elodeids and total obligate hydrophytes were negatively correlated with length of forest ditches. In contrast, the number of lemnids and helophytes was positively correlated with conductivity and length of agricultural ditches. Furthermore, the number of isoetids was exponentially related (negatively) to lengths of agricultural and forest ditches, indicating a threshold response to drainage ditch length.
   5. The results suggest that effects on water quality and macrophyte communities result from drainage ditching in the lake catchments rather than from land use itself. Given the total area of drainage-ditched land worldwide (millions of ha in Scandinavia alone), drainage ditching should be considered when evaluating environmental impacts on lake water quality and macrophyte occurrence and when determining reference conditions for catchment land use.

DT Article
AB Genets, ramets, flowers, and fruits of Cypripedium candidum Muhl. ex Willd, (small white ladyslipper) were recorded each year from 1986 through 1990 in a rich fen in western New York. Wide fluctuations in annual flowering and fruiting success were observed. Environmental and vegetational data were collected to determine their relationship to genet performance. Measurements of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on selected genets indicate that the average amount of PAR influences genet size and flowering success; i.e., there was significantly more light associated with larger genets and those with flowers. There was no correlation between flowering success and various monthly precipitation variables. An age-class distribution of woody species at the site indicates that invasion and growth of these species began soon after cessation of grazing, and after ditching, which lowered the water table. Experimental plots were established to determine the effect of removing woody vegetation on genet performance. The absence of a treatment effect may have been masked by normal year-to-year fluctuations in genet performance.

AB The Karapinar-Ayranci deposit is the most significant one among the recently explored coal deposits in Turkey. The aim of the present study was to determine maceral, mineralogical, and elemental compositions of coal samples picked up from one borehole (DK-7) drilled at the northern part of the deposit. The coal samples display moderate to high ash yield (average 38.7%, on dry basis), high volatile matter yield (average 33.9%, on dry basis), high total sulfur (average 6.7%, on dry basis) and low hydrogen contents (average 4.8%, dry basis). Huminite is dominant, and liptinite and inertinite appear at low concentrations. The bulk coal samples contain mainly quartz, clay minerals (mainly illite and chlorite), muscovite, feldspars, carbonates (calcite and aragonite), and rarely pyrite and gypsum/bassanite. The maceral and mineralogical compositions point to mesotrophic and rheotrophic conditions during peat accumulation; nevertheless, the inorganic intercalations show that peat formation was ceased several times. The petrographical and mineralogical compositions of coal seams in northern and eastern parts of the deposit could imply vegetation and water chemistry differences. The abundance of fossil shell-bearing layers in the studied samples could imply a slightly higher water table than this in the eastern part. In addition, higher telohuminite content might be related to a higher contribution of tree/bush peat-forming vegetation in the northern part; however, the lack of xylite-rich lithotype and the abundance of fluorinite-type resinite imply the predominance of shrubs on the palaeomire's surface. Overall, the precursor peat in the northern part of the deposit was accumulated under pure telmatic to limnotelmatic conditions, vegetation heterogeneity and ditches transporting inorganic material from the margins were developed on the surface of the Karapmar-Ayranci palcomire.

ID FERTILIZATION
AB A plantation of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.), which was established in 1973 on a ditched minerotrophic fen at planting spacings of 1.2 m, 1.8 m, and 2.4 m, was refertilized in 1985 with control, P, PK and NPK treatments consisting of 60 kg ha-1 phosphorus, 100 kg ha-1 potassium and 200 kg ha-1 nitrogen. Although each seedling had been,spot-fertilized in 1973 with a mixture of 71 g urea, 99 g ground rock phosphate and 41 g potassium sulphate, height and needle nutrient assessments of the plantation in 1984 indicated poor growth, low concentrations of needle nitrogen (1.26 per cent) and possible deficiency levels of needle phosphorus (0.10 per cent) and potassium (0.36 per cent). Between 1985 and 199 1, height and diameter growth increased significantly in all refertilization treatments. Growth response was greatest in the PK treatment and least in the P treatment. Needle weights, determined from 1987 to 1991, did not respond uniformly to any of the refertilization treatments. Needle concentrations of phosphorus increased to levels between 0.20 per cent and 0.23 per cent following refertilization with P, PK, and NPK, but by 1988 had decreased to about 0.14 per cent. Needle concentrations of potassium also increased sharply to 0.60 per cent in 1985 following refertilization with PK and NPK, but by 1988 had decreased to levels between 0.35 per cent and 0.45 per cent. Similarly, needle nitrogen concentrations increased to 1.84 per cent in 1985 following refertilization with NPK, then decreased to levels between 1.20 per cent and 1.33 per cent in 1986 and remained at those levels each year thereafter. Although needle nutrient levels fell sharply following an initial peak after refertilization, height and diameter growth did not decrease significantly, especially in the PK treatment, suggesting that nutrient levels remained adequate for optimum growth.

AB The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the restoration of wetlands impacted by a series of drainage ditches and pools located in an extensive undeveloped peatland in the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, Michigan. This study examined the nature and extent of degradation to the Marsh Creek wetlands caused by alteration of natural hydrology by a water-storage pool (C-3 Pool) that intersects the Marsh Creek channel. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in moderate-intensity disturbance associated with natural water-level fluctuations below the C-3 dike contributed to lower species richness, reduced floristic quality and a larger tree and shrub component than vegetation upstream from the pool. Wetland plant communities were sampled quantitatively and analyzed for species richness, floristic quality and physiognomy. Aerial photographs, GIS databases and GPS data contributed to the characterization and analysis of the Marsh Creek wetlands. Results showed that there was lower species richness in vegetated areas downstream from the pool, but not the anticipated growth in shrubs. Wetland vegetation upstream and downstream from the pool had similar floristic quality, except for a greater number of weedy taxa above the pool. Seepage through the pool dike and localized ground-water discharge created conditions very similar to those observed around beaver dams in Marsh Creek. In essence, the dike containing the C-3 Pool affected hydrology and wetland plant communities in a manner similar to an enormous beaver dam, except that it did not allow seasonal flooding episodes to occur. Management actions to release water from the pool into the original Marsh Creek channel at certain times and in certain amounts that mimic the natural flow regime would be expected to promote greater plant species richness and minimize the negative impacts of the dike.

AB Anisotropy of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s, m s(-1)) is a major input datum required for the modeling of saturated and unsaturated water flow in soils, significantly improving the reliability of the models. But, there are several known literature reports presenting positively verified examples of modeling of infiltration in horizontally layered small-scale soil profiles without taking anisotropy into consideration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of implementing the anisotropy ratio to the two-dimensional mathematical model of unsaturated flow in a selected small-scale multilayered soil profile on the possible improvement of calculations results. Two methods of soil sampling for anisotropy measurement were considered-small cylinder and cubic sampling. Our numerical model reflected the profile of a single bench terrace equipped additionally with draining sand ditch, located in Olszanka, Poland. The simple regression analysis indicated that implementing the ratio of anisotropy of saturated hydraulic conductivity to the mathematical model of variably saturated water flow in the studied horizontally layered soil profiles did not result in more precise effects of time-variable soil moisture calculations (R-2 = 0.773-0.883, P = 0.05). Moreover, results of the statistical calculations for volumetric water content and vertical flow velocity, assuming isotropic and anisotropic medium with anisotropy coefficient obtained on the basis of cylindrical and cubic samples, appeared to be comparable; the notable differences were observed only in the case of calculated horizontal flow velocity.

   EROSION; FLOW; MANAGEMENT; CHEMISTRY; TRANSPORT
AB Drainage of forested wetlands for increased timber production has profoundly altered the hydrology and water quality of their downstream waterways. Some ditches need network maintenance (DNM), but potential positive effects on tree productivity must be balanced against environmental impacts. Currently, no clear guidelines exist for DNM that strike this balance. Our study helps begin to prioritise DNM by: (1) quantifying ditches by soil type in the 68 km(2) Krycklan Catchment Study in northern Sweden and (2) using upslope catchment area algorithms on new high-resolution digital elevation models to determine their likelihood to drain water. Ditches nearly doubled the size of the stream network (178-327 km) and 17% of ditches occurred on well-draining sedimentary soils, presumably making DNM unwarranted. Modelling results suggest that 25-50% of ditches may never support flow. With new laser scanning technology, simple mapping and modelling methods can locate ditches and model their function, facilitating efforts to balance DNM with environmental impacts.

AB Freshwater bryozoans were investigated during held studies of 601 lakes and other surface water bodies throughout Norway from 1960 to 1978. The frequency of occurrence of the two Fredericella species was evaluated in relation to 12 environmental variables. Statistically significant deviations from the frequencies expected on the basis of random distribution were described using the categories preference, avoidance and absence. The typical European Fredericella sultana (with glossy statoblasts) occurred at 72 localities, north to 70degrees 25' N (the northernmost record on a global scale). Its frequency dropped towards the north. Maximum elevation above sea level was 1097 m (maximum recorded for Northern Europe). Another species with pitted statoblasts, tentatively considered to be Fredericella indica, occurred at 50 localities, north to 71degrees 09' N (the northernmost record reported to date). The geographical distribution reflected a typical northern cold-water species. One third of the 50 records were from lakes situated north of the Arctic Circle, and rich colonies were found on the North Cape plateau, as far north as possible on the European mainland. The few records from southeastern Norway were from high mountain lakes, up to 1397 m above sea level (highest record for Europe). This species was not found in any of the numerous lowland lakes investigated in southeastern Norway where E sultana was common. Both species tolerated a cold climate, especially Fredericella indica, and they occurred in a wide range of environments. F sultana preferred lakes with rather low elevation above sea level, rich vegetation with plant species typical for eutrophic environments, gyttja sediments and stony "hard" shores, some wave action. high content of calcium, and slightly coloured water. This species avoided ponds and was absent from ditches and mires, avoided dystrophic lakes surrounded by Sphagnum bog, with dy sediments and strongly coloured water, avoided sites with small wave action. was indifferent to magnesium and low concentrations of calcium, and was absent from lakes with pH below 5.4. F indica was only recorded from lakes. It preferred rather low temperatures, oligotrophic conditions with poor aquatic vegetation and stony shores, some wave action, pH above 7.0. and low water colour (below 11 mg Pt l(-1)). This species avoided lakes with high temperatures and was absent above 20 degreesC, was absent where aquatic vegetation was rich or consisted of Sphagnum bog, avoided lakes with soft sediments of dygyttja and dy, places with small wave action, acid takes. was absent at pH below 5.9, tended to avoid water with colour above 10 mg Pt l(-1) and was absent in lakes with colour above 40 mg Pt l(-1). F sultana and E indica occurred together in only six lakes, four in the north, and two in the southern mountain areas. The opposite sensitivity and reactions of the two species towards several environmental variables were supported by a logistic regression analysis. The main ecological difference between the two species is that F indica appears to be more strongly dependent on climatic factors.

AB Farmers can play an important role in enhancing the diversity of plant species in ditches, since they carry out most of the management. Little is known about the measures farmers can take to enhance aquatic biodiversity in ditches. Therefore, a field study was set up to determine how dredging, ditch cleaning, and nutrient supply in the adjacent fields affect the floristic values of the ditch vegetation in peat areas. A total of 240 ditches on 84 dairy farms were selected, to establish the effect of ditch cleaning, dredging, and nutrient supply. Generalised linear modelling was used to determine the most relevant factors, and to obtain quantitative relations between those factors and two indices of floristic value. Ditch management, field management, and water management were found to affect the floristic values of the ditch vegetation. Increasing the water depth proved to be the most cost-effective measure. Further improvements can be obtained by choosing certain machines or specific management periods, or reducing the N supply. The effect of the P supply is not yet sufficiently clear. The water boards can enhance floristic values by raising the ditch water table and by lowering the Cl- concentration in the ditches.

AB Organic waste, the predominant component of global solid waste, has never been higher, resulting in increased landfilling, incineration, and open dumping that releases greenhouse gases and toxins that contribute to global warming and environmental pollution. The need to create and adopt sustainable closed-loop systems for waste reduction and valorization is critical. Using organic waste as a feedstock, gasification and pyrolysis systems can produce biooil, syngas, and thermal energy, while reducing waste mass by as much as 85 & ndash;95% through conversion into biochar, a valuable byproduct with myriad uses from soil conditioning to bioremediation and carbon sequestration. Here, we present a novel case study detailing the circular economy of gasification biochar in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. Biochar produced from horticultural waste within the Gardens was tested as a partial peat moss substitute in growing lettuce, pak choi, and pansy, and found to be a viable substitute for peat moss. At low percentages of 20 & ndash;30% gasification biochar, fresh weight yields for lettuce and pak choi were comparable to or exceeded those of plants grown in pure peat moss. The biochar was also analyzed as a potential additive to concrete, with a 2% biochar mortar compound found to be of suitable strength for non-structural functions, such as sidewalks, ditches, and other civil applications. These results demonstrate the global potential of circular economies based on local biochar creation and on-site use through the valorization of horticultural waste via gasification, generating clean, renewable heat or electricity, and producing a carbon-neutral to-negative byproduct in the form of biochar. They also indicate the potential of scaled-up pyrolysis or gasification systems for a circular economy in waste management.

AB Mowing and plant removal is a traditional practice in low-intensity farming and likely to lead to high plant species richness. Even today, scientific knowledge on the impact of mowing on seed availability is still very limited. We studied whether the seed availability of ditch bank plant species was affected by the timing of mowing and, if so, whether the effect varied according to management regime (nature reserve, agri-environment scheme (AES) with long-term management, AES with short-term management, conventional management). Our focus was on seed availability for transportation, because restoration of ditch bank vegetation is known to be limited by seed dispersal. The presence and seed-setting of 25 target species in 384 plots were recorded at the mowing date, under four management regimes. A Hierarchical Generalised Linear Model (HGLM) was used to analyse the effects of mowing date and management on the number of species setting seed. It suggests that when the mowing is twice annually, mowing on July 1st and on September 1st will result in a maximum number of species of which the seeds are available for transportation and, therefore, create largest opportunities for seed dispersal on ditch banks in the western peat area of the Netherlands. The effect of mowing date differs among species, with certain rare species like Caltha palustris and Lythrum salicaria in particular differing from the commoner species. A flexible mowing regime varying from year to year would therefore help to protect these rare species. The later peak in seed-setting found in nature reserves and long-term AES suggest a postponed mowing compared to conventionally management and short-term AES. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

AB The West Nile Virus (WNV) is an infectious disease spreading rapidly throughout the United States, causing illness among thousands of birds, animals, and humans. Yet, we only have a rudimentary understanding of how the mosquito-borne virus operates in complex avian human environmental systems. The four broad categories of risk factors underlying WNV incidences are: environmental (temperature, precipitation, wetlands), socioeconomic (housing age), built-environment (catch basins, ditches), and existing mosquito abatement policies.
   This research first built a model incorporating the non-linear relationship between WNV incidences and hypothesized risk factors and second, identified important factor(s) whose management would result in effective disease prevention and containment. The research was conducted in the Metropolitan area of Minnesota, which had experienced significant WNV outbreaks from 2002.
   Computational neural network (CNN) modeling was used to understand the occurrence of WNV infected dead birds because of their ability to capture complex relationships with higher accuracy than linear models. Further a detailed interpretation technique, based on weights and biases of the network, provided a means for extracting relationships between risk factors and disease occurrence.
   Five risk factors: proximity to bogs, lakes, temperature, housing age, and developed medium density land cover class, were selected by the model. The detailed interpretation indicated that temperature, age of houses, and developed medium density land cover were positively related, and distance to bogs and lakes were negatively related to the incidence of WNV.
   This paper provides both applied and methodological contributions to the field of health geography. The relationships between the risk factors and disease occurrence could contribute to vector control strategies such as targeted insecticide spraying near bogs and lakes, mosquito control treatments for older houses, and extensive mapping, inspection, and treatments of catch basins. The proposed interpretation technique expanded the role of CNN models in health sciences as both predictive and explanatory tools. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Seamus Heaney; the sea; ecocriticism; gender; North Atlantic
AB The presence of the sea in Seamus Heaney's poetry is often overlooked in favour of a rural landscape. While the importance of the bog, ditches and fields should not be ignored, this paper refocuses critical attention towards the coastal sea and open ocean in Heaney's work. Beginning with a discussion of previous ecocritical readings of Heaney's poetry, this paper demonstrates the need for a fuller consideration of the topography of his work. The sea, in fact, appears at key points throughout his oeuvre, offering freedom and poetic clarity. Unconstrained by the preserved, ritual violence of the bog, the sea becomes a space in which to contemplate the complexities of these land-based concerns, while still remaining connected to community. Its constant flux and fluidity comes to offer the poet stability in times of crises. Yet, not all of the figures of Heaney's poetry experience liberation at sea as the women of Heaney's poetry are shown to be excluded from its freeing qualities. The paper plots an alternate route through Heaney's oeuvre, highlighting not only the importance of the sea to the poet but also the value of turning critical attention to this element.

AB The maintenance or development of plant community diversity in species-rich wet grasslands has been a focus of water management considerations in the UK for the past 20 years. Much attention has been given to the control of water levels in the ditch systems within these wet grassland systems. In this paper we report measurements of aeration status and water-table fluctuation made on a peat soil site at Tadham Moor in Somerset, UK, where water management has focused on the maintenance of wet conditions that often result in flooding in winter and wet soil conditions in the spring and summer. Measurement and modelling of the water-table fluctuation indicates the possibility of,variability in the aeration of the root environment and anoxic conditions for much of the winter period and for part of the spring and summer. We have used water content and redox potential measurements to characterize the aeration status of the peat soil. We find that air-filled porosity is related to water-table depth in these situations. Redox potentials in the spring were generally found to be low, implying a reducing condition for nitrate and iron. A significant relationship (p < 0.01) between redox potential and water-table depth exists for data measured at 0.1 m depth, but no relationship could be found for data from 0.4 m depth.

DE Ramsar wetlands type; Wetlands classification; Lithuanian wetlands
AB The different conceptions of wetlands and their classifications as well as their definitions in Lithuania are represented in this paper. According to existing databases, Lithuanian wetlands are represented by: suo wetlands, peatlands, lentic, lotic, and marine/coastal wetlands. The harmonisation of the Ramsar classification system with the traditional classifications of Lithuanian wetlands is emphasised. The distribution of the distinguishable wetland types is identified. The following Ramsar inland and man-made wetland types are found in Lithuania: non-forested and forested peatlands (9.9% area of Lithuania), seasonal pools on mineral soils and tree-dominated wetlands (>13.92% area of Lithuania), permanent freshwater lakes (1.27% area of Lithuania), permanent freshwater marshes/pools (0.08% area of Lithuania), aquaculture ponds (0.18% area of Lithuania), ponds (0.16% area of Lithuania), water storage areas (0.3% area of Lithuania), excavations (0.04% area of Lithuania), permanent rivers/streams/creeks, seasonal streams/creeks (similar to 0.69% area of Lithuania), canals and drainage ditches (0.11% area of Lithuania), and permanent inland deltas (0.01% area of Lithuania). The authors identified the following types of Ramsar marine/coastal wetlands in Lithuania: permanent shallow marine waters (0.09% area of Lithuania), sand, shingle or pebble shores (94 km marine and 77.89 km lagoon shores), coastal freshwater lagoons (0.52% area of Lithuania).

AB It was demonstrated that management regime can influence the species composition of ditch vegetation. This effect, however, is very small compared to the effects of other factors such as the within-site spatial variation and soil and water quality. Cutting late in November had the largest effect.
   The vegetation was composed of 139 plant species. The semi-aquatic and aquatic species were less numerous than the terrestrial ones (52 compared with 87). The total number per vegetation type and site ranged from 2 to 49, that of persistent plant species from 1 to 22. Only 20% of the species were influenced significantly by management regime.
   Significant effects inherent to within the year repeated management regimes on plant species were ascribed to (1) freeing sites for colonization of new species, (2) improving the light climate for seedlings, which had already colonized, and (3) exhaustion of carbohydrate reserves of solitary species. Management once a year had the reverse effect and caused suffocation due to its undecomposed autumn harvest.
   The highest species richness was attained for the semi-aquatic and aquatic vegetation: (1) on sand and clay by cutting three times per year, (2) on peat by cutting once a year (late in November); and for the shore vegetation: (1) on sand and clay once a year (in spring) or two times per year (in spring and summer), and (2) on peat, once a year (in spring or late autumn).

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; GRASSLAND
AB (1) The effects of three aspects of mechanical ditch management (cleaning frequency, cleaning method and dredging) on the ditch bank vegetation in Dutch peat areas were studied.
   (2) The optimum relationship between species-richness and cleaning frequency was examined; species-richness was highest with cleaning once every 2-3 years.
   (3) Thirty-eight species, including many that are endangered in the peat district, did better with cleaning every 2-3 years than with yearly cleaning.  Only five common species had greater cover with yearly cleaning.  There were only small botanical differences between cleaning once every 2-3 years and cleaning less frequently.
   (4) The results suggest that the lower floristic richness with yearly cleaning compared to less frequent cleaning is related to a higher supply of nutrient-rich sludge, smothering of the vegetation and physical damage to the plants.  Acidification of the soil from sludge deposition was not important.
   (5) The somewhat lower species-richness of banks along ditches cleaned less frequently than once every 3 years presumably reflects the effects of succession.
   (6) The cleaning method appeared to have no effect on floristic richness of the banks, probably due to variations in the way the cleaning machinery is used.
   (7) No botanical differences were found between banks examined 1-5 and > 5 years after ditch dredging, presumably because the ditch mud is spread over the fields rather than the banks.
   (8) Cleaning ditches once every 2-3 years is recommended, provided this is compatible with proper water management.  In all management practices, the lowest strip of the bank should be kept free from ditch sludge.

AB The effect of ditching of boreal (Finnish) peat-rich forest land on leaching patterns of phosphorus and nitrogen was assessed using a paired catchment approach (response stream + control stream) for a 4 + 1 year study period. After the ditching operations, the leaching of the organic nitrogen (TON) decreases, while that of the inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) and phosphorus (total reactive P and total non-reactive P) increases. The TON does not decrease as much as TOC does, indicating that the pool of organic material being leached after the ditching is enriched in nitrogen. The increased leaching of ammonium and nitrate after ditching is related most likely to ammonification and nitrification processes in peat biomass after the release of excess surface water. The behaviour of P is complex. The data indicate that the major controls of the determined P fractions are the Fe redox chemistry and the behaviour of Fe hydroxides.

AB Artificial drainage (ditching) is widely used to increase timber yield in northern forests. When the drainage systems are maintained, their environmental impacts are likely to accumulate over time and along accompanying management, notably after logging when new forest develops on decayed peat. Our study provides the first comprehensive documentation of long-term ditching impacts on terrestrial and arboreal biodiversity by comparing natural alder swamps and second-generation drained forests that have evolved from such swamps in Estonia. We explored species composition of four potentially drainage-sensitive taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, and snails), abundance of species of conservation concern, and their relationships with stand structure in two-ha plots representing four management types (ranging from old growth to clearcut). We found that drainage affected plot-scale species richness only weakly but it profoundly changed assemblage composition. Bryophytes and lichens were the taxonomic groups that were most sensitive both to drainage and timber-harvesting; in closed stands they responded to changed microhabitat structure, notably impoverished tree diversity and dead-wood supply. As a result, natural old-growth plots were the most species-rich and hosted several specific species of conservation concern. Because the most influential structural changes are slow, drainage impacts may be long hidden. The results also indicated that even very old drained stands do not provide quality habitats for old-growth species of drier forest types. However, drained forests hosted many threatened species that were less site type specific, including early-successional vascular plants and snails on clearcuts and retention cuts, and bryophytes and lichens of successional and old forests. We conclude that three types of specific science-based management tools are needed to mitigate ditching effects on forest biodiversity: (i) silvicultural techniques to maintain stand structural complexity; (ii) context-dependent spatial analysis and planning of drained landscapes; and (iii) lists of focal species to monitor and guide ditching practices.

AB In 1973, a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) plantation was established in central Newfoundland on a minerotrophic, open peatland that had been ditched at 1.8 m spacings.  The seedlings were planted at spacings of 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 m and spot fertilized with a mixture of 71 g urea, 99 g ground rock phosphate, and 41 g potassium sulfate.  In 1985, 12 years after establishment, concentrations of N (0.90%), P (0.10%), and K (0.28%) suggested that nutrient deficiencies were limiting growth.  Consequently, P, P-K, and N-P-K were applied in the amounts of 60 kg/ha P, 100 kg/ha K, and 200 kg/ha N.  Controls (no refertilization) were also included in the experiment, although these plots had been spot fertilized in 1973.  Between 1985 and 1991, height growth, needle weight, and needle nutrients were not significantly different among planting-spacing treatments.  Height growth was greatest in the P-K treatment, whereas needle weights were greatest in the N-P-K treatment in 1987.  Uptake of N was significantly improved by application of P-K as well as by application of N-P-K.  Concentrations of N, P, and K increased to levels of 2.43, 0.25, and 0.60%, respectively, following application of fertilizers containing those elements.  However, by 1991, concentrations had decreased to 1.10, 0.14 and 0.43%, respectively.  The effects of refertilization on uptake of Ca, Mg, and Cu were mainly nonsignificant.

AB Quantification of activity data and emission factors for carbon (C) in inland wetland mineral soils (IWMS) lack suitable low cost indicators for key soil C processes in temperate forests. In a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest near Soro, Denmark, SOC stocks and the risk of losing pre-drainage legacy SOC were studied using a digital elevation model (0.4 m resolution), redox potential and soil respiration measurements. The results were compared with a digitized legacy soil map used in the national GHG reporting to UNFCCC. In upland, flat and sloping terrain, an aerobic soil environment (Eh > 400 mV) prevailed throughout most of the year, but in a peat-filled topographic depression (TD) anaerobic conditions (Eh < 400 mV) fully or sporadically occurred in the growing season, controlled by the ditching-affected water table. The relief included SOC rich TDs making up 18.9% of the area based on the "Filled sink" algorithm (Saga GIS). In contrast, the peat cover on the legacy soil map was 8.2%. Furthermore, the mapped peat polygons were offset from the TDs defined by the DEM. The SOC stocks at 0-40 cm depth outside TDs (least squares mean 8.4 +/- sem 0.3 kg C m(-2)) were significantly lower than within TDs (11.9 +/- sem 0.5 kg C m(-2)). Average annual soil respiration increased linearly with the SOC stock by 0.06 kg C per kg SOC up to a SOC stock of 11 kg C m(-2) to 20 cm depth, and a SOC loss of 0.23 +/- se 0.10 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) was indicated inside the TD areas, close to the IPCC estimate of 0.26 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for drained organic soils under forest. Our results show that continuous sensor-based monitoring of redox potential and shallow water tables linked with high-resolution DEMs offer the possibility to estimate the spatial extent of inland wetland mineral soils and their status as aerobic or anaerobic as indicated by iron rods with higher accuracy than previously. This underpins the potential use of such data for activity data mapping in Tier 3 greenhouse gas reporting.

AB The Terramare civilization (ca. 1650-1150 cal bce) on the Po plain in northern Italy is considered to have been an agrarian society typical of the European Bronze Age, with a subsistence economy based on arable and livestock farming, and which showed some innovations such as the introduction of millets as cultivars. Some questions are still open concerning the agricultural system, the food and non-food uses of plant resources and the organization of labour at these sites. In this paper, for the first time, phytolith analysis has been integrated with more standard archaeobotanical methods applied to material from the long-lasting settlement of Fondo Paviani, Verona. The aim of the study was to use phytoliths as a tool to investigate the cereal economy in order to detect different grass subfamilies and possibly provide hints about local crop processing activities. For this purpose, two contexts, a shallow ditch at the edge of the site that had been filled with domestic waste and a near-site fen with natural infilling, have been the objects of a multi-proxy inter-disciplinary investigation. This includes the analyses of phytoliths, pollen, NPP, sediment texture and micromorphology. The phytolith record shows remains of panicoid as well as pooid grasses, including chaff material with frequent traces of threshing that indicate the processing of cereals at the site and the possible use of chopped straw as fodder. The comparison of different kinds of evidence strengthens the interpretation and offers a new perspective on the application of phytolith analysis to Bronze Age northern Italy.

AB Effects of different land-use types on nutrient and chemical run-off have been widely researched, but the total effect of changes in land use on communities of aquatic species is poorly known. We evaluated the effect of land-use change on waterfowl communities of boreal lakes. We conducted the study with topographic maps and GIS-techniques in central Finland. We compared changes in the structure of waterfowl communities with changes in land use around 15 lakes over a period of 50 years. Over the period, agricultural land and bogs were reduced in area, while ditched areas increased significantly. The numbers of waterfowl breeding pairs and species increased slightly on the majority of lakes. The largest increases in breeding pairs were for Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Teal Alias crecca. Interestingly, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos decreased in terms of both breeding pairs and the number of occupied lakes, although it has increased nationally. We found evidence of decreasing pair numbers of Mallards on lakes where adjacent dwellings increased in number. Changes in land use correlated with those in waterfowl communities but lake size appears to affect these results. After controlling for the effect of lake size, only the number of adjacent dwellings correlated significantly with changes in the number of breeding pairs of Mallards. According to our results, changes in the area of agricultural, bog or ditched land around lakes could not be clearly linked with changes in waterfowl communities.

AB Hydroponics requires good quality water. For this purpose, water quality is based on concentrations of specific ions and phytotoxic substances as well as the presence of organisms and substances that can clog irrigation systems. Here, four irrigation reservoirs. i.e. two rainwater ponds, a peat ditch. and a natural lake, were analyzed to determine whether or not they conform to water quality guidelines. Based on our data, the four reservoirs could be divided into two categories in respect to their water quality. The two rainwater ponds belong to the category characterized by low input of ionic strength (480 mumol m(-1)), low concentration of unwanted ions. such as SO42- (63 mumol l(-1)) and Zn2+ (3.9 mumol l(-1)), a moderate bacterial population (lg 4.9 CFU m(-1)), and moderate algae density (lg 6.0 cells ml(-1)). The rainwater ponds were found to contain a good diversity in bacteria (45 species from 25 genera), and a poor diversity of algae (15 species from 4 groups). The other category, to which the peat ditch and natural lake belong, is characterized by a high ionic strength (12,200 mumol l(-1)), high concentrations of alkali ions (Mg2+: 890 mumol l(-1); Ca2+: 3.260 mumol l(-1): 1; K+: 470 mumol l(-1)). a moderate bacterial (lg 4.7 CFU ml(-1)), but low algae density (lg 5.0 cells ml(-1)). In comparison to the first category, the diversity of the bacteria was poor (seven species from three genera). However, in sharp contrast was the rich algal community detected in the peat ditch, for which 32 species from six groups were found, whereas in the natural lake, only one group with seven species was identified. In all reservoirs, species of the genera Paenibacillus and Bacillus were detected, and small green algae, e.g. Scenedesmus spp., also dominated in each case. Overall, the bacterial and algal densities showed wide fluctuations between water sources, and neither caused filter clogging as observed in investigations of others. The quality of the rainwater investigated was assessed to be well suited for use in hydroponics due to appropriate nutrient concentration (except Zn2+ in one pond), and lack of potential bacterial and algal development. However, we recommend water from the natural lake and the peat ditch to be used with care because of the high nutrient concentration. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of hydrological manipulation on the mineralisation rates, measured as carbon dioxide and methane production rates, in the soil of the land-water transition zone of an unfertilised, Dutch peat grassland area was studied. The hydrological manipulation involved raising the ditch and groundwater levels by admitting nutrient-poor, Ca-rich groundwater in the trial area. An adjacent, fertilised, field served as a control. On an annual basis the CO2 production rate was usually highest in the parcels, intermediate in the ditch banks and lowest in the ditch bottoms, ranging from 2496 to 598 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the wet field and from 2918 to 421 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) in the control field. The CH4 production rate was negligible in the parcels, low in the ditch banks and substantial in the ditch bottoms, ranging from 0 to 1175 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) in the wet field and from 2 to 241 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) in the control field. The CO2 production rate was significantly affected by pH, C:N ratio and by moisture content. It tended to be highest at pH 5.8, at a C:N ratio of 12, at a moisture content of 50% and at a temperature of 20 degrees C. The CH4 production rate was significantly affected by pH, organic matter content and C:N ratio. It tended to be highest at pH 6.7, at an organic matter content of >40% and at a C:N ratio of 17. A temperature effect was not apparent. It was estimated that the CO2 and CH4 production rates of typical Dutch peat grasslands are 2824.3 and 6.1 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) when used for agriculture, but 2435.5 and 20.8 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) when rewetted with nutrient-poor, Ca-rich artesian water. Thus, rewetting, e.g. for nature conservation purposes, may cause the production of CO2 to decrease by 14% but that of CH4 to increase 3.4-fold. Circumstances in which these gases are emitted were discussed. This study indicates that hydrological manipulation of typical Dutch peat-grassland areas ire which fertilisation has ceased has profound effects on the production of CO2 and CH4 of these systems and may lead to increased emission of methane to the atmosphere.

AB Strategic approaches to biodiversity conservation increasingly emphasise the restoration of ecological connectivity at landscape scales. However, understanding where these connecting elements should be placed in the landscape is critical if they are to provide both value for money and for biodiversity. For such planning to be effective, it is necessary to have information of the distributions of multiple taxa, however, this is of poor quality for many taxa. We show that sparse, non-systematically collected biological records can be modelled using readily available environmental variables to meaningfully predict potential biodiversity richness, including rare and threatened species, across a landscape. Using a large database of ad-hoc biological records (50 501 records of 502 species) we modelled the richness of wetland biodiversity across the Fens, a formerly extensive wetland, now agricultural landscape in eastern England. We used these models to predict those parts of the agricultural ditch network of greatest potential conservation value and compared this to current strategic network planning. Odonata distribution differed to that of other groups, indicating that single taxon groups may not be effective proxies for other priority biodiversity. Our results challenged previous assumptions that river channels should comprise the main connecting elements in the Fens region. Rather, areas of high ditch density close to a main river are likely to be of greater value and should be targeted for enhancement. This approach can be adopted elsewhere in order to improve the evidence-base for strategic networks plans, increasing their value for money. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A spatially explicit dynamic model was developed that combines water quantity and quality processes for an average Dutch peat polder. The model has been used to calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036-2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Compared to other terrestrial environments, coastal "blue carbon" habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests sequester disproportionately large amounts of carbon as standing plant biomass and peat deposits. This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

AB In boreal forested wetlands. the observed increase in the water table level after clearcutting (watering-up) is often a threat to sustained ecosystem productivity. Hydrologic recovery refers to file processes by which a water table progressively drops back to its initial level after the cut. In eastern Canada, drainage is Used operationally after clearcutting wet sites ill Order to lower the water table level and accelerate hydrologic recovery. The objective of this study was to evaluate (the duration Of (the v,watering-up caused by timber harvesting and the extent to which drainage affected the water table recovery on five peatlands and three hydromorphic mineral sites located ill the St. Lawrence Lowlands of Quebec (Canada). The mixed wood stands studied are dominated by balsam fir (Abies balasamea (L.) Mill.). eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.). and red maple (Acer rubrum L). Results indicate that. 10 years after clearcutting, water table levels in undrained plots are still 5 to 7 cm higher than the pre-cut levels. The slight recovery in water table level plateaued after the third year. Rainfall interception by vegetation was also monitored. and after 10 years had reached nearly 50% of the pre-cut rate. The immediate water table drawdown following drainage mitigated watering-up within 40 m of a ditch. The persistent watering-up observed in this study should encourage using sylvicultureal systems adapted to boreal forested wetlands in order 10 prevent productivity loss and stand conversion.

AB Subarctic lakes are getting warmer and more productive due to the joint effects of climate change and intensive land-use practices (e.g. forest clear-cutting and peatland ditching), processes that potentially increase leaching of peat- and soil-stored mercury into lake ecosystems. We sampled biotic communities from primary producers (algae) to top consumers (piscivorous fish), in 19 subarctic lakes situated on a latitudinal (69.0 & ndash;66.5 degrees N), climatic (+3.2 degrees C temperature and +30% precipitation from north to south) and catchment land-use (pristine to intensive forestry areas) gradient. We first tested how the joint effects of climate and productivity influence mercury biomagnification in food webs focusing on the trophic magnification slope (TMS) and mercury baseline (THg baseline) level, both derived from linear regression between total mercury (log10THg) and organism trophic level (TL). We examined a suite of environmental and biotic variables thought to explain THg baseline and TMS with stepwise generalized multiple regression models. Finally, we assessed how climate and lake productivity affect the THg content of top predators in subarctic lakes. We found biomagnification of mercury in all studied lakes, but with variable TMS and THg baseline values. In stepwise multiple regression models, TMS was best explained by negative relationships with food chain length, climate-productivity gradient, catchment properties, and elemental C:N ratio of the top predator (full model R2 = 0.90, p < 0.001). The model examining variation in THg baseline values included the same variables with positive relationships (R2 = 0.69, p = 0.014). Mass standardized THg content of a common top predator (1 kg northern pike, Esox lucius) increased towards warmer and more productive lakes. Results indicate that increasing eutrophication via forestry-related land-use activities increase the THg levels at the base of the food web and in top predators, suggesting that the sources of nutrients and mercury should be considered in future bioaccumulation and biomagnification studies.

AB Wetlands, lakes and agricultural soils are important sources and sinks of the greenhouse gas methane. The only known methane sink of biological nature is the oxidation by methanotrophic microorganisms, these organisms therefore provide an important ecosystem service. To protect this ecosystem service, it is important to maintain methanotrophic microorganism diversity, especially under increased anthropogenically-induced environmental pressures, such as imbalanced input of nutrients to ecosystems. There is therefore an urgent need to understand how N and P affect the structure and activity of methane oxidizing communities. Numerous research studies have already shown variable effects of N-addition on methane oxidation: small additions tend to stimulate methane oxidation, whereas large additions are inhibitory. There is however still a large knowledge gap concerning effects of P on methane oxidation. Here, we present data on the relation between methane oxidation and various measures of P in 50 drainage ditches, and summarize literature reporting relations between P and methane oxidation in wetlands and soils. Additionally, we review experiments on effects of P, N and N + P addition on both low affinity and high affinity methane oxidation. In our set of drainage ditches, as well as studies on wetland and permafrost soils, P content is positively correlated to methane oxidation, though it also co-correlates with many other variables. However, results from P-additions in rice paddies, agricultural soils, landfills, peat bogs, permafrost soils and forests were more variable: sometimes inhibiting (2 studies), other times stimulating methane oxidation (4 studies), and sometimes showing no effect (5 studies). Two studies report increased methanotroph (pmoA) abundance following P-fertilization, but little is known about effects of P on methanotroph community structure and its consequences for methane consumption. By mining methanotrophic genomes for genes involved in N and P-related processes, we demonstrate that variability in N/P related traits (influencing acquisition, uptake and metabolism) does not reflect DNA-based phylogeny. This review points to a need for better mechanistic understanding of the effects of P on methane oxidation, and the role of traits of methanotrophic community members in regulating this process.

AB Surveys of the butterfly populations of a large number of field boundary transects were carried out in 1986 and 1991. The abundance of individual species, total abundance and species richness were related to characteristics of the field boundary and to field boundary flora using regression techniques Butterfly populations were enhanced in those boundaries containing large hedgerows, grassy areas in the form of verges or ditch banks, and where floral species richness was greatest. These features are more usually associated with the edges of pasture fields. A small set of additional data suggested the detrimental effect of agrochemical applications to butterflies. The importance of field boundaries in providing a network for movement between habitat patches is discussed

ID DRAINAGE
AB This paper presents past and recent water management in the area called the Vistula Delta Fens (Zulawy Fens). This area (56 x 56 km) is located at the outlet of the Vistula River to the Baltic Sea, at the shore of the Gulf of Gdansk. A large part of the area (30%) is located below sea level as potentially submerged depressions. A multitude of rivers, channels, ditches and pumping stations have been constructed here over several centuries. The area is characterized by highly productive alluvial soils, surface water with a high potential for fish-farming and fishery, and attractive tourist areas at the banks of the rivers and channels. Historically, floods have occurred repeatedly as a result of: (i) - breaks in the dams along big rivers, e.g. after heavy rains and high water levels (in summer); (ii) - dam breaks caused by accumulation of ice-cakes in winter or during spring times; (iii) - dam breaks after storms on the sea with increasing sea water levels at the river outlets (mainly in winter); (iv) - overflow of water into flat land after heavy rains followed by slow drainage of water from the fields, ditches, channels and pumping stations (in summer); (v) - overflow of water into depressions and swamps below sea level after interruptions of, or decreases in, the pump operations at the pumping stations. The EU directive on flood control advises that the member countries should: (i) produce maps of the areas vulnerable to floods to facilitate communication and planning; (ii) - develop management plans for flooding events; (iii) - exchange experience and codes of good practice during flood; (iv) - facilitate a close cooperation between the scientific community and politicians in the field of flood protection; (v) - raise the level of knowledge, communication and awareness among local societies living in areas prone to flooding.

AB The recent impacts of tropical cyclones and severe storms on the U.S. Atlantic coast brought into focus the need for extended records of storm activity from different geomorphologic settings. Such reconstructions are typically developed from sites that experienced repeated overwash of sand into low-energy, depositional environments. However, salt-marsh sediment may also preserve a record of repeated erosion from tropical cyclones and storms. We describe late Holocene sediments beneath the Sea Breeze salt marsh (Delaware Bay, New Jersey) from more than 200 gouge cores positioned along seven transects. The stratigraphic record documents at least seven depositional sequences consisting of salt-marsh peat and mud couplets that represent dramatic changes in sedimentation regime. There are a number of processes that could produce these stratigraphic sequences against a background of rising relative sea level including: lateral migration of tidal creeks; tidal channel network and/or drainage ditch expansion; changes in sediment delivery rates; rapid relative sea-level change; tsunami; and formation of salt pans. The abrupt contacts between the salt-marsh peat and overlying intertidal mud suggest that erosion of the peat was followed by rapid infilling of accommodation space. Correlation of erosional surfaces across 2.5 km suggests a common mechanism and we propose that the erosion was caused by tropical cyclones and/or storms. We developed a chronology of repeated salt-marsh erosion and recovery using 137Cs, metal pollution (Pb concentration and stable isotopes), and radiocarbon data. Two recent episodes of salt-marsh erosion may correlate with historic tropical cyclones in AD 1903, and AD 1821/1788 that impacted the Atlantic coast of New Jersey, but the erosive nature of the Sea Breeze site hinders definitive correlation. Prehistoric erosional sequences correlate with overwash fans preserved in the regional sedimentary record. We estimated that it takes.from several decades to almost 200 years for salt-marshes to recover from storm erosion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated plant communities in ditches bordering arable fields in the Fens of eastern England, and their response to bank mowing and dredging. The effects of mowing on species turnover were investigated by experiment. The first experiment compared the effects of four mowing frequencies (2x, 1x per year, 1 cut in alternate years, no cut). The number of emergent aquatic and riparian species decreased over 4 years but the magnitude of the decrease was negatively correlated with mowing frequency; it was greatest in the unmown plots. A second experiment compared two treatments (2x per year, I cut in alternate years) on a larger sample of ditches. Turnover of emergent aquatic and riparian species did not differ between the treatments but more floating and submerged species colonised ditches mown twice a year.
   The number of floating and submerged species per ditch tended to increase following dredging. The increase was greatest in ditches between 200 and 600 m from the main drain. Assemblages of floating and submerged plants in ditches < 200 m from the main drain were species-rich and their composition was relatively stable between years. Ditches > 800 m from the main drain were species-poor and were not colonised after dredging.
   A dredging cycle of at least 3 years is necessary for the maintenance of diverse assemblages of floating and submerged aquatic species. The maintenance of diverse assemblages of emergent and riparian species on ditch banks relies on frequent mowing carried annually and no less than once every 2 years. Mowing regimes for floating and submerged species should incorporate an annual spring cut and be targeted at ditches within 600 m of main drains. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water and nutrient budgets were constructed for 13 low-lying peat polders in the Netherlands that varied in elevation relative to sea level (-0.2 to -2.4 m below sea level), land use (7-70% of the total polder area covered by agriculture; largely dairy farming), and surface water prevalence (6-43%). Water balances were verified with chloride budgets and accepted when both met the criterion (total inflows - total outflows)/(total inflows) < 0.05. Apart from precipitation and evapotranspiration (overall means 913 vs. 600 mm), in- and outlet (171 vs. 420 mm) as well as in- and outward seepage (137 vs. 174 mm) were important items in the water budgets. Nutrient budgets, however, were dominated by terms related to agricultural land use (similar to 60% of all inputs, 90% of N-removal and 80% of P removal) rather than water fluxes (8% and 5% of N and P inputs; 6 and 18% of outputs). After agriculture (200 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), mineralisation of the peat soil and atmospheric deposition appear to be important inputs (about 94 and 21 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Major output terms were agricultural output (209 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and denitrification (95 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The average N budget was in balance (difference similar to 1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), whereas P accumulated in most polders, particularly those under agriculture. The mean P surplus (15 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) in the 9 mainly agricultural polders) corresponds well with the accumulated difference observed elsewhere (700 kg P ha(-1) in the upper 50 cm in a nature reserve versus 1400 under agriculture) after over 50 years of dairy farming. Bulk retention of N and P in these polders is taking place in the peat soil, through temporary sorption to the matrix and N is lost through denitrification. In a principal components analysis combining land use, landscape pattern, water balance and nutrient budget terms, the three-first principal components explained 63% of the variability. The first component (PC) correlated strongly with the percentage of land under agriculture (r = 0.82) and negatively with the percentage covered by surface water (r = -0.74). Most input and output terms of the nitrogen budget also correlated with this PC. The second PC covaried distinctly with the total area of a polder (r = -0.79) and human population density at municipality level (r = 0.75). Phosphorus loads in inlet and outlet water correlated with this PC. This suggests that the variability in nutrient budgets among polders is largely governed by agricultural land use.

AB Enchytraeidae) were recorded in three floodplain meadows differing in soil type in Northern Germany during 2 years of contrasting hydrological extremes: 2002 with high precipitation, extended winter inundations and summer floods in two of the sites, and 2003 with an extraordinarily dry summer. In all sites, earthworms dominated the biomass of soil fauna, the dominant species being Octolasion tyrtaeum in marsh soil, Octolasion cyaneum in peat soil, Allolobophora chlorotica in gley soil, and Lumbricus rubellus in all three sites. The enchytraeid communities composed of 7-10 species, differed widely between sites.
   While the summer flood of 2002 reduced annelid populations in peat soil to zero, in gley soil only enchytraeids were sharply reduced. The earthworms there probably were less affected because of shorter duration of the flood, the lower air temperatures and SOM contents and the diapause of the dominant A. chlorotica. During summer drought in 2003, earthworms and enchytraeids were absent from gley soil, while they had maximum abundances in peat soil. The marsh soil, structured by a microrelief of shallow ditches and ridges, had highest densities of annelids. As it was not subjected to summer flooding in 2002, populations of both earthworms and potworms were stable. The drought in 2003 led to a sharp decrease in earthworm abundance in July, while the enchytraeids reached maximum values. Dynamics and survival strategies of different annelid species are discussed.
   The water holding capacity as well as the organic matter content of the soil are important factors for annelids in sites subjected to such hydrological extremes.
   To promote terrestrial annelids, controlled flooding should be kept short, especially in winters following natural summer floods. If possible, recovery times for annelids should be guarenteed, that is 2-3 months without inundations for enchytraeids and about half a year for earthworms. A microrelief with drier refuge sites can be judged as favourable for earthworms. An artificially raised groundwater table will favour annelids during drought periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Amphibian declines have been reported worldwide during the last decades. In this study, we focused on the endangered great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), which has suffered from intensive forestry and past mire ditching in the northern verge of its distribution. We collected data from 46 breeding ponds in eastern Finland during 2005-2011 using dip-netting. We modeled breeding success with cost-effective methods by using site-level forest data. The results highlight the importance of herb-rich forests in the vicinity of breeding ponds. Based on the results possible new breeding sites can now be located based on the presence and size of types of nutrient-rich forest, proportion of deciduous trees, young stands, shading and unfavorable habitats in the vicinity of ponds. Also practical conservation measures, like creating new ponds within a certain area, can now be allocated more accurately using the same variables.

AB In the central parts of western Finland, many streams are severely acidified as a result of land-use activities on overburden (soils) capable of producing and ultimately releasing extreme acidity. Consequently, the extent of the acidification problem is likely to have varied over time in response to the type and extent of contemporary land use. In this study, we have combined historical information on land use and knowledge on hydrogeochemical processes in order to assess the pH declines that are likely to have occurred in streams in this area since the Middle Ages. The results show that among several potentially acidifying activities, reclamation of mires for farmland (19th and 20th centuries) and subsurface drainage of acid sulphate soils (post-war Limes) are the major causes of the pH decline. Recent methods developed to combat the acidification and possible future changes in pH are discussed.

AB A sedimentological and plant microfossil history of the Late Quaternary is preserved in two sediment cores from early Polynesian ditch systems on southern Aupouri Peninsula. The study places human activities into a geomorphological and ecological context and allows comparison of natural and anthropogenic effects on two different geological settings: a floodplain and a relatively closed peat swamp. The data fill part of the current gap in the environmental record from northern New Zealand, namely MIS 3 (57k-26k yr BP). There is evidence for an increase in fire frequency in the region after 40k C-14 yr BP, suggesting a shift to drier (and cooler) conditions. Pollen records show that conifer-hardwood forest dominated by podocarps (especially Dacrydium) prevailed prior to Polynesian arrival and deforestation within the last millennium, with Fuscopsora insignificant throughout. Both cores show sections with gaps in deposition or preservation, possible flood-stripping of peat during the pre-Holocene and mechanical disturbance by early Polynesians. The identification of prehistoric starch grains and other microremains of introduced Colocasia esculenta (taro) in both cores supports indirect evidence that the ditch systems of far northern New Zealand were used for the extensive cultivation of this crop.

AB Stream-water samples were collected during a 4-year-period in two small streams, one whose catchment was ditched for forestry halfway through the sampling period and another nearby reference stream whose catchment was not ditched during this period. The main aim was to study the impact of forest ditching on stream-water quality. Whereas the artificial drainage did not change the hydrograph pattern, it had a large effect on stream hydrochemistry: the concentrations of suspended material, Mn, Ca, Mg and Al increased, the concentrations of total organic carbon decreased, and pH increased by approximately one unit, from an average of 4.4 to 5.4. The increase in suspended material, Mn and Al concentrations is explained by the physical mobilisation of mineral particulates/colloids from mineral soils (till) exposed on the ditch slopes beneath the peat layer, while the increase in Ca and Mg loads is explained by the release of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in exchange reactions in this same soil layer. The increase in pH and decrease in TOC concentrations after ditching are related to changes in hydrological flow paths in the catchments, and most likely to immobilisation of both hydrogen ions and humic substances in the near neutral till horizon exposed beneath the peat layer. Only the aquatic abundance of Fe was not significantly affected by the ditching.

AB Despite the listing of golden plover Pluvialis apricaria on Annex 1 of the European Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds there is virtually no information on the habitat requirements or diet of their chicks. We used radio telemetry to investigate habitat selection of 22 broods on two upland study sites in northern England. Broods (< 16 days old) avoided old or extensive stands of heather Calluna vulgaris but selected small patches of heather mixed with grass. They also selected marshes (mainly soft rush Juncus effusus), grassland and Eriophorum vaginatum mire. Habitat selection broadly fitted the distribution of their favoured prey (Tipula spp. and beetles). We suspect food availability, vegetation structure and cover from predators may partly explain habitat preferences. We suggest moorland could be managed for golden plover broods by managing stocking densities to create patchworks of grass and heather and a heterogeneous mature heather sward and by blocking drainage ditches to create areas of soft rush.

AB Temporary freshwater bodies are important as wildlife habitats and in biomass cycling, but their quantity and characteristics in relation to forest management are poorly documented. We surveyed small waterbodies in Estonian forest landscapes, along randomly placed transects in forests and non-forested fens. The area of natural puddles and floods varied by nearly two orders of magnitude among habitat types. The main effect of drainage and clear cutting was the conversion of waterbody types: natural ones were partly replaced by ditches and wheel-rut puddles, respectively. Using the common brown frog and the moor frog as indicator species revealed that anthropogenic changes are not necessarily detrimental: the frogs preferred to breed in anthropogenic waterbodies in open areas (i.e., clear cuts). Mitigation of forestry effects on the biota of temporary waterbodies should combine restoration (allowing flooding in selected areas; restoring streams) and compensatory measures (excavating ponds; retaining wheel-rut puddles in key sites).

AB Ditches and systems of ditches area frequent kind of water body in Northern Germany. Although it is already known that ditches are important replacement habitats for species from ponds, organic rivers and floodplains there are nearly not approaches for their integrated assessment. In the sense of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), ditches are Artificial Water Bodies (AWB). For them, the environmental aim "good ecological Potential" is valid. This potential has to be defined. This contribution bases on assessments of 49 fen ditches in Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony. Sampling results concerning macroinvertebrate fauna and macrophyte flora were used to develop a multimetric method for ecological assessment of ditches and small canals. A Dutch assessment method also bases on a multimetric index but only uses macroinvertebrates. Both approaches were found to be applicable for the assessment of ditches. Thereby, the Ecological Potential mainly depends on the use of water body surroundings and on the regime of maintenance.

AB The extensive network of waters in the lower part of the Dutch delta is loaded with nutrients and accordingly a uniform ecological classification 'moderate' has been derived. The present study sets out to typify the diatom communities in this apparently homogenous environment via self-organizing maps of diatom species composition. Clusters of diatom communities were characterized through the representation of ecological guilds (high and low profile, motile and planktonic) and via a RDA analysis based on either species, genus or ecological guilds together with environmental drivers. Five clusters of diatom communities were identified despite the prominence of omnipresent species. The clusters had different profiles of ecological guilds and were associated with water transparency and sediment type (peat/clay) in addition to the well-established environmental drivers related to eutrophication, but with distinct roles for nitrogen and phosphate concentration. The clusters were interpreted as functional types of community, e.g. communities with a substantial share of planktonic diatom species were found in peat ditches with turbid water. The high consistency found between diatom community classification using species, genus or guilds may allow for a simplified water quality assessment while retaining valuable ecological information. The typology, based on species, genus and ecological guilds underpins the robust use of diatoms as water quality indicators in nutrient rich lentic waters and supports steps to improve ecological conditions.

AB The aim of the study was to estimate the vegetation and bird species and compare it with the data collected 17 years ago, analyse the changes in plant communities and bird species depending on grassland management and habitat as well as analyse the climate and habitat changes based on Ellenberg's indicators. Studies were carried out in 1996 and 2013 on Zienki Meadows in Polesie National Park, Eastern Poland. The meadow complex discussed (51 degrees 27-29' N; 23 degrees 6-9' E), covering approx. 650 ha, has natural borders: in the north, it adjoins a natural mineral soil elevation, the so-called Wlodawa Ridge; a forest complex in the west; a peat bog with Lake Moszne in the south; and a watershed on mineral soils in the east. The plant communities were classified using the Braun-Blanquet method. Investigations concerning birds were conducted in the breeding period from mid-April to mid-July in the same periods as the vegetation cover. The study area is characterized by the great diversity of habitats and plant communities. The most stable were tall oat-grass meadows, which are one of the habitat types protected within the framework of the Nature 2000 network (6510). That fresh meadows were characterized by the greatest floristic diversity, but Ellenberg's indicators showed a significant reduction of soil acidity and trophism of that habitat during 17 years. These changes could have been caused by extensification of meadow use (reduction or lack of mineral fertilisation). The biggest changes in Alopecurus and Poa pratensis-Festuca rubra meadows were observed. Most of them were transformed into meadows with the predominance of Deschampsia caespitosa. The appearance of large areas of such humid meadows was probably one of the reasons for the withdrawal of two endangered bird species in Europe: the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa and the common redshank Tringa tetanus. The most significant factors differentiating the data set were soil humidity and trophism. On the other hand, a mosaic character of different habitats, diversity of plant communities and extensive utilisation ensured the stable number of bird species in both study periods. The active protection of wet habitats conducted by the Polesie National Park in recent years led even to the appearance of the greater spotted eagle Clanga clanga, a species that is vulnerable to extinction in Europe. Moreover, isolated low shrubs that appeared in these meadows and shrubs growing along drainage ditches became a favourable habitat for the common grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia which had not occurred in this area before.

AB The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate, with the help of stem analysis, the growth increases of natural and planted black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) seedlings in 39 drainage networks located in Quebec public boreal forest and drained operationally after cutting. The ecological conditions of the sites have been described using the forest ecosystem classification for the Clay Belt of eastern Ontario. A significant effect of the drainage on 9-year periodic growth in diameter and height of natural black spruce seedlings, varying with distance from the ditch and ecological conditions, was observed. Stocking of natural black spruce seedlings was sufficient to insure the reconstruction of a forest stand both on the treated sites and on the control sites. The 5-year height growth increment of planted black spruce seedlings was weaker than that of the natural seedlings, which were located on the same sites, and it varied with distance from the ditches.

DE ISCHNURA-PUMILIO; STATUS; HABITAT; CONSERVATION
AB The status and distribution of the rare and local scarce blue-tailed damselfly Ischnura pumilio in Britain and Ireland is reviewed from a national mapping survey. Although the species is now extinct from parts of East Anglia (where it was recorded early this century) and has experienced recent declines in the New Forest area, information suggests that it is perhaps as common now as it ever has been. The species is well established in valley mires, floodlands and other natural wetlands, particularly in western Britain. In recent decades, it has been reported increasingly from artificial wetlands such as those created by mineral extraction, newly created ponds and ditches. Colonies at artificial wetlands tend to be more transient, associated with the early stages of plant seral succession. Disturbance to such habitats which perpetuates bare substrates and openness of vegetation appears to sustain the insect at such sites. Despite apparent differences between natural and artificial sites, the microhabitats favoured by this highly dispersive damselfly are similar throughout its range. Suitable management prescriptions are discussed for its effective conservation.

DT Article
AB A survey was made of the bryophytes of the young woods in the Noordoostpolder, E.- and S.-Flevoland.  These polders were reclaimed in the former IJsselmeer, in the period 1942-1968.
   A variety of tree species were planted on peat, boulder clay, sand and clay deposits.  From 1973 onwards 18 production woods and some nature reserves have been surveyed for their bryophyte flora.  A total of 216 species were recorded, including first records for The Netherlands of Distichium inclinatum, Pterigynandrum filiforme, Rhytidiadelphus subpinnatus, Plagiomnium medium and Ulota drummondii.
   Records of species that have been absent for many decades in the Netherlands include Eurhynchium angustirete, Atrichum angustatum, Orthotrichum rupestre and O. speciosum.
   Plantations of Fraxinus on sand, boulder clay and partially eroded peat are particularly rich in species.  Ditches provide habitats for many additional species in these and other woodland types.  Plantations of Salix and Populus can be rich in epiphytic species depending on soil type, moisture and planted cultivar.  Locations with strong seepage can also be rich in species.
   The species richness of the various woods is correlated with the area.  The importance of age is shown for some stand/soil types.  At the level of permanent plots it is shown that establishment is still going on, but at different rates in the various stand/soil types.
   Nearly 40% of the mosses do not (or very rarely) produce spores in The Netherlands.  Some of these may have invaded the woods by their asexual propagules.  A significant part of these species will have been dispersed from areas where they produce sporophytes more abundantly, such as mountainous areas of Middle Europe.  We speculate that subsequent terrestrial establishment possibilities in the woods were favourable in comparison with the "old land" due to low levels of competition with other plants.

AB Production of Vaccinium corymbosum L. is limited to acidic soils with high organic matter content. This specific soil requirement is limiting the possibilities to cultivate V. corymbosum L. in many regions of Central Europe. The aim of this study was to overcome the limiting production factors occurring under the soil and climate conditions of Switzerland: (1) evaluation of natural growing substrates without peat as required for organic production; (2) adjustment of the optimal pH in the growing substrate; (3) regulation of water issues (water quality and mulching) and (4) development of a suited planting system.
   Pine sawdust was evaluated to be the best alternative growing substrate compared to peat moss. Optimal pH adjustment in pine sawdust substrate was found to be 3.8 (CaCl2) and 4.2 (H2O). In field cultivation, an amount of 30 g S year(-1) plant(-1) to lower the pH of the pine sawdust ditches was sufficient for good plant and yield development. This acidification resulted in better growth (+48%) and higher Yield (+55%) when alkaline ground water (357 mg L-1 CaC0(3)) was used for irrigation. Acidification with citric acid gave poor results. A mulch of pine bark on the sawdust ridge increased growth by 59% and yield by 25%. The newly developed flat ditch system with low sawdust ditches buried partly into the ground was as suitable as the standard planting system with deep ditches lined with plastic film. By integration and application of these new findings, a system for commercial organic blueberry production under Swiss conditions and on alkaline soils was developed.

AB Methane fluxes measured in a eutrophic peat meadow in The Netherlands dominated by vascular plants showed high spatial and temporal variability. To elucidate this variability as well as the underlying processes, various measurement techniques were used: soil gradients of methane concentrations, the chamber method, and the eddy covariance technique. Additionally, soil temperature at multiple depths, soil water level, root depth, carbon dioxide fluxes, incoming radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, friction velocity latent, heat fluxes, and living biomass were monitored.
   A comparison of the measurement techniques showed that: (a) the soil gradient method and the chamber method showed comparable methane fluxes only at a site with low water table and shallow roots, while at other sites methane fluxes were underestimated with the soil gradient method by an order of magnitude: (b) a footprint analysis showed that the chamber method and eddy covariance showed similar methane fluxes for the different land elements (dry land, wet land, and ditches plus borders). However, when up-scaling the chamber measurements over time using a regression model based on soil temperature, methane emissions were overestimated by 37% compared to the eddy covariance data. The chamber method was the best technique to assess spatial variability, while eddy covariance was best for assessing temporal variability as well as up-scaling. The soil gradient method for methane fluxes should be used with great care, and probably generates reliable results only in areas with low water table and shallow roots.
   Both the chamber method and eddy covariance showed significant spatial variability, which was best explained by soil water level in combination with root depth patterns. Together, these variables probably determined the net methane production and the available mechanisms for methane transport to atmosphere. The methane fluxes showed strong temporal variability at different scales: diurnal cycles, significant day-to-day variability, and seasonal variations. Clear diurnal cycles of methane fluxes were observed synchronous to incoming radiation, latent heat and net ecosystem exchange, but not synchronous to temperature. This suggested that stomatal opening and/or pressurized convective throughflow were important mechanisms for gas transport through plants. The variability at the day-today scale was best explained by soil temperature below the water level combined with soil water level. Highest methane fluxes were observed during summer and lowest fluxes during autumn and winter. The vegetation density together with temperature and length of day-light probably determined this seasonality. Also, temporal variability varied spatially, probably due to the water table and root depth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effect of leaching of heavy metals (Cr, As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Co, Mo) and earth-alkaline metal, barium (Ba), on the percolation and ditch water quality from the forest roads that contained ash in the road structures. Water quality was studied in the immediate vicinity below the ash layers as well as deeper in the road structure. Water quality was also determined in the drainage water in ditches that crossed the forest roads. A mixture of wood and peat based fly ash was used in the road structures. The treatments were: 1) no ash, 2) a 15 cm layer of ash/gravel mixture, 3) a 20 cm layer of ash/ gravel mixture, 4) a 25 cm layer of ash, and 5) a 50 cm layer of ash. Large variation in the concentrations of Cr, As, Cu, Ni, Pb, Mo and Ba in the percolation water, even within the same treatment, caused difficulties to generalize the results. The concentrations of Cr, As, Ni, Pb, Mo and Ba in water samples were high in some treatment plot lysimeters containing ash compared to the control (no ash). On the other hand, many lysimeters had low and similar concentrations in water samples in the treatment plots containing ash compared to concentrations in the control plots. The ash in the roads did not affect the concentrations in the ditches. The leaching is uneven and seems to take place only from some parts of the ash layer. Risk for leaching is minimal if such parts are not widely spread.

DT Article
ID DITCH BANKS; MANAGEMENT
AB It was demonstrated that a mechanical harvesting regime can influence the species composition of ditch vegetation at the community level. This effect, however, was very small compared with those of other factors such as the between-site and the within-site spatial variation, and several soil and water quality parameters. Cutting in November had the largest effect, in that it caused the greatest extremes in species cover. The vegetation was composed of 136 plant species. The semi-aquatic and aquatic species were less numerous than the terrestrial ones (52 versus 84). The total number per vegetation type and site ranged from 5 to 49; that of persistent plant species, from 4 to 22. Only 16% of the species was significantly influenced by the mechanical harvesting regime. The significant effects of the mechanical harvesting regime on plant species were related to plant-inherent factors. Mechanical harvesting repeated within a year, on one hand, opened up the vegetation, 1) freeing sites for colonization of new species, 2) improving the light climate for seedlings which had already colonized; on the other hand, it exhausted (carbohydrate) reserves of solitary species. Mechanical harvesting once a year in November had a contrasting effect in that it caused suffocation of the shore vegetation in spring by the not yet decomposed plant material harvested in autumn. The highest species richness was attained for the aquatic vegetation: on sand by cutting three times per year (in May, July and September), and on peat by cutting once a year (in November); and for the shore vegetation: on sand once a year (in May) and two times per year (in May and July), and on peat once a year (in May or November).

AB Manure application can spread antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from manure to soil and surface water. This study evaluated the role of the soil texture on the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in soils and surrounding surface waters. Six dairy farms with distinct soil textures (clay, sand, and peat) were sampled at different time points after the application of manure, and three representative ARGs sul1, erm(B), and tet(W) were quantified with qPCR. Manuring initially increased levels of erm(B) by 1.5 +/- 0.5 log copies/kg of soil and tet (W) by 0.8 +/- 0.4 log copies/kg across soil textures, after which levels gradually declined. In surface waters from clay environments, regardless of the ARG, the gene levels initially increased by 2.6 +/- 1.6 log copies/L, after which levels gradually declined. The gene decay in soils was strongly dependent on the type of ARG (erm (B) b tet(W) b sul1; half-lives of 7, 11, and 75 days, respectively), while in water, the decay was primarily dependent on the soil texture adjacent to the sampled surface water (clay b peat b sand; half-lives of 2, 6, and 10 days, respectively). Finally, recovery of ARG levels was predicted after 29-42 days. The results thus showed that there was not a complete restoration of ARGs in soils between rounds of manure application. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that rather than showing similar dynamics of decay, factors such as the type of ARGand soil texture drive the ARG persistence in the environment.

AB This paper discusses the social history, attitudes, and understanding of approaches to the utilisation of wetlands, their drainage, preservation, management, and research. The analysis is in two phases; the manifestation of wetlands in map making in Iceland; and the social history of wetlands. Both phases focus on the 20th century until the present. Maps and the history of mapmaking are used as a heuristic devise to gauge and set the scene for the perception and experience of wetlands in the thinking of people. In order to illustrate this development, examples are taken from literature and travel accounts. Current endeavour in the utilisation of land and biotopic classification, best demonstrated in maps today, foregrounds the nature of the striations, making maps, and drainage ditches. Thus wetlands are viewed differently today, but nonetheless lingering traces of the modernist logic of progress remain, as we aim to demonstrate. The lines that form the tufts on the Icelandic maps are thus never stable, the striation never an end but constantly motile.

AB To tackle the symptoms of eutrophication in the open Baltic Sea and Finnish coastal waters, Finland has agreed to reduce both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) inputs. Due to large investments in treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters, TP loads started to decrease already in the mid-1970s and the respective TN loads in the mid-1990s. During the last two decades, much effort has been spent in decreasing the load originating from diffuse sources. Trend analyses in 1995-2016 showed that, despite various mitigation measures, riverine nutrient export has not substantially decreased, and especially the export from rivers draining agricultural lands remains high. In some areas TN concentrations and export were increasing and we found evidence that it was linked to ditching of peatlands. Several factors connected to climate/weather (e.g. temperature and precipitation) have counteracted the mitigation measures, and therefore Finland will not achieve the nutrient reduction targets by 2021.

AB Lake Zuvintas, located in southern Lithuania in the Dovine River basin, is one of the largest lakes and oldest nature reserves in the country. However, changes in the hydrology of the Dovine River basin, caused by large-scale land reclamation and water management works carried out in the 20th century, have resulted in a significant decrease in the biodiversity of the lake and surrounding wetlands. In order to halt the ongoing deterioration of the lake and wetlands, solutions have to be found at the basin level. Using the SIMGRO model, various measures were therefore analysed to evaluate their impact on the water management in the Dovine River basin. The results show that it is impossible to fully restore the water dynamics and flow pattern in the Dovine River to their original state. However, a good measure for improving the hydrological conditions is to block drainage ditches and remove bushes and trees from the wetlands.

AB A study was carried out to test the persistence of the early effects of forest drainage and planting position on the growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) seedlings planted in eight drained forested wetland cutovers. Initial results, 2 years after planting, had shown that seedling response was most affected by planting position within the microtopography, and to a lesser extent, by distance to the drainage ditch. Persistence of these effects was tested by measuring the survival and growth rates of seedlings for an additional 4 years after planting. Increased growth owing to raised planting position was maintained over time. The small effect of distance to ditch on seedling growth observed after two growing seasons did not evolve into larger differences over time, and after 6 years there was no significant effect of distance to drainage ditch. Given the marginal growth improvements of black spruce seedlings planted closer to the ditch, drainage networks with narrow ditch spacing are not necessary on these site types after clear-cutting.

Ditches also mediate the flow of pollutants from agroecosystems to downstream water bodies. This paper provides in overview of the science, management, and policy of ditches. Ditches provide a unique opportunity to address nonpoint source pollution problems from agriculture due to the concentration of the contaminants and the engineered nature of ditch systems. A better understanding of the nature of these complex system and the technologies available and under development to improve their management will assist in the design and implementation of water quality protection programs.

AB The Western Peat District of The Netherlands has a characteristic Dutch landscape. It consists mainly of meadows for dairy farming, crisscrossed by a dense network of ditches. Its biodiversity is regarded as of high national and international importance, but is declining as a result of intensive farming. Besides the establishment of reserves, measures to conserve and restore biological diversity have been implemented in the form of agri-environment schemes (AES). The aim of this research is to investigate, first, whether the reserves, assuming these provide source populations, affect the distribution of amphibians and, second, whether AES in the form of nature-friendly ditch bank management benefits amphibian diversity and abundance and enhances distribution across the agricultural landscape. In total, 42 ditches (24 control ditches and 18 AES ditches) were studied. Each ditch was perpendicular to the boundary of one of the reserves and was divided into five ditch sections of 100 m spread over 800 m, starting in the reserve and proceeding into the farmland. Generalized Linear Modelling was used to quantify the effect of nature-friendly ditch bank management (AES) and distance to the nature reserve on amphibian diversity and abundance. Species richness was high in AES ditches as compared to control ditches. The number of observed green frog (Rana esculenta synkl.) seemed to decline in the control ditches at large distances from the reserve. The other species, although their abundances were higher in the reserves, did not show a declining trend across the farmland. However, all adult amphibians except green frogs together had significantly higher abundances in the AES ditches compared to the control ditches. These results illustrate the potential role of agricultural ditches, combined with reserves and nature-friendly ditch bank management, in the conservation of amphibian populations.

AB The occurrence and density of greater than or equal to1 + brown trout, Salmo trutta L., and their relationship with prevailing instream and catchment characteristics were studied in 50 small forest streams, partially dredged for forest ditching. The occurrence of trout at a stream site was largely determined by the abundance of pools, size of upper catchment and water pH. Moreover, at sites where trout occurred, the abundance of pools was lower at dredged locations than at those in a natural state. In riffles in a natural state, there was a positive relationship between trout density and three instream variables: the abundance of stream pools, cascades and instream vegetation, while an inverse relationship was found with the abundance of substratum of 2-10 cm in diameter. Of the catchment variables, correspondingly, the proportion of forest in the upper catchment was positively related and the proportion of peatland negatively related to trout density. No significant regression model could be fitted for dredged riffles. The possibility of enhancing trout populations in dredged riffles is discussed.

AB Depth to water table, thickness of the aerobic layer and soil water content were measured before and after digging one drainage ditch on each of right waterlogged forested wetland cutovers in order to determine the effect of the distance to the ditch on seedling root zone conditions. Drawdown of the water table ranged from 23 cm at 3 m to 6 cm at 60 m from the ditch and was similar on mineral and organic soils. The ditch significantly lowered the: water table up to a distance of 60 m where the water table was maintained below the 20 cm depth 25% more often than on the undrained control. Soil water content was reduced by drainage in the top 10 cm layer and rite depth of the aerobic layer increased by 6 to 9 cm. This significant improvement of the soil moisture regime in the seedling rooting zone was similar at 7 and 40 m from the ditch, indicating that a dense ditch network may not be necessary to enhance seedling growth.

AB The present distribution and status of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) was investigated in the northern cross-border areas of Sweden, Norway, Russia, and Finland in the period of 2003-2007. Location of the populations was done in two steps, first by gathering all the existing data from earlier studies, historical pearl fishing, and from local people through interviews. After this preliminary data collection, the populations were located more precisely by field studies. The results of the investigations varied depending on the catchment area. Abundant and viable populations were found in some of the catchments, while in the others M. margaritifera had disappeared or were near extinction. Besides the absence or low densities of host fish, other threats to M. margaritifera in these vast and remote areas are ground preparation as part of the felling operations, ditching of forests and bogs, building of forest roads, and mining. During the field surveys, the mussels were found in habitats not reported earlier, e. g., in rivers totally covered by big boulders, on the roots of the water plants, and in extremely shallow brooks.

AB We engaged in field studies of native mosquitoes in a Cambridgeshire Fen, investigating a) the habitat specificity and seasonal dynamics of our native fauna in an intensively managed wetland, b) the impact of water-level and ditch management, and c) their colonization of an arable reversion to flooded grassland wetland expansion project. Studies from April to October, 2010 collected 14,000 adult mosquitoes (15 species) over 292 trap-nights and approximate to 4,000 pre-imaginal mosquitoes (11 species). Open floodwater species (Aedes caspius and Aedes cinereus, 43.3%) and wet woodland species (Aedes cantans/annulipes and Aedes rusticus, 32.4%) dominated, highlighting the major impact of seasonal water-level management on mosquito populations in an intensively managed wetland. In permanent habitats, managing marginal ditch vegetation and ditch drying significantly affect densities of pre-imaginal anophelines and culicines, respectively. This study presents the first UK field evidence of the implications of wetland expansion through arable reversion on mosquito colonization. Understanding the heterogeneity of mosquito diversity, phenology, and abundance in intensively managed UK wetlands will be crucial to mitigating nuisance and vector species through habitat management and biocidal control.

AB A freshwater sediment from a ditch of a peat grassland near Zegveld (Province of Utrecht, The Netherlands) was investigated for its potential methanogenic and syntrophic activity and the influence of sulfate and nitrate on these potential activities. Methanogenesis started after a 10 days lagphase. After 35-40 days aceticlastic methanogens were sufficiently enriched to cause a net decrease of acetate. In the presence of sulfate methane formation was only slightly affected. The addition of nitrate led to an outcompetion of aceticlastic methanogens by nitrate reducers. When inorganic electron accepters were absent, substrates like propionate and butyrate were converted by syntrophic methanogenic consortia. Addition of inorganic electron accepters resulted in an outcompetition of the syntrophic propionate and butyrate degrading consortia by the sulfate and nitrate reducers.

AB A novel drainage method using pressure valves to regulate the water pressure acting on the support system of transport tunnels is proposed in order to reduce water inflow and protect the local groundwater environment as much as possible. A complete analytical solution to the problem is further derived to assess the water pressure borne by the support system (assuming pressure valves are installed in the side ditches of the tunnel). No assumptions need to be made about the water penetrating the lining. Under this premise, the amount of water inflow is balanced by the water pressure acting on the tunnel lining to ensure the safety of the lining. To restrict the water inflow to the maximum amount allowed, using our novel drainage method allows the thickness of the grouted zone to be significantly reduced compared to conventional methods and, therefore, reduces costs and speeds up the construction process. Results predicted using our analytical solution are in excellent agreement with those derived via field monitoring and numerical (finite element) modeling. The relative errors are less than 0.15%, suggesting that our analytical solution is a reliable way of assessing the seepage expected in our novel drainage system.

AB The Zuvintas Lake. located in southern Lithuania in the basin of the Dovine River is one of the biggest takes and the oldest natural reserves of the country. However, the changes in the hydrology or the Dovine River basin, caused by large-scale melioration and water management works carried out in the 20th century, have resulted in significant alteration of hydrological regime aid decrease in biodiversity of the Zuvintas Lake and Surrounding wetlands. In order to prevent the ongoing deterioration or the Lake and wetlands solutions have to be found. Therefore, various scenarios have been analysed to evaluate the impact of water management alternatives. For these scenarios the physically-based distributed parameter model SIMGRO was used. The results have shown that natural water regime in the Zuvintas Lake is hardly reversible. However, the replacement of sluice-gates implemented at the Outlet of the Zuvintas Lake by overflow weir as well as the blocking of drainage ditches and the removal of scrubs and trees in the wetlands Surrounding the Lake call be highly successful measures to improve hydrological conditions.

AB Hitherto eight Cuscuta species (C. lupuliformis Krock., C. australis R.Br., C. campestris Yuncker, C. epilinum Weihe, C. europaea L., C. approximata Bab., C. kotschyi Desmoul., C. epithymum (L.) Nath.) have been recorded in Hungary.
   In our surveys C. campestris, C epithymum and C europaea showed to be the most frequent. C epilinum is supposedly extinct. C australis and C lupuliformis have only a few recent data. C. approximata has been recorded as a new element.
   Up until the middle of the 20(th) century dodders used to cause severe damage to agriculture, this effect has completely disappeared lately though. Now C campestris occurs in great quantities on the edge of roads and agricultural fields, C. europaea along streams and wet ditches. C. epithymum is widespread on mesophilous meadows and pastures, C. kotschyi in dry grasslands. C. australis occurs in extensive large sedge vegetation, swamps and fens. C lupuliformis, though getting rare, is a characteristic species of floodplains, while C approximata is found in acidophilous oakwoods.
   Compiling the host spectra of the different Cuscuta species based on herbaria, literature and our own observations revealed that these plants parasitize at minimum 12% of the vascular plants in Hungary (approx. 2500 species altogether). The rarer the plant, the narrower is the host spectrum of the species. C. epithymum has the widest host spectrum, while C approximata, known only at two locations, has the narrowest.

AB Small landscape elements such as ditches are an important remaining refuge for biodiversity in agricultural land especially in the Netherlands. By themselves ditches harbour steep gradients in environmental conditions creating a rich variety in microhabitat availability at the small scale. Regional variation in management and water quality could influence microhabitat variability among these ditches. Some 400 ditches in six major agricultural polder areas around Amsterdam were studied. Data were collected on ditch width, submerged or emergent plants, conductivity, bank height, slope and ditch depth. A principal component analysis using these variables showed observed variability and attributed to the ditch dimensions related to ditch maintenance carried out by the farmers and ditch water quality. Microhabitats prevalence such as percentage algal cover and emergent, vary greatly even in early spring. It was found that, there is a great variability between the ditches within the sampled agricultural polder areas.

AB 1. Wetlands are threatened by desiccation, eutrophication and changing water quality, generally leading to greatly altered biogeochemical processes. Sulphate pollution can lead to severe eutrophication and sulphide toxicity, but may also interact with the availability of iron and other metals.
   2. In the present study, we examined the biogeochemical interactions between sulphate and iron availability, and their effects on aquatic macrophytes, in a field experiment with enclosures. The natural iron supply by groundwater was mimicked by adding iron to the sediment, and the effect of increased sulphate concentrations in the surface water was also studied. The enclosure experiment was performed in a mesotrophic, anaerobic ditch in a peat meadow reserve in the Netherlands. In all enclosures, three Stratiotes aloides plants were introduced to serve as indicator species.
   3. Addition of sulphate led to the mobilisation of phosphate, whereas addition of iron or both iron and sulphate did not affect P mobilisation. Growth of S. aloides was decreased by both iron addition and sulphate addition (sulphide toxicity). Addition of iron under sulphidic conditions, however, led to mutual detoxification of both toxicants (iron and sulphide) and did not decrease S. aloides growth. The uptake of metals was highest in the treatment involving sulphate addition, probably as a result of increased mineralisation of the peat soil.
   4. Growth of Elodea nuttallii, which grew naturally in the enclosures, was stimulated by iron or iron plus sulphate addition. It did not, however, grow in the enclosures with sulphate addition, as a result of sulphide toxicity or sulphide-induced iron deficiency. Under iron-rich conditions, E. nuttallii appeared to be a better competitor than S. aloides and depressed the growth of the latter species.
   5. We propose that the growth of S. aloides is directly regulated by interactions between sulphide and iron and indirectly by the effects of both compounds on the competitive strength of E. nuttallii. In general, we conclude that biogeochemical interactions between sulphate and iron can have a strong influence on plant species composition in freshwater wetlands, because of direct effects or changes in the competitive strength of plant species related to differential sensitivity to either iron or sulphide.

AB Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) seedlings were planted on eight drained forested wetland cutblocks to study the effects of soil type, distance from drainage ditch, and microtopography on the physical conditions of the rooting zone and on seedling growth, survival, and physiology. After two growing seasons, providing a raised planting spot had a greater impact on seedling growth than locally intensive drainage. Less saturated, better aerated, and warmer rooting zone on hummocks increased foliar N and Ca concentrations, which led to significantly greater relative growth rate, terminal shoot height growth, diameter, and survival compared with the seedlings in hollows. The effect of drainage on seedling growth is not conclusive. Depth of the aerobic layer and soil water content at 10 cm depth were similar at all distances to the ditch despite a significantly lower water table level in the 5-m plot. Thus, no significant differences were observed as a function of distance to drainage ditch for water relation and growth parameters except for better height growth in the 5-m plot the second year after planting. Water table levels were identical for both soil types and consequently growth was similar on wet mineral and organic soil types.

DT Article
AB During the last 100 years, the neuston bacterium Nevskia ramosa has been described several times. This bacterium forms conspicuous rosette-like microcolonies at the air-water interface. In this study, pure cultures of Nevskia ramosa were obtained for the first time, from a bog lake (strain Soe1, DSMZ 11499(T)) and a freshwater ditch (strain OL1, DSMZ 11500). The isolates showed special adaptations to life in the epineuston. They formed hydrophobic surface films with a dull appearance. N. ramosa is sensitive to UV radiation but revealed a very effective photorepair mechanism. Exposure to light at a wavelength of 350 nm after UV treatment raised the number of surviving cells by several orders of magnitude. The isolates grew with a broad range of organic substrates, Surface films were formed only in the absence of combined nitrogen; however, nitrogenase activity was not detected. It appears that during growth at the air-water interface the cells benefit from trapping ammonia from the air. The G+C content of the DNA was 67.8 and 69.0 mol% for strains Soe1 and OL1, respectively. The slight difference was confirmed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, The 16S rRNA sequences revealed 99.2% similarity. Thus, both isolates belong to the same species, The phylogenetic analysis indicated that Nevskia is a member of the gamma-subclass Proteobacteria that has no known close relatives.

ID COMMUNITIES; VALUES
AB Grasslands in the Kulawa river valley (ca. 10 ha) were subject to land improvement in the 19(th) century, and remnants of the hydrotechnical system and overgrown ditches are still present. This study aims to:
   (1) evaluate the present meadow ecosystems;
   (2) predict their changes under the influence of the planned restoration of the hydrotechnical system and
   (3) compare results of various methods: phytoindication, phytosociological, floristic, and principal component analysis.
   The applied methods complemented one another. The devastation of the hydrotechnical system and the lack of utilization of the grasslands have led to either drying or waterlogging of the soil, and to changes in vegetation. The plant communities that have developed there represent the intermediate stage of regressive succession, and belong to the orders Arrhenatheretalia, Molinietalia, and the class Phragmitetea. Particularly the patches growing on relatively dry, strongly decomposed peaty soil have lost the characteristics of damp meadows. Meadow species have declined there, and nitrophilous species have replaced them. Only a local depression without outflow, which was earlier drained, is now waterlogged again, with a mosaic of calcareous fen, meadow, and marsh vegetation, including large populations of 11 species that are rare, protected, or listed as indicator species for the Natura 2000 habitat 7210*. Results of this study indicate that the present conditions in the waterlogged depression should be preserved. In contrast, the dry patches should be irrigated and subject to extensive farming.

AB Many of the agri-environment schemes (AES) implemented in the Western Peat District of the Netherlands have as their objective the conservation of the diversity of ditch bank plants. We investigated the effects of AES on ditch bank species in this area, using a dataset collected by 377 farmers who managed and monitored ditch banks during a 10-year period. We found that species richness has increased minimally over the last 10 years in ditch banks. Yet, we found no differences in increases in time between ditch banks with and without AES. In both ditch bank types plant species composition changed to species with higher nitrogen tolerance. Furthermore, species that disperse over long distances by water increased, whereas species with no capacity to disperse over long distances declined in both ditch bank types. This indicates that changes in vegetation composition in ditch banks are affected by other factors than AES.

AB Zoige Marsh, located in the Northeastern Qianghai-Tibet Plateau, is the largest highland marsh in the world. The marsh is one of the hotspots for biodiversity, harboring many endemic and endangered species, including Grus nigricollis, the only plateau crane. Zoige Marsh has a large area of high-quality grasslands, serving as the fifth largest livestock base in China, and it is also the major water source to the headstream of the Yellow River. However, due to global warming and unwise use of the marsh resources, including ditching for grassland enlargement, peat exploitation, and livestock grazing, since the 1970s, Zoige Marsh has suffered severe ecosystem degradations such as vegetation recessive succession, biodiversity loss, soil deterioration, and rodent disasters. It is therefore imperative to restore the damaged marsh. We propose in this paper that ecological engineering and livestock population control must be taken as measures for ecological restoration and biodiversity protection. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Restoring degraded lands in rural environments that are heavily managed to meet subsistence needs is a challenge due to high rates of disturbance and resource extraction. This study investigates the efficacy of erosion control structures (ECSs) as restoration tools in the context of a watershed rehabilitation and wet meadow (bofedal) restoration program in the Bolivian Andes. In an effort to enhance water security and increase grazing stability, Aymara indigenous communities built over 15,000 check dams, 9,100 terraces, 5,300 infiltration ditches, and 35 pasture improvement trials. Communities built ECSs at different rates, and we compared vegetation change in the highest restoration management intensity, lowest restoration management intensity, and nonproject control communities. We used line transects to measure changes in vegetation cover and standing water in gullies with check dams and without check dams, and related these ground measurements to a time series (1986-2009) of normalized difference vegetation index derived from Landsat TM5 images. Evidence suggests that check dams increase bofedal vegetation and standing water at a local scale, and lead to increased greenness at a basin scale when combined with other ECSs. Watershed rehabilitation enhances ecosystem services significant to local communities (grazing stability, water security), which creates important synergies when conducting land restoration in rural development settings.

AB Loss of coastal wetlands is occurring at an increasingly rapid rate due to drainage of these wetlands for alternative land-uses, which also threatens carbon (C) storage in these C-rich ecosystems. Wetland drainage results in water table drawdown and increased peat aeration, which enhances decomposition of previously stabilized peat and changes stable C isotope profiles. The effect of water table drawdown on the pool size and delta C-13 signature of plant C, soil organic C (SOC), and microbial biomass C (MBC) across a range of organic and mineral soils has not previously been reported in coastal freshwater forested wetlands. To this end, litter, roots, and soils were collected from organic and mineral soil horizons in two coastal freshwater forested wetlands in North Carolina with different hydrological regimes: (1) a natural bottomland hardwood forest (natural); and (2) a ditched and drained, intensively-managed wetland for loblolly pine silviculture (managed). We found that hydrology and soil horizon, and to a lesser degree micro-topography, was important in shaping observed differences in size and C-13 signature of soil and microbial pools between the natural and managed wetland. The natural wetland had higher SOC and MBC concentrations in the litter, surface organic, and mineral horizons compared to the managed wetland. In the managed wetland, C-13 of SOC was enriched across most of the soil profile (Oa and mineral soil horizons) compared to the natural wetland, suggesting enhanced decomposition and incorporation of microbially-derived inputs into stable SOC pools. Root C concentration decreased with soil depth, while root C-13 signature became enriched with soil depth. In the litter and Oe horizon of the natural wetland, MBC was higher and C-13 of MBC and SOC was enriched in hummocks compared to hollows. The C-13 of MBC and SOC tended to be enriched in upper soil horizons and depleted in lower soil horizons, particularly in the managed wetland. We conclude that drainage of these coastal wetlands has enhanced the breakdown of previously stabilized C and has the potential to alter regional C storage, feedback to climate warming, and ecosystem response to changing environmental conditions.

AB The effects of ditching of boreal forest land on stream-water quality and quantity was assessed by comparing, over a 4-year-period, the physicochemical properties of the water in two small streams (western Finland), one whose catchment was ditched for forestry halfway through the sampling period and another nearby (control) stream whose catchment was not ditched ('paired catchment method'). While the artificial drainage did not have any significant effect on the hydrograph, it resulted in an increase in the aquatic concentrations of Mn, Ca, Mg, suspended material and alkalinity, a decrease in the concentrations of TOC and H3O+, while for Al and Fe there was a change in control mechanisms. The concentration and control changes after ditching are related to changes in hydrological pathways and to the exposure of both organic (peat) and inorganic (mineral soil) lavers on the ditch slopes.

AB The exact understanding of distribution and natural history is the necessary prerequisite for conservation of the endangered European pond turtle. In this study we examined the distribution and population size of pond turtles in Ljubljansko barje, a bog of European importance (Natura 2000 site, intended to be included into the Convention on Wetlands, the 'Ramsar list'). For doing so, we used different capture and observation methods. Four hundred kilometres of drainage ditches were investigated by foot, fish traps were set at 507 localities, and 171 pond turtles were captured and measured. We conclude that pond turtles are distributed all over Ljubljansko barje, but concentrated in just 18 km(2) (areas of Gmajnice and Draga pri Igu) out of the 170 km(2) total size of Ljubljansko barje. In these two areas reproduction was confirmed. The relative density for Gmajnice was calculated to 16 turtles per square kilometre, which is lower than in Draga pri Igu, with a minimum of 57 turtles per square kilometre. The main threats for the survival of pond turtles are habitat loss, nest destruction by agriculture, an increase of floods during the past 100 years, inappropriate cleaning out of drainage ditches, and the presence of invasive non-native turtles. To make conservation efforts for the European pond turtle more effective in Ljubljansko barje, we recommend using wire meshes for protecting nests and shifting the cleaning out of ditches to the active period of pond turtles.

AB In the last century, Stratiotes aloides L. (Water Soldier) has declined considerably in the Netherlands. The species has disappeared almost completely from the littoral zones of the shallow peaty lakes it once occupied, and at present it is still abundant in ditches in nature reserves and in some agricultural areas. Originally Stratiotes aloides is a species from moderately nutrient rich and moderately alkaline waters. In large parts of the Netherlands, hydrological conditions have changed considerably owing to intensified human activities. In most peaty lowlands, water quality has been influenced not only by direct eutrophication but also by the inlet of water from the rivers Rhine and Meuse, which is characterized by a high alkalinity and relatively high sulphate levels. Additionally seepage of groundwater has strongly declined, resulting in decreased iron inputs in these aquatic systems. Increased sulphate reduction rates result in the immobilisation of iron as iron sulphide and in the generation of alkalinity. As a result phosphate is liberated from iron phosphate complexes and the decomposition of organic matter is accelerated (internal eutrophication). Next, dissolved iron levels decrease strongly while toxic sulphide accumulates in sediment pore water. As a result, iron deficiency, sulphide toxicity, ammonium toxicity and increased competition by nonrooting species have al been observed to affect Stratiotes aloides vegetation. We conclude that sulphate is the master variable in the decline of S. aloides in the Netherlands.

TI SIZE DEPENDENCE OF PARAMETERS FOR ECOLOGICAL FACTORS AND FOR NATURE
   CONSERVATION EVALUATION OF GRASSLAND RELEVES
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In the interpretation of vegetation data originating from releves (e.g. quadrats sensu Braun-Blanquet) which differ in size, it is important to known how substantial the size effect may be.  This effect may be influenced by the score of parameters based on the composition of the vegetation, e.g. those indicating ecological factors (trophic state, type of land use) and the score of evaluation parameters (nature conservation value).  Susceptibility to the size of the releve may provide a criterion for parameter choice.
   In order to investigate the size dependence of some parameters for grassland vegetation, releves were made on grassland (100-500 m2) and the adjacent ditch banks (25-75 m2).  The study was performed in the peat polder district of the province of South Holland.
   Parameters for ecological factors scarcely showed any size dependence while parameters for nature conservation evaluation did.  However, in order to lessen the size dependence of the latter, an evaluation parameter was designed which seemed to exclude size-dependence.  The precision of ecological factor parameters and evaluation parameters did not differ substantially.  The results of the field and ditch bank vegetation were fairly similar.

AB One of the main factors causing biodiversity loss in wetlands is drainage, nevertheless, even drained areas may provide habitat for aquatic fauna in the form of drainage ditches. Assemblages in ditches are regularly disturbed by ditch maintenance, but the extent of these disturbances and mitigation possibilities are poorly documented. We conducted an experimental study in three commercially managed forest plots in eastern Estonia, aiming to find out how ditch network maintenance (DNM) affects the diversity and assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates in ditches and remnant pools, and whether this effect can be alleviated by constructing mitigation waterbodies. For comparison we also collected data from natural pools in three undrained forest plots. Before DNM, ditches supported greater number of higher taxa compared to remnant and natural pools and more strictly aquatic taxa, whereas natural pools in undrained plots supported more Trichoptera shredders. After DNM, the diversity in remnant pools decreased. Moreover, majority of the pools dried out, which resulted in further reduction of the richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates. In ditches the diversity dropped immediately after DNM, but recovered in two to three years. Nevertheless, plot-scale richness and abundance did not completely recover. Assemblage shift in ditches took place right after DNM and remained distinct after the four year survey period. Mitigation pools provided habitat for several taxa (especially Odonata) uncommon in other waterbodies in drained and undrained plots. Our results show that DNM in forests substantially impoverishes habitat availability and reduces the abundance and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates. We recommend retaining uncleaned sections in ditches and constructing mitigation pools as tools for supporting wetland biodiversity in drained forests.

AB 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Stachys palustris (Marsh Woundwort) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.
   2. Stachys palustris is a monoecious perennial herb, with long creeping, strong, subsurface rhizomes. It is a common native herb growing by streams, rivers, ditches, ponds, in fens, marshes and swamps, and less frequently a weed of cultivated land.
   3. Although widespread throughout most of the British Isles, S. palustris is typically a plant of land water transitional situations that are not seral and, as such, appears to be under-represented in descriptions of plant communities.
   4. Stachys palustris is typically found on intermittently flooded and poorly drained soils, which are weakly acid or weakly basic and highly fertile.
   5. The production of numerous subsurface rhizomes by S. palustris helps to maintain shoot population density with little recourse to seedling recruitment.
   6. Stachys x ambigua, the hybrid between Stachys palustris and S. sylvatica, is most frequent in northern and western Britain.
   7. Stachys palustris is particularly valuable as a nectar source for insects, especially bumblebees. It has antispasmodic, antiseptic and astringent properties; the name 'Woundwort' derives from its traditional use in staunching bleeding and healing wounds.

AB Degradation of dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol in slurries prepared from sediments of minerotrophic peatland ditches were studied under various conditions, Maximal aerobic dimethyl sulfide-degrading capacities (4.95 nmol per mi of sediment slurry . h(-1)), measured in bottles shaken under an air atmosphere, were 10-fold higher than the maximal anaerobic degrading capacities determined from bottles shaken under N-2 or H-2 atmosphere (0.37 and 0.32 nmol per mi of sediment slurry h(-1), respectively). Incubations under experimental conditions which mimic the in situ conditions (i.e., not shaken and with an air headspace), however, revealed that aerobic degradation of dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol in freshwater sediments is low due to oxygen limitation. Inhibition studies with bromoethanesulfonic acid and sodium tungstate demonstrated that the degradation of dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol in these incubations originated mainly from methanogenic activity. prolonged incubation under a H-2 atmosphere resulted in lower dimethyl sulfide degradation rates. Kinetic analysis of the data resulted in apparent K-m values (6 to 8 mu M) for aerobic dimethyl sulfide degradation which are comparable to those reported for Thiobacillus spp., Hhyphomicrobium spp., and other methylotrophs. Apparent K-m values determined for anaerobic degradation of dimethyl sulfide (3 to 8 mu M) were of the same order of magnitude. The low apparent K-m values obtained explain the low dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol concentrations in freshwater sediments that we reported previously. Our observations point to methanogenesis as the major mechanism of dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol consumption in freshwater sediments.

AB Vegetated agricultural ditches play an important role in mitigation of pesticides following irrigation and storm runoff events. In a simulated runoff event in the Mississippi (USA) Delta, the mitigation capacity of a drainage ditch using the pyrethroid esfenvalerate (Asana XL(TM)) was evaluated. The pesticide was amended to soil prior to the runoff event to simulate actual runoff, ensuring the presence of esfenvalerate in both water and suspended particulate phases. Water, sediment, and plant samples were collected temporally and spatially along the drainage ditch. Even with mixing of the pesticide with soil before application, approximately 99% of measured esfenvalerate was associated with ditch vegetation (Ludwigia peploides, Polygonum amphibium, and Leersia oryzoides) three hours following event initiation. This trend continued for the 112 d study duration. Simple modeling results also suggest that aqueous concentrations of esfenvalerate could be mitigated to 0.1% of the initial exposure concentration within 510 m of a vegetated ditch. Observed field half-lives in water, sediment, and plant were 0.12 d, 9 d, and 1.3 d, respectively. These results validate the role vegetation plays in the mitigation of pesticides, and that ditches are an indispensable component of the agricultural production landscape.

AB The aim of this paper is to describe a conceptual classification model for Sustainable Flood Retention Basins (SFRB) used to control runoff in temperate climates. The author has defined a SFRB as an aesthetically pleasing (from the general publics' point of view) retention basin, predominantly used for flood protection and adhering to sustainable drainage and best management practices. The classification model concept was developed on the basis of an example database of 147 SFRB in Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany). The data were of high quality because the researchers had detailed local knowledge of the case study area. The model quality was improved on the basis of a more detailed case study of The Kaiserstuhl, a region (no clearly defined boundaries) with a very high density of flood retention basins (one SFRB per 2 km(2); 51 sites in total). The model is based on an agglomerative cluster analysis and is intended to be used by landscape planners, environmental engineers, and environmental scientists to adequately classify the following different types of SFRB with the purpose of improving communication among stakeholders: Hydraulic Flood Retention Basin, Traditional Flood Retention Basin, Sustainable Flood Retention Wetland, Aesthetic Flood Retention Wetland, Integrated Flood Retention Wetland, and Natural Flood Retention Wetland. Despite the limited regional variation in flood retention basin characteristics within The Kaiserstuhl, the classification model example had an accuracy of 60 percent. A scoring template for the classification of future SFRB was devised on the basis of researcher experience, and this was optimized with a genetic algorithm.

AB Drainage ditches are ubiquitous yet understudied features of the agricultural landscape. Nitrogen pollution disrupts the nutrient balance of drainage ditch ecosystems, as well as the waterbodies in which they drain. Denitrification can help ameliorate the impact of N-fertilization by converting reactive nitrogen into dinitrogen gas. However, factors affecting denitrification in drainage ditches are still poorly understood. In this study, we tested how within-ditch and regional environmental conditions affect denitrifier activity, abundance, and community structure, to understand controls on denitrification at multiple scales. To this end, we quantified in situ denitrification rates and denitrifier abundance in 13 drainage ditches characterized by different types of sediment, vegetation and land-use. We determined how denitrification rates relate to denitrifier abundance and community structure, using the presence of nirS, nirK and nosZ genes as a proxy. Denitrification rates varied widely between the ditches, ranging from 0.006 to 24 mmol N m(-2) h(-1). Ditches covered by duckweed, which contained high nitrate concentrations and had fine, sandy sediments, were denitrification hotspots. We found highest rates in ditches next to arable land, followed by those in grasslands; lowest rates were observed in peatlands and nature reserves. Denitrification correlated to nitrate concentrations, but not to nirK, nirS and nosZ abundance, whereas denitrifier-gene abundance correlated to organic matter content of the sediment, but not to nitrate concentrations. Our results show a mismatch in denitrification regulators at its different organizational scales. Denitrifier abundance is mostly regulated at within-ditch scales, whereas N-loads, regulated by landscape factors, are most important determinants of instantaneous denitrification rates.

AB 1. A fertilization experiment was performed to identify the limiting nutrient for the growth of submerged vegetation in ditches of a peat-grassland system in the Netherlands, in which restoration measures involved ceasing fertilization, exporting nutrients by removal of above-ground plant mass and large-scale introduction of calcium-rich, nutrient-poor artesian water.
   2. Growth of Elodea was significantly enhanced by enrichment with nitrogen alone, and by fertilization with nitrogen in combination with phosphorus, and by nitrogen in combination with phosphorus and potassium.
   3. Plant tissue nutrient concentrations increased significantly, for nitrogen by enrichment with nitrogen alone, and with nitrogen in combination with phosphorus and potassium; for phosphorus by enrichment with phosphorus alone and with phosphorus in combination with nitrogen and potassium; tissue concentrations of potassium were not enhanced by any treatment.
   4. The elemental ratios of treated plants indicated that nitrogen, rather than phosphorus, was limiting in all treatments, except in those involving nitrogen and NK enrichment (when phosphorus was limiting).
   5. The efficiency with which plants used nutrients declined with increased supply of nitrogen and phosphorus, but was unchanged when potassium was increased. Efficiencies were similar to those of other aquatic macrophytes.

AB Palynofacies' analysis was developed for petroleum exploration, but it is now commonly used to differentiate the major constituents of the sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in Postglacial deposits. Our work aimed at studying the SOM distribution in a present wetland of the Seine estuary (Vernier Marsh) in order to provide comparative elements to interpret the composition of SOM in the Lower Seine Valley alluvial infilling. In the Vemier Marsh, the distribution of major constituents is heterogeneous. Thus, for each depositional environment studied (soils, drainage ditches, channels, ponds), the composition of SOM has been characterized by using two ternary diagrams ("Amorphous OM/Preserved Phytoclasts/Transformed Phytoclasts" and "Opaque/ Amorphous/Gelified Particles"; OP/AP/GP). This approach allowed us to define four optical indices that can be used to estimate the relative abundances of principal organic fractions in mixed deposits based on the origin of SOM (aquatic/terrestrial), its source areas (vegetation, soils, river), and controls of early diagenetic changes (aerobic/anaerobic conditions, advanced oxidation). "Amorphous OM contents" increase from terrestrial environments to fluvial deposits and evaluate the abundance of planktonic contribution. "Preserved /transformed phytoclasts ratio" decreases from sites of production to those of deposition indicating the degree of degradation of terrestrial materials. "OP contents" allow one to define fluvial (high values) and palustrine (low values) environments. "GP/AP ratio" allows one to discern soil (low values) and plant (high values) supplied areas. Finally, these optical compositional indices are measured in Holocene deposits and used to complete palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Small-scale landscape elements, such as ditch banks are an important remaining source of biodiversity in many agricultural landscapes, including the Western Peat District in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, plant species richness is declining even in these habitats. To understand the factors threatening biodiversity, we studied demographic traits (occupancy, trend, colonisation and extinction) for a large number of plant species, in a 25-year long data set. We developed a method to investigate the relative importance of colonisation and extinction for species increase and decrease in multi-species assemblages. We show that colonisation has been more important for determining species trends than extinction. Decreasing species were small and characterised by low nutrient tolerance and high light requirements, indicating that competitive. ability influences species trends. The mechanism by which high nutrient levels reduce plant diversity appears to be closely related to colonisation (germination and seedling establishment). Local management should therefore continue to focus on nutrient reduction and the creation of regeneration sites. Yet, these measures will be insufficient for restoring species richness since isolation also hampers species increase. Therefore, to maximise the effects of local management, additional regional management solutions are required to improve seed dispersal for example, from nature reserves.

AB The Rozprza stronghold functioned as a seat of a noble family since at least the early14th century AD in the form of the motte-and-bailey residence. The remains of the residence are situated in the central part of mid-Luci#a River valley, on the river terrace remnant adjoining a strongly expanding floodplain. The situation and state of preservation give a unique opportunity to conduct research that explain the construction process, detailed history of the medieval moat and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the valley floor. Radiocarbon and dendrochronological dating and analysis of artefacts confirmed 14th century age of the moat. Organic deposits (gyttja, peat and organic mud) of moat fill allowed for a set of multiproxy analyses based on sediment cores. The research results indicate shallow water with brief episodes of in-wash in the first stage (13th-14th c. AD), followed by a transformation into telmatic habitat in the second phase of the moat development from 16th-17th c. AD. The deposition of overbank alluvium took place within the moat ditch system as late as the 18th and/or 19th c. AD. We studied the development of this moat environment in the context of valley floor changes.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the historical change in sedimentation rates in lakes that have been impacted by river regulation and agricultural activities in the Ishikari River floodplain. We dated sediment cores using caesium-137 (Cs-137) dating and tephrochronology, and we estimated sediment sources from Cs-137 concentrations in the topsoil of representative land covers. We found that, between 1739 and 1963, the distance between the lake and the main river channel and whether or not the lake was connected to the river affected the sedimentation rates. After 1963, agricultural drainage systems were established in the Ishikari River floodplain. The average sedimentation rate before and after the construction of drainage ditches varied between 1-66 and 87-301 mg cm(-2) a(-1), respectively. The increase in the sedimentation rate after 1963 was caused by the construction of a number of drainage networks, as well as extensive cultivation activity and/or fragmentation of the swamp buffers surrounding the lakes. The Cs-137 activities at the surfaces of the lake as well as the catchment-derived Cs-137 contributions and Cs-137 inventory in the lake profiles were used to examine the sediment influx from the various drainage areas after the establishment of the drainage system. Our results indicate that the majority of the lake sediments were derived from cultivated areas, and therefore the catchment-derived Cs-137 contribution in the lakes was strongly correlated with the sedimentation rate. The Cs-137 inventory across all of the lake profiles was also significantly greater than the atmospheric fallout. We identified a negative correlation between the Cs-137 lake profile inventory and the sedimentation rate. This is because the sediment originating from the drainage areas contained low Cs-137 concentrations, which diluted the overall concentration of Cs-137 in the lake sediment.

AB 1. Chalk stream floodplains are extensively managed and the high degree of connectivity associated with water meadows has been severely reduced. The main contributor to aquatic biodiversity is perceived to be the river itself. Ditches in these areas have been largely ignored as a contributor to total diversity.
   2. Separate surveys of instream, bankside and ditch macroinvertebrates in a small area of floodplain provided a unique opportunity to assess the relative contribution of each locality to total aquatic diversity. The fauna and flora of a ditch on the lower River Frome floodplain was examined and compared with studies of adjacent bankside and instream habitat. A total of 145 macroinvertebrate taxa and 61 plant species were recorded from the ditch. Faunal abundance and richness were positively related to the diversity of aquatic plants. The ditch showed a clear linear trend in community type that appeared to be partly related to the acidic seepage from tertiary deposits at the source and percentage cover of vegetation.
   3. There were large differences in the numbers of taxa collected in ditch, bankside, instream mesohabitat and RIVPACS surveys. Of the total 202 taxa recorded in the four surveys, the ditch contributed 59 unique taxa with 25 from the bankside and two and three from the mesohabitat and RIVPACS surveys, respectively.
   4. The large contribution of the Rushton Ditch to aquatic biodiversity on the floodplain is due to three main factors: the chemically different and slow-flowing environment, the connection to the main river, and a management regime which has halted hydroseral succession at a point where vegetation structure is for the most part open and able to support a wide range of ecological niches. The maintenance of these conditions requires sensitive management and further knowledge of the needs and interactions of faunal communities with vegetation. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The accumulation of phosphorus (P) in the bottom sediment of field drainage ditches poses a threat to the ecology both of the ditch water and downstream water courses. We investigated the amounts, forms and internal loading of sediment-bound P along two drainage ditches that regulate water levels in a basin fen (similar to 200 ha) supporting a mixture of restored wetland and drained agricultural fields. Water levels in the Lady's Drove Rhyne are currently managed to enhance the biodiversity of the wetland (Catcott Lows Reserve - an area formerly cultivated for arable crop production); whereas, the East Ditch is managed to drain adjoining land that remains under arable and livestock production.
   Laboratory-based chemical fractionation schemes were used to characterise the forms and potential mobility of the sediment-bound P. whilst pore-water equilibrators were employed in situ to evaluate the diffusive flux of P through the sediment-water column, and to characterise the corresponding redox conditions. Along both ditches, sediment pore-water profiles indicated conditions ranging from weakly to very reducing conditions with increasing depth, and net fluxes of P from the sediment to overlying water. P flux values ranged from 033 to 1.30 mg m(-2) day(-1). Both the degree of P saturation (DPS) of the sediment and NaOH extractable (Fe/Al-bound) P correlated significantly (P<0.05) with P flux. Both in the wetland and agricultural ditches, by far the highest values for P flux were recorded at sites closest to points of drainage water entry from the corresponding, adjoining land. Although the P flux data were obtained from only a single sampling event, this study highlights the contribution of historical as well as ongoing agricultural land use on the sustained elevated P status of ditch sediments in lowland catchments.

AB QuestionsCan drainage ditches in agricultural marsh grassland provide a suitable habitat for the persistence of fen meadow species? How does the ditch margin vegetation develop as a function of regular dredging? Is ornithologically oriented management also beneficial for plant biodiversity?
   LocationRiparian marshes, Eider-Treene-Sorge lowland, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.
   MethodsWe performed vegetation surveys of drainage ditches along with their water body, slope and margin structures annually for 3years. The data were analysed with respect to date and means of ditch dredging. In addition, we recorded vegetation of the surrounding agricultural grassland, measured nutrient status of the soil and the water body and sampled seed bank of the ditch slopes. We used ANOVA and multivariate methods to describe the development of the ditch vegetation and the persistence of target meadow species.
   ResultsVegetation re-development of ditch margins proceeds quite rapidly after disturbance from dredging. Dominance of mudbank species was observed only in the first year, followed by an increase of reed species and reduction of phytodiversity. Target species of wet meadow communities reach highest abundance in the second and third year and build a significant seed bank before being suppressed by reeds.
   ConclusionsIn heavily eutrophicated, intensively used marsh grassland, regularly disturbed ditch margins are important secondary habitats for pioneer and subdominant wetland species, which have nearly disappeared in a larger area. Current management cycles of ditch dredging every 3-4years comply with the successional development, allowing the mudbank and wet meadow species to persist in the vegetation and seed bank. In contrast to the frequency, the form of dredging (ditch profile), which is crucial for bird protection, plays a minor role for plants. We recommend moderate disturbance (mowing of ditch margins) to suppress strong competitors in the years between dredging for additional support to target plant species.

   extinction; common land; Cambridge
AB Historical and contemporary records have been used to assess the impact of urbanisation on the aquatic plants of the River Cam and its narrow floodplain in Cambridge. Of the 62 native aquatic plant species which have been recorded in the study area since 1660, 40 (65%) were still present in the period 1985-1999 whereas 22 (35%) are apparently extinct. There is a striking relationship between the fate of species and their trophic requirements, with species of less eutrophic habitats having suffered disproportionately. Historical records demonstrate that the River Cam became grossly polluted by sewage from Cambridge in the 19th century, but the chemical and biological quality of the river improved from 1897 onwards. However, the majority of the species recorded from the river and nearby ditches persisted until after maximum incidence of sewage pollution, which may even have stimulated the growth of 'weed' in the river. Losses of aquatic plant species from two riparian commons, Coe Fen (35%) and Sheep's Green (50%), have been particularly great. The level of these and other areas of low-lying common land by the river has been systematically raised by the controlled tipping of waste in hollows, followed by levelling and resowing. The main effects of urbanisation on the flora therefore arose from the transformation of riparian pastures into suburban open spaces. Commons which are used purely for amenity purposes have lost almost all their aquatic plant species. Those which are still grazed retain more, and continuance of grazing is probably essential if a varied aquatic flora is to be maintained. The interpretation of botanical records in terms of recorded management history is likely to throw further light on the processes of urbanisation, although the number of sites with a sufficiently detailed botanical record may be limited.

AB The Ruoergai Swamp (Zoige) at the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western China is the world's largest plateau peat wetland. Rapid shrinkage of the swamp since the 1950s has endangered the local terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the water supply of the upper Yellow River. The causes of the swamp shrinkage were evaluated based upon field investigations in 2011-2013 and analyses of remote sensing images and meteorological and hydrological data. Although a slight rise in the temperature was evident, there was no obvious decrease in the precipitation, indicating that climate change was not the primary cause of the recent swamp shrinkage. Remote sensing images indicated that roughly 920 km of artificial ditches excavated from the 1960s to 1990s have affected around 648 km(2) of swamp, accounting for 27% of the total shrinkage area (approximately 2400 km(2)). Bed incision of the upper Yellow River was considered to be the primary cause for the long-term degradation of the Ruoergai Swamp. Ensuing headcut erosion of countless tributaries has induced drainage network extension, draining large areas of the swamp and lowering the groundwater levels. Headcut erosion and construction of the artificial channels have markedly increased the flow and sediment movement in this landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water managers, policy makers, and farmers need tools to estimate the impact of water management on agricultural yields, economic benefits, and environmental effects to be able to make strategic and operational decisions. Historically, relationships between groundwater level and crop yields were used to calculate the reductions in crop yield due to suboptimal water status of fields. Nowadays, state-of-the-art deterministic models for water flow and crop production can be coupled to simulate the effects of changing water management. For dairy farms, an integral management model has been developed and applied to simulate decisions on grazing and cutting, and calculate farm economics. Soil physical conditions, crop yields, and farm management are simulated for a number of years, based on daily weather data. For a dairy farm in a peat district in the central part of The Netherlands, a rise of the ditch water level from 60 till 40 cm below the soil surface resulted in wetter conditions in the topsoil and a lower bearing capacity; a reduction of 0.8 tonnes/ha grass production and EUR222 ha(-1) lower economic benefit. Higher ditch water levels increase also the variation in farm economic results between years, and thus lead to higher economic risks for the farmers. Increased phosphorous leaching to surface waters is another risk when ditch water levels are raised. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Small mammals were sampled in woodlands, grasslands, and croplands in the Lake Wilson region of north-central Kansas during June 1985 through December 1986. The 11 types of habitats studied were three woodlands (cottonwood, planted plum-cedar, and plum thicket), four grasslands (grazed mixed-grass prairie, ungrazed mixed-grass prairie, planted grass, and roadside ditch), and four croplands (yellow clover, fallow field, wheat field, and hay field). Of lj species captured, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and white-footed mouse (P. leucopus) were the most abundant followed by thr hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) western harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis), Elliot's short-tailed shrew (Blarina hylophaga), Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii), eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), hispid pocket mouse (Chaetodipus hispidus), house mouse (Mus musculus), northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), southern bog lemming (Synaptomys cooperi), plains harvest mouse (R. montanus), thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecamlineatus), and least shrew (Cryptotis parva). The 11 most abundant species were distributed nonrandomly among the 11 habitats studied. In addition, these 11 species with the exception of the cotton rat were distributed nonrandomly among the three general habitat types of woodland, grassland, and cropland. The general patterns observed were positive associations of white-footed mice and eastern woodrats to woodlands: northern grasshopper mice and house mice to croplands; deer mice, prairie voles, western harl est mice, and hispid Docket mice to grasslands and croplands: cotton rats to habitats with lush vegetation (planted plum-cedar, planted gr ass, and yellow clover); short-tailed shrews to habitats with well-developed plant litter layers (roadside ditches, plum thickets, and yellow clover); and Ord's kangaroo rats to habitats with sandy soil (planted plum-cedar and wheat fields). Consistent with these species differences, the composition of assemblages of small mammals differed significantly among the 11 habitats.

AB Drainage ditches play an important role in maintenance of plant species diversity. We investigated plant species composition and diversity, and soil and water chemical properties in drainage ditches in the Hetao Irrigation Region of northern China. We compared species composition similarity within the same and among different drainage areas, and compared diversity of plant species, among different ditch sizes and slope positions. We identified a total of 70 plant species, which belonged to 64 genera and 30 families in the drainage ditch. The most frequent family was Compositae representing 15.7% of the total flora; Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud was the most widespread species with a frequency of more than 60% in all plots. The highest similarity values occurred in lateral ditches within the same drainage areas, and in main ditches among different drainage areas. The coefficient of variation of total salt in soil was closely related to species similarity in all ditches. Ditch size and position were significantly correlated with the indexes of species diversity. Higher plant -diversity occurred in smaller ditches and tended to be the highest at the transition zone and on the slope of the ditches. The response of species composition and diversity to environmental factors was significant for saline concentrations. Reducing the current water and soil saline contents, while maintaining current slope soil nitrogen content was suggested as an optimal way of maintaining high species diversity.

AB The effect of burning piles of slash on a Norway spruce clear-cut in southern Sweden was followed for 3 years. The vegetation cover, soil chemistry, soil water at a depth of 30 - 40 cm and runoff water were studied. The burnt plots were without vegetation for several months after burning, while the control plots were almost totally covered by Deschampsia flexuosa and Galium saxatile. The remaining mor horizon of the burnt plots had a pH of 6 compared with pH 4.4 in the control plots. This caused more intense nitrification of the burnt plots that, in turn, caused an acid push with high concentrations of hydrogen ions, nitrate and potassium in the soil water. After 1 year, a cover of D. flexuosa and G. saxatile had also developed on the burnt plots, and the soil water chemistry no longer indicated an elevated leakage of ions. Throughout the study period, no leaching effect was observed in the runoff water. This was explained by nutrient retention of a swamp forest with Betula pubescens on peat soil, surrounding the ditch collecting the runoff water. The increased risk of developing a nutrient imbalance in the next forest generation may strongly outweigh the short-term benefit of reduced competition between tree seedlings and forest floor vegetation, especially if the slash burning is not expected to be of any value for species conservation.

Seven species originate from North America, one from Southeast Europe and one from East Europe/Asia. Currently, at least seven species have well-established populations. Five species are listed as invasive alien species (IAS) of European Union (EU) concern (i.e. Faxonius limosus, Faxonius virilis, Pacifastacus leniusculus, Procambarus clarkii and Procambarus virginalis). All crayfish species of EU concern are subject to restrictions on keeping, transportation, importing, selling and breeding. Member States are required to take action on pathways of unintentional introduction, to perform measures for early detection and rapid eradication of these species, and to manage species that are already widely spread. The impact of these IAS on biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems mainly results from transmission of the crayfish plague pathogen Aphanomyces astaci, predation on native fauna, and fragmentation and consumption of aquatic plants. Moreover, burrowing activities of some IAS cause bank instability, increase risk of dike breaches in peatland areas and enhance sedimentation rates in ditches and canals. First-line risk assessments for the Rhine-Meuse river district with the Harmonia(+) scheme shows that seven crayfish species have a high risk of impact on biodiversity, water safety and ecological status of water bodies. Four species have already established populations in this area of concern. The risk of spread via interconnected rivers, canals and small watercourses is high for all species of North American origin. Eradication of alien crayfish populations in an extensive and open network of interconnected watercourses is not feasible. Six management strategies for control of alien crayfish species were formulated. These strategies were assessed using various criteria for cost-effectivity and subsequently prioritized using an unweighted Multi Criteria Analysis. Feasible strategies for population control of invasive crayfish species combine a) measures for enhancing robustness and resilience of ecosystems, and b) crayfish trapping by commercial fishermen, water authorities and well-informed citizens.

AB Concentrations of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) were measured in water and sediment columns of ditches in a minerotrophic peatland in The Netherlands. VOSC, with methanethiol (4 to 40 nM) as the major compound, appeared td be mainly of sediment origin. Both VOSC and hydrogen sulfide concentrations decreased dramatically towards the water surface. High methanethiol and high dimethyl sulfide concentrations in the sediment and just above the sediment surface coincided with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (correlation factors, r = 0.91 and r = 0.81, respectively). Production and degradation of VOSC were studied in 32 sediment slurries collected from various freshwater systems in The Netherlands. Maximal endogenous methanethiol production rates of the sediments tested (up to 1.44 mu mol per liter of sediment slurry.day(-1)) were determined after inhibition of methanogenic and sulfate-reducing populations in order to stop VOSC degradation. These experiments showed that the production and degradation of VOSC in sediments are well balanced. Statistical analysis revealed multiple relationships of methanethiol production rates with the combination of methane production rates (indicative of total anaerobic mineralization) and hydrogen sulfide concentrations (r = 0.90) or with the combination of methane production rates and the sulfate/iron ratios in the sediment (r = 0.82). These findings and the observed stimulation of methanethiol formation in sediment slurry incubations in which the hydrogen sulfide concentrations were artificially increased provided strong evidence that the anaerobic methylation of hydrogen sulfide is the main mechanism for VOSC formation in most freshwater systems. Methoxylated aromatic compounds are likely a major source of methyl groups for this methylation of hydrogen sulfide, since they are important degradation products of the abundant biopolymer lignin. Increased sulfate concentrations in several fresh,vater ecosystems caused by the inflow of water from the river Rhine into these systems result in higher hydrogen sulfide concentrations. As a consequence, higher flues of VOSC towards the atmosphere are conceivable.

AB 1. Current monitoring strategies of governmental organizations tend to be focused on relatively large flowing and standing waters, and until recently those polluted by point sources. Consequently areas of high conservation interest tend to be understudied, and defining reference conditions, as required by current legislation, is difficult to achieve.
   2. In order to address this imbalance, water samples have been collected and analysed once in each of four seasons during 2003 from 72 locations within a 100 km(2) area of the oligotrophic River Spey catchment in NE Scotland. The sampling design included examples of running water (headwater streams and the main rivers) and standing water (lochs, lochans, pools, ditches, backwaters, bogs). Attitude ranged from 220 to 980 in and incorporated a climatic regime from cool temperate to subalpine. Each sampling campaign targeted low-flow conditions to evaluate steady-state nutrient concentrations.
   3. Concentrations of the major soluble nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus demonstrated high spatial and temporal variability, with soluble organic and molybdate unreactive forms generally being dominant. Concentrations of ammonium-N, nitrate-N and soluble reactive phosphorus were extremely small, with 50% of samples falling below 8, 5 and 1 mu g L-1, respectively, during spring and summer.
   4. Sampling sites were grouped either by water-body type or by the properties of their immediate biophysical zone. Together these two groupings explained 33-38% of the variance in water chemistry. Certain changes were detectable across most habitats and biophysical zones.
   5. A decline in the concentration of nitrate that occurred in reaches downstream from certain headwater streams draining the mountain areas indicated the potential for its within-stream utilization. Inorganic N dynamics differed between small streams and large rivers.
   6. Landscape scale patterns were recorded in spring and summer nutrient availability with inorganic N and P thresholds (arbitrarily defined) of 10 and 1 mu g L-1, respectively. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peat ponds have been restored widely in the Netherlands to enhance the available habitat for species-rich plant communities that characterize the early succession stages toward land. Colonization success of 33 target aquatic species has been quantified in eight complexes of new ponds. It has been related to the lay-out of these ponds, the structure of the surrounding landscape, (historic) prevalence of source populations within the complex and within a perimeter of 10 km, and pond water quality. Colonization success was variable: between 6 and 26 target species had reached the complexes in 1998. This success was coupled to the first principal component (PC) in a principal component analysis (PCA) explaining 44% of the variation in 27 variables. This first PC correlated with historical perimeter and local within-complex species richness, the number of ponds in the complex, the SW orientation of ditches in these complexes and pH, and transparency of the water. Age of the ponds (1-9 years), area of open water (8-42%), and shoreline density (13-43 km/km2 in the complex) did not contribute significantly to colonization success. Separation of the effect of a species-rich surrounding landscape, the possibility to disperse through that landscape, the spatial lay-out of the complex and transparency of the water were precluded by the strong covariance along the first PC. Probably all three are independently important. It is speculated that diel migration by waterfowl may be responsible for the dispersal of plant propagules to the pond complex, whereas within-complex dispersal to establishment sites is enhanced by wind and water movement.

AB The present study investigates the possible hydrologic effects of the proposed lignite open-cast mining in Drama lignite field (north Greece). Recent years have seen a rapid increase in surface mining. This activity has generated a growing concern for the potential environmental impacts associated with large scale surface mining.
   In order to achieve a safe mine operation and allow extraction of lignite to considerable depths, extensive dewatering by pumping will be necessary, while at the same time it is desirable to avoid presence of overpumping conditions in the broader area. Based on stratigrafic, hydrologic and hydrogeologic data, a three-dimensional finite difference model was developed in order to simulate the dewatering process of the western part of the lignite open-cast mine in Drama and to predict both spatially and temporally the decline of ground water level down to the lignite surface. The dewatering of the part of the aquifer which underlies the mine area will influence the hydrological conditions of the broader region. The most important anticipated effects will be the abandonment of shallow wells as well as the decrease of ground water pumping rates of deep wells. Aquifer discharge towards the ditches of the study area will cease and there will be an inversion of ground water flow from the ditches towards the underlying aquifer. Dewatering activities will probably result in minor subsidence of the nearby peat deposits of Drama Philippi marshes. Moreover, sand pumping as well as the presence of gasses is likely to cause local subsidence phenomena, mainly in the pit slopes. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper the suitability of a buffer strip to reduce nitrate concentrations in the upper groundwater was tested for a sandy arable soil in The Netherlands during two consecutive leaching seasons. The bufferstrip was a 3.5 m wide unfertilised grass strip adjacent to a ditch on an arable field. In total 24 groundwater wells were installed in 4 transects perpendicular to the ditch to determine Cl, NO3 and delta N-15 concentrations. Piezometers were installed to assess the groundwater flow, which was in the direction of the ditch with small downward leakage across a peat layer at about 3 m depth. Nitrogen was dominantly present as nitrate (NO3). The NO3-N concentrations under the bufferstrip were significantly lower than under the adjacent arable field. The lower concentrations were due to dilution, uptake by grass and denitrification. Nitrate was actively removed in the bufferstrip, since the Cl/NO3 ratios were higher in the bufferstrip than in the remainder of the field. Furthermore, delta N-15 data indicated that denitrification occurred in the groundwater and increased with decreasing distance to the ditch. NO3-N loads to the ditch were estimated at 8.5 kg ha(-1)yr(-1), which is relatively low for this area. We can, however, not determine whether these relatively low NO3-N loads were causally related to the reduced NO3-N concentrations in the bufferstrip. Nevertheless, the results of the present study are promising and justify additional research on the efficiency of bufferstrips to reduce NO3 concentrations in shallow groundwater, and subsequently reduce NO3 loading of surface water, under Dutch conditions.

TI New archaeological data on the Deule in Lille: from a IInd century AD
   major erosion event to the urban development of the minor bed
SO REVUE DU NORD
LA French
DT Article
AB Antiquarian observations carried out on the course on the river Deule in Lille often mention Gallo-Roman material associated with river deposits. Recently acquired archaeological data confirm this incidence of forms, at least from the rue du Port down to the rue de Paris. The antique occupation of the banks is illustrated by the discovery of a small building of unknown designation (rue des Tanneurs). In the IInd century AD there occurs in the minor bed a major erosion event, followed in the IIIrd century by the rapid deposition of silt and peat. The causes of these probably local hydrographical changes are hard to make out. The fine sedimentation favoured a detailed palynological recording (rue de la Rivierette) and from this the agro-pastoral transformations that developed between the time of the Late Empire and that of the construetion of the mediaeval walls can be identified and discussed. A modest settlement in the minor bed dates back to the viith century at the Tanneurs. On the same site, the Becquerel bears witness to the first real canal work (XIth century). Not subjected to the topography of the site, the canal constitutes the ex nihilo creation of a hydrographical axis. While mediaeval urbanisation developed, the older course long remained subject to flooding, with deposits of clays silts, and the vicinity was not built upon. The successive systems of fortifications naturally tended to use it as a ditch defence (rue Patou, rue de la Rivierette), while, intra muros, these low and wet plots of land, which are crossed with urban canals, remains long dedicated to crafts (Tanneurs).

AB The Zoige Plateau Wetland, the largest alpine peat wetland in the world, is facing an extreme threat from over-grazing and drainage. For eco-hydrological protection, the influence of drainage on the wetland degradation is very significant. Although several negative impacts of the drainage ditches have been discussed by researchers in many studies, in this paper an Interactive Groundwater (IGW) modeling system is introduced to reproduce the hydrological process of the wetland and explain its degradation mechanism. The Longriba Wetland, a typical component of the Zoige Wetland, was taken as the research site because several wetlands in different degrees of degradation were included.
   Based on an established indicator system, the site was divided into three categories: Wetland Type I with slight degradation, Type II with medium degradation and Type III with heavy degradation. By comparing the simulated groundwater tables with the measured values, the IGW model has proved to be an effective approach to simulating the aquifer characteristics of the study site. The head contour and further seepage simulation of the site showed that drainage ditches have a severe influence on wetland degradation. In the vertical plane, the soil water in the submerged area mainly flows downward, and changes its pattern near the drainage ditches. While in the horizontal plane, soil water continuously flows from the center wetland to the drainage ditches, and then is lost through them. This speeds up the wetland degradation. The bigger and deeper ditches create greater degradation. Therefore, blocking ditches is suggested as a way to preserve the wetland moisture and prevent wetland degradation.

AB Unfertilized buff er strips (BS) are widely accepted to reduce nitrogen (N) loads from agricultural land to surface water. However, the relative reduction of N load or concentration (BS eff ectiveness, BSE), varies with management and local conditions, especially hydrogeology. We present novel experimental evidence on BSE for 5-m-wide grass BS on intensively drained and managed plain agricultural lowland with varying hydrogeology. We selected characteristic sites for fi ve major hydrogeological classes of the Netherlands and installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference (REF) treatments along the ditch. Th e REF was managed like the adjacent fi eld, and BS was only harvested. Treatments were equipped with reservoirs in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and fl ow proportional N concentration for 3 or 4 yr. In addition, N concentration in upper groundwater was measured. We found a statistically signifi cant BSE of 10% on the peat site. At the other sites, BSE for N was low and statistically insignifi cant. Low BSE was explained by denitrifi cation between adjacent fi eld and ditch, as well as by the site-specifi c hydrologic factors including low proportion of shallow groundwater fl ow, downward seepage, low residence time in the BS, and surface runoff away from the ditch. We emphasize that a REF treatment is needed to evaluate BSE in agriculture and recommend reservoirs if drainage patterns are unknown. Introduction of a 5-m-wide BS is ineff ective for mitigating N loads from lowland agriculture to surface waters. We expect more from BS specifi cally designed to abate surface runoff

AB The impact of hydrological manipulation of an unfertilised, Dutch peat grassland area on plant species composition on ditch banks and in ditchwater was studied. The hydrological manipulation involved raising the groundwater level by admitting nutrient-poor, Ca-rich groundwater in one compartment, and by retaining precipitation in another compartment. A third compartment served as control.
   The plant species composition showed significant correlations with the following hydrochemical parameters: in bank Vegetation with K+ concentration, and winter and summer groundwater levels, water depth and elevation; in aquatic vegetation with pH, the concentrations of Cl- organic-C and NH4+ water temperature and elevation.
   The number of terrestrial plant species increased after compartmentation from 97 to 122; 16 submerged and floating species were found. Most 'new' terrestrial species probably emerged in response to cessation of fertilization and biomass removal, since they showed no preference for any compartment. Five species showed preference for the groundwater compartment and two for the rainwater compartment. Of the 'new' terrestrial plants, seven were relatively rare: Carex panicea, C. oederi, C. pallescens, C. vesicaria, Galium uliginosum, Juncus acutiflorus and Stellaria uliginosa. Of the aquatic plants, eight were relatively rare: Chara globularis, two Callitriche spp., four potamogetonaceae and Ranunculus circinatus.
   This study indicates that hydrological manipulation of grassland systems in which fertilisation has ceased has profound effects on the vegetation in the ditches of these systems. Bank vegetation responds more slowly and to other hydrochemical factors than aquatic vegetation. Short-term responses in terms of increase in diversity of vegetation pattern and species richness are promising. Long-term responses are not yet known.

AB Abiotic variability is known to structure lotic invertebrate communities, yet its influence on lentic invertebrates is not clear. This study tests the hypothesis that variability of nutrients and macro-ions are structuring invertebrate communities in agricultural drainage ditches. This was determined by investigating invertebrate adaptations to disturbance using insect life-history strategies. Many low-lying agricultural areas contain drainage ditches which potentially provide suitable habitat for aquatic invertebrates. In the province of North Holland (The Netherlands) the extensive network of eutrophic ditches are hydrologically managed, creating seasonal variability of water quality arising from agricultural run-off and the inlet of mineral rich, river derived water. This temporal variability was analysed from monitoring data, collected over a 7 month period (February till August) and covering 84 ditches in three soil regions; sand, clay and peat. Invertebrate diversity was determined as local (alpha diversity), regional (gamma diversity) and species-turnover (beta diversity). We ran canonical correspondence analysis and linear mixed models to determine correlations between invertebrate diversity, functional community composition and specific abiotic parameters, including variability (expressed as the Median Absolute Deviation). Invertebrate a diversity was positively correlated to variability in water transparency and negatively correlated to average pH, with the two parameters reflecting a water quality gradient in the environment. Insect life-history strategies expressed adaptations to abiotic variability and harsh (eutrophic) conditions. These adaptations were mainly achieved through good dispersal abilities and developmental trade-offs. The results support measures to reduce influxes of excess nutrients to this network of ditches.

AB Drainage ditches are integral components of agricultural production landscape, yet their contaminant mitigation capacity has been scarcely examined. If ditches are indeed capable of contaminant mitigation, then their use may serve as an alternative agricultural best management practice (BMP). A 50 ra portion of an agricultural drainage ditch, located in the Mississippi Delta Management Systems Evaluation Area (MDMSEA), USA, was amended with a mixture of water, atrazine , (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) (herbicide) and lambda-cyhalothrin (lambda -cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate) (insecticide), simulating a storm runoff event. Pesticide amendment was achieved using a diffuser to disperse the mixture at an inflow point along the ditch (designated as "0 m"). Pesticide concentrations in water, sediment, and plants were monitored for 28 days. One hour following initiation of simulated runoff, mean percentages of atrazine concentrations measured in water and sediment were 37 and 2%, respectively, while mean percentages of lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations in water and sediment were 12 and 1%, respectively. Atrazine and lambda-cyhalothrin mean percentage concentrations in plants (Polygonum (water smartweed),Leersia (cutgrass), and Sporobolus (smutgrass)) were 61 and 87%, respectively. Therefore, plants serve as an important site for pesticide sorption during runoff events. Aqueous concentrations of both pesticides decreased to levels which would not elicit non-target toxicological effects by the end of the 50 m portion of the drainage ditch. This research provides fundamental answers concerning the capability of vegetated agricultural drainage ditches to mitigate pesticide-associated storm water runoff. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Acid soil drainage is of major economic concern for the arable crop farmers and fishermen in midwestern Finland. Almost all the farmland in this region consist of acid sulfate soils developed on sulfide-bearing fine-grained marine and lacustrine sediments. During rain storms in autumn and snowmelt in spring these soils are flushed, resulting in low pH and high metal concentrations in affected watercourses. A study of 40 first- and second-order streams during the 1997 autumn high water flow event demonstrated that (1) the pH in peat/till dominated catchments is controlled by organic acids (pH > 4.5), while in streams draining acid sulfate soil pH is controlled by sulfuric acid (4.5 > pH > 3.0); (2) the delta(34)S((sulfate)) values with range of -16 to +7 parts per thousand VCDT show two populations with medians of -6.2 and +3.2 parts per thousand, the first is dominated by original sedimentary sulfide and the second is most likely related to secondary sulfide formation in the acid sulfate soils; (3) the concentrations of Al, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Na, Zn, and SO42- are considerably higher in streamwaters in the investigated area than in headwater streams from the whole country as a result of extensive leaching of the acid sulfate soils; and (4) As, Ba, Cr, Fe, Ph, Sb, and V concentrations are controlled by soil and water pH, dissolved organic matter, and suspended particles and are not like the other trace elements, significantly enriched in the streamwaters.

AB Ecosystems dominated by Chamaeoparis thyoides (Atlantic White Cedar) are critically endangered due to hydrologic alterations associated with ditching, logging, development, and agricultural conversion. Few studies have related structural and functional characteristics of this plant community to water tables, yet hydrologic management options may be critical to establish a peat-based seed refugium and allow Atlantic White Cedar self-maintenance in this ecosystem. In this study, we assessed aboveground forest biomass, litter production, and depth to water table at a mature (60-70 v) and an intermediate (20-35 y) age-class stand in two national wildlife refuges. Alligator River (AR) and Great Dismal Swamp (DS) in North Carolina. We calculated forest biomass from morphometric data gathered within randomized study plots. We made monthly litter collections at each study plot from November 1998 to April 2000: litter was sorted by species and type for the first 112 months. Wells installed at each study plot recorded water-table levels, which were at or near the surface at AR but >30 cm below the soil surface at DS throughout the study. Although Atlantic White Cedar was a dominant species at all sites, community structure differed between refuges. Total aboveground biomass was similar among age classes; however, Atlantic White Cedar stem density was greater and mean diameter at breast height was lower at AR. Mean annual litter production was higher at AR sites for each age class despite a persistently high water table. We conclude that the rates of primary production associated with high water tables at AR represent favorable conditions for Atlantic White Cedar self-maintenance.

AB Wet grasslands are important both for their conservation value and for their important hydrological function. Evaporation is an important component of the water balance of a wetland. Where water is limited rainfall and/or surface (or sub-surface) inflows are required to balance the summer evaporation and thus become a significant factor in the maintenance and environmental health of a wetland. This study presents an almost complete year of measurements of the water and energy balance of a wet grassland in the Somerset Levels in southwest England. The majority of the radiant energy at this site goes into evaporation. There is a strong seasonality of the controls on evaporation; the roughness length varies by a factor of 10 between winter and summer. The surface resistance to evaporation is low, close to zero, during the winter when the water table is at, or just below the surface. In the summer the water table drops to 80 cut below the surface; there is no sign of soil water stress on the evaporation but a clear effect of the senescence of grass during seed head production and of the subsequent harvest. There is clear evidence that water for evaporation is provided by the drainage ditches through sub-surface flow. Standard evaporation formulae-such as the Penman-Monteith equation with constant and standard parameters-provide a reasonable simulation of the total evaporation at this site, although they miss some of the seasonal detail.

AB Four hundred and forty-four ecotypes of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) collected from Poland were screened for rust resistance. A field experiment was established at Hof Steimke, DSV (Deutschen Saatveredelung), Germany. The ecotypes originated fi om the Polish Gene Bank, IHAR - Botanical Garden, Bydgoszcz. Sixty-two (13.9%) ecotypes that scored on average more than 5 were included in a group with high resistance. Ecotypes scored on average less than 5 were either included in a susceptible group (average scores 4.0-4.9) or a very susceptible group (average scores 2.0-3.9). There were 181 ecotypes in the susceptible group (40.8%) and 201 (45.3%) in the very susceptible group. Thirty-three (7.4%) ecotypes were more resistant and 29 (6.5%) ecotypes had resistance on the level of the most resistant control variety Ottos (score of resistance 5.3). Eight ecotypes (1.8%) with the highest level of resistance (score 7 or higher) were identified as especially promising sources of rust resistance. One ecotype (141858) showed reaction type 9 in both years and another one (141903) showed reaction type 9 in one year and reaction type 8 in another year (mean 8.5). Six ecotypes were scored on average 7 or 7.5. For 17 different habitats from which the tested ecotypes were collected only those ecotypes originating from 10 habitats (meadow, peat meadow, forest meadow, pasture, field, lakeside, waterside, ditch, roadside and gravel pit) showed high levels of resistance to rust. The value of newly identified resistant ecotypes for control of rusts on Kentucky bluegrass is discussed.

AB Water tables in the Netherlands have been greatly lowered in recent decades, largely in order to favour agricultural activities. Drought and increased nitrate (NO3-) leaching from agricultural land lead to oxidation of iron-sulphide (FeSx) in the subsoil, resulting in increased sulphate (SO42-) concentrations in the groundwater. In addition, increased atmospheric sulphur (S) deposition and leaching of SO42- from agricultural land have increased SO42- concentrations in the groundwater. Attempts to retain groundwater in desiccated wetlands by simply damming drainage ditches have resulted in greatly increased retention times of the water, die-back of the original vegetation and massive development of algae and lemnids in summer. In order to determine whether stagnation of SO42--rich groundwater plays an important role in eutrophication, nine bottomless enclosures were placed in the sediment of an open water body to block the supply of groundwater. Na2SO4 was added to three enclosures twice a year to simulate a minimised input of SO42--rich groundwater. In addition NaCl was added to three enclosures, while three enclosures were left untreated. (Pore) water quality and vegetation development were compared with those at seepage-fed sites outside the enclosures. The results show that stagnating SO42--rich groundwater led to increased SO42- reduction in the sediment, resulting in phosphate (o-PO43-) mobilisation from the sediment and eutrophication of the water layer, due to the interference of S2- with the iron-phosphorous cycle. This was accompanied by massive growth of common duckweed (Lemna minor) and filamentous algae and a decreased growth of broad-leaved pondweed (Potamogeton natans). The consistently high input of SO(4)2- via seepage did not lead to eutrophication. The results indicated that SO42- reduction rates at sites fed by seepage were very low. This was probably caused by the consistently high input of Fe and NO3- via the groundwater, which prevents reduction of SO42- by providing energetically more favourable electron acceptors. In fens with stagnating groundwater, Fe and NO3- will be rapidly depleted, stimulating SO42- reduction resulting in development of toxic S2- concentrations and eutrophication of the water layer.

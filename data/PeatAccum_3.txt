AB Complex of Nature reservation Zbytka is the rest of various fen vegetation in the northeast part of the Czech Republic. It represents an important spring area which provides high quality potable water for more than 150 000 inhabitants. Waterworks utilization was started in the 1960s and the change of land-use practices has had a strong effect on the ecosystem. Oak chronology has been showing different tree growth trends since the start of the waterworks utilization. Also the occurrences of negative pointer years differ markedly before and after initiation of pumping underground water. Dendroclimatological analyses primarily revealed a close relationship between the temperature and tree growth - positive influence of spring and summer temperature. The period 1983-1992 of maximum artesian water pumping is expressed as higher tree-ring increments, but linear model analyses showed that the growth reaction of oak is not due to simple causality between temperature and under-ground water level. The radial increments reacted positively to the combination of high temperature during the vegetation season and low or, the contrary, high depth of underground water level. No direct relationship was detected between tree growth and fluctuation of underground water level; despite of the results dendrochronological data may be useful in historical ground water modelling studies. Results are also crucial for conflict of interests between nature preservation and potable water supply.

AB To select grassland sites for successful botanical restoration, it is essential that there is both a biological (a species pool) and an environmental potential (suitable conditions for the species to establish). Our aim was to identify indicators of the environmental potential of botanical quality measured independently of the species composition of the vegetation. Data were collected on numerous sward, soil, and grassland management variables at 20 Danish low-lying grasslands managed under different intensities. Top soil from each site was bioassayed with oat (Avena saliva L.) as a phytometer. Correlation analyses were used to examine relationships among variables and groups of variables. Indicators independent of species composition of the vegetation related to high or low botanical nature quality were identified. Indicators for high potential nature quality were the K/P ratio in the sward and K concentration in bioassay plants. Indicators for low potential nature quality were dry matter (DM) production, feed units and P-concentration of the sward; dry weight, shoot number and leaf length in bioassay; potential N mineralisation rate and amount of mineral N in the soil in spring. We concluded that a combination of indicators was preferable to only one indicator, as botanical nature quality is influenced in a multi-factorial way. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands are an integral part of the global carbon cycle-a strong sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide and source of methane. Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are thought to strongly impact these environments, and yet, peatlands are not routinely included in Earth system models. Here we present a quantification of the sink and stock of northern peat carbon from the last glacial period through the pre-industrial period. Additional data and new algorithms for reconstructing the history of peat carbon accumulation and the timing of peatland initiation increased the estimate of total northern peat carbon stocks from 545 Gt to 1,055 Gt of carbon. Further, the post-glacial increases in peatland initiation rate and carbon accumulation rate are more abrupt than previously reported. Peatlands have been a strong carbon sink throughout the Holocene, but the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been relatively stable over this period. While processes such as permafrost thaw and coral reef development probably contributed some additional carbon to the atmosphere, we suggest that deep ocean upwelling was the most important mechanism for balancing the peatland sink and maintaining the observed stability.

AB While boreal lowland bogs have been extensively studied using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique, less knowledge exists on mountainous peatlands. Hence, half-hourly CO2 fluxes of an ombrotrophic peat bog in the Harz Mountains, Germany, were measured with the EC technique during a growing season with exceptionally dry weather spells. A common biophysical process model for net ecosystem exchange was used to describe measured CO2 fluxes and to fill data gaps. Model parameters and uncertainties were estimated by robust inverse modelling in a Bayesian framework using a population-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. The focus of this study was on the correct statistical description of error, i.e. the differences between the measured and simulated carbon fluxes, and the influence of distributional assumptions on parameter estimates, cumulative carbon fluxes, and uncertainties. We tested the Gaussian, Laplace, and Student's t distribution as error models. The t-distribution was identified as best error model by the deviance information criterion. Its use led to markedly different parameter estimates, a reduction of parameter uncertainty by about 40%, and, most importantly, to a 5% higher estimated cumulative CO2 uptake as compared to the commonly assumed Gaussian error distribution. As open-path measurement systems have larger measurement error at high humidity, the standard deviation of the error was modeled as a function of measured vapor pressure deficit. Overall, this paper demonstrates the importance of critically assessing the influence of distributional assumptions on estimated model parameters and cumulative carbon fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere.

AB Perennial pools are common natural features of peatlands, and their hydrological functioning and turnover may be important for carbon fluxes, aquatic ecology, and downstream water quality. Peatland restoration methods such as ditch blocking result in many new pools. However, little is known about the hydrological function of either pool type. We monitored six natural and six artificial pools on a Scottish blanket peatland. Pool water levels were more variable in all seasons in artificial pools having greater water level increases and faster recession responses to storms than natural pools. Pools overflowed by a median of 9 and 54 times pool volume per year for natural and artificial pools, respectively, but this varied widely because some large pools had small upslope catchments and vice versa. Mean peat water-table depths were similar between natural and artificial pool sites but much more variable over time at the artificial pool site, possibly due to a lower bulk specific yield across this site. Pool levels and pool-level fluctuations were not the same as those of local water tables in the adjacent peat. Pool-level time series were much smoother, with more damped rainfall or recession responses than those for peat water tables. There were strong hydraulic gradients between the peat and pools, with absolute water tables often being 20-30 cm higher or lower than water levels in pools only 1-4 m away. However, as peat hydraulic conductivity was very low (median of 1.5 x 10(-5) and 1.4 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) at 30 and 50 cm depths at the natural pool site), there was little deep subsurface flow interaction. We conclude that (a) for peat restoration projects, a larger total pool surface area is likely to result in smaller flood peaks downstream, at least during summer months, because peatland bulk specific yield will be greater; and (b) surface and near-surface connectivity during storm events and topographic context, rather than pool size alone, must be taken into account in future peatland pool and stream chemistry studies.

AB This study assessed the risk of decomposition-driven soil subsidence in drained peat soils in the Netherlands, contrasting in peat origin and current land use. In a full factorial design, fen peat and bog peat were sampled from sites in use for nature conservation and for dairy farming, which contrast in history of drainage and fertilisation. In these four peat types, which frequently occur in the Netherlands, the microbial activity and respiration dynamics were studied in samples from superficial oxic peat layers by measuring Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR) and Substrate Induced Growth Response (SIGR). Total and active microbial biomass, microbial growth potential and potential exo-enzyme activities were determined in unamended samples and after nitrogen and/or glucose amendments.
   Remarkably, peat origin and land use did not affect basal respiration rates. In contrast, land use affected microbial biomass and potential growth rates as they were quadrupled in dairy meadows compared to nature reserves. This may be attributable to the pulses of organic and inorganic fertiliser that are being supplied in agricultural peatlands. Potential activities of oxidative exo-enzymes (phenol oxidase, PDX, and phenol peroxidase, POD), in contrast, depended more on peat type, indicating a difference in peat substrate quality. Basal respiration rates and enzyme activities were not related. Phosphorus enrichment was identified as a potential driver of increased peat decomposition. The activity of the oxidative enzyme phenol oxidase and the concentration of phenolic compounds, which are considered to be the main regulators of peat decomposition according to the enzymic latch theory, were not related to respiration rates. It was concluded that decomposition theories like the enzymic latch theory (attributing a main role in the regulation of decomposition to phenolic compounds and phenol oxidase) were not supported by our research in the drained peat soils in the Netherlands.

AB Peatlands contain about one third of the World's terrestrial carbon (C). Due to their increasing importance in the context of climate change various studies estimated regional and global carbon stocks. The greatest uncertainty in current C stock estimates is peat depth. Information on peat depth is often lacking or spatially variable, which both limit the accuracy of C stock estimates. We present measurements of peat depth on the Isle of Man and evaluate the C sink of the region. We assess the degree to which estimates of Sphagnum cover can be used to predict peat depth and we identify and quantify various uncertainties in resulting C stock estimates. Total peatland area was identified through classification of aerial photography. Peat depth and Sphagnum cover were measured on a 50 m grid at four study sites in the southern hills on the Isle of Man.
   Peatlands at the study sites were generally shallow with low total organic carbon (TOC) contents. Peat depth seemed not to be controlled by local terrain. It is estimated that the C stored per unit area ranges from 14.7 to 22.4 kg C m(-2). The results provided in this study were significantly lower than in other studies, which is likely due to the land use history. The large spatial variability of peat depth resulted in large uncertainty in C stock estimates. Sphagnum proved to be important for the formation of deep peat and could potentially be used to assess the quality of peatlands. Results suggest that peatlands on the Isle of Man will likely act as a C source in the long-term if not maintained and/or restored. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global change, like droughts, can destabilize the carbon sink function of peatlands, either directly or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. While the effects of drought and plant community composition on individual carbon (C) related processes are well understood, their effect on multiple C-related processes simultaneouslymultifunctionality-is poorly known. We studied the effect of drought on four C-related processes (net and gross CO2 exchange, methane fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon content) in a plant removal experiment. Plant functional type (PFT) removal (graminoids, herbs, Polytrichum spp., incl. combinations) negatively affected multifunctionality; most markedly when all PFTswere removed. Our results corroborate a negative drought effect on C-related multifunctionality. Drought reduced multifunctionality, and this reduction was again largest when all PFTs were removed. Our data further indicate that much of these negative drought effects were carried over and maintained from the initial removal treatment. These results suggest that while a high diversity in plant functional types is associated to high C-related multifunctionality, plant community assembly does not drive the ability of peatlands to withstand the negative impacts of drought on multifunctionality. Hence, to safeguard the carbon cycling function in intact peatlands, the effects of climate change on the functional composition of the peatland plant community needs to be minimized.

AB [ 1] To date, very little information has been available on the build-up and release of biogenic gas bubbles in poorly-decomposed bog peats near the peatland surface ( upper 1 m). We investigated the importance of ebullition of biogenic gas bubbles as a mechanism for the transport of CH4 to the atmosphere in eight cores ( 24 cm diameter, 22 cm depth) of poorly-decomposed, near-surface bog peat. Ebullition was recorded in all but one sample but varied greatly between samples. Maximum rates of CH4 efflux via ebullition were also highly variable, ranging from 2.2 to 83.0 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). These rates are similar to rates of diffusive CH4 efflux. Our results also show that wetland methane models are likely to need revision because they assume that unrealistically high CH4 pore-water concentrations are required before bubbles can be produced and because, in part, they do not account for gas bubble build-up prior to ebullition.

AB Since peatlands store up to 30% of the global soil organic carbon, it is important to understand how these ecosystems will react to a change in climate and management. Process-based ecosystem models have emerged as important tools for predicting long-term peatland dynamics, but their application is often challenging because they require programming skills. In this paper, we present NUCOMBog, an R package of the NUCOM-Bog model (Heijmans et al. 2008), which simulates the vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics of peatlands in monthly time steps. The package complements the model with appropriate functions, such as the calculation of net ecosystem exchange, as well as parallel functionality. As a result, the NUCOMBog R package provides a use-rfriendly tool for simulating vegetation and biogeochemical cycles/fluxes in peatlands over years/decades, under different management strategies and climate change scenarios, with the option to use all the in-built model analysis capabilities of R, such as plotting, sensitivity analysis or optimization.

AB In-situ oil extraction activities impact the vast mosaic of boreal wetlands and uplands. Peatland restoration in these regions aims at reestablishing crucial peatland functions, such as peat accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration. In order to assess the success of fen restoration, we evaluated the biogeochemical conditions, the seasonal carbon balances via carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and methane (CH4) emissions, and addressed the global warming potential following different restoration techniques at two restored in-situ oil sands well pads, during two consecutive growing seasons. Restoration work involved: 1) the partial or complete removal of introduced well pad construction materials, and spontaneous revegetation, or 2) the partial removal of foreign clay, in addition to reintroduction of typical fen plant species such as Larix laricina, Salix lutea and Carex aquatilis. Comparisons were done with regional reference ecosystems (REF) consisting of three peatlands: a wooded bog, a wooded rich fen and a wooded extreme-rich fen. While the average electric conductivity of restored sectors (946 mu S cm(-1)) was higher compared to REF (360 mu S cm(-1)), the pH was quite similar (pH 5.8 REF, pH 6 restored). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was lower in all restored sectors (5-11 mg L-1 restored sectors, 15-35 mg L-1 REF), presumably due to the still incomplete recovery of vegetation and lower organic matter content associated with remnant well pad material. Re-establishment of shrub and brown moss species improved significantly the C uptake. However, the active introduction of plant species was no crucial restoration step, in order to return species beneficial for C uptake. Restoration treatments that were leveled closest to the surrounding REF showed the most similar seasonal C balance to REF. In shallow open water areas resulting from the complete removal of all construction materials, we measured the highest methane emissions making these flooded sites net C sources to the atmosphere with elevated global warming potential. The partial removal of the well pad's mineral soil to near the water table level and the surface elevation of the surrounding ecosystem seems to be the most effective site management method to sequester carbon efficiently. However, further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of this restoration method for the recovery of biodiversity and possible impacts of residual foreign materials on fen ecosystems.

AB This study aims to reconstruct the recent dynamics of two bogs located in an agricultural landscape and to determine which factors favour tree expansion, the most salient change recently reported in treeless peatlands. The vegetation and hydrological dynamics of the bogs as well as land use changes in the vicinity were reconstructed using a combination of paleoecological, paleohydrological, and historical approaches. It was hypothesized that upland deforestation indirectly induced atmospheric mineral dust deposition on sites, thus increasing nutrient availability and triggering forest expansion. Results indicated that a widespread, but asynchronous tree expansion occurred in both bogs during the 20th century. However, no evidence suggesting that nutrient enrichment favoured the phenomenon was found. Forest expansion seems rather to have been favoured by drying of the peat surface, as a decrease of the water table depth coincided with the beginning of the forest encroachment on both sites. This drying correlated with the establishment of an in situ artificial drainage ditch on one site and with agricultural development in the catchment of the other. Local historical factors of each site apparently override regional factors such as climate anomalies or upland deforestation in explaining rapid, abrupt changes in bogs.

AB Peat humification analysis is a widely used palaeoclimate proxy. However, recent studies combining humification with other proxies of mire surface wetness have identified inconsistencies between the records. We illustrate this inconsistency by comparing humification records with plant macrofossil profiles in three ombrotrophic bogs. Peat humification is a measure for organic decay and reflects changing palaeohydrological conditions and former vegetation composition. The resulting signal is considered to be a derived response to climate. However, even minor changes in the botanical composition of the peat may have a significant influence on humification measurements. The implications of this for palaeoclimate studies are discussed. The assumption that climate has been the major influence on variations in humification rests on the botanical composition being relatively homogeneous throughout the peat profile, and is therefore questionable. Consideration should be given to developing species-specific measures of humification and to testing the assumption that the major influence on peat humification is the surface wetness of the bog (and therefore climate).

AB Floating islands of vegetation-covered peat which include palsas arc observed in spring-fed fens within a string bog in the MacMillan Pass, Yukon Territory, Canada. The fens are dammed by stable and long-lived banks of moss and contain floating islands of peat. The smaller 80 m(2) islands consist of sphagnum peat over 1.5 m deep with the surface rising up to 20 cm above the surrounding water level. They contain seasonal frost and have a Sphagnum-Betula vegetation. Larger islands (about 280 m(2)) have a height of up to 70 cm and contain permafrost. The peat is up to 3.3 m thick and consists of sphagnum peat, although the present-day living vegetation cover consists of a Cladonia-Ericaceae-Betula association. The embryonic palsas float in the water and in June a layer of water separates the frozen peat of the permafrost base from the underlying unfrozen peat. A distinct layer of volcanic ash of known origin provides a basis for an estimate of the rate of sphagnum accumulation (approximately 1.1-1.2 mm/yr). Electrical conductivity of the ice demonstrates that initially fen water freezes in the peat, but that subsequently more water from precipitation is added from the overlying active layer and snow bank. In the upper layers, the ratio of volumes of precipitation to fen water is 3:2, but can be as high as 13:1 in nearby mature palsas located in similar fens:Critical conditions for formation of permafrost appear to be a thickness of over 2 m of floating peat with its surface rising more than 40 cm above the level of the surrounding fen.

AB As the global climate changes so will the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and release from peatlands. The changes occurring within peatlands will be complex, making their future carbon (C) responses difficult to predict. We studied three boreal fen peatlands along a nutrient gradient in northern Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we investigated how abiotic and biotic responses of the fens interacted with seasonal and annual hydrologic variability. We further assessed the role that a local disturbance, such as inundation due to beaver dams, has in confounding fen C dynamics. We conducted these assessments by applying the process-based model Wetland-DNDC, which we parameterized, calibrated and corroborated with field data, to examine how C dynamics were affected by fen type (rich, intermediate and poor), historical and projected climate and local flooding disturbance. We found inter-annual variability in greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane, CH4) dynamics to be large among fens, with larger coefficients of variation for heterotrophic respiration and CH4 effluxes (a range of 40-85% and 31-58%, respectively) than gross primary production (a range of 9-26%). This annual variability in C effluxes correlated to meteorological conditions and water table, although the specific drivers differed among fens. Scenarios of prolonged flooding and drought had opposite effects on C effluxes. Drought increased CO2 efflux by 43%, 175% and 65% for rich, intermediate and poor fens, respectively, and decreased CH4 efflux by 11% and 14% for the intermediate and poor, but increased CH4 efflux by 19% for the rich fen. In contrast, shallow flooding decreased CO2 by 40%, 72% and 57% in the rich, intermediate and poor fen, and increased CH4 effluxes by 87%, 202% and 269%, respectively. Flooding by beaver dams during a prolonged drought moderately decreased CO2 (29%, 66% and 53%) but strongly increased CH4 efflux by 121%, 261% and 333%, respectively, than the flooding only. We conclude that the interacting controls on greenhouse gas dynamics differ among fens types, contributing to the magnitude of effluxes and their response to changing conditions. We propose that effects of water table level, peat nutrient status, and vegetation composition, and their interactions, on C processes require enhanced understanding to define natural ranges of spatial and temporal variability. Only then will it be possible to adequately predict future peatland C responses to climate and other environmental changes. As such, short-term experimental results or field studies should not be used to predict future peatland C dynamics without an understanding of the natural range of variation in the environmental drivers and the response of C processes to those drivers.

AB To predict the role of ombrotrophic bogs as carbon sinks in the future, it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in bogs will respond to global change. We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effects of two temperature treatments (17.5 and 21.7A degrees C) and two N addition treatments (0 and 4 g N m(-2) year(-1)) on the growth of four Sphagnum species from three geographically interspersed regions: S. fuscum, S. balticum (northern and central Sweden), S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum (southern Sweden). We studied the growth and cover change in four combinations of these Sphagnum species during two growing seasons. Sphagnum height increment and production were affected negatively by high temperature and high N addition. However, the northern species were more affected by temperature, while the southern species were more affected by N addition. High temperature depressed the cover of the 'wet' species, S. balticum and S. cuspidatum. Nitrogen concentrations increased with high N addition. N:P and N:K ratios indicated P-limited growth in all treatments and co-limitation of P and K in the high N treatments. In the second year of the experiment, several containers suffered from a severe fungal infection, particularly affecting the 'wet' species and the high N treatment. Our findings suggest that global change can have negative consequences for the production of Sphagnum species in bogs, with important implications for the carbon sequestration in these ecosystems.

SO MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA
LA English
DT Article
AB The Wagner Natural Area, located 8 km west of Edmonton, Alberta (53-degrees 34'N 113-degrees 47'W), contains a boreal spring fen estimated to be 4700 years old.  The site was selected in 1985 for a survey of its arthropod fauna.  A transect of the site from marl pools through fen, edge effect, and treed swamp was sampled for arthropods using pan and Malaise traps.  Specialized microhabitats outside the transect were identified and sampled using pan traps.  The Wagner fen samples contain 2181 species of arthropods contributing to a total known biota of 2905 species in the peatland.  Of those, 1410 are Hymenoptera.  Although seven other peatland studies are known, the inability of systematists to name most species prevents direct comparisons among peatlands.  Data obtained from the Hymenoptera collections at Wagner demonstrate a progression in species richness as one approaches the forest-fen edge from either fen or forest.  A large proportion [30% (382 species)] of Hymenoptera species, termed the aerial component, is active both in the forest-fen edge and in the fen.  The aerial component is a highly mobile, at least locally transient, but often uncollected component of peatland ecosystems.  Presence of the aerial component is probably associated with habitat structure.  Those peatlands possessing more complex vegetation architecture have greater proportions of aerial species.  About 80% of Hymenoptera at Wagner are parasitoids, most of which attack larva of holometabolous hosts.  Based on the host groups sought by parasitoids and the ratio of parasitoid species per host species, the fen is estimated to contain about 6000 species of arthropods.

AB The peat stratigraphy (plant macrofossils, colorimetric humification, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, carbon/nitrogen ratios) of three replicate cores from a raised peat bog in the UK (Walton Moss) and a single core from a raised peat bog in Denmark (Lille Vildmose) were examined in an attempt to investigate the relation between long-term climate change and changes in species composition of the peat-forming vegetation. Nine wet-shifts identified in the monoliths from Walton Moss and Lille Vildmose mainly occurred during periods of increasing atmospheric C-14 content. Because fluctuations in Holocene atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations have been shown to be due to variations in solar activity, the Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic deteriorations registered in both peat bogs were probably driven by changes in solar activity. Climatic deteriorations in the three replicate cores from Walton Moss are not all consistently registered and may reflect the internal variability in the extent of hollow/lawn/hummock microforms within raised peat-bog ecosystems. The lowest carbon accumulation values for the Walton Moss monoliths between ca. cal AD 1300 and 1800 and between ca. cal AD 1490 and 1580 for Lille Vildmose occurred during the course of LIA climatic deteriorations. Peat-bog primary productivity may have been reduced during the LIA owing to lower spring-summer temperatures and shorter growing seasons for the peat-forming plants. Species-specific higher decomposition rates may have also caused the lower carbon accumulation rates in the peat bogs during the LIA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the processes that led to the recent evolution of Mediterranean landscapes is a challenging question that can be addressed with paleoecological data. Located in the White Mountains of Crete, Asi Gonia peat bog constitutes an exceptional 2000-years-long sedimentary archive of environmental change. In this study, we document the making of the White Mountains landscape and assess human impact on ecosystem trajectories. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction is based on high-resolution analyses of sediment, pollen, dung fungal spores and charcoal obtained from a 6-m core collected from the bog. Multiproxy analyses and a robust chronological control have shed light on anthropogenic and natural processes that have driven ecological changes, giving rise to the present-day Mediterranean ecosystem. Our results suggest that sediment accumulation began during the transition from the Hellenistic to the Roman period, likely due to watershed management. The evolution of the peat bog as well as vegetation dynamics in the surrounding area were linked to past climate changes but were driven by human activities, among which breeding was of great importance. Charcoal analysis reveals that fire was largely used for the construction and maintenance of sylvo-agropastoral areas. Pollen data allow the identification of three main vegetation assemblages: 1) evergreen oak forest (before ca. 850 AD), 2) heather maquis (ca. 850 to 1870 AD), 3) phrygana/steppe landscape. Rapid changes between phases in vegetation development are associated with tipping-points in ecosystem dynamics resulting from anthropogenic impact. The modern ecosystem did not get established until the 20th century, and it is characterized by biodiversity loss along with a dramatic drying of the peat bog.

AB The stump and root systems of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and field-layer vegetation were sampled before (1984) and three growing seasons after drainage and fertilization (1987) of a low-shrub pine bog. Average below-ground biomass of the field layer was 548 gDW m-2 in 1984, with no significant treatment effects during experimentation. The stump-plus-root biomass of the pine stands was 1464 gDW m-2 in the virgin state, and had increased to 1854 gDW m-2 three years after the NPK-fertilizer treatment. The distribution over fractions also changed with this treatment. The fraction of tine roots (phi < 1 mm) in stump-root biomass increased from 4% (56 gDW m-2) to 11% 196 gDW m-2),  while the other compartments changed less. Total pine root length was 729 mm-2 in 1984. Root length increased by 94% to 1380 mm-2 on NPK-fertilized plots. Most of the fine pine roots were in the surface layer (0-10 cm), 79% in 1984 and 88% in 1987, and few pine roots were deeper than 20 cm. Maximum root length of fine pine roots (phi < 1 mm) was estimated to be 2710 mm-2 at about 800 gDW m-2 (NPK treatment), and the corresponding maximum for small pine roots (phi = 1-10 mm) was 227 mm-2 at 809 gDW m-2 Drainage stimulated net growth of fine roots, but this treatment also caused higher mortality rates of small roots. The fine roots responded to fertilization with higher net growth rate, and secondary growth of the large roots (phi > 10 mm) was improved. The observed changes in root biomass and structure are explained as strategic adaptations to altered hydrological and nutritional circumstances in the root zone after drainage and fertilization.

AB Peatland-margin habitats with organic matter accumulation of 40-150 cm make up a significant but poorly quantified portion of Canada's boreal forest region. Spanning the transition between non-wetland forest and fen proper, these ecosystems represent a zone of complex environmental and vegetation change, yet little is known about their ecological function or development. We here use vegetation and macrofossil analysis, traditional C-14, bomb-spike C-14, and Pb-210 dating to investigate the development, organic matter accumulation, and recent vegetation history of peat margin communities at two sites in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Although similar in general shape, bomb-spike C-14 and Pb-210 chronologies show limited agreement in three of the four profiles examined, with Pb-210 generally producing younger ages than C-14. Peat initiation and long-term organic matter accumulation at the Old Black Spruce (OBS) transect were probably driven mainly by the dynamics of Sphagnum, whereas at the Sandhill Fen (SF) transect, they were controlled by water level fluctuations in the neighboring fen. Bryophyte macrofossils suggest a recent drying of the vegetation surface at both sites, most likely triggered by regional drought in the late 1950s and 1960s. At OBS, the shift from Sphagnum- to feather moss-dominated communities continued in the 1990s, possibly reflecting effects of direct disturbance on local drainage patterns. Overall, our results suggest that community composition and C dynamics of peat-margin swamps respond dynamically to climatic and hydrologic fluctuations. However, uncertainties regarding the reliability of different chronologies limit our ability to link observed community changes to specific causal events.

AB Vegetation rehabilitation of harvested peat fields is globally important because it facilitates the restoration of natural biodiversity. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of mosses, lichens and arthropods in blueberry plantations of differing age on an abandoned peat production area. In the experiment, two lichen and five moss species were detected in total. By contrast, only one species, a moss, was found on a non-vegetated, abandoned peat area. Although the total number of lichens and mosses was not high, it varied significantly according to lowbush blueberry age. It was higher in 5-7-year old plantations with no significant differences with a natural, drained bog. As plant cover by cultivated blueberry plants increased up to 99% in the 13-year plantation, the presence of non-vascular plants diminished. The total number of arthropods depended on the age of the blueberry plantation and was lowest in the non-vegetated, abandoned peat area. Plantation age influenced arthropod abundance in both experimental years. More beneficial or neutral arthropods were found in bog and 6- and 7-year old plantations, while phytophagous arthropods predominated in older plots. Dominating beneficial arthropod groups in both years were Araneidae, Thomisidae, Lycosidae, Collembola, Formicidae and Carabidae. The growing of lowbush blueberry may become one option for the vegetation restoration of abandoned peatlands and the plant cover it provides serves as a suitable habitat for various arthropods.

However, previous studies do not consider the impact of other silvicultural practices on the C dynamics in drained peatlands. Clearfellings cause disturbance in ecosystem C dynamics and might lead to losses of C to the atmosphere. The initial development of C dynamics following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest in Finland was investigated in a 4-year study which included monitoring of ground vegetation development and chamber based measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and heterotrophic peat soil respiration (R-PEAT). NEE measurements showed that the site was mainly a net CO2 source (May-October mean efflux of 1990 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) to the atmosphere during the three measurement seasons after clearfelling. This was caused by decrease in photosynthesizing biomass and by high R-ECO (May-October mean efflux of 2540 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). The recovery of ground vegetation biomass was rather fast. However, during the 3 years after clearfelling its capability to fix carbon could not compensate the high R-ECO, which was mainly caused by excessive amounts of easily decomposable fresh organic matter (dying tree roots, logging residue and dying ground vegetation). Clearfelling slightly decreased the decomposition rates of peat (R-PEAT) (May-October mean efflux of 1130 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) i.e., the oldest and largest C storage of the site, through two mechanisms: R-PEAT in deeper layers was restricted by higher water table level and in surface layers by excessive dryness, which lowered the temperature response of R-PEAT. We conclude that clearfelling strongly affects ecosystem C dynamics but does not affect the peat C storage. The appearance of new tree stand is needed before the ecosystem could act as a C sink again. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Potential rates of methane production and carbon dioxide production were measured on 11 dates in 1986 in peat from six plant communities typical of moss-dominated peatlands in the Appalachian Mountains. Annual methane production ranged from 2.7 to 17.5 mol m(-2), and annual carbon dioxide production ranged from 30.6 to 79.0 mol m(-2). The wide range in methane production values among the communities found within a single peatland indicates that obtaining one production value for a peatland may not be appropriate. Low temperature constrained the potential for methane production in winter, while the chemical quality of the peat substrate appears to control methane production in the summer. Methane oxidation was measured throughout the peat profile to a depth of 30 cm. Values for methane oxidation ranged from 0.08 to 18.7 uM h(-1) among the six plant communities. Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria probably mediated most of the activity. On a daily basis during the summer, between 11 and 100% of the methane produced is susceptible to oxidation within the peat column. Pools of dissolved methane and dissolved carbon dioxide in pore waters were less than 0.2 and less than 1.0 mol m(-2), respectively, indicating that methane does not accumulate in the pore waters. Peatlands have been considered as an important source of biologically produced methane. Despite the high rates of methane production, the high rates of methane oxidation dampen the potential emission of methane to the atmosphere.

AB Precipitation is a key factor affecting shallow water table fluctuations. Although the literature on shallow aquifers is vast, groundwater response to precipitation in peatlands has received little attention so far. Characterizing groundwater response to precipitation events in differently managed peatlands can give insight into ecohydrological processes. In this study we determined the groundwater table response rate following precipitation events at a drained and a rewetted fen to characterize the effect of rewetting on hydrological buffer capacity. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the groundwater table at the rewetted fen has more than two times lower rate of response to precipitation events than that of the drained fen, even after adjusting for antecedent groundwater levels. Thus, the rewetted fen delivers a better hydrological buffer function against heavy precipitation events than the drained fen. We found that for the depths at which the groundwater interacts with incoming precipitation, the peat of the rewetted fen has a higher specific yield causing groundwater to rise slower compared to the response at the drained fen. A period of 20 years of rewetting was sufficient to form a new layer of organic material with a significant fraction of macropores providing storage capacity. Long-term rewetting has the potential to create favorable conditions for new peat accumulation, thereby altering water table response. Our study has implications for evaluating the success of restoration measures with respect to hydrological functions of percolation fens. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The vegetation history of two mires associated with Holocene dunes near the western Bay of Plenty coast, North Island, New Zealand, is deduced from pollen analysis of two cores. Correlation of airfall tephra layers in the peats, and radiocarbon dates, indicate that the mires at Papamoa and Waihi Beach are c. 4600 and c. 2900 conventional radiocarbon years old, respectively. Tephras used to constrain the chronology of the pollen record include Rotomahana (1886 AD), Kaharoa (700 yr B.P.), Taupo (Unit Y; 1850 yr B.P.), Whakaipo (Unit V; 2700 yr B.P.), Stent (Unit Q; 4000 yr B.P.), Hinemaiaia (Unit K; 4600 yr B.P.), and reworked Whakatane (c. 4800 yr B.P.) at Papamoa, and Kaharoa and Taupo at Waihi Beach. Feat accumulation rates at Papamoa from 4600 - 1850 yr B.P. range from 0.94 to 2.64 mm/yr (mean 1.37 mm/yr). At Waihi Beach, from 2900 yr B.P. - present day, they range from 0.11 to 0.21 mm/yr (mean 0.20 mm/yr). Feat accumulation at both sites was slowest from 1850 to 700 yr B.P., suggesting a drier overall climate during this interval.
   At both sites, the earliest organic sediments, which are underlain by marine or estuarine sands, yield pollen spectra indicating salt marsh or estuarine environments. Coastal vegetation communities declined at both sites, as sea level gradually fell or the coast prograded, and were eventually superseded by a low moor bog at Papamoa, and a mesotrophic swamp forest at Waihi Beach. These differences, and the marked variation in peat accumulation rates, probably reflect local hydrology and are unlikely to have been climatically controlled. The main regional vegetation during this period was mixed northern conifer-angiosperm forest. Kauri (Agathis australis) formed a minor component of these forests, but populations of this tree have apparently not expanded during the late Holocene at these sites, which are near its present southern limit. Occasional shortlived forest disturbances are detectable in these records, in particular immediately following the deposition of Taupo Tephra. However, evidence for forest clearance during the human era is blurred by the downward dislocation of modern adventive pollen at these sites, preventing the clear differentiation of the Polynesian and European eras.

AB Background: An understanding of the effects of red deer on bryophyte and lichen communities in wet heath and bog vegetation typical of northwest Scotland is important so that land managers can make more informed decisions concerning deer numbers.
   Aims: To compare various measures of cryptogam species diversity inside and outside a number of established deer exclosures at the Letterewe and Little Gruinard estates, Wester Ross, Scotland.
   Methods: Species cover data were recorded from 192 2mx2m quadrats allocated to 32 blocks and assigned to nine exclosures of different ages with due attention to randomisation. Linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data.
   Results: In the short to medium term there was no significant difference in cryptogam dominance, diversity and species richness on either side of the exclosures. However, Cladonia lichens responded to a lack of trampling and were significantly more abundant inside exclosures. Greater Calluna vulgaris cover in the absence of a large herbivore is likely to have created conditions that promote the growth of Sphagnum capillifolium ssp. rubellum and this in turn increased the habitat available for several liverworts.
   Conclusions: The upper limit of deer numbers deemed appropriate for reducing loss of Calluna cover in wet heath vegetation is set too high to prevent impact on important cryptogam communities.

AB Community and environmental gradients within the ecological boundaries of Carolina bay wetlands may provide important information on the interaction between Carolina bays and associated uplands, and may also provide guidance for improved management. We established twelve 30-m transects on the sloping rims of each of six Carolina bays in northeastern South Carolina to characterize the community gradient, as well as important environmental factors producing this gradient. Mid-points of the transects were placed on jurisdictional wetland boundaries. Hydrology, soil properties, and plant species composition were measured within these transects. On average, transects included an elevation change of 0.6 m that corresponded with gradients of hydrology, soil properties, and community characteristics. Decreasing surface soil moisture (i.e., fewer flood events) and decreasing soil nutrients were associated with a shift from shrub-bog vegetation with relatively low alpha diversity and prominence of evergreens to a relatively diverse and heterogeneous community characterized by grasses, herbs, low shrubs, and vines. Ecotones, identified by abrupt changes in community composition, were more frequently found outside jurisdictional wetland boundaries. Likewise, five near-endemic and endemic plant species were found outside the wetland boundaries. Our data reinforce the need for better understanding of how Carolina bays interact with adjacent landscape elements, and specifically how ecological boundaries are influenced by this interaction.

AB Peatlands are the significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4), which is produced during peat accumulation. In this study, we investigated CH4 emissions over two growing seasons from a Carex lasiocarpa-dominated peatland in the Sanjiang Plain in China using the static chamber technique. We also investigated the environmental factors controlling emissions during the two years of study, 2012 and 2013. CH4 emissions ranged from 0.07 to 56.01 mg CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) with mean values of 7.33 +/- 1.65 mg C m(-2) h(-1), showing significant temporal patterns in both years with peak values in early June and middle August respectively. Variations in water table, soil temperature at 25 cm depth and soil's water-filled pore space together explained 66.7% of the observed temporal variation of CH4 fluxes by the step-wise regression. Rapid and short-lived precipitation events might have no immediate influence on CH4 emissions, which primarily depended on the actual soil aeration and moisture conditions. A simple relationship between single parameter and CH4 fluxes would be overruled once the water table dropped below the critical threshold for CH4 release. The amount of CH4 emitted from the herbaceous peatland in the Sanjiang Plain during the growing season was about 6.93 x 10(12) mg C. Our results suggested that the herbaceous peatland in the Sanjiang Plain is an important source of atmospheric CH4. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Canaan Valley in West Virginia contains a greater area of peatlands than any other locality in the mid-Atlantic Highlands. Extensive fieldwork focused on peat stratigraphy, combined with high-resolution radiocarbon dating, was used to evaluate five peatlands within Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge (CVNWR). One hundred soil cores were profiled and described, 30 with laboratory analysis, including 52 radiocarbon dates. Calibrated basal peat dates from the five peatlands indicate the onset of peat genesis ranged from similar to 18,600 to similar to 15,200 cal yr BP. Basal peat dates on the two oldest cores are 1800 to 2200 years older than published dates on peat initiation in any other Appalachian Mountain peatlands. Peat accumulation rates varied from 0.02 mm/yr to 1.34 mm/yr, with a mean of 0.14 mm/yr. Results of age-depth profiles for six well-dated cores consistently exhibit: rapid accumulation during the late Pleistocene (Heinrich Stadial 1, Bolling-Allerod interstadial, and Younger Dryas cold stadial), lower accumulation rates in the early Holocene (Greenlandian Age), even lower accumulation rates during the mid-Holocene (Northgrippian Age), and the most rapid peat accumulation at the onset of the late Holocene (early Meghalayan Age). A paucity of shallow peat dating younger than 2000 BP may reflect a reduction in peat accumulation, or mixing of surface vegetation into near-surface soil horizons. Soil cores from CVNWR suggest a somewhat different peat development history than the process of terrestrialization previously proposed for other peatland ecosystems in the region.

AB Northern peatlands constitute a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4 with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4 emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40 degrees to 70 degrees N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4 emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6-15.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the mean and 3.3-6.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the median. The overall annual average (mean +/- SD) is 12 +/- 21 g C m(-2) year(-1) with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4 emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p < .05) reduces CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4 emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4 fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.

AB Temperate peatlands are regionally important for farming but long-term cultivation, as well as reforestation after intense agricultural use, can have a significant impact on their soil microbial activity and nitrogen cycles. We studied peatlands in the central part of European Russia, which initially was a swamp forest ecosystem with fairly homogeneous properties of woody peat. Different sites in the area were subsequently under different types of land use. We studied 4 sites in order of increasing management intensity: near-pristine swamp forest, a reforested site after 50 years of intensive cultivation and 2 agricultural sites with 50- and 100-year histories of agricultural use. We examined the dynamics of microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N and mineral nitrogen during the growing season (May-November). We conclude that land use type can affect the seasonal dynamics of available and microbial nitrogen by changing the vegetation cover. For peatlands covered with natural vegetation, an important feature of the seasonal dynamics of N is microbial immobilization and storage during winter. High activity of beta-1,4-glucosidase and low activity of peroxidase indicate that microorganisms consume mainly nitrogen and carbon from fresh plant litter, rather than carbon and nitrogen conserved in peat. Long-term peatland agricultural use has led to significant changes in the dynamics of available and microbial nitrogen and carbon during the growing season, and land management has greatly modified the limitations of the activity of micro-organisms from the availability of nitrogen (in the forest) to the availability of carbon (in arable peatland). The changes in peatlands occurred in the first years or decades of their exploitation because we did not find significant differences in any of the indicators between the arable lands used for 50 and > 100 years. We found that natural reforestation for 50 years has not yet fully restored microbial activity; however, for some parameters, this site has characteristics close to those of near-pristine swamp forest.

AB Four distinct vegetation types are found in close proximity along an exposed section of the southern central coast of British Columbia. A coastal fringe of coniferous forest a few hundred metres wide is separated by a steep ecotone from an inland peatland-forest complex. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the plant communities along the transition from forest to peatland, and (2) to identify some of the major environmental factors associated with those communities using indicator plant analysis. The coastal forest is dominated by Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Picea sitchensis, and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis. Characteristic understory species include Gaultheria shallon and Blechnum spicant. Inland from the coastal forest are transitional forest stands with a species-rich understory including Cornus canadensis, Hylocomium splendens, and Vaccinium parvifolium. The peatlands are poor fens characterized by thickets of Pinus contorta and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis among open areas dominated by species such as Sphagnum sp., Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, and bogs characterized by Myrica gale, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Sanguisorba officinalis. Indicator plant analysis identified differences in the ground surface materials, soil moisture and nutrient regime between the vegetation types. The general trend is for an increase in soil moisture from the forest vegetation to the peatlands and a concurrent change from the Mor humus forms that dominate the coastal forest floor to the surface groundwater table of the peatlands. These environmental differences between forest and peatland are likely related to the steeper slopes typically found in the fringe forest vegetation.

AB In Finland, recycling of wood-ash as a fertilizer has been widely studied in recent decades in peatlands drained for forestry. Wood-ash is reported to promote tree growth without any significant negative impacts on the environment and could, therefore, be a suitable option on cut-away peatlands, which are estimated to increase by 30,000 ha over the next ten years. However, the environmental effects of ash-fertilization on cut-away peatlands or on ground vegetation are not well known. We studied the effects of wood- and peat-ash application on the nutrient content in soil and plants and on the heavy metal content in the vegetation of a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite, or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Both wood- and peat-ash fertilization ensured an adequate level of nutrients for the early establishment and growth of ground vegetation and birch seedlings in a cut-away peatland. Dense pioneer moss cover was important in trapping the heavy metals, such as cadmium, which are present in the ash. Ground vegetation of mosses and herbaceous plants also had a major role in the retention of the nutrients that could otherwise have leached from the open cut-away peatland area during the early stages of afforestation. Both wood- and peat-ash proved to be suitable for the initial fertilization of afforested cut-away peatlands, but in order to guarantee a sufficient long-term potassium supply for tree growth, an application of biotite with the peat-ash is recommended.

AB Peatlands are abundant elements of boreal landscapes where inorganic mercury (IHg) can be transformed into bioaccumulating and highly toxic methylmercury (MeHg). We studied fifteen peatlands divided into three age lasses (young, intermediate and old) along a geographically constrained chronosequence to determine the role of biogeochemical factors and nutrient availability in controlling the formation of MeHg. In the 10 cm soil layer just below the average annual growing season water table, concentrations of MeHg and %MeHg (of total Hg) were higher in younger, more mesotrophic peatlands than in older, more oligotrophic peatlands. In contrast, total mercury (THg) concentrations were higher in the older peatlands. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis indicates that the net MeHg production was positively correlated to trophic demands of vegetation and an increased availability of potential electron acceptors and donors for Hg methylating microorganisms. An important question for further studies will be to elucidate why there is less THg in the younger peatlands compared to the older peatlands, even though the age of the superficial peat itself is similar for all sites. We hypothesize that ecosystem features which enhance microbial processes involved in Hg methylation also promote Hg reduction that makes previously deposited Hg more available for evasion back to the atmosphere.

AB (1) Molinia caerulea occurs in peatland vegetation communities. However, under certain environmental and management conditions it may overwhelm the typical peatland vegetation, compromising ecosystem services including carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and storage. Improved understanding of the effects of M. caerulea on CO2 fluxes in peatland ecosystems will better inform landscape management.
   (2) Photosynthesis at a PPFD of 600 mu mol M-2 S-1 (P-G600), ecosystem respiration and partitioned (heterotrophic and autotrophic) below-ground respiration were calculated from closed-chamber measurements collected over the 2012-2014 growing seasons within two drained M. caerulea dominated peatland catchments in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   (3) All CO2 fluxes peaked in mid-summer, in association with increased soil temperature and vegetation growth. During wetter periods, below-ground autotrophic respiration and P-G600 significantly decreased (p = 0.028 and p = 0.002), conversely heterotrophic respiration increased insignificantly (p = 0.081). An empirically derived net ecosystem exchange model estimated the growing season of 2012 to have been a smaller CO2 sink in carbon equivalents (-126 +/- 243 g m(-2)) than subsequent growing seasons (-146 +/- 310 and -234 +/- 325 g m(-2)) due to lower photosynthetic rates during a cool, wet summer (2012).
   (4) Management aimed at preserving the carbon store and increasing carbon sequestration through raising water tables may reduce photosynthesis and increase heterotrophic respiration unless the dominance of M. caerulea is reduced and Sphagnum spp. cover increased.

AB The water content of the topsoil is one of the key factors controlling biogeochemical processes, greenhouse gas emissions and biosphere - atmosphere interactions in many ecosystems, particularly in northern peatlands. In these wetland ecosystems, the water content of the photosynthetic active peatmoss layer is crucial for ecosystem functioning and carbon sequestration, and is sensitive to future shifts in rainfall and drought characteristics. Current peatland models differ in the degree in which hydrological feedbacks are included, but how this affects peatmoss drought projections is unknown.
   The aim of this paper was to systematically test whether the level of hydrological detail in models could bias projections of water content and drought stress for peatmoss in northern peatlands using downscaled projections for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in the current (1991-2020) and future climate (2061-2090). We considered four model variants that either include or exclude moss (rain)water storage and peat volume change, as these are two central processes in the hydrological self-regulation of peatmoss carpets. Model performance was validated using field data of a peatland in northern Sweden.
   Including moss water storage as well as peat volume change resulted in a significant improvement of model performance, despite the extra parameters added. The best performance was achieved if both processes were included. Including moss water storage and peat volume change consistently reduced projected peatmoss drought frequency with >50%, relative to the model excluding both proces'ses. Projected peatmoss drought frequency in the growing season was 17% smaller under future climate than current climate, but was unaffected by including the hydrological self-regulating processes.
   Our results suggest that ignoring these two fine-scale processes important in hydrological self-regulation of northern peatlands will have large consequences for projected climate change impact on ecosystem processes related to topsoil water content, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Northern peatlands are substantial carbon sinks because organic matter in peat is highly stable due to the low rate of decomposition. Waterlogged anaerobic conditions induce accumulation of Sphagnum-derived phenolic compounds that inhibit peat organic matter decomposition, a mechanism referred to as the "enzymic latch". Recent studies have predicted that the water table in northern peatlands may become unstable. We observed that such unstable water table levels can impede the development of Sphagnum mosses. In this study, we determined the effects of low and high frequency water table fluctuation regimes on Sphagnum growth and peat organic matter decomposition, by conducting a year-long mesocosm experiment. In addition, we conducted a molecular analysis to examine changes in abundance of fungal community which may play a key role in the decomposition of organic matter in peatlands. We found that rapid water table fluctuation inhibited the growth of Sphagnum due to fungal infection but stimulated decomposition of organic matter that may dramatically destabilize peatland carbon storage. Increased pH, induced by the fluctuation, may contribute to the enhanced activity of hydrolases in peat. We demonstrated that the water table fluctuation in peatlands impeded Sphagnum growth and accelerates decomposition due to fungal proliferation. Thus, we suggested that understanding the microbial community in the northern peatlands is essential for elucidating the possible changes in carbon cycle of peatland under the changing world.

AB Evaporation from a cutover raised bog in The Netherlands was modelled using a detailed, physically based evaporation model for heterogeneous vegetation and unsaturated soil water how ''SWAPS''. The model enables a quantification of the role of heterogeneity on evaporation. Micro-meteorological measurements above a vegetation of Molinia caerulea (purple moor grass) in the cutover raised bog ''Engbertsdijksvenen'' are used for calibration and validation of the model. In the present study, it is investigated how small scale heterogeneity affects the prediction of evaporation. Therefore, two hypothetical variants, which represent two possible types of small scale heterogeneity in peatlands, are evaluated: (1) peatland in which drainage has resulted in a vegetation cover of 50% purple moor grass and 50% birch, (2) peatland in which after rewetting the vegetation consists of 50% purple moor grass and 50% Sphagnum mosses. The results show that characteristics of the evaporation from purple moor grass in the two variants are dissimilar. The evaporation from purple moor grass, forming the lower components of a vegetation stand (variant I), can be accurately predicted via radiation based models. In case purple moor grass is the exposed part of the vegetation (variant 2), such models are not likely to predict the evaporation from purple moor grass correctly. An exposed, aerodynamically rough vegetation requires a model that accounts for the vapour pressure deficit as well. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The abundance of Phragmites australis (Trin.) has increased in many fen meadows of the Swiss Plateau. The vegetation of 241 4-m(2) plots was surveyed to determine how the abundance of Phragmites australis was related to site conditions and to the botanical conservation value. The aboveground biomass of P. australis (ABP) ranged from 0 g to 1270 g dry weight m(-2). ABP was positively correlated to the nitrogen indicator value of the vegetation, but uncorrelated to the soil moisture indicator value. The abundance of 55 of 85 plant species was significantly related to ABP. High ABP was, on an average, associated with low conservation value in terms of species richness, number of rare or endangered species, and proportion of typical mire species. Strong differences were, however, round between plots with tall-herb vegetation (alliance Filipendulion) and plots dominated by heathgrass or small sedges (alliances Molinion and Caricion davallianae). The conservation value of Filipendulion plots was low and decreased significantly with increasing ABP. The conservation value of Molinion and Caricion plots was generally high and not related to ABP. Nevertheless, the current spread of P. australis might reduce the conservation value of Molinion and Caricion meadows in three ways: (1) a direct impact of shading is likely to become apparent only after several years; (2) if I! australis spreads into a site together with tall herbs, the loss of conservation value will be greater than if only tall herbs invade; and (3) if the presence of P. australis increases nutrient availability, it may indirectly cause the spread of tall herbs and the resulting loss of conservation value. Thus, spread of P. australis, spread of tall herbs and increased productivity are strongly related to each other and must be considered together when changes in the vegetation of fen meadows are evaluated.

AB Peatlands represent globally significant soil carbon stores that have been accumulating for millennia under water-logged conditions. However, deepening water-table depths (WTD) from climate change or human-induced drainage could stimulate decomposition resulting in peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Contemporary WTD ranges of testate amoebae (TA) are commonly used to predict past WTD in peatlands using quantitative transfer function models. Here we present, for the first time, a study comparing TA-based WTD reconstructions to instrumentally monitored WTD and hydrological model predictions using the MILLENNIA peatland model to examine past peatland responses to climate change and land management. Although there was very good agreement between monitored and modeled WTD, TA-reconstructed water table was consistently deeper. Predictions from a larger European TA transfer function data set were wetter, but the overall directional fit to observed WTD was better for a TA transfer function based on data from northern England. We applied a regression-based offset correction to the reconstructed WTD for the validation period (1931-2010). We then predicted WTD using available climate records as MILLENNIA model input and compared the offset-corrected TA reconstruction to MILLENNIA WTD predictions over an extended period (1750-1931) with available climate reconstructions. Although the comparison revealed striking similarities in predicted overall WTD patterns, particularly for a recent drier period (1965-1995), there were clear periods when TA-based WTD predictions underestimated (i.e. drier during 1830-1930) and overestimated (i.e. wetter during 1760-1830) past WTD compared to MILLENNIA model predictions. Importantly, simulated grouse moor management scenarios may explain the drier TA WTD predictions, resulting in considerable model predicted carbon losses and reduced methane emissions, mainly due to drainage. This study demonstrates the value of a site-specific and combined data-model validation step toward using TA-derived moisture conditions to understand past climate-driven peatland development and carbon budgets alongside modeling likely management impacts.

AB The agricultural use of drained peatlands leads to huge emissions of greenhouse gases and nutrients. A land-use alternative that allows rewetting of drained peatland while maintaining agricultural production is the cultivation of Sphagnum biomass as a renewable substitute for fossil peat in horticultural growing media (Sphagnum farming).
   We studied Sphagnum productivity and nutrient dynamics during two years in two Sphagnum farming sites in NW Germany, which were established on drained bog grassland by sod removal, rewetting, and the introduction of Sphagnum fragments in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
   We found a considerable and homogeneous production of Sphagnum biomass (>3.6 ton DW ha(-1) yr(-1)), attributable to the high nutrient levels, low alkalinity, and even distribution of the irrigation water. The ammonium legacy from former drainage-based agriculture rapidly declined after rewetting, while nutrient mobilization was negligible. CH4 concentrations in the rewetted soil quickly decreased to very low levels. The Sphagnum biomass sequestered high loads of nutrients (46.0 and 47.4 kg N, 3.9 and 4.9 kg P, and 9.8 and 16.1 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 7.5 y and 2.5 y old sites, respectively), preventing off-site eutrophication.
   We conclude that Sphagnum farming as an alternative for drainage-based peatland agriculture may contribute effectively to tackling environmental challenges such as local and regional downstream pollution and global climate change. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We examined the water balance of a forested ombrotrophic peatland and adjacent burned peatland in the boreal plain of western Canada over a 3-year period. Complete combustion of foliage and fine branches dramatically increased shortwave radiation inputs to the peat surface while halting all tree transpiration at the burned site. End-of-winter snowpack was 7-25% higher at the burned site likely due to decreased ablation from the tree canopy at the unburned site. Shrub regrowth at the burned site was rapid post-fire, and shading by the shrub canopy in the burned site approached that of the unburned site within 3years after fire. Site-averaged surface resistance to evaporation was not different between sites, though surface resistance in hollows was lower in the burned site. Water loss at both burned and unburned sites is largely driven by surface evaporative losses. Evaporation at the burned site marginally exceeded the sum of pre-fire transpiration and interception at the unburned site, suggesting that evapotranspiration during the growing season was 20-40mm greater at the burned peatland. Although the net change in water storage during the growing season was largely unchanged by fire, the lack of low-density surface peat in the burned site appears to have decreased specific yield, leading to greater water table decline at the burned site despite similar net change in storage.

AB To study the effects of elevated ozone concentration on methane dynamics and a sedge species, Eriophorum vaginatum, we exposed peatland microcosms, isolated by coring from an oligotrophic pine fen, to double ambient ozone concentration in an open-air ozone exposure field for four growing seasons. The field consists of eight circular plots of which four were fumigated with elevated ozone concentration and four were ambient controls. At the latter part of the first growing season (week 33, 2003), the methane emission was 159 +/- 14 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) (mean +/- SE) in the ozone treatment and 214 +/- 8 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) under the ambient control. However, towards the end of the experiment the ozone treatment slightly, but consistently, enhanced the methane emission. At the end of the third growing season (2005), microbial biomass (estimated by phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers) was higher in peat exposed to ozone (1975 +/- 108 nmol g(-1) dw) than in peat of the control microcosms (1589 +/- 115 nmol g(-1) dw). The concentrations of organic acids in peat pore water showed a similar trend. Elevated ozone did not affect the shoot length or the structure of the sedge E. vaginatum leaves but it slightly increased the total number of sedge leaves towards the end of the experiment. Our results indicate that elevated ozone concentration enhances the general growth conditions of microbes in peat by increasing their substrate availability. However, the methane production did not reflect the increase in the concentration of organic acids, probably because hydrogenotrophic methane production dominated in the peat studied. Although, we used isolated peatland microcosms with limited size as study material, we did not find experimental factors that could have hampered the basic conclusions on the effects of ozone.

AB Plants are known to influence peatland carbon fluxes both i) directly through respiration and ii) by the production of litter and root exudates, which are then broken down by microbes within the peat matrix. In this study we investigated whether three different plant species typical of a UK blanket bog complex - Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus and mixed Sphagnum species - influence the carbon sequestering abilities of the peat that they grow in. To quantify this we measured fluxes of soil derived CO2 and CH4, and extractable levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics, from peat samples taken from areas dominated by one of the three plant communities. It was found that there were significant differences between the carbon fluxes from the different sites, which we attributed to changes brought about by the vegetation on the pH, phenolic concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities found in the peat matrix. Peat taken from Sphagnum-dominated areas emitted less CO2 than the other two sample groups, and had lower overall DOC concentrations and phenol oxidase activities. Conversely, Juncus-peat had the highest CO2 and CH4 fluxes, along with the greatest phenol oxidase activities. Taking all the results into consideration the plants were ranked in order of their ability to reduce the loss of carbon from the peat soil within which they were growing: Sphagnum>Calluna>Juncus. These results suggest that plant community structures could be altered in order to maximise a peatland's ability to be used as a carbon store should they need to be managed as part of a carbon stewardship scheme or a geoengineering project - if this was to be the sole management interest in an area of peatland.

AB The pollen diagram from the Kobyle Jezioro raised bog, situated in the source area of the Tanew River in the Roztocze region, covers the whole Neoholocene. The deposit thickness ( about 3.5 m) has permitted high resolution pollen, peat (including macrofossils) and lithology analyses. Vegetational and palaeoenvironmental changes in this part of the Roztocze were recorded in pollen spectra and organic deposits. Palynological evidence shows the typical Neoholocene succession, which corresponds with the phenomena described from central Europe: from mixed deciduous forests at the decline of the climatic optimum, through hornbeam- and beech-dominated forests to pine forests. Peat accumulation in the Kobyle Jezioro peat-bog started during increased climatic humidity at the beginning of the Subboreal, and originally a fen peat was formed. Raised bog peat layers make up the uppermost 80 cm of the deposit. Within the fen deposits can be found layers of transitional peat, indicating short-term episodes of water deficiency in the early Subboreal phase (short-term climatic dryness) and towards its end (drainage of the bog resulting from the lowering of the groundwater table in the source area of the Tanew River). The growth of the raised bog started at the beginning of the climate deterioration in the Little Ice Age, and the unstable climatic conditions are reflected in the numerous periodical mineral (aeolian) material supplies in the developing ombrogenic bog. The accumulation of the younger section of transitional and raised peats during the Little Ice Age reflects the local hydrological changes in the source area of the Tanew River.

AB 1. Peat formation is a key carbon sequestration process in the terrestrial biosphere. In temperate fens, peat is mainly formed by below-ground biomass of vascular plants. Nutrient availability in temperate fens is naturally variable, and nowadays increasing due to atmospheric deposition, runoff from agriculture and mineralization of peat caused by drainage. To maintain or restore peat formation, it is important to understand how increased nutrient availability influences the main controls of peat formation, that is, below-ground biomass production and decomposition.
   2. We investigated above- and below-ground biomass production and decomposition of five fen sedges (Carex spp.) grown under 12 different nutrient levels (realized with nitrogen amounts increasing exponentially across levels, with addition of phosphorous and potassium to ensure nitrogen limitation in each nutrient level) in a mesocosm experiment, designed to resemble a gradient of very low to very high nutrient availabilities in temperate fens. In addition, we measured nutrient stoichiometry in the biomass and related this to possible growth limitations and to root decomposition.
   3. Our results indicate that higher biomass production at higher nutrient levels was not offset by an increase in decomposition. Increase of above- and below-ground biomass with higher nutrient levels was species-specific. Decomposition of standardized plant material in mesocosms was not dependent on the species growing in the mesocosms and showed only slight, if any, variation with differing nutrient levels. Decomposition of roots grown under different nutrient levels was mainly correlated with species identity and root lignin:cellulose ratio.
   4. Our study suggests that the Carex spp. potentially peat-forming root biomass, here defined as the root biomass which is not decomposed during one growing season, increases with increasing nutrient levels: higher root biomass production is not counteracted by increasing decomposition during the growing season. Based on this pattern of positive mass balance in five common sedge species with differing growth characteristics, we propose that sedge communities establishing after rewetting have the potential for renewed peat formation regardless of the prevailing trophic level.

AB In riparian wetlands total standing crop often fails to account for a significant part of the observed variation in species richness and species composition within communities. In this study, we used abundance of the dominant species instead of total standing crop as the biotic predictor variable and investigated its relationships with species composition and species richness in communities dominated by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel. This was done by measuring soil organic matter content, litter cover and elevation, Phragmites abundance (standing crop and stem density) and species composition in 78 releves. In addition, we tried to identify the environmental boundaries of Phragmites communities by sampling releves in neighbouring communities.
   Two gradients were related to a decline in Phragmites abundance: one gradient, perpendicular to the shoreline, was mainly related to increased elevation and the second gradient ran parallel to the shoreline and was related to increased amounts of soil organic matter. Within the releves dominated by Phragmites, stem density of Phragmites and litter cover were the only factors significantly related to species composition in the RDA solution. Litter cover and standing crop of the dominant accounted for 64% of the variation in species richness within the Phragmites-dominated community. These results show that dead and living biomass of the dominant species may account for a substantial part of the variation in species composition and species richness within a single community.

AB Climate change scenarios suggest that northern peatlands could become drier. To address the type and magnitude of vegetation change associated with persistent drying, we studied changes in biomass and leaf area index following drainage 85 years previously of a bog, using destructive sampling, allometric relationships, and optical measurements. Our results show a 10-fold increase in aboveground biomass between the reference site and the most severely drained site, resulting from the growth of a tree layer. The total leaf biomass increased slightly as a result of drainage, thus an increase in woody biomass was the main cause of the increase in aboveground biomass. Leaf area index approximately tripled in sites where trees grew. Sphagnum L. moss biomass decreased from 120 g.m(-2) at the reference site (20% of all aboveground biomass) to 8 g.m(-2) under the tree canopy (<1% of all aboveground biomass). The percentage of deciduous shrubs increased from 3% of the total shrub biomass in the reference site to 72% in the most severely drained site. Our results show that lowering the water table of a bog can have a profound effect on vegetation but the net effect of these changes on the role of the peatland as a carbon sink remains difficult to assess.

AB Ombrotrophic bog peatlands are nutrient-deficient systems and important carbon (C) sinks yet the stoichiometry of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), essential for plant growth and decomposition, has rarely been studied. We investigated the seasonal variation in C, N, P, and K concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in photosynthetically active tissues of 14 species belonging to five plant functional types (PFTs) (mosses, deciduous trees/shrubs, evergreen shrubs, graminoids, and forb) at Mer Bleue bog, an ombrotrophic peatland in eastern Ontario, Canada. Although we observed variations in stoichiometry among PFTs at peak growing season, there was convergence of C:N:P:K to an average mass ratio of 445:14:1:9, indicating N and P co-limitation. Nitrogen, P, and K concentrations and stoichiometric ratios showed little seasonal variation in mosses, evergreens, and graminoids, but in forb and deciduous species were the largest in spring and decreased throughout the growing season. Variations in nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios among PFTs were greater than seasonal variation within PFTs. Plants exhibit N and P co-limitation and adapt to extremely low nutrient availability by maintaining small nutrient concentrations in photosynthetically active tissues, especially for evergreen shrubs and Sphagnum mosses. Despite strong seasonal variations in nutrient availabilities, few species show strong seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, suggesting a strong stoichiometric homeostasis at Mer Bleue bog.

AB A drill core from the marshlands of NW Germany covering the entire Holocene was analysed at high-resolution by geochemical (XRF, Cirm-MS) and microfacies methods (diatoms, thin sections, SEM) in order to provide information about the palaeoenvironmental development. In addition, microbial experiments were carried out with sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and cellulose fermenting fungi in seawater using pear as substrate. The core contains an intercalated reed peat layer (2.73-3.02 m) and a basal peat (5.78-6.42 m). The basal peat consists in the lowest part of fen woodland and raised bog pear, while the upper part is formed by a reed pear bed. The peat layers are characterised by a distinct enrichment of pyrite with negative bulk sediment delta S-34 values (av. -11.5%, range -2.6 to -26.7%) reflecting microbial sulphate reduction in some peat intervals under almost open system conditions with respect to the input of seawater sulphate. Pyrite occurs exclusively with framboidal texture in close vicinity to the organic matter which indicates localised pyrite formation at the decay site in microenvironments with high concentrations of dissolved Fe. Microbial experiments reveal that peat does not represent an appropriate substrate fur SRB and that SRB have to rely on the preceding decomposition of peat by other microorganisms in microenvironments. The total sulphur content of the peat layers averages to 7.8 wt% with a maximum value of 28.2 wt% unusually round within the basal peat at the transition of fen woodland and raised bog peat. The pyrite enrichments can be explained by two different scenarios which are related to the intensity of the sea-level rise. The first scenario applies to a moderate sea-level rise and is decisive for the reed peats where pyrite formation coincides with peat growth. A brackish zone is assumed for the pear-forming environment which is influenced by iron-rich freshwater and sulphate-rich seawater. As the freshwater forms the major Fe source the amounts of pyrite increase to a certain degree with decreasing salinity in this environment. The palaeosalinity is estimated by thr investigation of littoral and pelagic diatoms. The second scenario applies to the extensive pyrite formation within the basal peat at the transition of fen and bog peat. This pyrite was likely formed after pear growth favoured by a steep sea-level rise. Thin sections of this pear interval reveal elastic layers (1-3 mm) with completely pyritised interfaces. As these elastic layers contain marine pelagic diatoms (e.g. Paralia sulcata) we propose that they are caused by tidal channel activities during a phase of a steep sea-level rise. The marine incursion led to a partial buoyancy of the basal pear at weak transition zones, i.e, the transition from fen to bog peat. As a result of the bouyancy, marine suspended particulate matter can be introduced laterally in-between the peat sections. When the peat settles down a elastic layer remains whose interface with the peat may have favoured the inflow of waters of higher salinity. Therefore, an enhanced formation of pyrite was possible due to the combination of sulphate-rich ground water and iron-rich peatland waters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are generally small sinks for atmospheric CO2. However, the sustainability of this sink functioning is threatened in a changing climate. We measured the M exchange in a temperate bog between August 2005 and July 2006 using the eddy covariance technique. During this period, the CO2 balance was -78.6 +/- 20.0 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), which is a lower uptake than others have reported for comparable ecosystems, but in accordance with average Holocene uptake rates. Average winter emissions were small (11 mu g CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). but the accumulated non-growing season fluxes (121 g CO2 m(-2)) represent a larger flux than the annual balance. Taking into consideration that wintertime temperatures in the northern hemisphere are expected to increase in the future, wintertime fluxes may become increasingly important. The highest instantaneous monthly average uptake occurred in June (-38 mu g CO2 m(-2) S-1), while the drier month of July showed a distinctly smaller sink (-22 mu g CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). It is suggested that soil drying caused gross primary production to decline. while nighttime respiration showed a steadily increase. Our findings indicate that the effect of future warmer temperatures on the growing season CO) exchange in peatlands is dependent on soil wetness.

AB The dynamic carbon balance of a southeastern New Hampshire wetland was constructed for the 1994 growing season using a light-dark box sampling method. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (n=414) and ecosystem respiration (n=234) measurements were made at the 1.7 ha Sphagnum spp. dominated poor fen. The NEE rates ranged from -192 to 492 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and the ecosystem respiration measurements were between -10 and -365 mg C m(-2) h(-1). The negative values represent a loss of carbon from the wetland system. NEE and respiration data were used to derive photosynthesis rates of the vegetation at the study site. A simple model, using hourly averages of photosynthetically active radiation, and air and soil temperatures to generate hourly rates of photosynthesis and respiration, was constructed to interpolate the carbon cycling rates at this fen through the entire 1994 growing season. Results of the carbon balance model suggest that the wetland lost an estimated 145 g C m(-2) for the 9 month modeling period (April through December). The 1994 climate season was warmer (+1.15 degrees C/month) and drier (-12.3 cm) than the 30 year normals for Durham, New Hampshire, the nearest meteorological station. These data suggest that if future climate change brings about warmer temperatures and lower water tables in peatland soils, positive climatic feedback leading to substantial releases of CO2 from boreal and subarctic peatlands is probable.

AB Peatlands are carbon (C) storage ecosystems sustained by a high water table (WT). High WT creates anoxic conditions that suppress the activity of aerobic decomposers and provide conditions for peat accumulation. Peatland function can be dramatically affected by WT drawdown caused by climate and/or land-use change. Aerobic decomposers are directly affected by WT drawdown through environmental factors such as increased oxygenation and nutrient availability. Additionally, they are indirectly affected via changes in plant community composition and litter quality. We studied the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of WT drawdown on aerobic decomposer activity in plant litter at two stages of decomposition (incubated in the field for 1 or 2 years). We did this by profiling 11 extracellular enzymes involved in the mineralization of organic C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur. Our study sites represented a three-stage chronosequence from pristine to short-term (years) and long-term (decades) WT drawdown conditions under two nutrient regimes (bog and fen). The litter types included reflected the prevalent vegetation: Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, shrubs and trees.
   Litter type was the main factor shaping microbial activity patterns and explained about 30% of the variation in enzyme activities and activity allocation. Overall, enzyme activities were higher in vascular plant litters compared to Sphagnum litters, and the allocation of enzyme activities towards C or nutrient acquisition was related to the initial litter quality (chemical composition). Direct effects of WT regime, site nutrient regime and litter decomposition stage (length of incubation period) summed to only about 40% of the litter type effect. WT regime alone explained about 5% of the variation in enzyme activities and activity allocation. Generally, enzyme activity increased following the long-term WT drawdown and the activity allocation turned from P and N acquisition towards C acquisition. This caused an increase in the rate of litter decomposition. The effects of the short-term WT drawdown were minor compared to those of the long-term WT drawdown: e. g., the increase in the activity of C-acquiring enzymes was up to 120% (bog) or 320% (fen) higher after the long-term WT drawdown compared to the short-term WT drawdown. In general, the patterns of microbial activity as well as their responses to WT drawdown depended on peatland type: e. g., the shift in activity allocation to C-acquisition was up to 100% stronger at the fen compared to the bog.
   Our results imply that changes in plant community composition in response to persistent WT drawdown will strongly affect the C dynamics of peatlands. The predictions of decomposer activity under changing climate and/or land-use thus cannot be based on the direct effects of the changed environment only, but need to consider the indirect effects of environmental changes: the changes in plant community composition, their dependence on peatland type, and their time scale.

AB The calcareous substrate of spring-fed fens makes them unique islands of biodiversity, hosting endangered, vulnerable, and protected vascular plants. Hence, spring-fed fens ecosystems require special conservation attention because many of them are destroyed (e.g. drained, forested) and it is extremely difficult or even impossible to restore the unique hydrogeological and geochemical conditions enabling their function. The longterm perspective of paleoecological studies allows indication of former wetland ecosystem states and provides understanding of their development over millennia. To examine the late Holocene dynamics of a calcareous spring-fed fen (Raganu Mire) ecosystem on the Baltic Sea coast (Latvia) in relation to environmental changes, substrate and human activity, we have undertaken high-resolution analyses of plant macrofossils, pollen, mollusc, stable carbon (813C) and oxygen (818O) isotopes combined with radiocarbon dating (AMS) in three coring locations. Our study revealed that peat deposits began accumulating ca. 7000 cal. yr BP and calcareous deposits (tufa) from 1450 cal. yr BP, coinciding with regional hydrological changes. Several fire events occurred between 4000 and 1600 cal. yr BP, which appeared to have had a limited effect on local vegetation. The most significant changes in the forest and peatland ecosystems were at 3200 cal. yr BP associated with a dry climate stage and high fire activity, and then between 1400 and 500 cal. yr BP potentially associated with temperature changes during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age. Hydrological disturbances in the peatland catchment from 1400 cal. yr BP were most likely strengthened by human activity (deforestation) in this region. The relationship between the development of this peatland and changes in its catchment area, such as land cover changes or fluctuations in groundwater levels, suggest that protection and restoration of spring-fed fen ecosystems should also include the surrounding catchment. The presence of calcareous sediments, as well as appropriate temperature and local hydrological conditions appear to be the most crucial factors controlling Cladium marisus populations in our site - currently at the eastern limit of its distribution in Europe.

AB Beaver dams are known to raise water tables in mineral soil environments, but very little is known about their impact in wetlands, such as peatlands. Peatlands tend to have shallow water tables, and the position and tendency of the water table to fluctuate (i.e., stability) is a factor controlling the system's ability to store carbon and water. Many peatland environments, especially fens, offer ideal habitat for beaver, and the potential for beaver dams to influence this link by manipulating water tables requires investigation. Our objective was to determine the influence of beaver dams on the water table dynamics of a Rocky Mountain fen. We monitored water tables in the peatland for 4years while beaver dams were intact and 2years after they were breached by an extreme flood event. We found that, because of the unique way in which dams were built, they connected the peatland to the stream and raised and stabilized already high water tables within a 150-m radius. Beaver-mediated changes to peatland water table regimes have the potential to enhance carbon sequestration and the peatland's ability to respond to external pressures such as climate change. Furthermore, beaver dams increased surface and groundwater storage, which has implications for regional water balances, especially in times of drought.

Intact peat cores maintained with an anoxic headspace over the peat surface consumed CFC-11 and minor amounts of CFC-12 The consumption of CFC-11 showed a first-order rate constant of 0.122 d(-1); hence, molecular diffusion transports CFCs through vegetation to consumption sites in the peat. Peat samples from the 0-10 cm depth in the swamp site showed higher microbial activity and consumed both CFC-11 and CFC-12 at higher rates than deeper pear samples (20-30 cm depth). Conversely, deeper peat from the bog showed higher consumption rates for CFCs than pear samples from the 0-10 cm depth corresponding to the higher microbial activity deep in the pear profile. For both CFCs, consumption by incubated pear samples followed the series: anoxic > anoxic with carbon added much greater than, autoclaved > oxic;anoxic methanogen inhibited > oxic with CH4. The results suggest that anaerobic sail in northern peatlands have the capacity to serve as a sink for atmospheric CFCs.

AB Although studies have shown that peatland drainage and harvesting alter local hydrology, microclimate, and peat characteristics, little is known about the effects of these changes on CO2 production rates. This study examines the different factors affecting CO2 production from natural and cutover peatlands. Laboratory peat incubations were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine the influence of temperature, soil moisture, and peat depth on CO2 production rates from peat samples taken from: (1) a natural peatland; (2) a 2-year post-cutover peatland and; (3) a 7-year post-cutover peatland.
   CO2 production rates ranged from 0.21 to 4.87 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions, and from 0.37 to 15.69 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) in the aerobic trials. While no significant differences were found between the CO2 production rates of the two cutover sites, the natural site consistently displayed higher production values. The natural site was also the only site to exhibit strong depth dependent trends, thus indicating the importance of the upper peat layer with respect to substrate quality. Higher production rates were found under aerobic than anaerobic conditions, with the greatest response to oxygen observed at the natural site. Production rates increased with both temperature and soil moisture, with maximum production rates found at 20 degreesC and 92% moisture content. Temperature responses were generally greater at the cutover sites, while soil moisture had greater effects on the natural site peat.
   Results of this work agree with previous studies that suggest that it is essential to begin restoration once a cutover peatland is abandoned. Re-wetting a cutover peatland (through restoration practices) is necessary to prevent an increase in peat temperature and CO2 production since cutover peat has higher Q(10) values than natural peat. A decrease in overall peatland oxidation should reduce the persistent source of atmospheric CO2 from cutover peatlands and the irreversible changes in peat structure that impede Sphagnum re-establishment.

AB AimTo assess vegetation changes in montane fens and wet meadows and their causes over 38years.
   LocationWetlands, Jura Mountains (Switzerland and France).
   MethodsPlots were inventoried in 1974 and re-located in 2012 (quasi-permanent plots) on the basis of sketches to assess changes in plant communities. The 110 plots belonged to five phytosociological alliances, two in oligotrophic fens (Caricion davallianae, Caricion fuscae) and three in wet meadows (Calthion, Molinion, Filipendulion). Changes between surveys were assessed with NMDS, and changes in species richness, Simpson diversity, species cover and frequency and the causes of these changes were evaluated by comparing ecological indicator values.
   ResultsChanges in species composition varied between alliances, with a general trend towards more nutrient-rich flora with less light at ground level. Species diversity declined, with a marked decreasing trend for the typical species of each alliance. These species were partly replaced by species belonging to nitrophilous and mesophilous grasslands. However, no trend towards drier conditions was detected in these wetlands. The largest changes, with an important colonization by nitrophilous species, occurred in the Swiss sites, where grazing was banned 25years ago. As a result of floral shifts, many plots previously belonging to fens or wet mesotrophic meadows shifted to an alliance of the wet meadows, generally Filipendulion. Moreover, communities showed a slight trend towards more thermophilous flora.
   ConclusionsThe investigated wetlands in the Jura Mountains have suffered mainly from eutrophication due to land-use abandonment and N deposition, with a loss of typical species. Areas with constant land use (grazing or mowing) showed less marked changes in species composition. The most important action to conserve these wetlands is to maintain or reintroduce the traditional practices of extensive mowing and livestock grazing in the wetlands, especially in areas where they were abandoned 25years ago. This previous land-use change was intended to improve fen conservation, but it was obviously the wrong measure for conservation purposes.

AB To determine the influence of fire and thermokarst in a boreal landscape, we investigated peat cores within and adjacent to a permafrost collapse feature on the Tanana River Floodplain of Interior Alaska. Radioisotope dating, diatom assemblages, plant macrofossils, charcoal fragments, and carbon and nitrogen content of the peat profile indicate similar to 600 years of vegetation succession with a transition from a terrestrial forest to a sedge-dominated wetland over 100 years ago, and to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in approximately 1970. The shift from sedge to Sphagnum, and a decrease in the detrended tree-ring width index of black spruce trees adjacent to the collapse coincided with an increase in the growing season temperature record from Fairbanks. This concurrent wetland succession and reduced growth of black spruce trees indicates a step-wise ecosystem-level response to a change in regional climate. In 2001, fire was observed coincident with permafrost collapse and resulted in lateral expansion of the peatland. These observations and the peat profile suggest that future warming and/or increased fire disturbance could promote permafrost degradation, peatland expansion, and increase carbon storage across this landscape; however, the development of drought conditions could reduce the success of both black spruce and Sphagnum, and potentially decrease the long-term ecosystem carbon storage.

AB Peatlands are recognised as an important but vulnerable ecological resource. Understanding the effects of existing damage, in this case erosion, enables more informed land management decisions to be made. Over the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were measured using closed chamber techniques within vegetated haggs and erosional peat pans in Dartmoor National Park, southwest England. Below-ground total and heterotrophic respiration were measured and autotrophic respiration estimated from the vegetated haggs. The mean water table was significantly higher in the peat pans than in the vegetated haggs; because of this, and the switching from submerged to dry peat, there were differences in vegetation composition, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. In the peat pans photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration were greater than in the vegetated haggs and strongly dependent on the depth to water table (r(2)>0.78, p<0.001). Whilst in the vegetated haggs, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration had the strongest relationships with normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r(2)=0.82, p<0.001) and soil temperature at 15cm depth (r(2)=0.77, p=0.001). Autotrophic and total below-ground respiration in the vegetated haggs varied with soil temperature; heterotrophic respiration increased as water tables fell. An empirically derived net ecosystem model estimated that over the two growing seasons both the vegetated haggs (29 and 20gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -570 to 762 and -873 to 1105 gCm(-2)) and the peat pans (7 and 8gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -147 to 465 and -136 to 436gCm(-2)) were most likely net CO2 sources. This study suggests that not only the visibly degraded bare peat pans but also the surrounding vegetated haggs are losing carbon to the atmosphere, particularly during warmer and drier conditions, highlighting a need for ecohydrological restoration.

AB Rates of peat growth and carbon (C) accumulation in a Sphagnum-dominated boreal peatland in south-east Norway were compared over two time periods each 17yr long, that is, an earlier period from 1978 to 1995 and a recent period from 1995 to 2012. Our research was based on 109 peat cores. By using exactly the same study area and sampling protocols to obtain data for the two time periods, we were able to obtain a clear picture of the spatio-temporal patterns of peat accumulation. We show that peat growth and C accumulation were significantly higher in the recent than in the earlier time period. Interestingly, nitrogen (N) deposition was lower in the recent than in the earlier time period, while precipitation increased in the recent time period. Temperatures did not show any consistent trends over the time periods. Although our data do not allow assessment of the relative importance of declining N deposition vs increasing precipitation as drivers of peat accumulation, our results suggest that peatland C sequestration is not significantly inhibited by N pollution at current precipitation and N deposition levels.

AB The aim of this study was to detect vegetation change and to examine trophic interactions in a Sphagnum-dominated mire in response to raised temperature and nitrogen (N) addition. A long-term global-change experiment was established in 1995, with monthly additions of N ( 30 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and sulfur (20 kg.ha(-1)yr(-1)) during the vegetation period. Mean air temperature was raised by 3.6 degrees C with warming chambers. Vegetation responses were negligible for all treatments for the first four years, and no sulfur effect was seen during the course of the experiment. However, after eight years of continuous treatments, the closed Sphagnum carpet was drastically reduced from 100% in 1995 down to 41%, averaged over all N-treated plots. Over the same period, total vascular plant cover ( of the graminoid Eriophorum vaginatum and the two dwarf-shrubs Andromeda polifolia and Vaccinium oxycoccos) increased from 24% to an average of 70% in the N plots. Nitrogen addition caused leaf N concentrations to rise in the two dwarf-shrubs, while for E. vaginatum, leaf N remained unchanged, indicating that the graminoid to a larger extent than the dwarf-shrubs allocated supplemented N to growth. Concurrent with foliar N accumulation of the two dwarf-shrubs, we observed increased disease incidences caused by parasitic fungi, with three species out of 16 showing a significant increase. Warming caused a significant decrease in occurrence of three parasitic fungal species. In general, decreased disease incidences were found in temperature treatments for A. polifolia and in plots without N addition for V. oxycoccos. The study demonstrates that both bryophytes and vascular plants at boreal mires, only receiving background levels of nitrogen of about 2 kg.ha(-1)yr(-1), exhibit a time lag of more than five years in response to nitrogen and temperature rise, emphasizing the need for long-term experiments. Moreover, it shows that trophic interactions are likely to differ markedly in response to climate change and increased N deposition, and that these interactions might play an important role in controlling the change in mire vegetation composition, with implications for both carbon sequestration and methane emission.

AB Forest expansion (afforestation) is one of the main vegetation changes currently observed in peatlands worldwide in response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. We examined the relationships between plant and bird richness and frequency and extent of the forest cover in bogs of southeastern Quebec to evaluate the impact of forest expansion on typical bog species. A total of 154 plant species and 36 bird species were recorded in the 16 peatlands studied (2-189 ha). Richness and frequency of ombrotrophic plant species were negatively associated with an increase in forest cover. Yet, minerotrophic and minerotrophic-ombrotrophic species did not appear to take advantage of this decline. Afforestation influenced bird species composition by altering the vegetation structure in all strata of the bogs (fewer mosses and shrubs, more trees) and by homogenizing the spatial distribution of plant communities (open patches progressively replaced by forested patches). Peatlands of southeastern Quebec remain islands of boreal vegetation in a matrix of deciduous forests and agricultural fields, but afforestation appears to progressively reduce the diversity of peatland habitats. Afforestation does not imperil plant or bird species across their entire range, but it contributes to impoverishing regional biodiversity.

AB Increased radiative forcing is an inevitable part of global climate change, yet little is known of its potential effects on the energy fluxes in natural ecosystems. To simulate the conditions of global warming, we exposed peat monoliths (depth, 0.6 m; surface area, 2.1 m(2)) from a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA, to three infrared (IR) loading (ambient, +45, and +90 W m(-2)) and three water table (-16, -20, and -29 cm in bog and -1, -10 and -18 cm in fen) treatments, each replicated in three mesocosm plots. Net radiation (Rn) and soil energy fluxes at the top, bottom, and sides of the mesocosms were measured in 1999, 5 years after the treatments had begun. Soil heat flux (G) increased proportionately with IR loading, comprising about 3%-8% of Rn. In the fen, the effect of IR loading on G was modulated by water table depth, whereas in the bog it was not. Energy dissipation from the mesocosms occurred mainly via vertical exchange with air, as well as with deeper soil layers through the bottom of the mesocosms, whereas lateral fluxes were 10-20-fold smaller and independent of IR loading and water table depth. The exchange with deeper soil layers was sensitive to water table depth, in contrast to G, which responded primarily to IR loading. The qualitative responses in the bog and fen were similar, but the fen displayed wider seasonal variation and greater extremes in soil energy fluxes. The differences of G in the bog and fen are attributed to differences in the reflectance in the long waveband as a function of vegetation type, whereas the differences in soil heat storage may also depend on different soil properties and different water table depth at comparable treatments. These data suggest that the ecosystem-dependent controls over soil energy fluxes may provide an important constraint on biotic response to climate change.

AB The effects of peat bog harvesting and restoration on dissolved organic matter (DOM) are poorly known although DOM represents the most mobile part of organic matter in peat. The aims of our study were: (i) to determine concentrations and properties of DOM in a series of natural, harvested, and restored peatlands in eastern Quebec and (ii) to relate DOM to CO2 efflux from these bogs. We sampled pore waters at eight peat bogs and determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, humification indices derived from synchronous fluorescence spectra (humification index (HIX), ratio of intensities at 470 and 400 nm), specific absorption at 280 nm, and the humic acid (HA) content. DOC concentrations ranged from 35 to 625 mg C l(-1). The highest values were observed at a block-cut (BC) site where the ditches had been closed to stimulate restoration. This resulted in limited external drainage, DOM accumulation in deeper horizons, and an enrichment of the poorly biodegradable humic acids to about 60% of the bulk DOM. DOC concentrations increased immediately during harvesting up to 188 mg C l(-1) as a result of this ecosystem disturbance. Afterwards, DOC concentrations decreased which might be due to a low content of potential DOM of the remaining little oxidised peat. The enhanced decomposition of the remaining peat during the restoration process seems to be important for a new build-up of potential DOM, which is indicated by reincreasing DOC concentration during the restoration process. We could not relate spectroscopic properties of DOM to peat harvesting and restoration. The portion of humic acids was inversely related to CO2 efflux, indicating low substrate quality of humic acids in pore waters. The seasonal average humification indices of DOM where humic acids had been removed were positively correlated with the seasonal CO2 efflux. from the eight sites, indicating that high respiration results in an enrichment of more aromatic and complex DOM molecules. The relationships suggest that DOM composition affects CO2 efflux from peat bogs and is also driven by respiration and CO2 efflux. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands accumulate organic matter (OM) under anaerobic conditions. After drainage for forestry or agriculture, microbial respiration and peat oxidation induce OM losses and change the stoichiometry of the remaining organic material. Here, we (i) evaluate whether land use (cropland CL, grassland GL, forest FL, natural peatland NL) is associated with different peat stoichiometry, (ii) study how peat stoichiometry changes with OM content and (iii) infer the fate of nitrogen upon soil degradation. Organic C and soil N were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland degradation. OM contents (CL<GL<FL<NL), H/C, O/C, C/N ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce a progressed state of soil degradation.

AB A drained boreal bog with active drainage ditches and the introduction of forage grass was compared with a natural bog site to assess the effect of agricultural drainage on the photosynthetic capacity of boreal peatlands. In this study, the net carbon dioxide uptake and the ecosystem respiration were measured using a pair of clear and dark chambers, connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer in order to estimate the gross primary production (GPP). Environmental factors, including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), peat soil temperature, soil moisture, electrical conductivity and water table depth (WTD), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were also investigated at each site. Our results confirmed a correlation between water table depth, peat soil temperature, electrical conductivity and peatland productivity. Changes in electrical conductivity, water table depth, and peat soil temperature together explained 61% of gross primary productivity variance at our drained peatland pasture site. In general, plant functional types/growth forms did not have any significant difference in their GPP at the drained site except shrubs which had a significantly higher GPP at PAR level greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, p < 0.001). At the natural site, GPP was significantly higher at the hollow (0.168 +/- 0.02 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.098 +/- 0.01 mg/m(2)/s) where relatively the higher WTD was recorded. We therefore concluded that water shortage to the shallow rooting depth of shrubs on our hummock subplots may be the cause of the low productivity. At PAR greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s, productivity at the hollow was still significantly higher (0.17 +/- 0.002 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.10 +/- 0.00 mg/m(2)/s). This suggests that, for ecosystem carbon modelling, the minimum PAR level at which the GPP is estimated is very crucial. All the growth forms at the drained site recorded a significantly higher GPP than the microforms at the natural site. We speculate that not only hydrological changes via agricultural drainage can affect the carbon balance of boreal peatland ecosystem through photosynthesis, but also the hydrological changes in the peat due to the differences in peat soil makeup, structure and density. We, therefore, conclude that differences in microtopography and the corresponding changes in vegetation, land-use practice and its effects on peat soil properties and hydrology should be taken into account when modelling the gross primary production in a peatland ecosystem.

AB Peatlands characteristically accumulate organic matter due to low decomposition rates, but peatland disturbance alters local physicochemical conditions often resulting in loss of soil organic matter and emission of CO2. Restoration may reduce peat oxidation, but traditional measurements of decomposition are time-consuming. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) is a simple, standardized method to measure decomposition rates in soils. We used the TBI to measure decomposition rate at four restored peatland sites across Canada that were used for peat extraction or disturbed by oil extraction (former well-sites), comparing to undisturbed and unrestored sites. We measured environmental conditions including soil temperature, water table position and peat pH from May to August 2016. Litter bags were buried for one year alongside tea bags at one site for a direct comparison of decomposition rates between the methods. There were no significant differences for TBI decay constant (k(TBI)) between treatments of restored, unrestored or undisturbed sites across the whole data set, but some differences were found among treatments within the same peatland site for sections restored at different times in the past. Soil temperature, pH, and water table were not significantly related to k(TBI), but were negatively correlated with the stabilization factor (S). The k(TBI) and litter bag k were significantly different but positively correlated. The TBI is not easily comparable to traditional litter bags, but is less costly in both time and money, and may be used in conjunction with additional parameters to determine decomposition patterns with potential for use as a metric for evaluating restoration outcomes.

AB A better understanding of past long-term environmental changes in the subarctic region is crucial for mitigation of the possible negative effects of climate warming in this vulnerable region. This study provides a new multi-proxy reconstruction of regional vegetation changes and peatland development for north-eastern Fennoscandia (Russia) during most of the Holocene. To that purpose, we performed plant macrofossil, pollen, testate amoebae, peat humification, loss on ignition and radiocarbon analyses of the peat deposits from a mire around Vodoprovodnoe Lake (the Kindo Peninsula, the Republic of Karelia). Our data indicate that the peat deposits started accumulating before 9147 +/- 182 cal. yr. BP. The vegetation cover in the area was mainly typical for the northern taiga zone, except for the period similar to 7800-5600 cal. yr. BP, when it generally resembled the middle taiga zone. The vegetation cover and peatland were greatly affected by reoccurring fires, which can be partly related to human activity. These events were associated with an increased proportion of birch in the vegetation cover (as a pioneer species) and/or water level decreases. By 600 cal. yr. BP, the peatland and the surrounding vegetation reached its current state and only minor changes had been recorded since that time. Overall, our results suggest a considerable and unexpected role of fires in the postglacial dynamics of subarctic peatlands.

AB As far as is currently known, patterned fens of the Great Sandy Region (GSR; Australia) are globally unique in that they arise from the particular hydrological characteristics of a sub-tropical coastal dune system. This article outlines their extent, distribution, characteristics, values and threats. Seven distinct clusters of fens, containing 700 ha of obvious 'patterning' resembling that in temperate mires, cover a total area of around 7,000 ha within largely acidic (pH < 5) wet heath ecosystems. Unlike patterned mires in the Northern Hemisphere dominated by Sphagnum (moss) species, these examples are dominated by the restiad species Empodisma minus. Habitat is provided for many endangered fauna including frogs and fish adapted to the unusually acidic conditions. All of the GSR fens fall within the proposed Great Sandy World Heritage Area. The carbon sequestration process that characterises peaty environments makes these fens a fertile source of information on many aspects of environmental history. They are intrinsically sensitive to fluctuations in rainfall, evaporation and sea level, and thus to climate change. A more direct key threat is extraction of resources including, notably, groundwater. However, the fens have remained largely free from human disturbance since the early Holocene and, with their identification and recognition, the challenge now is to maintain these systems in their natural state and continue benefiting from the ecosystem services provided as a result of their excellent condition.

AB Ecological gradients have always been a central theme of plant ecology. Yet, very little is known on the bog-lagg-mineral land gradient. Improved knowledge of this gradient is important to the understanding of wetland plant ecology and wetland delineation alike. In this study, the relation between vegetation composition and peat thickness is analysed in 20 raised bogs of eastern Canada using split moving window dissimilarity analysis. Four different transition types are identified: (1) an abrupt transition without an ecotonal community; (2) a narrow transition with a lagg-swamp ecotonal community (most common transition type); (3) a narrow transition with two ecotonal communities (a lagg-fen and a lagg-swamp); and (4) a broad transition with a large wetland adjacent to the bog. Laggs that could be defined as separate habitat (type 1) occured, on average, on peat soil over 30 cm thick (defined as > 30 % dry mass of organic matter), making the lagg an integral part of the peatland complex. Other unique features of the lagg are: (1) a very densely structured habitat where trees, shrubs, herbs and Sphagnum mosses are abundant; (2) soils characterised by relatively high contents of total nitrogen and total phosphorus, but a particularly low N:P ratio (8.7 +/- A 2.5); and (3) a relatively high water table, which fluctuates substantially (from -33 to +10 cm in site A; from -12 to +10 in site B).

DT Article
ID FOREST ZONE; HOLOCENE; WETLANDS; CLIMATE; CYCLE
AB The Western Siberian lowlands (WSL) are the world's largest high-latitude wetland, and possess over 900,000 km(2) of peatlands. The peatlands of the WSL are of major importance to high-latitude hydrology, carbon storage and environmental history. Analysis of the existing Russian data suggests that the mean depth of peat accumulation in the WSL is 256 cm and the total amount of carbon stored there may exceed 53,836 million metric tons. A synthesis of published and unpublished radiocarbon dates indicates that the peatlands first developed at the end of the Last Glacial, with a rapid phase of initiation between 11,000 and 10,000 cal yr BP. Initiation slowed after 8000 cal yr BP and reached a nadir at 4000 cal yr BP. There has been renewed initiation, particularly south of 62degreesN, following 4000 cal yr BP. The initial development of peatlands in the WSL corresponds with the warming at the close of the Pleistocene. Cooling after 4000 Cal yr BP has likely led to increased permafrost and increased peatland development particularly in central and southern regions. Cold and dry conditions in the far north may have inhibited peatland formation in the late Holocene. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are important contributors to global biodiversity, yet drainage and land management practices continue to affect many. We studied changes in a 114-ha raised bog remnant in northern New Zealand by assessing the vegetation and peat from 1974 to 2017, a period of agricultural conversion and intensification, and by comparing it with an intact bog. Over 43 years the remnant experienced significant water table drawdown, resulting in changes in vegetation composition and extirpation of species. However, the keystone peat-forming restiads (Restionaceae), Empodisma robustum and Sporadanthus ferrugineus, are still present. Between 1997 and 2017, concentrations in peat of N and K increased significantly but the concentration of P which, initially, was already higher than in the intact bog, did not increase. Foliar analysis of the ericoid mycorrhizal shrub Epacris pauciflora revealed significantly higher N and P, lower N/P and less depleted delta N-15 compared with the intact bog. Although raised bogs are inherently P-limited, the nature of the limitation appears to be changing at the remnant, with P becoming less limiting, a likely side effect of local fertiliser application. An ecological tipping point may be imminent, accompanied by a switch to higher productivity and expansion of woody species which are better adapted to lowered water table and increased nutrients.

AB Several studies on the impact of climate warming have indicated that peat decomposition/mineralization will be enhanced. Most of these studies deal with the impact of experimental warming during summer when prevalent abiotic conditions are favorable to decomposition. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental air warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) on water-extractable organic matter (WEOM), microbial biomasses and enzymatic activities in two contrasted moisture sites named Bog and Fen sites, the latter considered as the wetter ones. While no or few changes in peat temperature and water content appeared under the overall effect of OTCs, we observed that air warming smoothed water content differences and led to a decrease in mean peat temperature at the warmed Bog sites. This thermal discrepancy between the two sites led to contrasting changes in microbial structure and activities: a rise in hydrolytic activity at the warmed Bog sites and a relative enhancement of bacterial biomass at the warmed Fen sites. These features were not associated with any change in WEOM properties namely carbon and sugar contents and aromaticity, suggesting that air warming did not trigger any shift in OM decomposition. Using various tools, we show that the use of single indicators of OM decomposition can lead to fallacious conclusions.
   Lastly, these patterns may change seasonally as a consequence of complex interactions between groundwater level and air warming, suggesting the need to improve our knowledge using a high time-resolution approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The modern floristic composition of the principal raised bogs of Wales is significantly altered compared with their histories of development from the early to mid Holocene. This paper uses pollen and plant inacrofossil records from two raised bogs together with previously published data from a further two sites to explore the key factors contributing to the present condition of Welsh ombrotrophic plant communities. Results show Betula and Molinia invasion is a recent feature of bog development in Wales. Previous Holocene 'dry-phases' were characterized by Ericaceae and Pinus establishment, supporting recent experimental evidence that Betula and Molinia encroachment is primarily a response to nitrogen (N) loading rather than desiccation on intact bogs. Several of the bogs featured in this study also show severe signs of structural damage, not only from peat cutting but, in the case of Cors Caron, from channel processes in the adjacent River Teifi. Radiocarbon dating and inter-site comparisons of peat accumulation rates show that Rhos Goch Common in particular has been heavily impacted by peripheral peat cutting, leading to de-watering, significant subsidence of its peat dome and the spread of hummock and high dry ridge communities. Finally, the decline and local extinction of Sphaginum austiniii in bogs across Europe represents one of the most significant changes in ombrotrophic community composition in the late Holocene. Co-registered pollen and macrofossil evidence from Cors Caron demonstrates that increases in landuse intensity over the last 2000 years are temporally associated with reductions in the abundance of S. austinii and ultimately its local disappearance from the palaeoecological record.

AB In peat soils, decomposition and degradation reduce the proportion of large pores by breaking down plant debris into smaller fragments and infilling inter-particle pore spaces. This affects water flow and solute migration which, in turn, influence reactive transport processes and biogeochemical functions. In this study we conducted flow-through reactor experiments to investigate the interplay between pore structure and solute transport in samples of undegraded and degraded peat collected in Canada and Germany, respectively. The pore size distributions and transport parameters were characterised using the breakthrough curve and two-region non-equilibrium transport model analyses for a non-reactive solute. The results of transport characterisation showed a higher fraction of immobile pores in the degraded peat with higher diffusive exchanges of solutes between the mobile and immobile pores associated with the dual-porosity structure. The rates of steady-state potential nitrate reduction were compared with pore fractions and exchange coefficients to investigate the influence of pore structure on the rates of nitrate reduction. The results indicated that the degraded peat has potential to provide the necessary boundary conditions to support nitrate removal and serves as a favourable substrate for denitrification, due to the nature of its pore structure and its lower organic carbon content compared to undegraded peat.

AB Peatlands can be classified into fens and bogs based on their hydrology. Development of fens to bogs is accompanied by the invasion of Sphagnum species. The purpose of this study was to determine how the decomposition process in fens is influenced by the transition from a vascular plant-dominated system to a Sphagnum-dominated system. We carried out a reciprocal litter bag experiment, using litter of Carex diandra C. lasiocarpa, Sphagnum papillosum and S. squarrosum in a fen dominated by Sphagnum species and a fen without Spagnum. Decomposition rare and nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics of the plant Jitter were measured in a field experiment for two years. Decomposition rate was highest for the Carex litter types and lowest for the Sphagnum litter types. Surprisingly, decomposition rates hardly differed between the two sites. Nutrient dynamics, however, showed a clear site-effect: In the Sphagnum site net mineraIization was observed for all litter types whereas in the Carer site net immobilization was observed. These results show that carbon and nutrient cycles were coupled in a different way in a Sphagnum-dominated and a Carex-dominated site, respectively. Nutrient availability and adaptation of the microbial community to nutritional and other environmental conditions may be the main regulators of carbon and nutrient cycles in these peatlands.

AB The majority of northern peatlands were initiated during the Holocene. Owing to their mass imbalance, they have sequestered huge amounts of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. Although recent syntheses have filled some knowledge gaps, the extent and remoteness of many peatlands pose challenges to developing reliable regional carbon accumulation estimates from observations. In this work, we employed an individual- and patch-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) with peatland and permafrost functionality to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates in northern peatlands and to assess the effects of historical and projected future climate change on peatland carbon balance. We combined published datasets of peat basal age to form an up-to-date peat inception surface for the pan-Arctic region which we then used to constrain the model. We divided our analysis into two parts, with a focus both on the carbon accumulation changes detected within the observed peatland boundary and at pan-Arctic scale under two contrasting warming scenarios (representative concentration pathway-RCP8.5 and RCP2.6). We found that peatlands continue to act as carbon sinks under both warming scenarios, but their sink capacity will be substantially reduced under the high-warming (RCP8.5) scenario after 2050. Areas where peat production was initially hampered by permafrost and low productivity were found to accumulate more carbon because of the initial warming and moisture-rich environment due to permafrost thaw, higher precipitation and elevated CO2 levels. On the other hand, we project that areas which will experience reduced precipitation rates and those without permafrost will lose more carbon in the near future, particularly peatlands located in the European region and between 45 and 55 degrees N latitude. Overall, we found that rapid global warming could reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern peatlands in the coming decades.

AB Following a summer drought, intact cores of peat soil from two cool temperate peatlands (a rain-fed bog and a groundwater-fed swamp) were exposed experimentally to three different water table levels. The goal was to examine recovery of anaerobic methanogenesis and to evaluate peat soil decomposition to methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) upon rewetting. Methane emission from soils to the atmosphere was greatest (mean = 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) when the entire peat core was rewetted quickly; emission was negligible at low water level and when peat cores were rewetted gradually. Rates of CO2 emission (mean = 1.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were relatively insensitive to water level. Concentrations of CH4 in soil air spaces suggest that onset of methanogenesis induces, but later represses, aerobic oxidation of CH4 above the water table. Concentrations of CO2 suggest production at the soil surface of swamp peat versus at greater depths in bog peat. Portions of peat soil incubated in vitro without oxygen (O-2) exhibited a lag before the onset of methanogenesis, and the lag time was less in peat from the cores rewetted quickly. The inhibition of methanogenesis by the selective inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES) decreased CO2 production by 20 to 30% but resulted in an increase in concentrations of DOC by 2 to 5 times. The results show that methanogens in peat soils tolerate moderate drought, and recovery varies among different peat types. In peat soils, the inhibition of methanogenesis might enhance DOC availability.

AB We describe the relationships between vegetation patterns, depth of sediment accumulation, and distance to shore in Arcadia Bog, a small moat bog in Belchertown, Massachusetts. A Fringe Moat community occurs Primarily where sediment depths are 0-2 m and at 0-10 m from shore. Shrub Thickets are least restricted in their distribution, occurring at 0-30 m from shore above 0-10 m of sediment. The true bog community (Dwarf Tree/Shrub) is divided into two types-Tamarack/Spruce centered at 15-25 m from shore above 7-11 m of sediment and Spruce/Tamarack at the deeper, more distant central portion of the basin (20-40 m from shore, 10-13 m depth). This community is uncommon in central Massachusetts. Variations in surface-water pH suggest that the distributions of at least some species may be influenced by nutrient availability. Additional studies would be required to determine the relationship between physiographic location and water chemistry and flow, the ecological factors most likely controlling vegetation patterns in Arcadia Bog.

AB Most wetlands in the central European lowlands have been severely altered by cultivation. As a consequence they no longer fulfil their function as habitats for specialised species and communities, nor as retention areas for water and solid materials. Therefore, a number of renaturation experiments are in progress, which intend to develop and test strategies and measures to improve this defect in landscape diversity. For this purpose experiments on re-wetting, nutrient depletion of eutrophicated areas and re-establishment of typical wetland plant species and phytocoenoses have been performed. An ecological development concept defining the aims and describing their feasibility precedes such experiments. Preliminary results indicate that the reconstruction of the former state (regeneration) is impossible within reasonable time spans. In drained raised bogs overgrown with heather, as well as in those which have been industrially exploited, the primary aim must always be to restore efficient peat formation as far as possible; as a rule one succeeds only with well-growing and nutrient-demanding fen and transitional bog species. In cultivated fens the aim is to reduce peat loss. As a first step this is accomplished by converting arable fields and sown meadows into permanent grassland, if possible with reduced fertilization and low mowing or grazing frequencies, and accompanied by rewetting during winter. Many experiments have sought to impoverish eutrophicated fen soils and introduce typical fen species by sowing or planting, so well tested techniques are available. However, the total prevention of peat loss is only possible by permanent rewetting throughout the year, so that peat accumulation can start again. Only in this way could fens regain their former function as sinks in landscape processes.

AB The spatial variability of biogenic gas produced by methanogenic archaea is difficult to assess within saturated peat soils and is often poorly quantified. This study uses ground-penetrating radar to noninvasively estimate the vertical distribution of biogenic free-phase gas (FPG) in two distinct peat landform types in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland, Minnesota: a near-crest bog and a midslope lawn (i.e., both as defined by surface vegetation communities). Ground- penetrating radar velocities retrieved from common midpoint surveys were modeled using the Complex Refractive Index Model to estimate free-phase gas volumes along one-dimensional vertical profiles. Near-crest bog landforms are characterized by vertical variability in gas content with accumulations along the peat column up to 24% by volume of FPG localized within the deep peat (e.g., 2-4 m depth). Midslope lawn sites show lower total volumes (up to 12% free-phase gas) and less variability that result in a more even free-phase gas distribution throughout the vertical profile. High-resolution data also suggests the presence of thinner layers (<1 m) containing up to 40% free-phase gas at a near-crest site. Our results suggest that spatial distribution of free-phase gas along the peat column may vary in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands depending on peat landform. Statistical analysis supports vertical variability of ground-penetrating radar velocity data with a 95% confidence limit. Our results could potentially be upscaled using surface vegetation communities to estimate landscape-scale gas storage potential in peat landforms.

AB The short-term influence of different biofuel ashes on the growth of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) seedlings and suitable wood, peat and mixed ash doses for regulating biomass production on peat soil were studied. The experiments were conducted with I-year-old seedlings planted in vegetation pots. The growth of seedlings for different ash treatments was analysed using the variations in the absolute values of mean annual increments of the height and diameter at the root collar of seedlings, by the final heights and diameters at the end of the experiment, by the increase in height and diameters compared to corresponding initial parameters in the year of the application of ashes and finally the growth of fertilised seedlings was compared with the growth of unfertilised seedlings. In the first growing season, the growth of silver birch seedlings of all treatments exceeded that of the control seedlings. In the second growing season, the height increments of treatments with higher doses of peat and mixed ash were considerably larger than those for control seedlings. Only the application of the larger doses of peat ash increased significantly the height and radial growth over a 2-year period as a whole compared to the control. Wood ash, particularly the smaller amounts used in experiments, favoured the growth of the black alder seedlings. Along with wood ash peat ash is a promising tool in the afforestation of cut-away peatlands.

AB Historical records of mercury (Hg) accumulation in lake sediments and peat bogs are often used to estimate human impacts on the biogeochemical cycling of mercury. On the basis of studies of lake sediments, modern atmospheric mercury deposition rates are estimated to have increased by a factor of 3-5 compared to background values: i.e., from about 3-3.5 mu g Hg m(-2) yr(-1) to 10-20 mu g Hg m-2 yr(-1). However, recent studies of the historical mercury record in peat bogs suggest significantly higher increases (9-400 fold, median 40x), i.e., from about 0.6-1.7 mu g Hg m(-2) yr(-1) to 8-184 mu g Hg m(-2) yr(-1). We compared published data of background and modern mercury accumulation rates derived from globally distributed lake sediments and peat bogs and discuss reasons for the differences observed in absolute values and in the relative increase in the industrial age. Direct measurements of modern wet mercury deposition rates in remote areas are presently about 1-4,mu g m(-2) yr(-1), but were possibly as high as 20 mu g Hg m(-2) yr(-1) during the 1980s. These values are closer to the estimates of past deposition determined from lake sediments, which suggests that modern mercury accumulation rates derived from peat bogs tend to overestimate deposition. We suggest that smearing of Pb-210 in the uppermost peat sections contributes to an underestimation of peat ages, which is the most important reason for the overestimation of mercury accumulation rates in many bogs. The lower background mercury accumulation rates in peat as compared to lake sediments we believe is the result of nonquantitative retention and loss of mercury during peat diagenesis. As many processes controlling time-resolved mercury accumulation in mires are still poorly understood, lake sediments appear to be the more reliable archive for estimating historical mercury accumulation rates.

AB Global peatlands store more carbon than is naturally present in the atmosphere(1,2). However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland(3-5). Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems(6). Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions.

AB Winter climate change may result in reduced snow cover and could, consequently, alter the soil frost regime and biogeochemical processes underlying the exchange of methane (CH4) in boreal peatlands. In this study, we investigated the short-term (1-3years) vs. long-term (11years) effects of intensified winter soil frost (induced by experimental snow exclusion) on CH4 exchange during the following growing season in a boreal peatland. In the first 3years (2004-2006), lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots relative to the control coincided with delayed soil temperature increase in the treatment plots at the beginning of the growing season (May). After 11 treatment years (in 2014), CH4 emissions were lower in the treatment plots relative to the control over the entire growing season, resulting in a reduction in total growing season CH4 emission by 27%. From May to July 2014, reduced sedge leaf area coincided with lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots compared to the control. From July to August, lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the pore water of the treatment plots explained 72% of the differences in CH4 emission between control and treatment. In addition, greater Sphagnum moss growth in the treatment plots resulted in a larger distance between the moss surface and the water table (i.e., increasing the oxic layer) which may have enhanced the CH4 oxidation potential in the treatment plots relative to the control in 2014. The differences in vegetation might also explain the lower temperature sensitivity of CH4 emission observed in the treatment plots relative to the control. Overall, this study suggests that greater soil frost, associated with future winter climate change, might substantially reduce the growing season CH4 emission in boreal peatlands through altering vegetation dynamics and subsequently causing vegetation-mediated effects on CH4 exchange.

AB Understanding the responses of the carbon-rich peatland ecosystems to past climate change is crucial for predicting peat carbon fate in the future. Here we presented a data synthesis of peatland initiation ages, area changes, and peat carbon (C) accumulation rate variations in China since the Holocene, along with total C pool estimates. The data showed different controls of peatland expansion and C accumulation in different regions. The peat C accumulation rates were 32.3 (ranging from 20.7 to 50.2) g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and 14.7 (ranging from 7.4 to 36.5) g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Northeast China (NEC). The peaks of peatland expansion and C accumulation in the QTP occurred in the early Holocene in response to high summer insolation and strong summer-winter climate seasonality. The rapid peatland expansion and maximum C accumulation rate in the NEC occurred in the middle-late Holocene. Peatlands scattered in the coastal and lakeside regions of China expanded rapidly at the onset of the Holocene due to large transgression, consistent with the stronger summer insolation and monsoon, and during the middle and late Holocene, as a response to the high and stable sea level and the strong summer monsoon. The carbon storage of peatlands in China was estimated as 2.17 (ranging from 1.16 to 3.18) Pg, among which 1.49 (ranging from 0.58 to 2.40) Pg was contributed by peatlands in the QTP, 021 (ranging from 0.11 to 0.31) Pg by those in the NEC, and 0.47 Pg by those scattered in other regions of China. Our comparison of peatlands dynamics among regions in China showed that climate and monsoon are the essential factors in determining the expansion and carbon accumulation patterns of peatlands, although their effects on peatland formation and C accumulation is complex owing to land availability in peatland basins and regional moisture conditions.

AB Peat bogs represent archives of mercury content in the atmosphere. This research is aimed at a homogeneity study of mercury content in peat layers. A small-scale peat bog in the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic was selected for this purpose. This locality evinces the parameters of a natural mountain bog. Additionally, the bog is influenced by ground water.
   Nine peat cores were collected from three sampling sites at the bog. The mercury contents at particular depths of the studied cores showed significant variability even within each sampling site. The depth profiles evinced a general decline in mercury content in lower peat layers with local maxima. In addition, an analytical procedure for the determination of three mercury forms contained in the peat was used. Mercury bound to humic substances was determined by sequential extraction, and the content of Hg-0 was determined using thermal desorption. The residual mercury fraction was defined as the mercury incorporated in the organic matrix of the peat. Thus, the depth profiles of peat layers do not lose their information about mercury behavior despite the hydrological conditions of the locality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water table depth (WTD) effects on net ecosystem CO2 exchange of boreal peatlands are largely mediated by hydrological effects on peat biogeochemistry and the eco-physiology of peatland vegetation. The lack of representation of these effects in carbon models currently limits our predictive capacity for changes in boreal peatland carbon deposits under potential future drier and warmer climates. We examined whether a process-level coupling of a prognostic WTD with (1) oxygen transport, which controls energy yields from microbial and root oxidation-reduction reactions, and (2) vascular and nonvascular plant water relations could explain mechanisms that control variations in net CO2 exchange of a boreal fen under contrasting WTD conditions, i.e., shallow vs. deep WTD. Such coupling of eco-hydrology and biogeochemistry algorithms in a process-based ecosystem model, ecosys, was tested against net ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements in a western Canadian boreal fen peatland over a period of drier-weather-driven gradual WTD drawdown. A May-October WTD drawdown of similar to 0.25m from 2004 to 2009 hastened oxygen transport to microbial and root surfaces, enabling greater microbial and root energy yields and peat and litter decomposition, which raised modeled ecosystem respiration (R-e) by 0.26 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) per 0.1m of WTD drawdown. It also augmented nutrient mineralization, and hence root nutrient availability and uptake, which resulted in improved leaf nutrient (nitrogen) status that facilitated carboxylation and raised modeled vascular gross primary productivity (GPP) and plant growth. The increase in modeled vascular GPP exceeded declines in modeled nonvascular (moss) GPP due to greater shading from increased vascular plant growth and moss drying from near-surface peat desiccation, thereby causing a net increase in modeled growing season GPP by 0.39 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) per 0.1m of WTD drawdown. Similar increases in GPP and Re caused no significant WTD effects on modeled seasonal and interannual variations in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). These modeled trends were corroborated well by eddy covariance measured hourly net CO2 fluxes (modeled vs. measured: R-2 similar to 0.8, slopes similar to 1 +/- 0.1, intercepts similar to 0: 05 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), hourly measured automated chamber net CO2 fluxes (modeled vs. measured: R-2 similar to 0: 7, slopes similar to 1 +/- 0.1, intercepts similar to 0.4 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), and other biometric and laboratory measurements. Modeled drainage as an analog for WTD drawdown induced by climate-change-driven drying showed that this boreal peatland would switch from a large carbon sink (NEP similar to 160 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) to carbon neutrality (NEP similar to 10 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) should the water table deepen by a further similar to 0.5 m. This decline in projected NEP indicated that a further WTD drawdown at this fen would eventually lead to a decline in GPP due to water limitation. Therefore, representing the effects of interactions among hydrology, biogeochemistry and plant physiological ecology on ecosystem carbon, water, and nutrient cycling in global carbon models would improve our predictive capacity for changes in boreal peatland carbon sequestration under changing climates.

AB After rewetting of peatlands, phosphorus (P) pore-water concentrations were up to three orders of magnitude greater than under pristine conditions. It was hypothesized that different mobilization processes such as ion-exchange reactions, biotic/abiotic redox reactions, acidification and ongoing anaerobic decomposition of particulate organic matter by hydrolytic cleavage and fermentation might be responsible. To identify P pools in peat samples of varying degrees of decomposition, we modified and improved a sequential chemical extraction method that allowed conclusions on potential mobilization mechanisms in rewetted peatlands. The results indicated that the earlier drainage of rewetted fens strongly increased the P mobilization potential in the upper decomposed peat layers. Accordingly, the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive (bicarbonate/dithionite soluble) compounds (BD-P) was, on average, one order of magnitude greater in decomposed peat of rewetted fens (5.4-14.3 mu mol P g(-1) dry matter or DM) than in underlying less-decomposed peat layers (0.2-1.9 mu mol P g(-1) DM) or slightly decomposed peat derived from pristine fens (0.4-2.0 mu mol P g(-1) DM). The BD-P fraction found in the upper very decomposed peat layers appears to be most important for P mobilization in rewetted fens and accounted for 85% of the variability of P mobilization rates. Despite uncertainties regarding P diagenetic processes in peat, as well as the development of microbial decomposition processes, in the long-term, high pore-water P concentrations can be expected in rewetted fens for decades to come.

AB A long-term introduction experiment conducted in 2009-2016 revealed that in the harshest weather conditions of the northern part of Belarus associated with a difficult environmental situation in a trial area, on weakly-decomposed acid sphagnum peat and with the lack of artificial watering, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) due to the significant tolerance to harsh conditions in the environment is still able to fulfil its bioproductive potential. Lowbush blueberry plants formed a continuous bush cover and showed high resistance to cold. A sustainable cultivated plantation formed. Plant cover protected a peat substrate from fires; water and wind erosion, and showed a high level of berry fruit productivity during the Whole recorded period. It proves the appropriateness of the ecological-biological type of the species to the extreme weather and conditions of the experiment. However, lowbush blueberry plants showed a need for improved mineral nutrition. The implementation of these conditions is a guarantee of successful introduction of the plant on the cutover raised-bog peatlands in northern Belarus.

AB Subfossil black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) stems from permafrost mires in a 250-km(2) area at the arctic tree-line, near the eastern coast of Hudson Ray, were sampled for the construction of a long 'light-ring' chronology spanning the late Holocene. Thirty-three out of the 143 sampled spruce logs were C-14-dated yielding dates between 4580 and 1540 BP (3550-3010 cal. sc - cal. AD 377-649). Light rings (rings with thin-walled latewood cells or showing reduced latewood cell development) were numerous in all the studied stem discs and a set of 47 logs was successfully cross-dated. The cross-dated trees were used to build seven 'floating' light-ring chronologies located between c. 1200 cal. sc and cal. AD 500 (i.e., c. 1200 to 1000 cal. sc, 900 to 800 cal, sc, 700 to 400 cal. sc, 700 to 500 ed. sc, 100 cal. sc to ed. Ao 300, cal. Ao 50 to 450 and cal. AD 400 to 500). The large number of light rings in mire spruces appears to be associated with particular growth conditions in mires. A comparison of the frequency of light rings in extant spruce growing in mires and in dry-mesic sites showed that light rings were more common in peatland trees during this century. A delayed growing season caused by late peat thaw may possibly explain the difference between the two groups of sampled trees.

AB The form of the species richness-productivity relationship (SRPR) is both theoretically important and contentious. In an effort to distill general patterns, ecologists have undertaken meta-analyses, within which each SRPR data set is first classified into one of five alternative forms: positive, humped (unimodal), negative, U-shaped (unimodal), and no relationship. Herein, I first provide a critique of this approach, based on 68 plant data sets/studies used in three meta-analyses published in Ecology. The meta-analyses are shown to have resulted in highly divergent outcomes, inconsistent and often highly inappropriate classification of data sets, and the introduction and multiplication of errors from one meta-analysis to the next. I therefore call on the ecological community at large to adopt a far more rigorous and critical attitude to the use of meta-analysis. Second, I develop the argument that the literature on the SRPR continues to be bedeviled by a common failing to appreciate the fundamental importance of the scale of analysis, beginning with the confusion evident between concepts of grain, focus, and extent. I postulate that variation in the form of the SRPR at fine scales of analysis owes much to artifacts of the sampling regime adopted. An improved understanding may emerge from combining sampling theory with an understanding of the factors controlling the form of species abundance distributions and species accumulation curves.

AB Questions: What vegetation changes occurred over three decades on two large temperate peatlands (1115 ha) isolated in an agricultural landscape and affected by a human-ignited fire?
   Location: Southwest Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: In 2012, we revisited 103 plots first sampled in 1984-85. Changes in species composition were evaluated using the Sorensen dissimilarity index, in species frequency with Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, and in species cover using one-sample t-tests. Tree encroachment was evaluated using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. We used linear discriminant analyses (LDA) and ANOVA to evaluate the impact of tree encroachment on species composition.
   Results: We found a floristic dissimilarity of 35% between 1984 and 1985 and 2012. Most species whose frequency and mean cover increased were peatland species, while most species with lower frequency and mean cover in 2012 were non-peatland species. The total area occupied by forest increased from 26% to 51%, an overall gain of 280 ha of forest. The species composition of old and new forests as well as of open sectors was highly distinct, as shown by the LDA that correctly assigned 97% of the sampling plots to these groups. Non-peatland species were 15 and five timesmore abundant than peatland species in old and new forests than open habitats, respectively.
   Conclusions: Gradual drying of the peatland margins due to drainage of the surrounding catchment, as well as post-fire succession are likely the main drivers of the changes observed. Overall, our study showed that peatlands isolated in an anthropogenic landscape are dynamic ecosystems where vegetation communities can experience substantial changes in a short time frame. The broader implication is that peatland conservation in highly modified landscapes must be linked to restoration.

AB The conservation or restoration of seminatural vegetation often involves measures that influence the availability of nutrients and consequently the plant species composition., The ability to predict effects of modified nutrient availability on species composition would therefore help to choose appropriate management strategies. The aim of this study was to test whether short-term effects of nitrogen or phosphorus enrichment can be predicted from nutrient ratios in plant biomass. At 11 species-rich sites in,Dutch fens and dune slacks, small plots Were fertilized with N, P, N + P, or not fertilized (control). The aboveground biomass, N and P concentrations, and N:P ratios, were compared between fertilized and control plots for all sufficiently abundant plant populations in the summers preceding and following fertilization. Of 121 populations, only 45 had their biomass enhanced significantly by fertilization. Populations enhanced by P fertilization had on average higher biomass N:P ratios than those enhanced by N,. due to higher N and lower P concentrations. However, N:P ratios did not differ among populations enhanced by N, N + P, or neither nutrient. High biomass N:P ratios (>20) therefore indicated that a plant population would probably respond to P-fertilization, but low or intermediate N:P ratios (<20) did not indicate whether the population would respond to N or N + P fertilization. The predictive value of N:P ratios was not higher if only species from one site or only species with the same growth form were considered. It is concluded that N:P ratios are not suitable to predict how changed nutrient supply will affect plant species composition, especially in the long term. However, results suggest that biomass N:P ratios do reflect the relative availability of N and P to plants and may indicate the degree of N or P deficiency experienced by a plant population even more reliably than fertilization experiments. N:P ratios can be used to investigate how the relative availability of N and P influences various ecological processes and how it is affected by human. impacts or management.

AB The degree to which vegetation and site type have influenced fire regimes through the Holocene has not been investigated in detail in the temperate ecosystems of southern Patagonia. Here we present a first attempt using a paired-basin approach to study the evolution of fire regimes in sectors dominated by humid Nothofagus forests and the xeric Patagonian steppe in the Magallanes region of Chilean Patagonia (51 degrees S). We analyzed sediment cores from two small lakes and a bog located within the same climate zone on opposite sides of the forest-steppe ecotone, similar to 28 km apart. The position of this biological boundary east of the Andes is controlled by the strength and position of the southern westerly winds, which constitute the sole source of precipitation throughout western Patagonia. Our results indicate that fires have occurred in the study region repeated times over the last similar to 13,000 years at bi- and tridecadal timescales. Sectors currently dominated by Patagonian steppe feature high frequency and low magnitude of local fires, and vice versa in humid forests. Climate-driven expansion of Nothofagus scrubland/woodland into steppe environments over the last similar to 4,200 years increased the magnitude and lowered the frequency of fire events, culminating with peak Nothofagus abundance, fire magnitude and frequency during the last millennium. We also detect divergences between lake-based vs. bog-based paleofire histories among paired sites located within the Patagonian steppe, similar to 12 km apart, which we attribute to local burning of the bog at times of lowered water table. This divergence suggests to us that bog-based vegetation and fire histories exacerbate a local, azonal, signal blurring extra-local or regional regimes, thus accounting for some discrepancies in the Quaternary paleovegetation/paleoclimate literature of southern Patagonia.

AB This study examined daily, seasonal, and interannual variations in CH4 emissions at a temperate peatland over a 5-year period. We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange ( NEE), CH4 flux, water table depth, peat temperature, and meteorological parameters weekly from the summers ( 1 May to 31 August) of 2000 through 2004 at Sallie's Fen in southeastern New Hampshire, United States. Significant interannual differences, driven by high variability of large individual CH4 fluxes ( ranging from 8.7 to 3833.1 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) occurring in the late summer, corresponded with a decline in water table level and an increase in air and peat temperature. Monthly timescale yielded the strongest correlations between CH4 fluxes and peat and air temperature (r(2) = 0.78 and 0.74, respectively) and water table depth (WTD) (r(2) = 0.53). Compared to daily and seasonal timescales, the monthly timescale was the best timescale to predict CH4 fluxes using a stepwise multiple regression (r(2) = 0.81). Species composition affected relationships between CH4 fluxes and measures of plant productivity, with sedge collars showing the strongest relationships between CH4 flux, water table, and temperature. Air temperature was the only variable that was strongly correlated with CH4 flux at all timescales, while WTD had either a positive or negative correlation depending on timescale and vegetation type. The timescale dependence of controls on CH4 fluxes has important implications for modeling.

AB White horticultural peat is a microbiologically active growing medium which binds significant quantities of nutrients and water due to its favourable cation exchange capacity and porosity. Unfortunately, horticultural peat is only very slowly renewable, and good quality horticultural peat is not common even in peatland-rich countries. Therefore, good-quality and simultaneously renewable alternative growing media are needed. A new growing medium based on Sphagnum moss biomass is introduced in this study. According to our results, harvesting of Sphagnum biomass to a depth of no more than 30 cm will have a relatively short-term effect on Sphagnum carpet coverage and carbon sequestration, allowing a harvesting cycle of similar to 30 years to be achieved. Therefore, the average harvesting depth will be 30 cm. Only half of the mire surface on each harvesting area will be utilised, the other half being kept intact for transportation routes. This will also secure a reserve of Sphagnum mosses for reseeding and recovery. The end product - Sphagnum biomass based growing medium - will be truly renewable, and environmental effects will be negligible compared with conventional extraction of white horticultural peat. Therefore, Sphagnum biomass harvesting is more comparable with sustainable forestry management than with the production of white peat, which causes drastic and long-term alterations of the mire ecosystem.

AB Peatlands perform important ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage and nutrient retention, which are affected, among other factors, by vegetation and peat decomposition. The availability of silicon (Si) in peatlands differs strongly, ranging from <1 to >25 mg L-1. Since decomposition of organic material was recently shown to be accelerated by Si, the aim of this study was to examine how Si influences decomposition of carbon and nutrient and toxicant mobilization in peatlands. We selected a fen site in Northern Bavaria with naturally bioavailable Si pore water concentrations of 5 mg/L and conducted a Si addition experiment. At a fourfold higher Si availability, dissolved organic carbon, carbon dioxide, and methane concentrations increased significantly. Furthermore, dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, manganese, cobalt, zinc, and arsenic concentrations were significantly higher under high Si availability. This enhanced mobilization may result from Si competing for binding sites but also from stronger reducing conditions, caused by accelerated respiration. The stronger reducing conditions also increased reduction of arsenate to arsenite and thus the mobility of this toxicant. Hence, higher Si availability is suggested to decrease carbon storage and increase nutrient and toxicant mobility in peatland ecosystems.

AB Peatlands store roughly one-third of the terrestrial soil carbon and release the, potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, making these wetlands among the most important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Despite their importance, the controls of anaerobic decomposition of organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 within peatlands are not well understood. It is known, however, that the enzymes responsible for CH4 production require cobalt, iron and nickel, and there is a growing appreciation for the potential role of trace metal limitation in anaerobic decomposition. To explore the possibility of trace metal limitation in peatlands, we washed 3 peat soils with either PbCl2, to remove available trace metals, or distilled water. Following these washes, we added trace metals (as CoCl2, CuCl2, FeCl2, PbCl2 and NiCl2) to each soil. We measured anaerobic CH4 and CO2 production in laboratory incubations over 4 weeks before adding glucose as a labile carbon source and measuring CH4 and CO2 production for an additional 4 weeks. In all 3 soils, neither CH4 nor CO2 production were limited by individual trace metals, even following the wash with PbCl2 to remove available metals. Further, in response to the addition of a labile carbon substrate, all soils supported increased rates of CH4 and CO2 production without progressive trace metal limitation. Taken together, our findings suggest that individual trace metals may not be limiting to anaerobic decomposition in many peatland soils.

AB Background: Although forest floor forms a large biomass pool in forested peatlands, little is known about its role in ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics.
   Aim: We aimed to quantify forest floor photosynthesis (P-FF) and respiration (R-FF) as a part of overall C dynamics in a drained peatland forest in southern Finland.
   Methods: We measured net forest floor CO2 exchange with closed chambers and reconstructed seasonal CO2 exchange in the prevailing plant communities.
   Results: The vegetation was a mosaic of plant communities that differed in CO2 exchange dynamics. The reconstructed growing season P-FF was highest in the Sphagnum community and lowest in the feather moss communities. On the contrary, R-FF was highest in the feather moss communities and lowest in the Sphagnum community. CO2 assimilated by the forest floor was 20-30% of the total CO2 assimilated by the forest. The forest floor was a net CO2 source to the atmosphere, because respiration from ground vegetation, tree roots and decomposition of soil organic matter exceeded the photosynthesis of ground vegetation.
   Conclusions: Tree stand dominates C fluxes in drained peatland forests. However, forest floor vegetation can have a noticeable role in the C cycle of peatlands drained for forestry. Similarly to natural mires, Sphagnum moss-dominated communities were the most efficient assimilators of C.

AB Natural peatlands accumulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). They affect the global climate by binding carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing methane (CH4) to the atmosphere; in contrast fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in natural peatlands are insignificant. Changes in drainage associated with forestry alter these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus the radiative forcing (RF) of peatlands. In this paper, changes in peat and tree stand C stores, GHG fluxes and the consequent RF of Finnish undisturbed and forestry-drained peatlands are estimated for 1900-2100. The C store in peat is estimated at 5.5 Pg in 1950. The rate of C sequestration into peat has increased from 2.2 Tg a(-1) in 1900, when all peatlands were undrained, to 3.6 Tg a(--1) at present, when c . 60% of peatlands have been drained for forestry. The C store in tree stands has increased from 60 to 170 Tg during the 20th century. Methane emissions have decreased from an estimated 1.0-0.5 Tg CH4-C a(-1) , while those of N2O have increased from 0.0003 to 0.005 Tg N-2 O-N a(-1). The altered exchange rates of GHG gases since 1900 have decreased the RF of peatlands in Finland by about 3 mW m(--2) from the predrainage situation. This result contradicts the common hypothesis that drainage results in increased C emissions and therefore increased RF of peatlands. The negative radiative forcing due to drainage is caused by increases in CO2 sequestration in peat (-0.5 mW m(-2)), tree stands and wood products (-0.8 mW m(2) ), decreases in CH4 emissions from peat to the atmosphere (-1.6 mW m(-2)), and only a small increase in N2O emissions (+0.1 mW m(-2) ). Although the calculations presented include many uncertainties, the above results are considered qualitatively reliable and may be expected to be valid also for Scandinavian countries and Russia, where most forestry-drained peatlands occur outside Finland.

AB Permafrost thaw resulting from climate warming may dramatically change the succession and carbon dynamics of northern ecosystems. To examine the joint effects of regional temperature and local species changes on peat accumulation following thaw, we studied peat accumulation across a regional gradient of mean annual temperature (MAT). We measured aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and decomposition over 2 years for major functional groups and used these data to calculate a simple index of net annual aboveground peat accumulation. In addition, we collected cores from six adjacent frozen and thawed bog sites to document peat accumulation changes following thaw over the past 200 years. Aboveground biomass and decomposition were more strongly controlled by local succession than regional climate. AGNPP for some species differed between collapse scars and associated permafrost plateaus and was influenced by regional MAT. A few species, such as Picea mariana trees on frozen bogs and Sphagnum mosses in thawed bogs, sequestered a disproportionate amount of peat; in addition, changes in their abundance following thaw changed peat accumulation. Pb-210-dated cores indicated that peat accumulation doubles following thaw and that the accumulation rate is affected by historical changes in species during succession. Peat accumulation in boreal peatlands following thaw was controlled by a complex mix of local vegetation changes, regional climate, and history. These results suggest that northern ecosystems may show responses more complex than large releases of carbon during transient warming.

AB Peatlands contain around one third of the global soil carbon (C) and play an important role in the C cycle. In particular, the response of the productivity-decay balance to climate variability is critical for understanding both the past and future global C cycle. Most studies of peatland C dynamics have been carried out on boreal and subarctic peatlands, where climate models predict a greater increase in temperature compared to the global average. Less is known about peatlands at lower latitudes, yet there are significant peatland C stocks in these regions that may be more vulnerable to future climate change because they are closer to the climatic limit of peatland distribution. Northeast China is China's largest wetland region, with extensive peatlands in mountain regions and across the plains. Here, we used core data from 134 peatland sites to quantify the C accumulation rate over different timescales and estimate C storage across northeast China. The results show that the Holocene long-term apparent rate of C accumulation (LORCA) ranged from 5.74 to 129.31 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with a mean rate of 33.66 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The total wetland area and C storage within this region is 82,870 km(2) and 4.34 Gt C, and about 80% of the C is contained in mountain peatlands. We find that total C accumulated over the last 2000 years is linearly related to photosynthetically active radiation over the growing season, supporting the hypothesis that rates of net primary productivity (NPP) are more important than decomposition rates in determining long-term C accumulation. Although peatlands in northeast China are close to the southern limit of major peatland extent, our data suggest that future warming will lead to greater future C accumulation, as long as moisture balance or cloudiness do not become limiting factors.

AB High-resolution Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) C-14 dates of selected plant macrofossils from the raised bog Engberts-dijksvenen (Eastern Netherlands) show century-scale wiggles analogous to the radiocarbon calibration curve. We used three relative time scales, viz., based on depth, mass, and pollen concentration, respectively, to match the peat AMS dates to the calibration curve. This procedure is repeated for one conventionally dated core. For each relative time scale, realistic confidence intervals are calculated. Depth appears to be the best time scale for certain stratigraphical units of a core. This justifies using depth for wiggle matching conventionally dated mire cores published by others, even when C-14 errors are larger. Our evidence shows four major sources of C-14 variation for mire deposits compared to treerings: (1) dating error, due to sample composition. This includes a reservoir effect demonstrated for many bulk peat samples; (2) hiatuses, causing a sudden 'leap' of peat C-14 age; (3) changing accumulation rates, apparent from a break in the slope of the peat C-14 ages; (4) sampling error. These results shed doubt on the assumed continuities in theoretical peat accumulation models. Both mire stratigraphy and changing accumulation rates can be explained in qualitative hydrological terms. More evidence for a previously discovered reservoir effect in bog deposits is presented, though the physical/biological mechanisms remain uncertain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Planting forest on cutover peatlands may be regarded as a viable restoration technique in western Canada, where natural bogs are treed with a high density of Black Spruce, Picea mariana. Fertilizer is needed to promote P. mariana establishment on cutover peatlands; however, it also encourages spontaneous colonisation by non-peatland species such as Paper Birch, Betula papyrifera. This study aimed to assess the most appropriate fertilizer dose for P. mariana establishment and growth against the trade-off of birch invasion; consequently, we monitored the effect of B. papyrifera on P. mariana growth. Four levels of fertilizer dose were applied below-ground, but flooding of the site following planting allowed fertilizer to reach the surface and favoured the colonisation of B. papyrifera. Seven years after planting, fertilizer promoted P. mariana survival and the highest fertilizer dose improved both P. mariana and B. papyrifera growth, while the lowest fertilizer dose promoted spruce growth, to a lesser degree, without promoting birch growth as much as higher doses of fertilizer. Birch removal had a significant positive effect on the growth of P. mariana, possibly by allowing greater light penetration and higher near-surface soil moisture. Avoiding B. papyrifera colonisation on site is more effective than cutting due to the ability of birch to regenerate rapidly from stumps. In practice, if planting coniferous trees is the chosen restoration option, the risk of birch colonisation can be minimised by leaving a thicker remnant peat deposit, burying fertilizer near the planted seedlings, and planning planting to avoid flooding during the growing season post-planting whenever possible.

AB The butterflies which complete their entire life cycle within peatland habitats were documented in the Lake Superior drainage basin of northwestern Wisconsin. Seventy peatlands were inventoried over the course of the 1996 growing season, and were classified as either muskeg, kettlehole, or coastal sites. Muskeg peatlands were of similar elevation to the surrounding uplands, possessed drier and more nutrient-poor substrates, and were typically larger than other peatland types. Kettlehole peatlands were wetter and had floating Sphagnum mats which fringed lake margins or were in depressions much lower than the surrounding uplands. Coastal peatlands were located in estuaries along the Lake Superior coast, and possessed relatively eutrophic, wet soils. Muskeg sites harbored the most diverse total fauna, and possessed the highest average number of taxa per site. a highly significant correlation between habitat size and butterfly richness was observed in both muskeg and kettlehole peatlands. The muskeg fauna included five taxa not found in other peatland habitats. These species have arctic-boreal affinities and reach their southern range limit in eastern North America an these sites.

AB Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-intrusive geophysical observation method based on propagation and reflection of high-frequency electromagnetic waves in the shallow subsurface. The vertical cross-sectional images obtained allow the identification of thickness and lithologic horizons of different media, without destruction. Over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated the potential of GPR. This paper presents a review of recent GPR applications to peatlands, particularly to determine peat stratigraphy. An example study of acquisition and comparison of peatland soil thickness of a fen-dominated watershed located in the James Bay region of Quebec, using (1) a meter stick linked to a GPS RTK and (2) a GSSI GPR, is given. A coefficient of determination (r(2) ) of 56% was obtained between the ordinary krigings performed on data gathered using both techniques. Disparities occurred mainly in the vicinity of ponds which can be explained by the attenuation of GPR signal in open water. Despite these difficulties - the higher time required for analysis and the error margin - it seems more appropriate to use a GPR, instead of a graduated rod linked to a GPS, to measure the peat depths on a site like the one presented in this study. Manual measurements, which are user-dependent in the context of variable mineral substrate densities and with the presence of obstacles in the substrate, may be more subjective.

AB QuestionA better understanding of the response of Sphagnum mosses and associated vascular plants to climate warming is relevant for predicting the carbon balance of peatlands in a warmer world. Open-top chambers (OTCs) have been used to investigate the effect on soil biogeochemical processes in peatlands, but little information is available on the effects of OTCs on microclimate conditions and the associated response of the plant community. We aimed to understand how simulated warming and differences in soil moisture affect plant species cover.
   LocationA Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in French Jura.
   MethodsWe used OTCs to measure the effect of a near-ground temperature increase (+1.5 degrees C on average) on vegetation dynamics over five growing seasons (2008-2012) in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, in two adjacent microhabitats with different hydrological conditions - wet and dry. Microclimatic conditions and plant species abundance were monitored at peak biomass in years 1, 2, 3 and 5 and monthly during the plant growing season in year 5.
   ResultsThe response to warming differed between vascular plants and bryophytes, as well as among species within these groups, and also varied in relation to soil moisture. Andromeda polifolia abundance responded positively to warming, while Vaccinium oxycoccus responded negatively, and Eriophorum vaginatum showed a high resistance.
   ConclusionDepth of rooting of vascular plants appeared to control the response in plant abundance, while moss abundance depended on various other interacting factors, such as shading by the vascular plant community, precipitation and soil moisture.

AB Relations between vegetation characteristics and eco-hydrological processes were assessed in a pristine mire in the valley of the Ob River (Western Siberia). Along a transect from the terrace scarp to the river, field data were collected on vegetation composition, peat stratigraphy, peat chemistry, hydrology and hydrochemistry. Based on floristic composition, eight vegetation communities were distinguished. Hydraulic head measurements were used to obtain an indication of groundwater flow directions. The water balance of the mire was calculated with a two-dimensional steady-state numerical groundwater model. Water types were defined based on cluster analysis of hydrochemical data. The results revealed that the dominant hydrological factor in the Ob mire is the discharge of groundwater, which supplies about threefold more water than net precipitation. Although the discharge flux decreases with increasing distance from the terrace scarp, high water levels and a "groundwater-like" mire water composition were observed in the major part of the study site. Precipitation and river water play only a minor role. Despite dilution of discharging groundwater with rainwater, spatial differences in pH and solute concentrations of the surficial mire water are small and not reflected in the vegetation composition. Although small amounts of silt and clay were found in the peat in the proximity of the river, indicating the occurrence of river floods in former times, no river-flood zone could be recognized based on hydrochemical characteristics or vegetation composition. A comparison of the Ob mire with well-studied and near-natural mires in the Biebrza River valley (Poland) revealed substantial differences in both vegetation characteristics and the intensity and spatial pattern of eco-hydrological processes. Differences in the origin and ratios of water fluxes as well as a dissimilar land use history would seem to be key factors explaining the differences observed.

AB Peatlands are archives of environmental change that can be driven by climate and human activity. Proxies for peatland vegetation composition provide records of (local) environmental conditions that can be linked to both autogenic and allogenic factors. Analytical pyrolysis offers a molecular fingerprint of peat, and thereby a suite of environmental proxies. Here we investigate analytical pyrolysis as a method for biomarker analysis. Pyrolysates of 48 peatland plant species were compared, comprising seventeen lichens, three Sphagnum species, four non-Sphagnum mosses, eleven graminoids (Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Poaceae), five Ericaceae and six species from other families. This resulted in twenty-one potential biomarkers, including new markers for lichens (3-methoxy-5-methylphenol) and graminoids (ferulic acid methyl ester). The potential of the identified biomarkers to reconstruct vegetation composition is discussed according to their depth records in cores from six peatlands from boreal, temperate and tropical biomes. The occurrence of markers for Sphagnum, graminoids and lichens in all six studied peat deposits indicates that they persist in peat of thousands of years old, in different vegetation types and under different conditions. In order to facilitate the quantification of biomarkers from pyrolysates, typically expressed as proportion (%) of the total quantified pyrolysis products, an internal standard (5-alpha-androstane) was introduced. Depth records of the Sphagnum marker 4-isopropenylphenol from the upper 3 m of a Sphagnum-dominated peat, from samples analysed with and without internal standard showed a strong positive correlation (r(2) = 0.72, P < 0.0005, n = 12). This indicates that application of an internal standard is a reliable method to assess biomarker depth records, which enormously facilitates the use of analytical pyrolysis in biomarker research by avoiding quantification of a high number of products.

AB Hydrological conditions play a key role in the carbon cycle of northern peatlands. This study examines the evapotranspiration (ET) dynamics and its impact on the water and energy balance in response to differing meteorological conditions during the exceptionally dry year 2006 and the normal wet year 2007 at a boreal peatland in Finland. Energy and water vapor fluxes were determined continuously using the eddy covariance approach. Daily ET rates varied considerably during the growing season and averaged 2.23 +/- 0.15 mm d (1) and 1.59 +/- 0.07 mm d (1) in the dry and wet year, respectively. Synoptic weather conditions as reflected by incoming radiation and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the key factors controlling ET. Differences in the precipitation patterns and summer temperature also accounted for some of the observed differences in ET between the 2 years. No evidence was found for a relationship between ET rates and water table level, probably due to the relatively high water table level even in the dry year. Latent heat flux dominated the energy balance, particularly in the dry year 2006 with 60% of cumulative precipitation returned to the atmosphere through ET. In the wet year 2007, runoff dominated the water loss, and only 36% of the cumulative precipitation was returned to the atmosphere through ET. While the annual water balance regime of the peatland was mainly regulated by the precipitation pattern, daily measured ET was closely related to potential evaporation, and latent heat flux could be well modeled by the Penman-Monteith approach, suggesting two feasible schemes for ET prediction in peatlands under well watered conditions.

AB The nutrient status was studied in permanent plots Of four plant communities, two rich-fen communities and two wooded grassland communities, all formerly used for hay-making. The concentrations of N, P and K in plant material of dominant and subdominant species (above- and below- ground) were measured in plots experimentally scythed annually or biennially for two decades, and in plots unscythed for four decades. Three of the communities had an N:P ratio of 14 or less, indicating N-limitation; the most fertile grassland community had particularly low values for the N:P ratio (6-12), as did a majority of the species, including all tall-herb species. A species-rich community of fen-margin vegetation in the lowest productive rich fen, had an N:P ratio of 17-19 in the above-ground biomass, which indicates P-limitation of nutrients. Molinia caerulea and Thalictrum alpinum were found to be the vascular plants with the highest N:P ratio, indicating P-limitation of nutrients. Calculations of N:K and K:P ratios indicated possible K-limitation in the rich-fen communities, especially for Thalictrum alpinum., the species with the highest N:K value. No expected change from N- to P-limited growth was found; in contrast, a reduction in the N:P ratio was found in the annually scythed plots of the rich fens, suggesting that reduced biomass production is mainly a result of disturbance by scything. As expected, a reduction in the concentration of K was detected in the scythed plots.

TI Winter methane dynamics in a temperate peatland
SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
LA English
DT Article
AB Methane (CH4) dynamics in pore water, snow pore air, and surface emissions were investigated in a temperate poor fen in New Hampshire over several winters. Total snowfall and average air temperatures during winter months (defined as December, January, and February) were climatologic indicators of significant flux rates from this midlatitude poor fen. Average winter emissions, for the five winters ending in 1994-1995, were 20, 39, 53, 56, and 26 mg m(-2) d(-1) amounting to 2.0, 5.2, 6.6, 9.2, and 2.0% of the total annual fluxes, respectively. Totaling emissions over 5 years that represent low to average snowfall, winter accounted for 4.3% of emissions to the atmosphere. Winter flux rates were near 55 mg m(-2) d(-1) for years with average snowfall, and 25 mg m(-2) d(-1) for years with low snowfall. Concentrations of CH4 sampled in pore water immediately beneath the ice were highly variable (0 to 1.1 mM). The concentration magnitude and standard deviation increased toward the fen center and correlated with spatial variation in hydrology, peat texture, and peat depth. CH4 stores increased in the near-surface pore water as the ice cover formed. Seasonal CH4 buildup in deeper peat began near the end of the growing season, probably due to changing transport mechanisms and temperature effects on solubility. Stored CH4 in the 25- to 75-cm peat layer decreased by 2.7 g m(-2) between January and June 1995.

AB Northern peatlands contain up to 20% of the similar to 3000 Pg of global soil organic carbon. Carbon-rich peatlands cover upwards of 65% of the landscape in northern Canada where resource extraction activities disturb both the carbon pools and the future carbon sequestration capacity of the landscape. Previous estimates of the carbon losses from this disturbance predict a complete loss of the region's peatland carbon pool. Mining industries operating in these sensitive environments have recently begun constructing closure landscapes which are intended to develop carbon cycle processes similar to undisturbed northern peatlands. This study investigates eddy covariance fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) at one of Canada's first fully constructed boreal plains watersheds, the Sandhill Fen Watershed. During the first three years since inception, only the lowland region had an annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) indicative of increasing CO2 sink potential. The lowland region was characterized by saturated salvaged peat soils, standing water, thriving communities of Typha and Carex spp. and was a net CO2 sink of 77 g C m(-2) in the third year. At the same time the upland and the midland regions characterized by moist salvaged peat soils and a mix of herbaceous, shrub and planted Picea glauca and Pinus banksiana remained net sources of CO2. Despite similar rates of gross primary production, ecosystem and plot-level respiration rates in the lowland were significantly lower than in the midland region, likely due to very low reduction potentials within the lowland's saturated soils. With no other significant outflows of carbon, the lowland of the Sandhill Fen Watershed may be in the early stages of organic matter accumulation. Due to limited oxidation of the salvaged peat substrate in the lowland region, wetland reclamation employing these techniques may reduce the disturbance loss of the carbon pool in the boreal plains.

AB Peatlands are ideal archives that are widely used to reconstruct historical Hg accumulation around the world. However, decomposition of peat soils leads to Hg enrichment or depletion in peat profiles. To evaluate the impact of peat decomposition on historical Hg accumulation records, a 7800-year peat sequence from the Shenjiadian peatland (SJD-2, Sanjiang Plain, northeast China) was selected in this study. Based on the degree of peat humification and a generalized additive model (GAM), Hg accumulation rates (Hg ARs) were reconstructed and calibrated from the middle Holocene onward. The results showed that the Hg concentrations in the SJD-2 peat profile ranged from 11.9 to 55.3 ng g(-1) and that the Hg AR ranged from 0.4 to 7.0 mu g m(-2) yr(-1); these values for both parameters were lower than their corresponding values observed in other peatlands around the world. Peat decomposition led to Hg depletion in peat soils to some extent, and the GAM could be used to evaluate the impact of peat decomposition on historical Hg ARs in peat sequences based on the degree of peat humification and calibration of Hg ARs. Before the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic Hg sources caused the calibrated Hg ARs in the SJD-2 peat profile to slightly increase around 1300 cal yr BP. Similar to other regions around the world, the calibrated Hg AR on the Sanjiang Plain also obviously increased from 3 to 8 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) after global Hg emissions began to increase during the Industrial Revolution.

AB The hump-shaped relationship between plant species richness and biomass is commonly observed at fine scale for herbaceous vegetation in temperate climates. This relationship predicts that herbaceous species richness is highest at an intermediate level of biomass that corresponds to moderate competition or disturbance. However, this relationship has not previously been investigated in high and sub-alpine mountain grasslands. We tested the humped-back prediction in the and Trans-Himalayan mountain grassland with a seasonal grazing system. The study area is located in the bottom of a U-shaped valley, in the Manang district (3500 m.a.s.l.). We sampled two hundred plots (I in X I m) in two different types of pastures: common pasture and old field, which both have similar grazing practices. There was a significant unimodal relationship between species richness and biomass only in the common pasture, and when the two sites were analyzed together. The species turnover is estimated by DCA in standard deviation unit. The turnover was lower in the old field than in the common pasture. The unimodal relationship between plant species richness and biomass did not disappear after accounting for unknown environmental gradients expressed as DCA (detrended correspondence analysis) axes and spatial variables. The species richness is highest at 120 +/- 40 g/m(2). The results indicate that a hump-shaped relationship is also found in and Trans-Himalayan grasslands.

AB Peatlands are an important carbon (C) store but many have been drained and damaged by mechanical harvesting. Little is known about ecological processes on abandoned peatlands that have recolonized naturally nor the impact of plants on C balance of these sites. Over the course of 13 months, we measured amounts of litter falling from three different species colonizing an abandoned peat bog in north-eastern Scotland to calculate potential inputs of C and nitrogen (N). In parallel, a litter bag experiment quantified C loss from the litter of these species over 18 months. Calluna vulgaris produced the greatest amounts of litter (276 +/- 32.3 g dwt m(-2) yr(-1)); Eriophorum angustifolium produced 10.9 +/- 2.6 g dwt m(-2) yr(-1) and Eriophorum vaginatum produced 42.3 +/- 3.5 g dwt m(-2) yr(-1). Carbon loss varied from 30% (E vaginatum) to 40% (Calluna) over 18 months, but differences among the three species were not significant. Overall, these findings indicate that Calluna can make significant inputs of C and N into degraded cut-over peatlands, but seasonal variation in inputs is considerable.

AB Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10(-7) and 8.5*10(-3) cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10(-7) and 3.9*10(-6) cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer - peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels.

AB Northern forests and peatlands are globally significant elements in carbon (C) cycling. Recent research has also highlighted the role of aquatic ecosystems in landscape C budgets. We measured contemporary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange, lateral C transfer (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4), and long-term C accumulation in a peatland-stream-lake-continuum in north boreal Finland. On an annual scale the peatland, a rich fen, was a relatively strong C sink (27 g Cm-2 a(-1)). The stream that traversed through the fen had high CO2 and CH4 effluxes (on average 480 and 12 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively) to the atmosphere, while the small oligotrophic lake was a small C gas source per unit area (15 g C m(-2) a(-1)). A catchment C budget was compiled by supplementing these measured values with literature values for the forests. The aquatic C fluxes equaled similar to 13% of the net C input by the forest and peatlands in the catchment, and the largest component was the downstream transfer of DOC. This study supports the proposition that ignoring the aquatic component would result in an overestimated regional C uptake. The contemporary net C input estimate for the fen, after accounting for the C transfer, was larger than the long-term C accumulation rate based on peat cores (22 versus 6.3-16.0 g C m(-2) a(-1)). This study provides reference values for both the contemporary C exchange and long-term C accumulation history, and the terrestrial-aquatic linkage from the boreal-subarctic ecotone, which is vulnerable to ongoing climatic change.

AB Cloudberry cultivation is being seriously considered as a rehabilitation option for industrial peatlands after horticultural peat extraction has ceased. Besides increasing the ecological and economic values of these sites, cloudberry cultivation could improve fruit yield and facilitate fruit harvesting compared to picking in natural peatlands. Previous studies reported slow establishment that was tentatively associated with substrate characteristics. Field and greenhouse experiments were thus conducted to better characterize the impact of different peat substrates in combination with restoration techniques on the growth of male and female clones. Cloudberry grew much better in less-decomposed fibric peat (H1-H3) than in more-decomposed mesic peat. Restoring the moss layer of the former peat field would thus need to precede cloudberry planting by a few years, in order to plant the rhizomes in a newly formed fibric peat layer. Male clones produced larger leaves and more ramets per rhizome than female clones under common greenhouse conditions, which indicated that differences between sexes are most likely genetic rather than environmental. Furthermore, we found cloudberry clones may be very sensitive to aluminium toxicity. In conclusion, the degree of peat decomposition appears to be one of the key factors determining the success of cloudberry plantations.

AB The California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Vegetation Program worked collaboratively with the USDA Forest Service (USFS) and California Department of Parks and Recreation to produce a vegetation classification, map, and quantitative ranking of sites with fens and wet meadows in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Project goals included surveying and classifying fen sites for their vegetation type, vegetation diversity, and presence of rare species, and ranking sites for their ecological integrity and quality. CNPS staff visited 15 sites in 2010, and completed 57 vegetation stand surveys. We recorded field data using standard CNPS vegetation plot protocols in combination with an expanded USFS Region 5 Fen survey protocol developed for this project. We analyzed the field data from CNPS in 2010 with pre-existing USFS data from 2009-2010. The analysis resulted in a classification of 26 alliances and 38 associations, which are floristically and environmentally defined plant communities per the National Vegetation Classification System. We also established a system for ranking fen sites to assist land managers in recognizing high priority sites and in making long-term management decisions.

AB Wildfire is an important factor on carbon sequestration in the North American boreal biomes. Being globally important stocks of organic carbon, peatlands may be less sensitive to burning in comparison with upland forests, especially wet unforested ombrotrophic ecosystems as found in northeastern Canada. We aimed to determine if peatland fires have driven carbon accumulation patterns during the Holocene. To cover spatial variability, six cores from three peatlands in the Eastmain region of Quebec were analyzed for stratigraphic charcoal accumulation. Results show that regional Holocene peatland fire frequency was similar to 2.4 fires 1000 yr(-1), showing a gradually declining trend since 4000 cal yr BP, although inter- and intra-peatland variability was very high. Charcoal peak magnitudes, however, were significantly higher between 1400 and 400 cal yr BP, possibly reflecting higher charcoal production driven by differential climatic forcing aspects. Carbon accumulation rates generally declined towards the late-Holocene with minimum values of similar to 10 g m(-2) r(-1) around 1500 cal yr BP. The absence of a clear correlation between peatland fire regimes and carbon accumulation indicates that fire regimes have not been a driving factor on carbon sequestration at the millennial time scale.

AB 1. While establishment of vegetation is the most visual indicator of regeneration on cutover peatland, the reinstatement of belowground functions is less well understood. Vegetation succession results in differences in peat quality in terms of C availability. The respiratory response of the soil microbial community to ecologically relevant substrates (community-level physiological profile, CLPP) such as those found in rhizosphere exudates and litter hydrolysates, is thought to reflect the activity and functional diversity of the soil microbial community, especially those involved in turnover of soluble photosynthate-derived C.
   2. The relationship between CLPP and typical regeneration stages was investigated at five European peatlands, each with up to five sites representing a gradient of natural regeneration stages. We aimed to determine whether unaided revegetation consistently affected soil microbial CLPP, which environmental factors explained variation in CLPP on the scale of individual peatlands, and if these factors were consistent across different peatlands.
   3. Within each peatland, a decomposition index based on diagnostic bands in Fourier transform-infrared spectra indicated that regeneration had generally started from a common base and that the influence of vegetation on the decomposition index declined with depth. In parallel, differences in vegetation cover between regeneration stages resulted in significantly different CLPP, but this effect decreased rapidly with soil depth. The magnitudes of the effect of vegetation succession versus soil depth appeared to be linked with the age range of the regeneration gradients. Hence, the effect of vegetation on CLPP is effectively diluted due to the remaining organic matter. Specific plant species described significant proportions of CLPP variability but these species were not consistent across peatland types. The effects of soil depth appeared to be peatland-specific.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Together, the results indicate significant responses of the microbial community to vegetation succession, with the strength of the effect probably dependent on quantities of labile C allocation to the soil microbial community. Therefore, particularly in the early stages of regeneration of cutover peatlands, CLPP could provide vital information about the relative importance of different plant functional types on potential rates of labile C turnover.

AB The primary production of two pristine Sphagnum-Carex peatlands in France and Finland were 274 and 629 g C (carbon) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively and accumulation/productivity ratios were 0,10 and 0,03 yr(-1) which represent 28 and 20 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The natural processes of pear accumulation were altered by human activities, i.e. forestry in Finland and agricultural use in France. At the French site, the main changes processes in the managed site were Sphagnum reduction and an increase in grasses. These changes diminished the C-Aux to the litter while a parr of the stock in the pear was released with the increase of decomposition of accumulated peat. Ar the Finnish sire, the main changes in the managed site were the development of tree layer after drainage and an increase in pear respiration. Although litter production was increased, the increased decomposition also resulted in the cessation of peat accumulation and decomposition of earlier accumulated peat.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatlands head the list of ecosystems with the largest known reservoirs of organic carbon (C). The bulk of this C is stored in decomposition-resistant litter of one bryophyte genus: Sphagnum. Understanding how Sphagnum litter chemistry controls C mineralization is essential for understanding potential interactions between environmental changes and C mineralization in peatlands. We aimed to separate the effects of phenolics from structural polysaccharides on decay of Sphagnum. We measured aerobic microbial respiration of different moss litter types in a lab. We used chemical treatments to step-wise remove the chemical compounds thought to be important in decay-resistance in three taxonomically distant moss genera. We also focused on the effect of Sphagnum-specific cell-wall pectin-like polysaccharides (sphagnan) on C and N mineralization. Removing polymeric lignin-like phenolics had only negligible effects on C mineralization of Sphagnum litter, but increased mineralization of two other bryophyte genera, suggesting a minor role of these phenolics in decay resistance of Sphagnum but a major role of cell-wall polysaccharides. Carboxyl groups of pectin-like polysaccharides represented a C-source in non-Sphagnum litters but resisted decay in Sphagnum. Finally, isolated sphagnan did not serve as C-source but inhibited C and N mineralization instead, reminiscent of the effects reported for phenolics in other ecosystems. Our results emphasize the role of polysaccharides in resistance to, and active inhibition of, microbial mineralization in Sphagnum-dominated litter. As the polysaccharides displayed decay-inhibiting properties hitherto associated with phenolics (lignin, polyphenols), it raises the question if polysaccharide-dominated litter also shares similar environmental controls on decomposition, such as temperature or nutrient and water availability.

AB Peatland vegetation is controlled primarily by the depth of the water table, making peat paleovegetation a useful climate archive. We applied a biochemical approach to quantitatively estimate the plant sources of peat carbon based on (1) neutral sugar compositions of Sphagnum, vascular plants, and lichens and (2) lignin phenol compositions of vascular plants. We used these biochemical indices to characterize vegetation change over the last 2000years in four peat cores from the West Siberian Lowland (Russia) to investigate climate change during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. The vegetation was dominated by Sphagnum in all four cores, but was punctuated by several rapid but transient transitions to vascular plant dominance in the two cores from the southern West Siberian Lowland (<60 degrees N latitude). Lichen contributions were evident at the end of the Medieval Climate Anomaly and during the Little Ice Age in the two cores from northern West Siberian Lowland (>60 degrees N), possibly indicating permafrost development. However, there was no evidence for sustained vegetation change in response to either climatic event in cores from southern West Siberian Lowland. This suggests that these climatic events were relatively mild in the southern West Siberian Lowland, although the sensitivity of bog plant communities to climate change remains poorly understood.

AB Peatlands are large sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream ecosystems and DOC losses account for an important portion of peatland carbon balance. Disturbance and restoration of peatland ecosystems alters ecohydrological conditions that are likely to affect DOC chemistry in both soil water and discharge, although the direction of change and controls on DOC chemistry post-restoration remain unclear. We investigated DOC chemistry (concentration, SUVA(254), E2:E3, E4:E6, pentose and hexose concentration) during the growing season (May to October) in soil and discharge of a peatland restored for 10 years and compared the results to those measured at neighboring unrestored and natural peatland sites. Controls on the spatial and temporal variability of DOC chemistry, including pH, water table, temperature, plant cover and type, and carbon dioxide and methane flux were also investigated. After 10 years, restoration increased DOC concentration in soils compared to both natural and unrestored sites. This high DOC concentration likely resulted from high plant productivity post-restoration and a mean water table position deeper than the natural site. Ecohydrological conditions were also correlated to DOC chemistry. High vascular plant cover and photosynthesis rates were correlated to lower SUVA(254) and higher pentose concentration, while deeper water table position was correlated to higher E2:E3 and E4:E6. DOC concentration in discharge was lower, and E2:E3 higher, at the restored compared to the unrestored site. Differences in DOC chemistry in discharge water were minimal between the sites except when water was likely sourced from the near surface layer at the restored site, which represents new peat accumulated post-restoration. These results suggest that DOC dynamics 10 years post-restoration remain intermediate between natural and unrestored peatland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural peat soils serve as important sinks for nutrients, organic components, and water. Peat soils can pose major environmental problems when they are drained for agricultural production, which may change their role in the landscape from a sink to a source. To successfully restore and conserve peat soils, it is important to understand the soil-moisture dynamics and water demand of drained peat soils for different climate and groundwater conditions. For this purpose, we conducted a series of lysimeter experiments with peat soils subject to different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates and upward capillary fluxes in peat soils under grass were measured, while TDR probes and tensiometers were used to monitor the soil-water dynamics in the lysimeter during the growing season. The lysimeter data were simulated using an extended version of HYDRUS-1D to enable ET calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. A physically based approach was tested to predict the canopy resistance as a function of the average pressure head of the soil root zone. The numerical simulations closely followed the observed soil-moisture dynamics in the lysimeter and were consistent with measured differences in ET rates for different groundwater levels. Besides average climate conditions, the effects of extreme dry and wet weather conditions on ET and groundwater recharge during the growing season were evaluated using the calibrated numerical model for different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration rates during dry years depended very much on upward capillary flow from the water table and hence on the soil hydraulic properties. During wet years, however, ET was controlled mostly by the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, and much less by the soil hydraulic properties.

AB The decomposition of deep peat deposits controls the long-term carbon balance of peatlands but is poorly understood with respect to rates and controls. To rectify this deficiency, we estimated in situ dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4) production rates from a beaver pond to a central bog dome and related them to organic matter properties, Gibbs free energies of respiration, and delta C-13 values of DIC and CH4. DIC and CH4 production decreased from maxima of similar to 10 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) near the water table to values <0.1 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) at depths > 1 m, and there was little differentiation among sites. Deeper into the peat, we measured an accumulation of DIC, CH4, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) enriched in aromatic and phenolic moieties, which resulted from the slowness of diffusive vertical pore-water movement. Lack of transport may have slowed decomposition in two ways: (1) Aromatic and phenolic DOM moieties accumulated, while the release of carbohydrate-rich DOM from peat was apparently impeded. (2) The accumulation of DIC and CH4 reduced Gibbs free energy of acetoclastic methanogenesis toward a critical threshold value of -25 to -20 kJ mol(-1) CH4. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was energetically more favorable and generally dominated according to an isotopic fractionation between CO2 and CH4 of 1.053 to 1.076, but it was apparently impeded by some other factor. We conclude that lateral homogeneity and slowness of decomposition in geologically sealed deep peat deposits are assisted by a lack of solute transport, which facilitates the formation of deep peat deposits over millennia.

AB Many peatlands have a recent history of being degraded by extraction, drainage, burning, overgrazing and atmospheric pollution often leading to erosion and loss of peat mass. Restoration schemes have been implemented aimed at rewetting peatlands, encouraging revegetation of bare peat or shifting the present vegetation assemblage to an alternative. Here we demonstrate the use of palaeoecological techniques that allow reconstruction of the historical development of a blanket peatland and provide a historical context from which legitimate restoration targets can be determined and supported. We demonstrate the applicability of simple stratigraphic techniques to provide a catchment-wide peatland development history and reinforce this with a detailed macrofossil reconstruction from a central core. Analysis at Keighley Moor Reservoir Catchment in northern England showed that the present vegetation state was 'atypical' and has been characteristic for only the last c. 100 years. Sphagnum moss was an important historic contributor to the vegetation cover between 1500 years ago and the early 1900s. Until the early 1900s Sphagnum occurrence fluctuated with evidence of fire, routinely returning after fire demonstrating good resilience of the ecosystem. However, from the turn of the 20th century, Sphagnum levels declined severely, coincident initially with a wildfire event but remaining extremely diminished as the site regularly underwent managed burning to support grouse moor gun sports where practitioners prefer a dominant cover of heather. It is suggested that any intention to alter land management at the site to raise water tables and encourage greater Sphagnum abundance is in line with peatland development at the site over the past 1500 years. Similar palaeoecological studies providing historical context could provide support for restoration targets and changes to peatland management practice for sites globally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We modelled the European distribution of vegetation types at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using present-day data from Siberia, a region hypothesized to be a modern analogue of European glacial climate. Distribution models were calibrated with current climate using 6274 vegetation-plot records surveyed in Siberia. Out of 22 initially used vegetation types, good or moderately good models in terms of statistical validation and expert-based evaluation were computed for 18 types, which were then projected to European climate at the LGM. The resulting distributions were generally consistent with reconstructions based on pollen records and dynamic vegetation models. Spatial predictions were most reliable for steppe, forest-steppe, taiga, tundra, fens and bogs in eastern and central Europe, which had LGM climate more similar to present-day Siberia. The models for western and southern Europe, regions with a lower degree of climatic analogy, were only reliable for mires and steppe vegetation, respectively. Modelling LGM vegetation types for the wetter and warmer regions of Europe would therefore require gathering calibration data from outside Siberia. Our approach adds value to the reconstruction of vegetation at the LGM, which is limited by scarcity of pollen and macrofossil data, suggesting where specific habitats could have occurred. Despite the uncertainties of climatic extrapolations and the difficulty of validating the projections for vegetation types, the integration of palaeodistribution modelling with other approaches has a great potential for improving our understanding of biodiversity patterns during the LGM.

AB The organic carbon (C) stocks contained in peat were estimated for a wetland-rich boreal region of the Mackenzie River Basin, Canada, using high-resolution wetland map data, available peat C characteristic and peat depth datasets, and geostatistics. Peatlands cover 32% of the 25 119 km(2) study area, and consist mainly of surface- and/or groundwater-fed treed peatlands. The thickness of peat deposits measured at 203 sites was 2.5 m on average but as deep as 6 m, and highly variable between sites. Peat depths showed little relationship with terrain data within 1 and 5 km, but were spatially autocorrelated, and were generalized using ordinary kriging. Polygon-scale calculations and Monte Carlo simulations yielded a total peat C stock of 982-1025 x 10(12) g C that varied in C mass per unit area between 53 and 165 kg m(-2). This geostatistical approach showed as much as 10% more peat C than calculations using mean depths. We compared this estimate with an overlapping 7868 km(2) portion of an independent peat C stock estimate for western Canada, which revealed similar values for total peatland area, total C stock, and total peat C mass per unit area. However, agreement was poor within similar to 875 km(2) grids owing to inconsistencies in peatland cover and little relationship in peat depth between estimates. The greatest disagreement in mean peat C mass per unit area occurred in grids with the largest peatland cover, owing to the spatial coincidence of large cover and deep peat in our high-resolution assessment. We conclude that total peat C stock estimates in the southern Mackenzie Basin and perhaps in boreal western Canada are likely of reasonable accuracy. However, owing to uncertainties particularly in peat depth, the quality of information regarding the location of these large stocks at scales as wide as several hundreds of square kilometers is presently much more limited.

AB Few investigations deal with the subterranean phytomass in fens (minerotrophic peatlands), their results differing widely.  This study was carried out in a "rich fen" in central Sweden, and involved excavation of peat monoliths, depth-sectioning and hand-sorting as to species, type of organ, and living or dead condition.  The below-ground living phytomass was large, over 4 kg m-2 in each of two sample plots, being no < 97-96% in the dominants, Carex limosa and C. lasiocarpa, 89% on average in Menyanthes trifoliata, and c. 93% for all species.  Carex limosa had its rhizome maximum slightly higher than C. lasiocarpa, but a greater part of its roots penetrated deeper.  For Menyanthes, also net annual production above and below ground was estimated.  The subterranean phytomass decreased with depth, but living roots were found even at 42 cm.  The recognizable necromass did not decrease with depth.  These recent constituents would render a very unequal age to the peat.  The imbalance between the small green aerial phytomass and the much greater subterranean phytomass was emphasized.  It could be related to a relatively very great translocation of photosynthates from above to below ground, and/or to longevity of below-ground organs, the latter at least in Menyanthes.

AB To clarify seedbank developmental pattern and its determinants, we examined relationships between seedbank, standing vegetation, and litter in a post-mined peatland on Sarobetsu Mire, northern Japan. In late fall 2006 and early summer 2007, peat was sampled from four vegetation types, and litter was also sampled from two of the four vegetations where thick litter was accumulated. Seed germination tests were performed by the samples in a glasshouse. The results were compared between the standing vegetation and litter accumulation. Seed density and species richness in seedbank gradually increased with increasing vegetation cover. Seeds in surface layer germinated more in fall than in summer. In vegetation with thick litter, small seeds, such as Drosera rotundifolia and Gentiana triflora, germinated more from peat than from litter in summer, probably due to the downward movement. Seed density in litter decreased from fall to the next summer. Moliniopsis japonica and Rhynchospora alba developed short-term persistent seedbank, whereas D. rotundifolia and G. triflora preserved long-term persistent seedbank in peat covered with thick litter. Seedbank development follows the development of the standing vegetation with litter. Litter derived from the standing vegetation is a prime determinant on the seedbank composition and development, by acting as seed trap and keeping seed dormancy.

AB 1 A unimodal relationship between species richness and primary productivity is commonly reported. To explain this pattern, the mechanisms proposed in the many hypotheses are generally complex and almost all are without a strong empirical foundation. Here we evaluate the role of self-thinning in plant assemblages: assemblage-level thinning.
   2 We developed a simple two-parameter model of species richness that predicts that plant species richness will be determined by a unimodal relationship between total plant density and above-ground biomass. This model provides a very narrowly defined set of testable quantitative predictions, and thus is the first falsifiable model of assemblage-level thinning. We fit this model to the species richness-above-ground biomass data from 14 empirical studies that are often cited as evidence of a general diversity-productivity relationship. In addition, we compared our model to two other models, one more flexible and one more constrained than our own.
   3 We found that our model of species richness explained a substantial and statistically significant portion of the species richness observed in 11 of the 14 empirical studies of species richness-biomass patterns. Therefore, given the conservative nature of our model, and the number of previously published data sets explained by this model, we argue that assemblage-level thinning not only provides a viable and exceedingly parsimonious explanation, but may also be a widespread phenomenon.

AB The genus Sphagnum is the key peat-forming bryophyte in boreal ecosystems. Relying entirely on passive capillary action for water transport, soil moisture is often the limiting factor in Sphagnum production, and hence peat accumulation. While several hydrological models of peat physics and peatland water movement exist, these models do not readily interface with observations and models of peatland carbon accumulation. A conflict of approaches exists, where hydrological studies primarily utilize variables Such as hydraulic head, while ecological models of Sphagnum growth adopt the coarse hydrological variables of water table (WT), volumetric water content (VWC) or gravimetric water content (WC). This review examines the potential of soil pressure head as a measurement to link the hydrological and ecological functioning of Sphagnum in peatlands. The non-vascular structure of Sphagnum mosses and the reliance on external capillary transport of water in the mosses make them an ideal candidate for this approach. The main advantage of pressure head is the ability to mechanistically link plot-scale hydrology to cellular-scale water requirements and carbon exchange. Measurement of pressure head may improve photosynthetic process representation in the next generation of peatland models. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Drainage is known to affect peatland natural hydrology and water quality, but peatland restoration is considered to ameliorate peatland degradation. Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydro climate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (N-tot), total phosphorus(P-tot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher P-tot, N-tot, and DOC than well restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry. Rich fens (median pH 6.2-6.6) showed lower pore water P-tot, Ntot, and DOC than intermediate and poor peats (pH 4.0-4.6) both before and after restoration. Nutrients and DOC in pore water increased in the first year postrestoration but decreased thereafter. The most important variables related to pore water quality were trophic level, peatland class, water table level, and soil and air temperature.

AB Several studies contributed to the development of restoration techniques for open Sphagnumdominated habitats on peat-extracted bogs. Yet, in exception to some afforestation efforts, connectivity between restored sites and surrounding landscapes has received little attention. The general goal of this study is to ameliorate management of very shallow peat fields (<30 cm) located within the margins of peatextracted bogs. Firstly, to assist decision making in peatland management, baseline ecological conditions, peat physicochemistry and spontaneous vegetation recolonization were assessed for 18 of these fields. This first study revealed that (1) concentrations of several macro-nutrients are almost one order of magnitude lower for unrestored fields than previously characterized natural lagg habitats of the same region, and (2) there is little spontaneous colonization. In a second study, peat chemistry and soil/air microclimate were evaluated in plantations established on shallow residual peat (a 21-year-old Larix laricina plantation and an 18-year-old Picea mariana plantation) and compared to adjacent unrestored shallow bare-peat fields. This second study showed that afforested peat fields are characterized by (1) a soil enriched in nutrients, notably in N, P, and K, and (2) a more humid and cooler microclimate at the soil/air interface, with less daily humidity and temperature fluctuations. These results indicate that afforestation is an appropriate approach to start an ecological recovery. Yet, the absence of natural recolonization by herbs and mosses in the understory of afforested peat fields suggests that reintroduction of appropriate understory species should also be considered if the goal is to restore a fully functional ecosystem.

AB A hydrogeophysical study conducted in a 2200-ha peatland in central Maine shows evidence that a laterally continuous esker deposit extends below the peat soil following the direction of glacier retreat and coinciding with the presence of a pool system. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity (ER) imaging and terrain conductivity measurements were constrained with limited hydrological measurements, direct sampling of inorganic sediments and radiocarbon dating of peat soils to develop a conceptual model for pool formation that could explain the unique pool patterning observed in other northern peatlands. GPR profiles revealed three-dimensional images of two esker crests below the easternmost edge of the pool area. GPR data was supported by ER imaging and terrain conductivity data and allowed for facies differentiation to infer processes related to esker formation during the glacier front retreat. Hydrologic data showed preferential flow of groundwater towards the esker, suggesting that pools may persist as a result of enhanced peat decomposition and carbon loss due to oxygenation and/or upward supply of alternative electron acceptors from the mineral soil along narrow, permeable inorganic esker crests. Variations in pool depths and radiocarbon dating of peat samples from the pool bottom support a model whereby pools originate at a focus centered along the two esker crests and subsequently spread laterally outwards.

AB Northern high latitudes contain large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC), of which Alaskan terrestrial ecosystems account for a substantial proportion. In this study, the SOC accumulation in Alaskan terrestrial ecosystems over the last 15 000 years was simulated using a process-based biogeochemistry model for both peatland and non-peatland ecosystems. Comparable with the previous estimates of 2570 PgC in peatland and 13-22 Pg C in non-peatland soils within 1m depth in Alaska using peat-core data, our model estimated a total SOC of 36-63 Pg C at present, including 27-48 PgC in peatland soils and 9-15 Pg C in non-peatland soils. Current vegetation stored 2.5-3.7 Pg C in Alaska, with 0.3-0.6 PgC in peatlands and 2.2-3.1 Pg C in non-peatlands. The simulated average rate of peat C accumulation was 2.3 TgC yr(-1), with a peak value of 5.1 Tg C yr(-1) during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the early Holocene, 4-fold higher than the average rate of 1.4 TgC yr(-1) over the rest of the Holocene. The SOC accumulation slowed down, or even ceased, during the neoglacial climate cooling after the mid-Holocene, but increased again in the 20th century. The model-estimated peat depths ranged from 1.1 to 2.7 m, similar to the field-based estimate of 2.29m for the region. We found that the changes in vegetation and their distributions were the main factors in determining the spatial variations of SOC accumulation during different time periods. Warmer summer temperature and stronger radiation seasonality, along with higher precipitation in the HTM and the 20th century, might have resulted in the extensive peatland expansion and carbon accumulation.

AB In ever-wet climates, raised mires that are elevated several metres above flood levels can cover significant portions of coastal plains. Because peat accumulation may keep pace with moderate rates of base-level rise, the development of raised mires may reduce the areal extent of marine transgressions. Thick, low-ash coals are present immediately landward of many vertically stacked shoreface parasequences in Cretaceous strata of the Western Interior of North America. We suggest that these coals formed in raised mires that stabilized shorelines for long periods of time. In such settings, the rate of sediment supply (including peat accumulation) to the coastal environment is partly a function of the rate of change in base level.

AB Drained peatlands dominated by purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are widespread in the UK and Western Europe. Although substantial carbon stores may be present in these peatlands, in this degraded state they are not currently acting as carbon sinks. Therefore, M.caerulea dominated peatlands have been identified as potential sites for ecohydrological restoration to tackle the current climate emergency. However, at present little is known about whether ditch blocking can raise water tables and promote the recovery of bog plant species, and the subsequent effects on carbon sequestration in these peatlands.
   To investigate the potential for restoration, we measured changes in water table depth, vegetation composition, photosynthesis at 1000 mu mol Photons m(-2) s(-1) (P-G1000), ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) and partitioned below-ground respiration in two M.caerulea dominated peatlands in which drainage ditches had been blocked located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England. Measurements were made in two headwater catchments at 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 of the distance between adjacent drainage ditches at four control-restored paired sites, during the growing seasons pre- (2012) and post- (2014, 2016 & 2018) restoration.
   Restoration had a small but significant (p = 0.009) effect on water table depths however, this did not result in a significant change in vegetation composition (p > 0.350). Ecosystem respiration increased in both the control and restored locations following restoration however, this increase was significantly smaller (p = 0.010) at the restored locations, possibly due to a similarly reduced increase in photosynthesis, although this change was not significant (p = 0.116). Below-ground respiration showed no significant changes following restoration.
   This research illustrates how degraded these shallow peatlands are, and raises concerns that ditch blocking alone may not bring about the high and stable water tables required to perturb the existing Molinia caerulea-dominated ecosystem and substantially alter the carbon balance. Additional restoration measures may be required.

AB Aim Hydroclimatic shifts and anthropogenic-driven nitrogen deposition are major outcomes of global change that could compromise the functioning of many peatlands as a carbon sink. ForSphagnum-dominated peatlands, an emerging hypothesis is that the change could be triggered by shifts in competitive dominance among plant functional groups, specifically from the currently predominant decay-resistantSphagnumto the more decomposable vascular plants. However, the relationship betweenSphagnumand vascular plant occurrence is notably complex and also includes facilitative interactions that are crucial to the productivity ofSphagnum, and therefore, carbon sequestration. Location Global. Taxa Northern peatlands-Sphagnummoss and vascular plants. Time period Present day and the future. Methods We use a conceptual review to examine underlying mechanisms for the competitive exclusion hypothesis and the nature of facilitative interactions betweenSphagnumand vascular plants under potential global change conditions. We complement the review with an empirical study of peatlands with contrasting hydrology to provide some critical insights into the potential effects of change in plant communities on carbon sequestration. We also propose a conceptual model that presents probable combinations of global change factors and their implications for carbon sequestration. Results Vegetation structure inSphagnum-dominated peatland appears to be driven largely by hydrology, rather than competition among plant functional groups. The peat deposit also exerts some controls (e.g., nutrient immobilization) on biotic structure, thereby acting as resistance against an abrupt shift in plant communities. Main conclusions Peatland controls that constrain vegetation shifts have developed over a millennial time-scale in many peatlands, and the pace of climate change may not allow enough time for the establishment of those mechanisms in younger peatlands. Thus, the persistence of a given peatland as a carbon sink also likely depends on the successional stage of the peatland.

AB 1 Raised bogs are traditionally regarded as being solely dependent upon atmospheric influences. However, these terrestrial carbon stores may also be affected by calcareous (bicarbonate-rich) groundwater, which is often found in deeper peat layers.
   2 Field data from a bog area in the Netherlands were used to select appropriate levels of bicarbonate supply for an aquarium mesocosm experiment. The effects of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 mmol HCO3- l(-1), and 1 mmol HCO3- l(-1) + 2 mmol SO42- l(-1), on the biogeochemistry of peat monoliths, including their Sphagnum vegetation, were investigated.
   3 Slightly increased alkalinity rapidly stimulated buoyancy of living Sphagnum due to higher inorganic carbon concentrations in the water layer. Moderate HCO3- concentrations also stimulated buoyancy of the entire peat monoliths after 3 weeks, because of increased methane production rates. High alkalinity, however, led to rapid internal phosphate mobilization, pear disintegration and Sphagnum die-off. This detrimental effect was stronger when sulphate was supplied simultaneously.
   4 The results are discussed with respect to the carbon dynamics and overall functioning of peat bogs, in relation to hydrology and hydrochemistry (groundwater influence, sulphate pollution).

AB Mountain fens are limited in their spatial extent but are vital ecosystems for biodiversity, habitat, and carbon and water cycling. Studies of fen hydrological function in northern regions indicate the timing and magnitude of runoff is variable, with atmospheric and environmental conditions playing key roles in runoff production. How the complex ecohydrological processes of mountain fens that govern water storage and release as well as peat accumulation will respond to a warmer and less snowy future climate is unclear. To provide insight, we studied the hydrological processes and function of Sibbald fen, located at the low end of the known elevation range in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, over a dry period. We added an evapotranspiration function to the Spence hydrological function method to better account for storage loss. When frozen in spring and early summer, the fen primarily transmits water. When thawed, the fen's hydrological function switches from water transmission to water release, leading to a summertime water table decline of nearly 1 m. Rainfall events larger than 5 mm can transiently switch fen hydrological function to storage, followed by contribution, depending on antecedent conditions. The evapotranspiration function was dominant only for a brief period in late June and early July when rainfall was low and the ground was still partially frozen, even though evapotranspiration accounted for the largest loss of storage from the system. This research highlights the mechanisms by which mountain peatlands supply baseflow during drought conditions, and the importance of frozen ground and rainfall in regulating their hydrological function. The study has important implications for the sustainability of low elevation mountain fens under climate change.

AB Blanket bog is a highly distinctive biome restricted to disjunct hyperoceanic regions. It is characterized by a landscape covering of peat broken only by the steepest slopes(1). Plant and microbial life are adapted to anoxia, low pH and low nutrient availability. Plant productivity exceeds soil organic matter decomposition, so carbon is sequestered over time. Unique climatic requirements, including high year-round rainfall and low summer temperatures(2), make this biome amenable to bioclimatic modelling. However, projections of the fate of peatlands in general, and blanket bogs in particular, under climate change have been contradictory(3-7). Here we use a simple, well-founded global bioclimatic model(8), with climate-change projections from seven climate models, to indicate this biome's fate. We show marked shrinkage of its present bioclimatic space with only a few, restricted areas of persistence. Many blanket bog regions are thus at risk of progressive peat erosion and vegetation changes as a direct consequence of climate change. New areas suitable for blanket bog are also projected, but these are often disjunct from present areas and their location is inconsistently predicted by different climate models.

AB Variation of plant species cover on a Sphagnum-dominated mire in the south-eastern Alps of Italy was assessed over a 10-year period in relation to depth to the water table, peat accumulation rate, and climate. Population dynamics of vascular species appeared to be primarily affected by the autogenic process of peat accumulation, which determined the lowering of water-table position at microhabitat scale. Increase of depth to the water table through peat accumulation resulted in increased cover of ericaceous shrubs at previously moister microhabitats. Conversely, graminoid species such as Eriophorum vaginatum, Trichophorum caespitosum, and Scheuchzeria palustris, being negatively affected by autogenic peat growth, were forced to shift their niche towards the wetter end of the water-table gradient. Carex limosa and Carex rostrata decreased their cover along the whole gradient in depth to the water table, likely due to multiple processes related to peat accumulation, competition with bryophytes, and a negative feedback due to increased litter deposition. Bryophytes, in particular Sphagnum mosses, appeared more sensitive to climatic conditions, with higher precipitation favouring faster-growing species. Accordingly, Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum magellanicum increased their cover much more than Sphagnum capillifolium, whereas Polytrichum strictum showed the strongest decrease at sites where S. magellanicum cover increased most.

AB Peat bogs are unique wetland ecosystems of high conservation value all over the world, yet data on the macroinvertebrates (including mayfly assemblages) in these habitats are still scarce. Over the course of one growing season, mayfly assemblages were sampled each month, along with other macroinvertebrates, in the largest and oldest Croatian peat bog and an adjacent stream. In total, ten mayfly species were recorded: two species in low abundance in the peat bog, and nine species in significantly higher abundance in the stream. Low species richness and abundance in the peat bog were most likely related to the harsh environmental conditions and mayfly habitat preferences. In comparison, due to the more favourable habitat conditions, higher species richness and abundance were observed in the nearby stream. Three of the recorded species, Caenis luctuosa from the peat bog, and Eurylophella karelica and Leptophlebia marginata from the stream are new records for the Croatian mayfly fauna. Typical Central European life cycle patterns were confirmed for several species (e.g. Baetis vernus, Nigrobaetis niger, Electrogena ujhelyii), while for several others (e.g. Habrophlebia fusca, Paraleptophlebia submarginata) some discrepancies were observed. Therefore, these results provide new and valuable information on the ecology of mayflies in peat bog habitats.

AB Peat is a highly compressible medium and changes in peat surface level in response to shifts in water storage and entrapped gas volume have been reported previously. Since both peat compressibility and capacity to entrap gas are related to peat structure, we hypothesize that the relationship between water table and surface level may vary across a peatland. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between peat surface level positions, water table positions and subsurface gas pools at local topographic low-lying areas within a poor fen, which differ in peat properties and vegetation cover. Three sites were investigated, two with highly movable surfaces (FA and FB) and one which was more stable (NF). Deviations from the water table position-surface level position relationship (residuals) appear to be related to changes in atmospheric pressure. However, this relationship varied between FA and NF. The differences in these relationships were supported by distinct patterns of gas dynamics between these sites. Ebullition tended to occur only during periods of falling atmospheric pressure at FA, whereas it occurred much more frequently at NF without atmospheric pressure being the primary control. Evidence of ebullition based on changes in volumetric water content below the water table were supported by ebullition measured by surface gas traps and by shifts in pore water pressure deviation. These different responses of surface level fluctuations to changes in atmospheric pressure between sampling locations are likely related to variations in peat properties between the sites.

AB Boreal mire ecosystems are predicted to experience warmer air temperatures as well as changed deposition loads of nitrogen and sulfur during the coming century. In this study, we hypothesized that vegetation changes that accompany these new environmental conditions alter the chemical composition of peat. To test this hypothesis, we quantified changes in peat geochemistry (Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, P, Pb, and Zn) that have occurred in field manipulation plots exposed to 12 years of warming and nitrogen and sulfur additions in a nutrient-poor boreal mire. In Contrast to non-nutrients with a mainly atmospheric origin (i.e. Pb), Al-normalized inventories of micronutrients (Zn and Fe) and macronutrients (P and Ca) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher as a result of warming. For P and Ca, enrichments were also induced by nitrogen additions alone. These results suggest that mires evolving under increasing temperatures and availability of nitrogen are around two times More effective in storing nutrients in the accumulating peat. Our study provides the first empirical evidence that predicted changes in climate and nitrogen deposition scenarios will increase the retention of Ca, Fe, P, and Zn in surface peat of boreal mires in the near future, which may cause a depletion of nutrients released to inland waters dependent on mire inputs.

The results of plant macrofossil and pollen analyses were used to reconstruct the history of peat formation, vegetation, and climate changes during the Holocene. The radiocarbon dating of archaeological artifacts and enclosing sedimentary layers were used to reconstruct the stratigraphy and dynamics of peat formation and establish the chronology of inhabitation of this region in the changing paleoenvironmental conditions.

AB A newly discovered fossil forest is reported from Lower Pennsylvanian (late Langsettian) strata in the classic Amroth to Wiseman's Bridge section of Pembrokeshire, South Wales. It comprises nearly two hundred sediment-cast Calamites axes and putative groundcover ferns, preserved in growth position in the deltaic mouth bar deposits of a marine-influenced coastal plain. Vegetation-Induced Sedimentary Structures developed around upright axes imply that dense Calamites thickets promoted localized patterns of sedimentation, and ultimately, stabilized substrates, paving the way for the establishment of mire vegetation. Not long after initial colonization, a short-lived brackish incursion resulted in dieback of the Calamites thickets; however, a few axes survived to recolonise the delta front through adventitious regeneration, implying that calamitaleans were, to a limited degree, saline tolerant. A remarkable feature of the fossils is that many examples preserve an internal pith-cast embedded within a stem-cast. Preservation of both pith- and stem-casts for the same plant allows inference of an ontogenetic growth-series, and shows that these clastic-substrate Calamites were much more substantially 'woody' than previously conjectured. This raises the possibility that plastic developmental traits like growth rate and longevity may have been what mainly distinguished these opportunistic Calamites in disturbed clastic settings from their much larger, and even more woody, cousins in adjacent mires. Analysis of the fossils also contributes to taphonomic debates, supporting the hypothesis that upright Calamites axes are mostly preserved as stem-casts (rather than pith-casts, as traditionally believed). As such, the newly discovered fossil forest sheds light on the ecology, ontogeny, and taphonomy of Calamites - an iconic, familiar, yet, insufficiently understood Pennsylvanian plant.

AB Methane (CH4) flux into the atmosphere during spring thaw was investigated in a small ombrotrophic peatland (141 degrees 48'E, 43 degrees 19'N, Japan) using the conventional chamber method. More than 50 chamber deployments on top of the snow cover were carried out and continued for more than 165 It until the surface snow and underlying ice cover on top of the peat layer had thawed completely. Methane emissions were almost absent in the presence of snow cover. At the very moment the surface ice cover thawed, a large CH4 flush (>10 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) was recorded, which was on the same order of magnitude as episodic ebullition previously observed in the high-summer. Gas bubbles trapped in the ice layer on top of the waterlogged peat were preliminarily analyzed for the volumetric percentage in the total ice volume and their gas species compositions. Results showed that the bubbles occupied about 3.2% volume and that the mixing ratio of CH4 in the bubbles was about 20%. The abundance of the bubble-form CH4 was sufficient to explain the observed episodic CH4 release during the thaw. Results of this study show that CH4 emissions during the thaw season have great temporal variability; emission occurs as an episodic release of bubble-form CH4 stored in the frozen layer. The results also imply the possibility that gas-phase CH4 plays an important role, not only during the growing season but also in cold-season CH4 dynamics in northern peatlands.

AB The carbon pool of peatlands has been considered as potentially unstable in a changing climate. This study is the first presenting carbon dioxide (CO2) net ecosystem exchange, CO2 efflux due to ecosystem respiration and CO2 uptake by gross primary production over a complete growing season for different microforms of a boreal peatland in Russia (61A degrees 56'N, 50A degrees 13'E). CO2 fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique from the 25th April in the period of snow melt until the end of the vegetation period and the first frost on the 20th October 2008 at seven different microform types: minerogenous and ombrogenous hollows, lawns and hummocks, respectively, and Carex lawns situated in a transition zone between minerogenous and ombrogenous mire parts. The total number of chamber flux measurements was 5,517. Ombrogenous hummocks and lawns were sources of CO2 over the investigation period whereas hollows and minerogenous lawns were CO2 sinks. Some plots of Carex lawns and minerogenous hummocks were sinks while other plots of these microform types were sources. The CO2 fluxes were characterised by large variability not only between the microform types but also within the respective microform types. Of all microform types, the Carex, ombrogenous, and minerogenous lawns showed the highest variability in CO2 fluxes, which is probably related to a stronger within-microform heterogeneity in vegetation composition and coverage as well as in the water table level. Air temperature was one of the dominant controls on the CO2 flux dynamics. Water table and green area index were found to have strong influence on CO2 fluxes both within different patches of the same microform type as well as between different microforms.

AB Worldwide, regularly recurring wildfires shape many peatland ecosystems to the extent that fire-adapted species often dominate plant communities, suggesting that wildfire is an integral part of peatland ecology rather than an anomaly. The most destructive blazes are smoldering fires that are usually initiated in periods of drought and can combust entire peatland carbon stores. However, peatland wildfires more typically occur as low-severity surface burns that arise in the dormant season when vegetation is desiccated, and soil moisture is high. In such low-severity fires, surface layers experience flash heating, but there is little loss of underlying peat to combustion. This study examines the potential importance of such processes in several peatlands that span a gradient from hemiboreal to tropical ecozones and experience a wide range of fire return intervals. We show that low-severity fires can increase the pool of stable soil carbon by thermally altering the chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM), thereby reducing rates of microbial respiration. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared, we demonstrate that low-severity fires significantly increase the degree of carbon condensation and aromatization of SOM functional groups, particularly on the surface of peat aggregates. Laboratory incubations show lower CO2 emissions from peat subjected to low-severity fire and predict lower cumulative CO2 emissions from burned peat after 1-3 years. Also, low-severity fires reduce the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of peat, indicating that these fires can inhibit microbial access to SOM. The increased stability of thermally altered SOM may allow a greater proportion of organic matter to survive vertical migration into saturated and anaerobic zones of peatlands where environmental conditions physiochemically protect carbon stores from decomposition for thousands of years. Thus, across latitudes, low-severity fire is an overlooked factor influencing carbon cycling in peatlands, which is relevant to global carbon budgets as climate change alters fire regimes worldwide.

AB Peatlands play an important role for global carbon dynamics, acting as a sink or source depending on climate. Such changes imply a series of additional effects because peatlands are also an important reservoir of atmospherically derived pollutants. Using a multiproxy approach (non-pollen-palynomorphs, delta N-15, C/N, Se, Br, I, Hg, Ti), we show a relationship between climate (wetter-drier) and peat decomposition, which affected element concentrations in a Spanish bog during the last 5500 years. Changes in superficial wetness played a critical role in the cycling of elements coupled to carbon dynamics. Dry phases caused increased peat mineralisation, resulting in a 2-3 times increase in concentrations of the analysed elements independent from atmospheric fluxes. Under the present trend of climate change large areas of northern peatlands are expected to be severely affected; in this context our findings indicate that the increase in carbon release, which leads to an enrichment of elements, may enhance the export of stored contaminants (Hg, organohalogens) to the aquatic systems or to the atmosphere.

AB Aims This study assesses the relative effects of hydrology and colonization by vascular plants on belowground C and N mobilization, and emission of CO2 and CH4 in an extracted bog under restoration in Alberta (Canada). Methods A wet (high water table) and dry (low water table) area were identified at the site and plots with cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) or bare peat were established in each area. Plant growth, peat and porewater dissolved C (DOC) and N (TDN), microbial biomass and the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were monitored at the plots throughout the growing season. Results The largest concentrations of DOC were measured in dry and bare sites. Lower E2:E3 ratios suggested a higher aromaticity of the DOC at these sites that were net sources of CO2 and CH4. The concentration of TDN was greater in plots with cottongrass and high water table, supporting a more abundant microbial biomass. Cottongrass dominated plots also had larger gas emissions as compared to bare plots even though they were net C sinks due to their high photosynthetic rates. Conclusion Maintaining a high water table is key to reducing peatland C losses. While vascular plant presence seems to prime the release of N and greenhouse gases, the inputs of C exceeded the losses and recovered the C sink function of the peatland ecosystem in the short term. Carbon inputs are maximized under high water table and plant presence.

AB We present analyses of macroscopic and microscopic remains as a tool to characterise sedge fen peats. We use it to describe peat composition and stages of peat decomposition, to assess the success of rewetting of a formerly drained fen, and to understand the workings of these novel ecosystems. We studied two percolation fen sites, one drained and one drained and rewetted 20 years ago. Years of deep drainage have resulted in a layer of strongly decomposed peat which lacks recognizable macro-remains. We could associate micro-remains with macro-remains, and thus still characterise the peat and the plants that once formed it. We show that the strongly decomposed peat is of the same origin as the slightly decomposed peat below, and that is was ploughed. We present descriptions of eight types of the main constituent of sedge peat: plant roots, including Carex rostrata type, C. lasiocarpa/rostrata type, C. limosa type, C. acutiformis type, C. echinata type, Phragmites australis type, Cladium type, Equisetum type. We describe three new non-pollen palynomorph types (microscopic remains) and five new subtypes. The rewetted fen provides insights into plant succession after rewetting and the formation of peat that predominantly consists of roots. Results indicate that leaf sheaths may be a consistent component of the peat.

AB Two ombrotrophic bogs in Canada's Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), an area storing an estimated 33 Gt of soil carbon, are contrasted with the Mer Bleue temperate ombrotrophic bog approximately 1000 km to the southeast to assess the net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between these ecosystems and the atmosphere. Peatlands in the BBL region may be impacted by not only climate change but also resource extraction practices that may cause drying of surrounding areas. Two years of eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements show the two HBL bogs to be annual sinks for CO2. Given random error and gap-filling uncertainties of 6 to 13 g C m(-2) yr(-1), the annual budgets of 45 to 55 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the HBL bogs did not differ significantly from the temperate bog's budget of 55 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (in the first year) despite differences in climate and vegetation composition and abundance. The temperate bog did have significantly greater net uptake of CO2 (78 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in the second study year. Component fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration were much smaller at the HBL bogs and speculated to be a result of less vascular vegetation. Less growing season CO2 uptake at the HBL bogs was offset by less winter loss when compared to the temperate bog. The influence of mid-summer drying and lowered water tables was similar among all three bogs. Decreasing mid-summer net ecosystem productivity (NEP) appeared to be a result of reduced photosynthetic uptake rather than increased respiration. In the short-term, drying of the BBL peatlands might result in a decrease of their C sink strength.

AB Forest drainage has been used rather widely to improve tree growth in peatlands in northern and northeastern Europe and some parts of North America. The consequent fundamental change in the vegetation presumably gives rise to a concomitant change in the distribution of nutrients within the ecosystem. We investigated the post-drainage dynamics of soil properties ( top 30-cm) and tree stand biomass on a series of peatlands drained for forestry in Finland to evaluate the sufficiency of soil nutrient pools for production forestry, and the ability of a floristic-ecological peatland site type classification for estimating soil nutrient status. The nutrient dynamics were assessed by comparing the nutrient pools in a large number of peatland sites differing in drainage age. Drainage unambiguously influenced stand biomass and structure and, consequently, the nutrient pool bound in trees. Nevertheless, with the exception of Mg, ditching did not decrease soil nutrient pools over the 75-year observation period. Thus, the soil pools seem sufficient for forest production on these sites. The decreasing trend in the soil Mg pool points on a potential risk in the long run, however. Peat depth and temperature sum were identified as significant sources of variation for the soil nutrient pools. Using soil Ca, K, Fe and N pools, on average 49% of our sites were grouped correctly according to the floristic-ecological site type classification. This classification most successfully described soil nutrient status among the most nutrient-poor sites. We concluded that the floristic-ecological classification of drained peatlands successfully describes their production potential, but not their total nutrient pools in varying thermoclimatic conditions.

AB Fen construction has recently been tested in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, Alberta, Canada in an effort to return peatlands to the post-mining landscape. Understanding the drivers of organic matter decomposition in constructed fens will improve our capacity to evaluate the return of ecosystem function while also helping to inform management activities that could optimize peat accumulation. At a four year old constructed fen, we measured the decomposition of Carex aquatilis and Juncus balticus tissue over one year along with soil physical and chemical properties including concentrations of phenolic compounds in pore water, and potential phenol oxidase and hydrolase enzyme activities. Results were compared to three reference fens. Averaged across both species, decomposition of aboveground plant tissue was significantly slower at the constructed fen than the reference fens. Across the reference fens, a positive relationship between phenolic compound concentrations and decomposition constant (k) suggests microbial use of phenolic compounds as substrates. We found no evidence that phenolic compounds suppressed decomposition. At the constructed fen, a negative relationship between total potential hydrolase activity and k was observed, suggesting that nutrient limitation may suppress microbial activity at the site. There was little evidence that mulch or planting treatments altered short-term litter decomposition rate at the constructed fen, indicating that future research should focus on differences in biomass production between species, below ground nutrient cycling and the longer term preservation of litter as peat to determine strategies for optimizing peat accumulation.

AB Boreal peatlands store large amounts of carbon, reflecting their important role in the global carbon cycle. The short-term exchange and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in these ecosystems are closely associated with the permanently wet surface conditions and are susceptible to drought. Especially, the single most important peat forming plant genus, Sphagnum, depends heavily on surface wetness for its primary production. Changes in rainfall patterns are expected to affect surface wetness, but how this transient rewetting affects net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) remains unknown. This study explores how the timing and characteristics of rain events during photosynthetic active periods, that is daytime, affect peatland NEE and whether rain event associated changes in environmental conditions modify this response (e.g. water table, radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature). We analysed an 11-year time series of half-hourly eddy covariance and meteorological measurements from Degero Stormyr, a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results show that daytime rain events systematically decreased the sink strength of peatlands for atmospheric CO2. The decrease was best explained by rain associated reduction in light, rather than by rain characteristics or drought length. An average daytime growing season rain event reduced net ecosystem CO2 uptake by 0.23-0.54gCm(-2). On an annual basis, this reduction of net CO2 uptake corresponds to 24% of the annual net CO2 uptake (NEE) of the study site, equivalent to a 4.4% reduction of gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. We conclude that reduced light availability associated with rain events is more important in explaining the NEE response to rain events than rain characteristics and changes in water availability. This suggests that peatland CO2 uptake is highly sensitive to changes in cloud cover formation and to altered rainfall regimes, a process hitherto largely ignored.

AB We examined short-term (decadal) and long-term (millenial) processes of peat accumulation, and the links between them, in a Sphagnum bog in continental Canada. A previously published model of bog growth was fitted to age profiles of the oxic acrotelm (surface, <60 cm thick) and the underlying, anoxic catotelm (210 cm thick). Approximately 5300 years of accumulation were represented in a radiocarbon-dated core that extended to the base of the deepest part of the peat deposit. The model estimated that the overall rate at which material entered long-term storage in the catotelm was 60-66 g . m(-2). a(-1). Although the decay rate coefficient was near zero, the bog stopped accumulating peat within the past 1500 years, resulting from either a decrease in the rate of transfer of material from the acrotelm or an increase in the rate of decay of material at the top of the catotelm. The model of bog growth estimated recent inputs to the acrotelm (90-930 g . m(-2). a(-1)) that were twofold higher than published field measurements of aboveground productivity, and decay rate coefficients (0.005-0.040 a(-1)) that were 10-fold lower than published litter-bag measurements of mass loss. The pattern of mass loss over time, approximated from nitrogen concentration data, deviated from the pattern predicted by exponential models of decay. Calculations of the balance between additions to and losses from the acrotelm suggest that the amount of material transferred to the underlying catotelm differs among microhabitats. Such spatial variability in short-term processes is incompatible with long-term processes determining the position of the acrotelm-catotelm boundary. We discuss the applicability of the model to continental peatlands and suggest ways to improve modelling of short-term autogenic processes.

AB The restoration of cutaway peatlands provides an opportunity to return the carbon (C) sink function and to examine the influence of climate on peat formation and C accumulation. We studied CO2 exchange dynamics in 2002 and 2003 at a rewetted cutaway peatland located within the temperate maritime climatic zone. Gross photosynthesis (P-G), ecosystem respiration (R-TOT), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were observed in a range of microsites representing a hydroseral succession gradient: Typha latifolia - Phalaris arundinacea, Eriophorum angustifolium - Carex rostrata, and Juncus effusus - Holcus lanatus vegetation communities and areas of bare (unvegetated) peat. Annual rainfall was 26% higher in 2002 and 4% lower in 2003 than the long-term average and influenced water table position at all microsites. Observed instantaneous CO2 fluxes varied temporally and spatially at all microsites. Modelled P-G was strongly dependent on irradiation (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) and the Vascular Green Area index (VGA). R-TOT was influenced by the soil temperature at 5 cm depth (T-5cm) and the water table position. All microsites were net sources of CO2 in both years of the study, and higher losses (with the exception of Juncus / Holcus) were observed in 2003 at all microsites. In general, losses followed the trend Juncus / Holcus > Phalaris > Typha > bare peat > Eriophorum - Carex in 2002 and Phalaris > Juncus - Holcus > Typha > Eriophorum / Carex > bare peat in 2003. Losses ranged from -163 to -651 g CO2 - C center dot m(-2)center dot y(-1) in 2002 and -308 to -760 g CO2 - C center dot m(-2)center dot y(-1) in 2003. Considerable wintertime losses were observed at all microsites. The results from this study suggest that these peatlands are vulnerable to interannual variations in climatic inputs and that future predictions of climatic change may make restoration of the C sink function in cutaway peatlands in the temperate maritime climatic zone a considerable challenge in the years ahead.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for carbon (C) storage, provision of water resources and biodiversity. UK blanket peats represent 10-15% of those found worldwide. While many peatlands continue to be managed through artificial drainage and vegetation burning, it has long been recognized that local habitats and ecological diversity are strongly influenced by these practices. This paper reviews the hydrological, physicochemical and ecological effects of three widespread U K peatland management practices, namely artificial drainage, drain-blocking and rotational heather burning. Drainage and burning of peat often lead to altered runoff regimes, oxidation of organic matter, changes to C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, and increased metal and suspended sediment concentrations in streams relative to intact peatlands. Although artificial drainage is now rarely implemented on UK upland peats, a great number of historical drains remain, thus drain-blocking is increasingly being applied to restore many peatlands. In contrast, recent increases in the intensity and extent of rotational heather burning may result in further changes to peatland ecosystems. Relatively little is known about the environmental effects of rotational heather burning compared with drainage and drain-blocking management, and for all three of these management techniques there is scarce information on river ecosystem response. We hypothesize some likely effects of basin-scale drainage, drain-blocking and heather burning on stream ecosystems and illustrate these with a schematic model. Such a holistic consideration of peatland river basins is particularly timely with respect to the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB Peat extraction for energy purposes causes major changes in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. According to national strategies for extracting peat in Finland, new peat extraction areas should be established on previously drained peatlands. On such areas it is difficult to find the natural, intact peatland required for treatment wetlands or so-called overland flow areas, which are considered the best available technology for runoff water purification. Therefore treatment wetlands must be constructed on drained peatland. It is known that drainage causes physical, biogeochemical and hydraulic changes in the peat layer, as well as changes in vegetation. It is probable that these changes affect the purification efficiency of wetland treatment systems in many ways. This study evaluated the function and characteristics of drained peatland areas for purification of peat extraction runoff water. Study sites were established on 11 drained wetlands and their purification efficiency was evaluated. Detailed measurements of peat physical properties and hydraulic conductivity, as well as studies on vegetation, were also made in the study areas. The results showed that wetlands constructed on drained peatland areas can purify peat extraction runoff. However, leaching of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) was observed in some areas. Leaching is influenced e.g. by pH and the soil P pool. The chemical oxygen demand was also observed to increase in runoff water from the wetland. The results indicated that low (Fe + aluminium (Al) + manganese (Mn))/P ratio (<= 25) and quite high P content (>1200 mg/kg) in the surface peat characterised those areas where P leaching was observed. The presence of a dense tree stand in a drained peatland area also seemed to indicate release of nutrients from the area after its rewetting and use as a treatment wetland. Thus, potential nutrient release from a drained peatland area intended for use as a treatment wetland can be assessed by studying the characteristics of the peatland area, especially the peat mineral content, and the vegetation, especially tree stand density in the area. Using the findings obtained, a conceptual decision tree was drawn up in order to help to establish and design wetlands in previously drained peatland areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Boreal peat-forming wetlands, mires, are globally important sources of methane and sinks for CO2. As peatland vegetation plays a significant role regulating the exchange of these greenhouse gases, we have assessed the responses of the dominant plants and ecosystem functions to increasing tropospheric ozone concentration and enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation in long-term experiments, the results of which are summarized in this review. The dominant sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, and especially the Sphagnum mosses common on peatlands, appear fairly tolerant to the future predicted ozone levels. Similarly, UV-B radiation only caused few alterations in the carbohydrates and pigments of the dominant sedge, Eriophorum russeolum, and had no effects on the dominant moss species of the experimental site, Warnstorfia exannulata. Surprisingly, there were alterations in organic acid concentrations in the peat pore water and peat microbial community composition in both experiments. Elevated ozone caused a transient decrease in ecosystem-level gross photosynthesis and methane (CH4) emission, which shifted to a slight increase later on. Enhanced UV-B decreased dark ecosystem respiration and increased CH4 emission in the course of the six measurement years. The emission of isoprene was increased by both ozone and UV-B during warm weather periods, suggesting interactive effects with temperature. All in all, we suggest that ozone and UV-B have limited effects on the carbon cycle in boreal peatlands, because other environmental factors, such as temperature, water level and photosynthetically active radiation more strongly regulate CO2 and CH4 exchange rates.

AB Modeling risk factors to soils is constrained by the lack of key data and understanding that explicitly and quantitatively link specific threats to risk. Peat erosion results from the complex interaction of climatic, topographic, and anthropogenic influences acting over a long period of time. With numerous contemporary factors operating to perpetuate the erosion processes, it is often difficult to identify with certainty what actually are the initial and subsequent drivers of erosion. In this situation, expert opinion forms a vital source of information. Here we demonstrate how Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) can be used to combine quantitative data from the National Soils Inventory of Scotland (NSIS) with qualitative expert knowledge to estimate risk of peat erosion in Scotland. This model was used to identify the main factors associated with peat erosion. It was shown that climatic variables (increased temperature, decreased precipitation) are the most important risk factors for perpetuating peatland erosion. However, the BBN approach also indicated that maintaining good vegetation cover is a significant mitigating factor. It would follow that land management practices that impact negatively on vegetation cover would also exacerbate peatland erosion given a hot dry climate.

AB Peatlands cover a large area in Canada and globally (12% and 3% of the landmass, respectively). These ecosystems play an important role in climate regulation through the sequestration of carbon dioxide from, and the release of methane to, the atmosphere. Monitoring approaches, required to understand the response of peatlands to climate change at large spatial scales, are challenged by their unique vegetation characteristics, intrinsic hydrological complexity, and rapid changes over short periods of time (e.g., seasonality). In this study, we demonstrate the use of multitemporal, high spatial resolution (1 m(2)) hyperspectral airborne imagery (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and Shortwave Airborne Spectrographic Imager (SASI) sensors) for assessing maximum instantaneous gross photosynthesis (PGmax) in hummocks, and gravimetric water content (GWC) and carbon uptake efficiency in hollows, at the Mer Bleue ombrotrophic bog. We applied empirical models (i.e., in situ data and spectral indices) and we derived spatial and temporal trends for the aforementioned variables. Our findings revealed the distribution of hummocks (51.2%), hollows (12.7%), and tree cover (33.6%), which is the first high spatial resolution map of this nature at Mer Bleue. For hummocks, we found growing season PGmax values between 8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 12. tmol m(-2) s(-1) were predominant (86.3% of the total area). For hollows, our results revealed, for the first time, the spatial heterogeneity and seasonal trends for gravimetric water content and carbon uptake efficiency for the whole bog.

AB Sphagnum moss is an important genus of plants responsible for large stores of soil organic carbon associated with wet habitats, such as northern peatlands. Northern peatlands, which contain globally significant quantities of legacy carbon, may be vulnerable to enhanced summer moisture deficits due to climate change. We adapted HYDRUS-1D and a semi-arid soil-moisture model to investigate the role of microtopographic position and depth dependence of peat hydraulic properties on Sphagnum moisture-stress response to current and projected climate conditions in an idealized northern Michigan peatland. Water table (WT) level was shown to have a strong control on pore-water pressure () and thus on Sphagnum moisture stress. As a result of the close correspondence between surface peat hydraulic properties for hummocks and hollows used to parameterize our model, the microtopographic position was shown to have a greater impact on Sphagnum moisture stress. Model behaviour suggests that, while maintains equilibrium-profile values relative to the WT level for relatively shallow values, surface becomes nonlinearly related to the WT level below a value of approximately -0.4 m, thus, greatly increasing the likelihood of desiccation under future climate scenarios, where growing-season soil-moisture deficits are projected to increase. The simulated range of instantaneous and cumulative moisture stress for hollows under future climate conditions closely corresponds to the contemporary range exhibited by hummocks. Therefore, in order to assess the competitive advantage of various Sphagnum species to future climate conditions, we argue that more data are needed to better inform a physiological psi-based moisture-stress threshold, the evolution of the stress response to increasing levels of desiccation and its subsequent recovery dynamics.

ID PEATLANDS
AB It is commonly assumed that the development of blanket bogs is governed more by climatic factors than by topography, but no quantitative studies have been undertaken. The primary aim of this research was to quantitatively assess the extent and nature of the topographic influence of both the surface and the underlying substrate on the distribution of bog and heath communities within a blanket bog complex. Three blanket bog sites on the southeastern lobe of the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, were studied. Terrain shape characteristics such as slope, plan and profile curvature, and upslope catchment area were derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) of surface and mineral substrate, and analysed using Partition d'un Ensemble Geographique pour l'Analyse Spatiale Ecologique (PEGASE), a procedure based on concepts from information theory. The analysis showed that topography accounted for approximately 22% of the structure underlying the distribution of bog and heath communities within the blanket bog complexes studied. Furthermore, only substrate morphology, which represents the topographic conditions at the initiation of peat accumulation, strongly affected the present pattern of bog and heath at the sites. Although lower elevations were more favourable for bog development, bog communities persisted in upper elevations in areas where the topography assisted in detaining water.

AB Results of long-term estimates of carbon stock and current carbon sequestration in pine-shrub-sphagnum BGC in Vasyugan Mire (VM) are discussed. In different climatic conditions (different years), ND P varies from 206 to 337 g Cm-2 year(-1). An increase in carbon-emission intensity was detected in drier vegetation periods. Most of the carbon losses are the emission of carbon dioxide (average is 61.3 g Cm-2 years(-1), or 23.5% NPP). It is possible to ascertain the progression of peat formation. The removal of the carbon by bog waters was calculated using a mathematical model. It was estimated as 3.0% ND D with a mean value of the removal of 7.9 g Cm-2 years(-1). Based on the model of bogs vertical growth, the modern rate of carbon accumulation was estimated in the range from 10.3 g Cm-2 years(-1) in polygonal bogs to 51.7 g Cm-2 years(-1) in grassy bogs.

AB Global warming is expected to have greater impacts on northern peatlands in coming decade than most other ecosystems. Bacterial and methanogen communities in peatlands play a role in greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a feedback to global climate change. We investigated 3-degree warming effects on gas emissions (CO2 and CH4) and bacterial and methanogen communities in different depths of peat mire for 3 growing seasons. Warming doubled CO2 fluxes from the warming treatments compared to that from the control (P=0.08). Although CH4 fluxes were higher in the warming treatment, it was not a significant increase. Warming caused a shift in the composition of bacterial communities in the surface (1-3 cm, P<0.01) and middle layers (9-11 cm, P < 0.01), but not in the deep layer (17-19 cm). There were few changes in the diversity indices and quantity of bacterial communities due to the warming treatments. Warming significantly decreased the richness. Shannon diversity index, and quantity of methanogens. However, the composition was hardly related to temperature. The ratios of methanogens to bacteria in terms of gene copy numbers significantly decreased by a factor of 2-6 due to elevated temperature. The composition and diversity of bacteria and methanogens, respectively, were significantly related to soil depth. Temperature and soil depth interacted significantly on the bacterial diversity (P=0.01). The results suggest that warming is likely to influence the function and structure of microbial communities in peat lands. However, warming effects would be different with the type of microbial community and soil depth. Warming could favor bacterial communities over methanogens, which may induce changes in balance between CO2 and CH4 emissions from peatlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Holocene histories of two polygonal peatlands in the low arctic of south-central Nunavut, Canada, are reconstructed using plant macrofossil and pollen stratigraphies of four cores. Peat accumulation began in both basins between 7600 and 8000 cal. yr BP, within less than 1000 years after deglaciation. Mid- to late-Holocene vegetation changes recorded in the peat cores may be related to permafrost aggradation, associated with a regional cooling trend inferred from a nearby lake sediment record. However, differences in the timing of changes among the peatland coring sites indicate that local autogenic processes have also played an important role. Peat accumulation rates have decreased considerably in the past 3000 to 5000 years compared to the early Holocene. Our results illustrate the complexity of peatland development and peat accumulation dynamics in areas of permafrost, resulting from the important influences of both internal autogenic factors and external environmental forces such as climatic change.

AB The ability to predict the response of peatland ecosystems to hydrologic changes is imperative for successful conservation and remediation efforts. We studied a 1.25-ha Vermont kettlehole bog for one year (September 2001-October 2002) to identify hydrologic controls, temporal and spatial variability in flow regimes, and to link hydrologic processes to density of the carnivorous plant (Sarracenia purpurea), an ombrotrophic bog specialist. Using a spatial array of nested piezometers, we measured surface and subsurface flow in shallow peat and surrounding mineral soil. Our unique sampling array was based on a repeated measures factorial design with: (1) incremental distances from a central kettlehole pond; (2) equal distances between piezometers; and (3) at three depths from the peat surface.
   Local flow patterns in the peat were controlled by snowpack storage during winter and spring months and by evapotranspiration and pond water elevation during summer and fall months. Hydraulic head values showed a local reversal within the peat during spring months which was reflected in higher chemical constituent concentrations in these wells. On a regional scale, higher permeable soils diverted groundwater beneath the peatland to a nearby wetland complex. Horizontal water gradient magnitudes were larger in zones where the peatland was perched above regional groundwater and smaller in zones where a hydraulic connection existed between the peatland and the regional groundwater. The density of pitcher plants (S. purpurea) is strongly correlated to the distance from a central pond, [Fe3+], [Na+], [Cl-], and [SO42-]. The pH, conductivity, and [Ca2+] had significant effects of depth and time with horizontal distance correlations between 20 and 26 m. The pH samples had temporal correlations between 27 and 79 days. The link between pitcher plants and ion chemistry; significant effects of peatland chemistry on distance, depth, and time; and spatial and temporal correlations are important considerations for peatland restoration strategies.

AB When severely degraded fens are rewetted, they often become shallow lakes with an average water depth of less than 1 m. The additional high nutrient availability in highly decomposed peat soils of these newly formed ecosystems favours the fast establishment of a small number of helophytes while the return of lost target species like low sedges and brown mosses could be delayed for decades. We hypothesise that the phosphorus (P) uptake of the newly developed vegetation substantially influences the P cycle in rewetted fens. Therefore, we investigated how much of the P released in upper degraded peat soils is pumped across the redox-interface between the soil and surface water (='P barrier') during the growing season (similar to 150 days) by six helophytes (Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Glyceria maxima, Carex acutiformis, Carex riparia, and Phalaris arundinacea) in five rewetted fens. We then assessed how this would affect the different plant-available P fractions in the rooted degraded peat layers. The highest P uptake during the growing season (duration 150 days from May to September) was recorded for T. latifolia and G. maxima (3.0 and 2.8 g m(-2), respectively). Overall, the P uptake was in the range of the P mobilisation rates we measured in highly decomposed peat soils (range: 0.8-15.6 g P m(-)2(,) n=30), but four to 10-fold higher than diffusive net P fluxes at the interface between soil and surface water. Accordingly, helophytes are able to compensate for the high P mobilisation in degraded peat soils during the growing season, by incorporating this P into biomass. On the other hand a large part of the plant-P stock is released after die back through leaching and mineralisation, which increases the P load of these newly formed shallow lakes and possibly also of adjacent water courses. We estimated that it would still take 20-50 years to exhaust the large pool of plant-available Pin highly decomposed peat soils if aboveground biomass was removed. Without any further management apart from fen rewetting it is unlikely that the fens will return to low nutrient levels within a human life time. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Changes in the paleoecological environment over the last 10000 years were divided into five periods. The climate was characterized in the Holocene according to these periods. At the watershed studied, peatland-forming processes started about 9510 years ago resulting in 550 cm of peat accumulation. The rate of peat accumulation within the watershed decreased over time from 1.9-0.3 mm year(-1).

TI Inferring landscape dynamics of bog pools from scaling relationships and

AB 1 On many peatlands, a patterned landscape is formed by clusters of open-water pools enclosed by the peat of surrounding terrestrial and semi-aquatic habitats. Processes governing development of pool complexes operate over long time-scales (decades to millennia) that preclude direct observation and necessitate inferential analysis.
   2 We used present-day scaling relationships and spatial patterns of pools to test multiple hypotheses for development and dynamics of a bog pool complex in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The complex included 641 permanent pools, ranging in surface area from 2.3 to 1930 m(2).
   3 Allometric scaling relationships and spatial analysis showed that the shape and distribution of pools is size- (or age-) dependent. With increasing size, pools became deeper relative to their surroundings and more convoluted and elongated in shape. Pool orientation and bathymetry were related to direction of slope. Small pools were located on the periphery of a focus now occupied by the largest pools. Peat depth varied systematically across the complex, leading to changes in both direction and gradient of water flow.
   4 The evidence suggests that pools formed initially where water tended to pond, and subsequently spread outward as the flat plateau expanded. Pools have accumulated sediment more slowly than surrounding areas, and the continued initiation of new pools seems to depend on this spatial variation in rates of sediment accumulation. Our study provides both a fuller understanding of the development of one pool complex, and techniques for comparative analysis of others.

AB The closed chamber technique has been widely employed to detect methane emissions, despite little being known about whether the absence or presence of light will impact the flux estimation. Here, we employed a laser greenhouse gas analyzer with an opaque-transparent chamber pair to measure the methane emission rate in a boreal peatland complex. Microtopography (i.e., hummocks and hollows) in natural and drained peatlands, and plant communities (i.e., grasses and shrubs) in a pasture converted from natural peatlands, were considered to cover the local heterogeneity. Our results indicated that opaque chambers (0.58-0.78 g CH4 m(-2) during the growing season) measured a significantly higher (similar to 2-3 times) methane emission at the hummocks than transparent chambers (similar to 0.24 g CH4 m(-2)); however, a similar phenomenon was not found at the hollows or at other measurement plots. Gross photosynthesis explained 44%-47% of the temporal variation of the 'artificial bias' (the difference in methane flux obtained by the opaque versus transparent chambers) at the hummocks. Additionally, both water table depth and surface soil moisture significantly explained spatial variations of methane emissions. Our study suggests that microtopography has a significant influence on the artificial bias in methane emission estimation and the artificial properties of a chamber (transparency/opacity) method can be vitally important in some cases (i.e., hummocks), and negligible in others (i.e., hollows). The observed connection between the photosynthesis process and the 'artificial bias' of closed chambers (opaque versus transparent) can be used to improve methane flux modeling. Separate parameterization schemes are needed for methane transportation under the presence or absence of light.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and its components, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), were compared between a bog and an abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. Measurements based on the eddy covariance technique from April 2014 to April 2016 were used to examine the influence of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. NEE, GPP and ER at both sites showed pronounced seasonal variation, peaking near the middle growing season. The maximum net CO2 uptake rate of -28.61 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and emission rate of 14.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the pasture were significantly higher than those at the bog (-9.67 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Daytime average GPP was related to photosynthetic photon flux density and air temperature and the nighttime average ER decreased with soil water content, but increased with surface soil temperature for both sites. Annual NEE of the pasture (-128 +/- 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and -124 +/- 56 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16) was considerably larger than that of the bog (-46 +/- 36 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15). GPP of 1086 +/- 141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 982 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 and ER of 957 129 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 858 +/- 112 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 at the pasture were approximately twice the magnitude of the corresponding fluxes at the bog. The difference in GPP between the bog and pasture was mainly related to their different aboveground biomass. Higher ER at the pasture was probably related to its lower water table depth, greater substrate availability and higher autotrophic respiration. Unlike previous findings that managed peat lands are large CO2 emitters, our results suggest that abandoned peatland pastures can function like natural grasslands and sequester considerable amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB The number and the area of former milled peatlands under restoration have increased rapidly in the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades with the primary aim of promoting peat accumulation. However, the application of similar restoration techniques across different sites does not always lead to desired results, and some site-specific modifications may be needed. This study aimed to evaluate the response of aboveground plant biomass on three experimental sites in northern Estonia to different restoration techniques in degraded peatlands. The sites were restored using the moss layer transfer technique, which was modified with different plant spreading rates and species composition of spread material, fertilization, and creating variations in microtopography. The strongest effect of manipulations was found for bryophyte biomass responses to treatments. The creation of a microtopographic relief during the site preparation phase favored the development ofSphagnumbiomass in depressions rather than in positive microforms. The species composition of the spreading material had some effect on bryophyte biomass:Sphagnumbiomass was higher where hummock species had been spread. We did not find any statistical difference in the ratio ofSphagnumreintroduction tested ranging from 1:10 to 1:15.

AB We have described the relationship between depth and age of surface peat in hummock and lawn communities on eleven Swedish mires in order to estimate the rate of annual peat increment.  The study comprises peat down to a depth of ca. 0.6 m and altogether 679 age determinations were made.  Peat younger than 50 yr was found at highly variable depths.  Consequently, the rate of annual peat increment was also highly variable.  The highest maximum rate of annual peat increment was always found in hummock communities.  With increasing age of peat, the range of depths in which peat of a certain age occurred, decreased.  This was more obvious in hummock than in lawn communities, indicating that the compaction was more pronounced in hummock communities.  Most of the compaction occurred when the peat was younger than 50 yr.  The age of the surface peat was determined by the use of small specimens of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. on which we measured the vertical distance from the growing point to the mire surface and counted the annual rings.

AB We found a consistent distribution pattern for radiocarbon in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and methane replicated across spatial and temporal scales in northern peatlands from Minnesota to Alaska. The C-14 content of DOC is relatively modern throughout the peat column, to depths of 3 m. In sedge-dominated peatlands, the C-14 contents of the products of respiration, CH4 and DIC, are essentially the same and are similar to that of DOC. In Sphagnum- and woody plant-dominated peatlands with few sedges, however, the respiration products are similar but intermediate between the C-14 contents of the solid phase peat and the DOC. Preliminary data indicates qualitative differences in the pore water DOC, depending on the extent of sedge cover, consistent with the hypothesis that the DOC in sedge-dominated peatlands is more reactive than DOC in peatlands where Sphagnum or other vascular plants dominate. These data are supported by molecular level analysis of DOC by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry that suggests more dramatic changes with depth in the composition of DOC in the sedge-dominated peatland pore waters relative to changes observed in DOC where Sphagnum dominates. The higher reactivity of DOC from sedge-dominated peatlands may be a function of either different source materials or environmental factors that are related to the abundance of sedges in peatlands.

AB Practices currently employed in the investigation and characterisation of peat deposits are destructive and may irremediable perturb peat bog development even in cases when exploitation is not carried out. We investigated the correlation between vegetation characteristics in the active area of Poiana Stampei peat bog, Romania, and the underlying peat layer depth, aiming at establishing a non-destructive method of peat layer depth estimation. The presence of the Sphagneto-Eriophoretum vaginati association, dominated by Sphagnum fimbfiatum, Diophorum vaginatum, Andromeda polifolia, Vaccinium oxycoccos, V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Polytrichum commune, Picea excelsa, Pinus sylvestris and Betula verrucosa was found to predict the existence of the peat layer but not its depth. Out of the seven identified vegetation types, one type was associated with a very thin or no peat layer, one type was characterised by the presence of a thick (over 100 cm) peat layer and five types indicated the presence of variable average depths of the peat layer. pH values correlated with peat layer depth only within the vegetation type associated with thick peat layers.

AB This study comparing the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in natural, restored, and naturally regenerated peatlands assesses the significance of peatland restoration as a global biotic offset under the Kyoto Protocol. Maximum gross photosynthesis (GP) at the restored peatland (-17.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) was more than two times that at lawns in the natural peatland (-8.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) and almost three times that of the naturally regenerated peatland (-6.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). However, GP(max) at hummock sites (-18.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the natural peatland exceeded that of the restored peatland. Total rainfall during the study period was similar to 75% of the 30-year mean and these drier conditions resulted in all sites being a net source of atmospheric CO2 during the summer. From May 5 to August 23, 1998 respiration followed the trend: mined (398 g C m(-2)) > restored (169 g C m(-2)) > natural (138 g C m(-2)) peatland. While restoration did not return the net carbon sink function, it resulted in a significant decrease in the source of atmospheric CO2 (229 g C m(-2)) over the summer season. Approximately 70% of this decrease was due to the increase in gross ecosystem production, while the remaining 30% was due to a decrease in total respiration. The presence of Sphagnum mosses at the naturally regenerated peatland also resulted in a similar to 45% decrease in total respiration (soil and plants), indicating that an increase in volumetric soil moisture content during restoration has the potential to lower soil respiration at abandoned mined peatlands. Considering the area of drained and mined peatlands globally, peatland restoration on abandoned mined peatlands has the potential to represent an important biotic offset through enhanced carbon sequestration.

AB A study (August 1990 to July 1991) of profiles of dissolved CH4 concentrations, diffusive flux of CH4, and CH4 production rates of 45 sites in the Lake Agassiz Peatlands in northern Minnesota shows that dissolved CH4 deep in the peat (> 1 m depth) mobilized easily to the vadose zone. During August 1990 the dissolved CH4 concentrations at some depths at some sites were supersaturated with respect to one atmosphere partial pressure of CH4. At one site (2.5 m depth) the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore-water was 140 mg L(-1). In July 1991, at no site did the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore water exceed 40 mg L(-1) in the peat profile. The average calculated diffusive flux of CH4 decreased from 95 to 45 mg m(-2) d(-1) between 1990 and 1991. Gaseous CH4 was more in evidence in 1990 than in 1991. In 1990, CH4 at many depths bubbled vigorously when pear pore water was sampled. At some sites there was sufficient pore pressure to eject slugs of water forcibly from piezometers. Similarly, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) consisting of H2CO3, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- decreased between the sampling times from an average for both bogs and fens in 1990 of 62 mg C L(-1) to 38 mg C L(-1) in 1991. A dynamic mechanism must exist which traps CH4 deep in the peat column allowing gaseous CH4 to build up, increasing dissolved CH4. Other times, CH4 passes freely from deep peat to the vadose zone. We suggest as a hypothesis that a confining layer of trapped CH4 bubbles forms at depth in the peat, trapping gaseous CH4. The duration of the ''bubble confining layer'' is uncertain. We propose two hypotheses. (1) The confining layer is usually present and deteriorates after a major climatic event such as a drought, or (2) the confining layer forms and collapses seasonally with seasonal variations in the water table elevation.

AB In order to develop new tools in the reconstruction of microbiological processes in ancient continental settings, we determined the concentration of archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol in four Holocene ombrotrophic peatlands, spanning a range of European climate zones. Neither ether lipid was present in the aerobic acrotelm peat, consistent with an origin from anaerobic archaea, presumably methanogens. At the depth of the maximum seasonal water table, archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol concentration markedly increased at all four sites, again consistent with an anaerobic source, but differed strongly among sites. The differences apparently reflect a combination of vegetation - ericaceous and graminoid plants as opposed to Sphagnum spp. and other mosses lacking root systems - and temperature influence on methanogenesis. In particular, low ether lipid concentrations in Finland probably reflect the lack of vascular vegetation possessing well-developed root systems, together with low mean annual temperature. Similarly low concentrations of archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol in a German bog likely result from winter temperatures below 0 degrees C and a relatively shorter growing season. The occurrence of sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol is limited to a narrow and shallow depth range, indicating that it is poorly preserved, but archaeol persists throughout the cores. Decoupling the concentration of archaeol and the more labile sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol below ca. 50 cm suggests that the former records fossil biomass rather than living biomass. If so, then downcore variation in archaeol concentration likely reflects past changes in methane cycling, and archaeol, pending further developmental research, could serve as a new tool for reconstruction of past peatland biogeochemistry.

AB Here we used organic composition and stable isotopic analysis to evaluate the effects of drainage and restoration at an ombrotrophic peatiand, to assess whether rewetting of blanket bogs will reverse degradation. The organic composition of the peat and the isotopic fractionation between the solid (peat), liquid (pore water) and gas (soil gas) phases on actively accumulating, degrading and restored locations are compared. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the organic material has shown a high level of humification (low decomposition) in the active peat. Stable isotope analysis in the solid, liquid and gas phases has corresponded with this and indicated that the active location is enriched in C-13 in the solid and gas phases, N-15 in the solid phase, O-18 in the liquid and gas phases and Din the liquid phase, suggesting a closed system with limited isotopic fractionation and thus limited water movement and decomposition. The degrading location has a lower level of humification, and is depleted in C-13 in the solid phase due to ingression of vascular plants. The restored location has high humification and enrichment of C-13 and N-15 in the solid phase, and Din the liquid phase suggesting increased microbial activity. C-13 and O-18 in the gas phase and O-18 in the liquid phase are depleted, as a result of microbial mediated gas production and rewetting. FTIR analysis has also indicated a subsurface zone of increased decomposition between the acrotelm and catotelm in both the active and degrading peat. This is due to a stable water table and is not present within the restored location, which we attribute to water table fluctuation associated with rewetting. This zone of increased decomposition adds to the complexity of blanket bog peatlands and the assumption that all systems can be generalized under one conceptual model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The spatial and temporal variability of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and evapotranspiration (ET) of a karst-hole sphagnum peat mire situated at the boundary between broad-leaved and forest-steppe zones in the central part of European Russia in the Tula region was described using results from field measurements. NEE and ET were measured using a portable measuring system consisting of a transparent ventilated chamber combined with an infrared CO2/H2O analyzer, LI-840A (Li-Cor, USA) along a transect from the southern peripheral part of the mire to its center under sunny clear-sky weather conditions in the period from May to September of 2012 and in May 2013. The results of the field measurements showed significant spatial and temporal variability of NEE and ET that was mainly influenced by incoming solar radiation and ground water level. The seasonal patterns of NEE and ET within the mire were quite different. During the entire growing season the central part of the mire was a sink of CO2 for the atmosphere. NEE reached maximal values in June-July (-6.8 +/- 4.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The southern peripheral part of the mire, due to strong shading by the surrounding forest, was a sink of CO2 for the atmosphere in June-July only. ET reached maximal values in the well-lighted central parts of the mire in May (0.34 +/- 0.20 mm h(-1)) mainly because of high air and surface temperatures and the very wet upper peat horizon and sphagnum moss. Herbaceous species made the maximum contribution to the total gross primary production (GPP) in both the central and the peripheral parts of the mire. The contribution of sphagnum to the total GPP of these plant communities was relatively small and ranged on sunny days of July-August from -1.1 +/- 1.1 mgC g(-1) of dry weight (DW) per hour in the peripheral zone of the mire to -0.6 +/- 0.2 mgC g(-1) DW h(-1) at the mire center. The sphagnum layer made the maximum contribution to total ET at the mire center (0.25 +/- 0.10 mm h(-1)) and the herbaceous species on the peripheral part of the mire (0.0 3 +/- 0.03 mm h(-1)).

AB The partitioning of latent heat flux (Q(E)) to vascular plant and moss surface components was assessed for a Sphagnum-dominated bog with a hummock-hollow surface having a sparse canopy of low shrubs. Results from porometry and eddy covariance measurements of Q(E) showed evaporation from the moss surface ranged from greater than 50% of total Q(E) early in the growing season to less than 20% after a dry period toward the end of the growing season. Both soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit (D-a) affected this partitioning with drier moss and peat, lower water table. and smaller D-a all reducing MOSS Q(E). Daily maximum moss Q(E) ranged from greater than 200 W m(-2) early in the growing season to less than 100 W m(-2) during a dry period. In contrast, vascular contribution to total QE increased over the season from a daily maximum of about 150 W m(-2) to 250 W m(-2) due to increase in leaf area by leaf replacement and emergence and to drying of the moss surface. Porometry results showed average daily maximum conductance from bog shrubs was near 8 mm s(-1). These conductance values were smaller than those reported for vascular plants from more nutrient-rich wetlands. The effect of increases in D-a on vascular QE were moderated by decreases in stomatal conductance. At constant available energy, vascular leaf conductance was reduced by as much as 2 mm s(-1) and moss surface conductance was enhanced by up to 3 mm s(-1) by large D-a. Considering vascular and non-vascular water transport characteristics and frequency of water table position and given the observed variations of Q(E) partitioning with water table location and moss and peat water content, it is suggested that modelling efforts focus on how dry hummocks and wet hollows each contribute to Q(E), especially as related to D-a and soil moisture dynamics.

AB Northern peatlands have been accumulating organic matter since the start of the Holocene, and are now a substantial store of terrestrial carbon. However, their current status as carbon sinks is less clear, because of the possible effects of climate change, air pollution, grazing and drainage etc., and the difficulties of accurate measurement with suitable time resolution. Such measurements are particularly lacking in the UK. Here, we present multi-year eddy covariance measurements of the carbon fluxes at a relatively undisturbed ombrotrophic blanket bog in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The site consistently acted as a moderate sink for CO2 over all the measurement years (mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -114 g C m(-2) y(-1)), similar in magnitude to other measurements in the boreal and tundra zones, and rather higher than the existing measurements at other sites in the UK and Ireland. Generally, the NEE of CO2 was relatively insensitive to moderate inter-annual variations in weather. Non-CO2 losses comprised 11% of gross primary production, mainly from methane emissions. Accounting for these terms, the net ecosystem carbon balance was -50 g C-CO2 eq m(-2) y(-1). The contemporary carbon sink was larger than estimates from local peat cores, based on peat accumulation over the last several thousand years, but in the middle of the range of estimates which used spheroidal carbonaceous particles to estimate peat accumulation rates over the last century.

AB Sphagnum bogs in the southern Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America are rare and diverse ecosystems the unique climate range they occupy allows for a mixture of northern and southern species to thrive creating isolated biodiversity hotspots Research on northern bogs in Europe and North America has found that climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition can shift species composition of bog communities and release carbon however research on southern bogs has not begun to answer questions about their fate We reviewed research conducted in northern bogs and applied this information to southern Appalachian bogs to explore the potential impacts that climate change may have on southern Sphagnum bogs The projected increase in evapotranspiration coupled with nitrogen deposition may lead to the drying up of southern bogs causing (1) increased decomposition rates which can lead to the system becoming a carbon source rather than a sink and (2) local extinction of many bog species allowing alternative ecosystems to replace the bogs Because of these threats we suggest a call to action for scientists and managers to begin investigating the specific Impacts that climate change will have on bogs in the southeastern United States so we may better protect and conserve these unique and diverse habitats

AB Climate warming increases evapotranspiration (ET) more in boreal peatlands than in forests. Observations show that peatland ET can exceed forest ET by up to 30%, indicating a stronger warming response in peatlands. Earth system models do not fully account for peatlands and hence may underestimate future boreal ET.
   The response of evapotranspiration (ET) to warming is of critical importance to the water and carbon cycle of the boreal biome, a mosaic of land cover types dominated by forests and peatlands. The effect of warming-induced vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increases on boreal ET remains poorly understood because peatlands are not specifically represented as plant functional types in Earth system models. Here we show that peatland ET increases more than forest ET with increasing VPD using observations from 95 eddy covariance tower sites. At high VPD of more than 2 kPa, peatland ET exceeds forest ET by up to 30%. Future (2091-2100) mid-growing season peatland ET is estimated to exceed forest ET by over 20% in about one-third of the boreal biome for RCP4.5 and about two-thirds for RCP8.5. Peatland-specific ET responses to VPD should therefore be included in Earth system models to avoid biases in water and carbon cycle projections.

AB Mapping peatland extent in Canada would contribute important information concerning carbon balance and hydrology. While such mapping, based on air photo interpretation and remote sensing data, has recently improved, maps have been limited to 1:1 million scale. We hypothesized that forest structure information from forest inventory plots could be used to predict the presence of forested and treed peat lands in boreal Canada at the ground plot-level, and that a resulting model could be used to predict the distribution of forested and treed peatlands across Canada. Inventory ground plots from the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) with organic soil depth measurements were used to create a model of the presence of treed to forested (canopy cover ranging from sparse to closed) peatlands (greater than 40 cm organic soil depth) in boreal Canada. The presence of black spruce (Picea mariana) or larch (Larix laricina), in combination with low stand height and stand age greater than 75 years, were the strongest predictors of the presence of peatlands. Bioclimatic variables related to high diurnal and annual temperature variation, consistent with a continental climate, also contributed to the increased predicted presence of treed peatlands. Both logistic and boosted regression tree models showed similar results, with similar to 87% accuracy in the discrimination of treed peatlands when validated against an independent set of ground plots. The boosted regression tree model was propagated across Canada using forest attribute raster data layers at 250 m resolution from the NFI along with bioclimatic layers. Estimates of treed peatland extent agreed with data points from peat cores with 85-95% accuracy in the Boreal Shield ecozone, although prediction was less accurate in the more southern boreal and Great Lakes forest areas. The resulting map can be used as an input to forest carbon modelling, and the improved knowledge of treed peatland extent will be useful in modelling wildfire or peatland drainage.

AB Aims Present-day large-scale and plot-based vegetation analyses contribute to the transnational characterization and interpretation of biodiversity patterns and to habitat typologies, which are important for planning, monitoring and decision making in nature conservation. Many historical vegetation surveys applied cover abundance, relative occurrence or density scales (species-quantity scales) that are nowadays poorly known and consequently disregarded or misinterpreted. Therefore, it is worthwhile to put effort into making them compatible with the datasets sampled using mainstream methods. Within Europe, this especially applies to historical data from Fennoscandia. Here, we aim to propose how to transform the species-quantity scales frequently used in Fennoscandia into percentage cover scales, based on the conversion of their individual grades. Study area Fennoscandia, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Fennoscandian part of Russia (Republic of Karelia, Karelian Isthmus, Murmansk Region). Methods and results We inventoried Fennoscandian vegetation plot studies and identified that the most frequently applied species-quantity scales were those of Norrlin, Hult-Sernander and Drude. We reviewed the definitions and applications of these scales in the literature and, if not available, calculated hypothetical species covers to approximate realistic conversions to the percentage scale. As a result, we propose alternative ways of conversion of the individual scale grades to mid-percentage cover values. Conclusion Historical vegetation plot data from Fennoscandia can be used as quantitative information for vegetation research if their grades are consistently transformed into percentage cover values using the proposals presented in this paper.

AB The objective of this study was to show that temperate zone fens could be constructed on a surface of glacial gravel or a surface without preformed hydric soil. A reference study examined the construction of a fen on remnants of a buried fen. Each construct was replicated in four sections planted with seeds, greenhouse-grown stock or natural fen plant communities. An artesian well supplied high carbonate water through the subsurface. After 8 years, each fen contained 71 species in common, the gravel-based fen had 28 additional species and the soil-based fen had 21 additional species. On the third year, the gravel-based fen began producing calcareous peat composed of brown mosses and by the eighth year a 10 cm layer of peat covered most of the surface. The gravel-based fen produced short and less densely distributed plants than the soil-based fen but the gravel-based fen had a greater number of rare plants. While most plantings had a high degree of survival the naturally derived plugs were the most successful and the seed produced the fewest survivors. We show that, given continuous groundwater supply, it is possible to produce a high diversity fen-like environment on either substrate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are the largest natural carbon store as a result of environmental conditions that limit decomposition rates. However, climate change is predicted to threaten peatland C sink function through rising temperatures, lowered water tables and the expansion of vascular plants. Here, by selecting four peatland habitats differing in their dominant plant communities and abiotic conditions, we investigated the influence of the most relevant climatic factors (namely temperature and soil water content) in controlling the spatial and temporal responses of soil organisms and their potential links to above-ground plant functional diversity. We found that the soil mesofaunal communities under vascular plants were mainly dominated by microarthropods (oribatid mites and collembolans), and contrasted with those under mosses that consisted of enchytreids and dipterans (approximate to 15% dissimilarity). We show that the balance of tolerance to drought and saturation determined the temporal dynamics and vertical stratification of the soil invertebrate populations. From this, we anticipate that the projected expansion of vascular plants not only will displace active peat forming vegetation species (mosses), but also those invertebrates that are poorly adapted to the new environment (enchytraeids and dipteral larvae). Our findings indicate future peatland responses to environmental changes should take into account the habitat complexity above- and below-ground community structure) and the modulating effects of the abiotic environment.

SO BOREAS
LA English
DT Article
ID LAKE-SEDIMENTS; RHIZOPODA; AMEBAS
AB Radiocarbon-dating and analyses of fossil testate amoebae (Protozoa) have established changes in soil moisture conditions on the developing surface of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland near Emo in northwestern Ontario. The distribution and composition of modern testate amoebae communities were studied from peatlands in the region of Ontario and Minnesota as a guide to interpreting fossil assemblages. Although the core spans all of the Holocene, fossil testate amoebae were recovered only from the part post-dating 6500 BP. Earliest testate amoebae assemblages associated with bryophytic and cyperaceous-rich fen peat are dominated by species in the genera Cyclopyxis and Centropyxis. By 5000 BP, Amphitrema flavum, Assulina muscorum, Heleopera sphagni and Hyalosphenia subflava become important species as Sphagnum-rich peat accumulated at the site. Present-day microtopographic differentiation probably developed during historic time when the site became progressively drier, as indicated by a change of Nebela griseola, N. militaris and Trigonopyxis arcula. Although it is possible to derive quantitative estimates of changing soil moisture conditions from testate amoebae, care should be taken in interpreting results, particularly from non-Sphagnum-rich peats, until more is learned about the distribution and ecology of modern faunas.

AB Increases in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) reaching the earth have been estimated to continue until 2050s in the boreal and subarctic regions with an abundant peatland cover. Peatlands are significant sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) and sources for methane (CH4). To assess whether the future increases in UV-B could affect the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in peatlands via an impact on vegetation, we exposed peatland microcosms to modulated 30% supplementation of erythemally weighted UV-B at an outdoor facility for one growing season. The experimental design included appropriate controls for UV-A and ambient radiation. The UV-B caused a significant reduction in gross photosynthesis, net ecosystem CO2 exchange, and CH4 emission of the peatland microcosms. These changes in the carbon gas cycling can be partly explained by UV-B-induced morphological changes in Eriophorum vaginatum which acts as a conduit for CH4. Leaf cross section and the percentage of CH4-conducting aerenchymatous tissue in E. vaginatum were significantly reduced by UV-B. Methanol-extractable UV-B absorbing compounds decreased under both UV-B and UV-A in Sphagnum angustifolium, and tended to accumulate under UV-B in S. papillosum. Membrane permeability to magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) ions was higher in UV-B exposed S. angustifolium. Amount of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments was increased by UV-A in S. magellanicum. The observed changes in Sphagnum mosses did not coincide with those in carbon gas fluxes but occurred at the time of the highest UV intensity in the mid summer. Our findings indicate that increasing UV-B may have more substantial effects on gas exchange in peatlands than previously thought.

AB Mercury (Hg) records in natural archives such as peat bogs are often used to evaluate anthropogenic or climatic influences on atmospheric Hg deposition. In this context, there is an ongoing discussion about natural sources or processes of Hg enrichment in natural archives. In the present study we estimated Hg fluxes from rock weathering, direct atmospheric deposition and from indirect atmospheric deposition in the catchment of a pristine minerogenic fen (GC2) located in the Magellanic Moorlands, southernmost Chile. The Hg record in the bog covers 11 174 cal. C-14 years and shows Hg concentrations of up to 570 mug kg(-1) with an average of 268 mug kg(-1). Hg was found to be enriched in the peat by a factor of 81 if compared to the mean Hg concentrations in the rocks of the catchment (3.2 mug kg(-1)). Hg and also Pb, Fe, and As were found to be enriched predominately in goethite layers indicating high retention of these elements in the bog by iron oxyhydrates. It could also be demonstrated that the high peat decomposition rates in minerogenic bogs can increase the Hg concentrations in the minerogenic peat by a factor of approximately 2 at the same atmospheric Hg deposition rate if compared to ombrotrophic sites. This study has shown that Hg in minerogenic peat can be naturally enriched especially through the retention by autochthonous formed goethite and can be a solely internal process which does not require increased external Hg fluxes.

AB In European peatlands which have been drained and cut-over in the past, re-vegetation often stagnates after the return of a species-poor Sphagnum community. Re-introduction of currently absent species may be a useful tool to restore a typical, and more diverse, Sphagnum vegetation and may ultimately improve the functioning of peatland ecosystems, regarding atmospheric carbon sequestration. Yet, the factors controlling the success of re-introduction are unclear. In Ireland and Estonia, we transplanted small and large aggregates of three Sphagnum species into existing vegetation. We recorded changes in cover over a 3-year period, at two water levels (-5 and -20 cm).
   Performance of transplanted aggregates of Sphagnum was highly species specific. Hummock species profited at low water tables, whereas hollow species profited at high water tables. But Our results indicate that performance and establishment of species was also promoted by increased aggregate size. This mechanism (positive self-association) has earlier been seen in other ecosystems, but our results are the first to show this mechanism in peatlands. Our results do not agree with present management, which is aimed at retaining water on the surface of peat remnants in order to restore a functional and diverse Sphagnum community. More than the water table, aggregate size of the reintroduced species is crucial for species performance, and ultimately for successful peatland restoration. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB Although numerous descriptive studies have been published throughout the 20th century on peat communities in the Southern Cone of South America, the nomenclature applied to the different units recognised often fails to take into account the proposals of previous authors. Our aim is to clarify the nomenclature by applying the rules of the ICPN to propose a current syntaxonomy of the class Myrteolo nummulariae-Sphagnetea magellanici. After a bibliographic compilation of possible peatland associations from the part of South America between parallels 40 degrees and 56 degrees south, under Temperate and Boreal macroclimates, we have collected around 30 names of phytosociological associations and alliances containing an abundance of homonyms and nomina nuda. Following ICPN standards, we have eliminated duplications and established priority names over others, lectotypified some names and rejected others as nomen ambiguum. We have arranged the floristic groups in the recognised associations in synthetic tables, with some nomina nuda whose characterisation we interpret as doubtful, as a proposed syntaxonomical organisation of the phytosociological class.

AB Peatlands accumulated large carbon (C) stocks as peat in historical times. Currently however, many peatlands are on the verge of becoming sources with their C sequestration function becoming sensitive to environmental changes such as increases in temperature, decreasing water table and enhanced nitrogen deposition. Long term changes in vegetation composition are both, a consequence and indicator of future changes in C sequestration. Spatial continuous accurate assessment of the vegetation composition is a current challenge in keeping a close watch on peatland vegetation changes. In this study we quantified the fractional cover of three major plant functional types (PFTs; Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, and ericoid shrubs) in peatlands, using field spectroscopy reflectance measurements (400-2400 nm) on 25 plots differing in PFT cover. The data was validated using point intercept methodology on the same plots. Our results showed that the detection of open Sphagnum versus Sphagnum covered by vascular plants (shrubs and graminoids) is feasible with an R(2) of 0.81. On the other hand, the partitioning of the vascular plant fraction into shrubs and graminoids revealed lower correlations of R(2) of 0.54 and 0.57, respectively. This study was based on a dataset where the reflectance of all main PFTs and their pure components within the peatland was measured at local spatial scales. Spectrally measured species or plant community abundances can further be used to bridge scaling gaps up to canopy scale, ultimately allowing upscaling of the C balance of peatlands to the ecosystem level.

AB Temperature sensitivities of microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production were investigated by using a novel method, thermal gradient (2-20A degrees C) temperature bar, in two typical peatlands (bog and fen) in North Wales, UK over 12 months. The study indicated that temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition in North peatlands was regulated not only by temperature but soil water content, dry-rewet event and phenologies. Potential decreases of Q(10) (CO2) with increasing soil temperature were confirmed in both peatlands, but Q(10) (DOC) increase with increasing soil temperature in both bog and fen sites. These results imply, if other factors such as the so-called CO2 fertilization effect are simultaneously taken into account, that the feedback of global warming induced CO2 release from peatlands to climate change may be overestimated in current biogeochemical models. However, global warming might have been nonlinearly accelerating DOC thermal production, and therefore it helps explaining the causes of remarkable increase of DOC in surface water in the Northern Hemisphere during last several decades.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon was measured using eddy covariance for four growing seasons at a subarctic hummocky fen in northern Manitoba, Canada. Over a 115 day measurement period each year, cumulative net ecosystem exchange of carbon ranged from a gain of 49 g C m(-2) to a loss of 16 g C m(-2) with a mean loss of 6gCm(-2) from the fen,with an uncertainty of about +/- 34 g C m(-2). Ecosystem respiration decreased with higher water tables (r(2) = 0.3), especially in one summer when flooding occurred to 0.12 m above the peat surface. Additional methane emissions previously documented for the site of 4-5.7 g C m(-2)year(-1) added to the carbon loss. Carbon loss was measured from this same fen in the 1990s and it is likely that the carbon gain (peat accumulation) during past centuries has not continued in recent decades. Scaling to annual greenhouse gas emissions as a 100 year global warming potential showed that this fen is currently a source of 192-490 g CO2-equivalents m(-2) year based on both carbon dioxide and methane flux measurements, indicating that peat is decomposing.

AB Peatlands are large repositories of carbon (C). Sphagnum mosses play a key role in C sequestration, whereas the presence of vascular plants is generally thought to stimulate peat decomposition. Recent studies stress the importance of plant species for peat quality and soil microbial activity. Thus, learning about specific plant-microbe-soil relations and their potential feedbacks for C and nutrient cycling are important for a correct understanding of C sequestration in peatlands and its potential shift associated with vegetation change. We studied how the long-term presence of blueberry and cotton-grass, the main vascular dominants of spruce swamp forests, is reflected in the peat characteristics, soil microbial biomass and activities, and the possible implications of their spread for nutrient cycling and C storage in these systems. We showed that the potential effect of vascular plants on ecosystem functioning is species specific and need not necessarily result in increased organic matter decomposition. Although the presence of blueberry enhanced phosphorus availability, soil microbial biomass and the activities of C-acquiring enzymes, cotton-grass strongly depleted phosphorus and nitrogen from the peat. The harsh conditions and prevailing anoxia retarded the decomposition of cotton-grass litter and caused no significant enhancement in microbial biomass and exoenzymatic activity. Therefore, the spread of blueberry in peatlands may stimulate organic matter decomposition and negatively affect the C sequestration process, whereas the potential spread of cotton-grass would not likely change the functioning of peatlands as C sinks.

AB In peatland ecosystems, plant communities mediate a globally significant carbon store. The effects of global environmental change on plant assemblages are expected to be a factor in determining how ecosystem functions such as carbon uptake will respond. Using vegetation data from 56 Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs across Europe, we show that in these ecosystems plant species aggregate into two major clusters that are each defined by shared response to environmental conditions. Across environmental gradients, we find significant taxonomic turnover in both clusters. However, functional identity and functional redundancy of the community as a whole remain unchanged. This strongly suggests that in peat bogs, species turnover across environmental gradients is restricted to functionally similar species. Our results demonstrate that plant taxonomic and functional turnover are decoupled, which may allow these peat bogs to maintain ecosystem functioning when subject to future environmental change.

AB Sediment cores were taken from the central pond and fringing mat of a Sphagnum peatland located in the Big Woods vegetation type. Pollen analysis of the pond core spanning 12 000 cal. BP to the present indicated a mid-postglacial warm period (10 000 to 3900 cal. BP at this site), when the area was covered by open oak woodland and prairie. From 3900 to 300 cal. BP oak forest expanded. At 300 cal. BP (AD 1650) Big Woods species (e.g., Tilia, Ostrya, Ulmus and Acer) increased as a result of 'Little Ice Age' cooling. Diatoms indicating water of high acid-neutralizing capacity (e.g., Stephanodiscus hantzschii) dominated the lake during the mid-Holocene. At 2100 cal. BP these species were succeeded by Aulacoseira distans and A. perglabra, indicating water of low acid-neutralizing capacity and marking peatland initiation. Transfer functions derived from diatoms in surface-sediment samples from Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan suggest that this change was associated with reduced acid-neutralizing capacity in Pogonia Bog Pond. This decline was probably caused by peat accumulation around the Pond. The development of peatland at Pogonia Bog is late relative to sites farther north and east, indicating that the climate of the site has become conducive to peat accumulation in the last 2200 years and that the initiation of peatland development represents a time-transgressive boundary that has moved across central North America.

AB We investigated the soil chemical environment of coastal peat mires with a Picea glehnii forest and Sphagnum community in Ochiishi, north-eastern Japan. We tested the hypothesis that the soil chemical environment in an ombrotrophic peat mire is affected by the vegetation and the consequent chemical modification of precipitation by plants. We measured the chemical properties of peat pore water and precipitation both in the P. glehnii forest and the Sphagnum community and found that the forest acidifies the peat and accumulates sea salt deposited by precipitation. Picea glehnii grows in soils that have a higher salt concentration than the Sphagnum communities. We measured a stem flow salt concentration that was higher than the bulk deposition. The salt concentration in precipitation and peat pore water decreased with increasing distance from the coastline. These results imply that atmospheric sea salt deposition is effectively trapped by the P. glehnii canopy, and it then contributes to the accumulation of salt and the consequent acidification within the peat. Stem-flow water was more acidic than bulk deposition or throughfall within the P. glehnii forests. This means that acids are dissolved while precipitation runs through on the bark of P. glehnii, and then the acids are transferred and accumulate in the peat. The chemical modification of precipitation by P. glehnii makes the soil chemical environment more acidic than the Sphagnum community that usually makes the soil environment acidic in a peat mire ecosystem.

AB Plant species shape soil properties such as nutrient availability and carbon storage through functional traits. Understanding the role of plant functional traits, and the relationship between aboveground and belowground systems are especially important in boreal peatlands, which are important carbon sinks. Sphagnum as a key peat-forming bryophyte has long been considered an ecosystem engineer, whereas the engineering role of graminoids, also dominant in peatlands, has not traditionally been considered.
   We quantified vegetation community composition, plant functional traits, and peat properties in two peatland sites differing in dominant vegetation (Sphagnum mosses and Carex sedges), and link plant traits with peat properties using ordination.
   We show that plant traits significantly explain many peat properties, including organochemicals that are indicators of decomposition dynamics. Specifically, Carex-dominated sites had larger amount of 'decomposition products' while a larger proportion of 'undecomposed materials' was observed in Sphagnum-dominated sites.
   Feedbacks in plant-soil systems are increasingly being recognised as drivers of ecosystem processes. In both peatland types, plant traits of the key ecosystem engineer drove properties of the belowground peat environment. Peat organochemical constituents between Sphagnum-dominated and Carex-dominated sites reveal differences in ecosystem function, and thus the conducive potential for carbon storage.

AB Peat Core W3 was taken from the fen in Wolbrom (Silesian-Cracovian Upland, Southern Poland) in September 2015. Previous analyses of Core W3 showed a significant increase in lead concentration during the time of the Roman Empire as well as some changes in peat accumulation conditions. The work reported here investigates its geochemical composition in terms of major and trace elements (Pb, Zn, Na, K, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Cu, Ni, Cr by AAS) as well as Pb isotopic composition, to identify the sources of metal pollution in the Wolbrom peat deposit. The geochemical record spans the period from 4900 BC to modern times, with a likely hiatus corresponding to the period from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the contemporary metallurgical industry. The Pb isotopic composition combined with a cluster analysis allows identification of the primary sources of Pb. In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps to decipher the most important factors that affected the chemical composition of sediments at Wolbrom. These factors were linked to chemical denudation and human activity.

AB Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) derives from incomplete combustion of organic matter and is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic systems. Most PyC is inherently more stable against decomposition than plant residues, and PyC therefore forms an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle. During the Holocene, about 436Pg organic C accumulated in northern peatlands, and we hypothesize that PyC may contribute substantially to that C stock. We studied 70 samples from 19 intact and degraded European peatland sites and analyzed their PyC content by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular modeling and peat age and accumulation by radiocarbon dating. Classification of a peatland as either intact or degraded was based on the comparison between apparent and expected long-term C accumulation rates. On average, PyC amounted for 135% of soil C across sites, and accounted for up to 50% at single sites. The amount of PyC increased significantly with peat age. Degraded peatlands had lost approximately 56kgCm(-2), half of their former C stock. However, degraded peat had higher PyC contents than intact one. Selective enrichment of PyC during both peat build-up and decomposition seems to be an important factor fostering PyC accumulation. Assignment of our results to peatlands of the northern hemisphere, stratified by age, revealed an estimated PyC stock of 62 (+/- 22)Pg. Our estimate indicates a substantial and hitherto unquantified contribution of northern peatlands to global PyC storage. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB Among wetlands, rich fens are one of the most species-rich, and also one of the most threatened habitats due to drainage activities. We tested the effects of several restoration measures on vegetation composition and dynamics over 4 years in two rich fens in east central Sweden that had been drained about 50 years ago. The encroaching tree layer was removed, and the restoration measures examined were rewetting by ditch blocking, mowing, and peat disturbance (removing vegetation and mixing the surface peat). At both sites, rewetting alone (without mowing or peat disturbance) led to small changes in species composition. In plots with peat disturbance, several characteristic rich fen species established, probably from a persistent diaspore bank or from refugia nearby. The disturbance treatment also prevented a rapid reestablishment of dominant grasses and mosses that had spread since drainage. Late season mowing alone appeared not to be a very efficient treatment in the initial phase after restoration, but seemed to reinforce the positive effects of peat disturbance. The results indicate the necessity of combining several treatments to recreate an ecologically functional vegetation.

AB Northern peatland ecosystems represent large carbon (C) stocks that are susceptible to changes such as accelerated mineralization due to water table lowering expected under a climate change scenario. During the growing seasons (1 May to 31 October) of 2011 and 2012 we monitored CO2 fluxes and plant biomass along a microtopographic gradient (hummocks- hollows) in an undisturbed dry continental boreal treed bog (control) and a nearby site that was drained (drained) in 2001. Ten years of drainage in the bog significantly increased coverage of shrubs at hummocks and lichens at hollows. Considering measured hummock coverage and including tree incremental growth, we estimate that the control site was a sink of -92 in 2011 and -70 g C m(-2) in 2012, while the drained site was a source of 27 and 23 g C m-2 over the same years. We infer that, drainage-induced changes in vegetation growth led to increased biomass to counteract a portion of soil carbon losses. These results suggest that spatial variability (microtopography) and changes in vegetation community in boreal peatlands will affect how these ecosystems respond to lowered water table potentially induced by climate change.

AB . Bogs, economically valuable wetlands, are subjected to exploitation in southern Canada. We addressed plant conservation within bogs mined for peat, in which small undisturbed remnants are left, mostly at the margins of the mined areas. The main goal of the study was to test whether these remnants act as refuges for plants which could recolonize areas that are planned for restoration after mining is completed. Mosses, lichens and vascular plants were sampled in remnants of 24 mined bogs in southeastern Canada during the summer of 1997. The vegetation was also sampled at the margins and centres of 24 nearby natural bogs in plots similar in size to these remnants. Using similarity analysis and ordination techniques, we found that plant species assemblages in remnants of mined bogs differ from those near the margins of natural bogs, and that certain species are associated with the centre of natural bogs, due to the presence of pools. We also showed that water conditions of remnants are affected by drainage due to peat mining. Sphagnum moss showed itself to be a key indicator of mining effects on vegetation. Implications for peat resource management and bog conservation are discussed.

AB The vertical distribution of biomass and production was measured using indirect C-14 isotope techniques in a boreal mesotrophic fen dominated by Carex rostrata and Potentilla palustris. The biomass of C. rostrata was high (2290 g . m(-2)), 78% of which was fine-root biomass. Even with a low turnover rate (0.59 yr(-1)), fine roots also accounted for 74% of the total production of 1424 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The majority of the belowground biomass was found in the uppermost 30 cm. However, living roots of C. rostrata were found down to a depth of 230 cm. In fen ecosystems, the direct input of carbon through deep-penetrating roots to slowly decomposing layers may considerably affect the accumulation of peat.

AB [1] To examine belowground carbon (C) turnover in peatlands, we measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) by chamber measurements, estimated respiration by in situ incubations of peat, and in situ production of dissolved carbon (CO(2); CH(4); and dissolved organic carbon, DOC) by pore water modeling at an ombrotrophic temperate bog. Ecosystem respiration (ER) averaged 205 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in summer and was related to temperature, but not water table position, and in situ rates of heterotrophic respiration in the unsaturated zone were also temperature-dependent, with Q(10) = 5.0 - 6.4. In the saturated zone, concentrations of 0.1 - 2.5 mmol L(-1) (CO(2)), 0 to 0.6 mmol L(-1) (CH(4)), and < 10 - 120 mg L(-1) (DOC) were recorded. Turnover was dominated by DOC unrelated to respiration, which ranged from < 0.5 to 7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and amounted on average to < 1% of ER. Peat decomposition constants k(d) were 0.060 yr(-1) to 0.034 yr(-1) in the unsaturated and < 0.002 yr(-1) in the saturated zone. Monthly averages of CH(4) fluxes ranged from 0 to 1.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and were higher than modeled diffusive fluxes when threshold concentrations for CH(4) ebullition were recorded closer to the peatland surface. Our results suggest that the saturated zone is of little relevance to ER in this dry temperate bog and that mobilization of DOC is a potentially more relevant process. Temperature is a more important control on ER than water table position because most of the ER is generated close to the peatland surface. Concurrent, moderate increases in temperature and soil moisture are thus likely to increase losses of CO(2) from ER and of CH(4) from this type of peatland.

AB Large areas of naturally open peatland in western Europe were drained and planted with non-native conifers in the twentieth century. Efforts arc currently underway to restore many of these sites. Ultimately, forest-to-bog restoration aims to bring back functional peatlands that can sequester carbon but there is a lack of empirical evidence for whether current approaches are effective. Using a chronosequence design, we compared the annual gaseous carbon balance of two forest-to-bog restoration areas with an open area not subject to afforestation. A closed chamber method was used to determine gas fluxes (Net Ecosystem Respiration, Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4)) over a twelve-month period for locations spanning the range of peatland microtopography and vegetation communities. Relationships between gas fluxes, vegetation/ cover and environmental factors were analysed and regression models used to estimate annual CO2 and CH4 budgets. During the study period, NEE estimates (total gaseous C expressed as CO2-eq) showed a net sink for the unafforested (-102 g C M-2 yr(-1)) and oldest ( -131 g C M-2 yr(-1)) restoration area (17 years post-restoration 'RES 17 YRS'), whilst the youngest restoration area (6 years post-restoration 'RES 6YRS'), was a net source (35 g C m(-2) yr (-1)). We observed significantly higher CH4 emissions from restoration areas dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium compared with other peatland vegetation types. Sampling points with higher cover of Sphagnum were found to be most effective for C sequestration. Overall, vegetation composition/cover was observed to be an important factor determining C emissions from forest-to-bog restoration areas. These results suggest that restoration is effective in returning the carbon sink function of peatlands damaged by commercial forestry and - depending on restoration techniques - timescales of >10 years may be required.

AB 1. A valid strategy to mitigate the eutrophication of water bodies due to non-point source phosphorus (P) pollution and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases is the rewetting of degraded peatlands. However, long-term drainage and intensive agricultural use make it unlikely that the original sink functions for nutrients and carbon (C) as well as low-nutrient conditions can be re-established within a human time perspective.
   2. We hypothesized that the removal of the upper degraded peat layer can be a suitable measure to avoid the negative implications of excess mobilization of P and C after rewetting. To evaluate the effect of top soil removal (TSR) we performed lab and field experiments in six inundated peatlands in northern Germany without TSR compared to six inundated sites with TSR. In addition, we included data from a rewetted peatland where the degraded peat had been removed from about half of the area and groundwater level was just beneath the soil surface.
   3. The results emphasized that following inundation newly formed detritus mud layers overlying the former peat surface are the dominating source for P and methane in particular in sites without TSR but also in sites with TSR, although at significantly lower rates. Although highly decomposed peat released more or less no methane, dissolved organic matter mobilization was highest in this substrate while less decomposed peat was characterized in general by lowest rates of mobilization.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Top soil removal prior to rewetting can be a suitable method to avoid the negative consequences of the excess release of phosphorus (P) and carbon post-rewetting. We developed a simple decision support schematic to assist the peatland restoration process and to better understand the implications of top soil removal. Despite the potential benefits, top soil removal should not be declared as a universal method, as it requires detailed consideration prior to application. However, this and other research demonstrate that it is inevitable that without any further management interventions high mobilization of P, dissolved organic matter and methane may persist for centuries following rewetting of peatlands.

ID SOIL PROPERTIES; PEAT
AB Peatlands exploited for their peat by the method of milling are poorly recolonized by plants after the cessation of extraction activities, in part due to unstable peat substrates. Wind erosion has been suspected to play a role in this instability. Four studies were conducted to investigate the role of wind erosion on abandoned milled peatlands. A wind tunnel experiment was performed to evaluate the erodibility of dry, loose peat as a function of its degree of decomposition. A second wind tunnel experiment was conducted to determine how crusted peats differ in their resistance to erosion as a function of their degree of decomposition, without the input of abraders. Third, wind profiles were measured in milled, revegetated and natural peatlands in southeastern Quebec to determine their aerodynamic roughness length. Finally, field measurements were made at three abandoned milled peatlands through two field seasons to characterize substrate stability and particle movement. In the wind tunnel, the erodibility of loose surface peat decreased with increasing decomposition and was predicted by their equivalent diameter to mineral particles 0.84 mm in diameter. However, once surface crusts formed, peats were all resistant to erosion. Surfaces of abandoned milled peatlands were aerodynamically smooth; therefore, exposed surface elements are subject to strong erosive forces during wind events. The greatest subsidence on abandoned milled peatlands occurred in the spring, prior to the surface movement of particles. Erosion during the summer could not be clearly detected. The instability of the peat surface remains a constraint for the restoration of abandoned milled surfaces.

AB A 7000-year record of local fire history was reconstructed from three ombrotrophic peatlands in the James Bay lowlands (northwestern Quebec, Canada) using a high-resolution analysis of macroscopic charcoal (long axis >= 0.5 mm). The impact of fire on vegetation changes was evaluated using detailed analysis of plant macrofossils. Compared to upland boreal forest, fire incidence in these Sphagnum-dominated bogs is rather low. Past fire occurrence seems to have been controlled primarily by internal processes associated with local hydroseral succession. Size of the peatland basin and distance from the well-drained forest soils also appear to be factors controlling fire occurrence. The impact of peatland fires on long-term vegetation succession appears negligible except in a forested bog, where it initiated the replacement of Sphagnum by mosses. In some circumstances, fire caused marked changes in the bryophyte assemblages over many decades. However, ombrotrophic peatland vegetation is generally resilient to surface fire.

AB There have been widespread attempts to rewet peatlands in Europe and elsewhere in the world to restore their unique biodiversity as well as their important function as nutrient and carbon sinks. However, changes in hydrological regime and therefore oxygen availability likely alter the abundance of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenolic compounds, which have been suggested as a "latch" preventing large amounts of carbon from being released into the atmosphere by microbial mineralization. In recent years, a variety of factors have been identified that appear to weaken that latch including not only oxygen, but also pH. In minerotrophic fens, it is unknown if long-term peat mineralization during decades of drainage and intense agricultural use causes an enrichment or a decline of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenols. To address this, we collected peat samples and fresh roots of dominating plants (i.e., the peat parent material) from the upper 20cm peat layer in 5 rewetted and 6 natural fens and quantified total phenolic content as well as hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Polyphenols from less decomposed peat and living roots served partly as an internal standard for polyphenol analysis and to run enzyme inhibition tests. As hypothesized, we found the polyphenol content in highly decomposed peat to be eight times lower than in less decomposed peat, while condensed tannin content was 50 times lower in highly degraded peat. In addition, plant tissue polyphenol contents differed strongly between peat-forming plant species, with the highest amount found in roots of Carex appropinquata at 450 mg g(-1) dry mass, and lowest in Sphagnum spp. at 39 mg g(-1) dry mass: a 10-fold difference. Despite large and clear differences in peat and porewater chemistry between natural and rewetted sites, enzyme activities determined with Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and peat degradation were not significantly correlated, indicating no simple linear relationship between polyphenol content and microbial activity. Still, samples with low contents of polyphenols and condensed tannins showed the highest microbial activities as measured with FDA.

AB The mineralogy of three back-barrier peat marshes (Torreblanca, Benicasim and Moncofar marshes) from Eastern Spain and one peat bog (Orihuela del Tremedal bog) from central east Spain have been investigated, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM) techniques. A combination of XRD methods was used to quantify the mineralogy of dried bulk peat samples.
   The water source in the peat marshes is both continental and marine. Water is highly mineralised. Water flow is both low and slow (accumulative system). The water source in the peat bog is continental, draining from the hill. The higher concentration of ions in the water of the back-barrier peat marshes leads to a higher concentration of authigenic minerals in the peat marshes compared to the peat bog.
   Three main mineral origins have been recognized, namely: detrital, syngenetic-epigenetic and biogenic. The more important contribution comes from the detrital system.
   Biogenic and bio-influenced minerals are the main non-detrital minerals in the peatlands. This paper discusses the biogenic origin of halite (and other minor halides and sulphates, such as, sylvite, carnalite, epsomite, glauberite, mirabilite and anhydrite?) from halophytic plants, as well as amorphous silica (opal-A) from sponge spicules and phytoliths of several plants.
   Pyrite in the peat bog has both syngenetic and epigenetic origins from plant decomposition and sulphur release. In the peat marsh the pyrite has a syngenetic origin from sulphate reduction (S-sulphate -> S-pyritic and an epigenetic origin in the older peat, from plant decomposition (S-organic -> S-pyritic).

AB Vast areas of peatlands have been drained for forestry endangering their carbon sink function. Peatland rewetting aims at mitigating the situation through restoring the hydrology and vegetation of these areas. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and phytomass on four pairs of rewetted and pristine peatland sites in Finland and Estonia, and described correlations between phytomass and CO2 fluxes. We measured the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), respiration and photosynthesis over one growing season using manual chambers, and biomass of plant functional types (PFT) on rewetted sites and their pristine counterparts. Although pair-wise differences in the vegetation were small, pristine sites were on average stronger CO2 sinks than rewetted sites. Respiration was higher in hummocks while no differences were found in photosynthesis between hummocks and hollows. No clear relationship between the biomasses of PFTs and NEE was found. Generally, however, CO2 uptake decreased with increase in Sphagnum biomass.

AB Production of soil gases is important in nutrient and carbon cycling, particularly in peatlands due to their large atmospheric emissions of several greenhouse gases. We examined factors controlling aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration in three contrasting types of freshwater North Carolina peatland communities (short pocosins, tall pocosins and gum swamps) which occur along a natural soil nutrient availability gradient. Short pocosins occur in the ombrotrophic center of the bog complexes and are extremely nutrient-deficient; tall pocosins are slightly less nutrient-deficient; and gum swamps are relatively nutrient-rich. Short pocosin had the lowest soil CO2 production rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in laboratory experiments, while rates in tall pocosin were similar to or somewhat less than in the gum swamp. Methanogenesis rates were extremely low in laboratory experiments, and indicate that CH4 production is not a significant pathway of carbon flow in these peatlands. Methane production is also low in relation to other peatlands. Amendment experiments indicate that the poor substrate quality of the highly decomposed, humified peat limits both CO2 and CH4 production rates, even though the peat is 95% organic matter. Low soil nutrient concentrations and low pH do not directly limit soil respiration in these peatlands, although there is a positive feedback of nutrients with organic matter inputs and litter quality, causing greater soil respiration in nutrient-rich sites.
   In situ CO2 emissions similarly differed between the communities, with highest rates in the gum swamp and lowest rates in the pocosins. Emissions were highly seasonal with soil temperature explaining the majority of the temporal variability. Maximum potential CH, emission estimates derived from laboratory temperature relationships and in situ soil temperature data indicate that pocosins make an insignificant contribution to the global atmospheric CH4 flux. The continued existence of peatlands in warm climates may to a large extent depend on the low substrate quality of their soil organic matter, which maintains low decomposition rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB Wetlands are very vulnerable ecosystems and sensitive to changes in the ground water table. For the last few thousand years, hydrological balance has also been influenced by human activity. To improve their cropping features, drainage activity and fertilizing were applied. The drainage process led to an abrupt change of environment, the replacement of plant communities and the entire ecosystem. The problem of carbon sequestration is very important nowadays. A higher accumulation rate is related to higher carbon accumulation, but the intensity of carbon sequestration depends on the type of mire, habitat, and climatic zone. The main aim of this article was an examination of the changes in poor-fen ecosystem during the last 200 years in relation to natural and anthropogenic factors, using paleoecological methods (pollen and macrofossils). The second aim was a detailed investigation of the sedimentary record to aid our understanding of carbon sequestration in the poor fen of temperate zone. This case study shows that fens in temperate zones, in comparison with boreal ones, show higher carbon accumulation rates which have been especially intensive over the last few decades. To reconstruct vegetation changes, detailed palynological and macrofossil analyses were done. A 200-year history of the mire revealed that it was influenced by human activity to much degree. However, despite the nearby settlement and building of the drainage ditch, the precious species and plant communities still occur.

AB Northern peatlands, which are highly heterogeneous ecosystems, are a globally important carbon (C) store. Understanding the drivers and predicting the future trajectory of the peatland C store requires upscaling from cores and sites to regions and continents, alongside a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing their C sequestration. Studies incorporating replication are therefore important to quantify how peatland heterogeneity may affect upscaling from local-scale dynamics to models. In addition, we need to better understand the processes driving observed variability, but the interplay between plants, microbes and C cycling in peatlands remains poorly understood. One approach to address both issues is to examine replicated microbiological functional traits within a multi-proxy framework to provide an ecosystem-level perspective on ecological and biogeochemical processes. Peatland testate amoebae are a functionally important group of protists that are well suited to such an approach. Analysing testate amoeba functional traits provides an opportunity to examine processes that may affect key peatland ecosystem services, such as C sequestration. Here, we compared four key testate amoeba functional traits (mixotrophy, biovolume, aperture size and aperture position) to C accumulation, hydrological and vegetation changes in 12 post-Little Ice Age peat records. Samples were collected from high-boreal and low-subarctic regions in northwestern Quebec, Canada in an experimental design that includes internal and external replication at both site and regional scales. Our results showed that correspondence between C accumulation, hydrology and testate amoeba functional traits varied, but recent changes in mixotrophy and aperture size, which may affect peatland C sequestration potential and microbial food web structure, respectively, showed tentative links to recent C accumulation increases. Vegetation, especiallySphagnumabundance was important in promoting mixotrophy and small aperture size in testate amoeba communities. Future impacts of climate change on peatland vegetation will further influence the functional role of testate amoebae on C sequestration through changing mixotrophic testate amoeba abundance.

AB In Solendet nature reserve in the upper boreal of central Norway, the effects of controlled trampling from 1977 to 1981 were observed in four rich fen localities. The vegetation recovery was monitored on permanent plots on 3-4 occasions during the period 1981-1995. During trampling the vegetation cover was reduced and bare peal increased, particularly in a wet fen expanse locality. Woody species and herbs disappeared or were considerably reduced in cover, while some graminoids (e.g. Carer spp. and Eriophorum angustifolium) and bryophytes (e.g. Campylium stellatum and Scoipidium cossonii), appeared to be quite tolerant. Equisetum palustre and Eriophorum angustifolium increased in cover on two tracks. Several bryophytes survived trampling, but Sphagnum warnstorfii was eradicated. Campylium stellatum and Tomentypnum nitens were able to increase after the decrease in S. warnstorfii. The recovery was dependent on which species were present at the outset and which species arrived early. Further development seemed to depend largely on the species' capacity for rapid increase in cover. Eventually, the more vulnerable dominants of the untrampled vegetation (e.g. Thalictrum alpinum, Trichophorum cespitosum and Sphagnum warnstorfii) increased in abundance. After 15 years the tracks still contained fewer species and had less vegetation cover than the surroundings.

AB Purpose The objective of this study was to determine the long-term environmental changes induced by ancient landslide in the mountain fen. Attempts were made to demonstrate the progress of the soil cover restoration process about 200 years after the landslides and associated with changes in vegetation and soil microarthropod biodiversity and occurrence pattern associated with the restoration of soil cover. Material and methods The study covered mountain fen of the Caltho-Alnetum in the Babiogorski National Park in Outer Flysch Carpathians, Poland, where ancient landslide deposits are causing disturbance in fen hydrologic regime and over time related to various rate of fen area natural restoration processes. The drill test has been used to assess changes in layering and thickness of the fen soils. The following soil parameters, such as pH and total organic carbon content, were determined at each distinguish layer. The diversity and distribution pattern of soil microarthropods, represented by Collembola, was examined in two parts of the fen: restored and not-restored. The soil parameters, such as pH, electrical conductivity, total exchangeable base, total organic carbon, and nitrogen content, were determined in the soil samples simultaneously. The assessment of the vegetation structure recovery within studied mountain fen after landslide was referred to average parameters of the community completed for other natural mountain fens under the Caltho-Alnetum community. The research results were statistically verified. Results and discussion The test drillings showed that landslides change soil layering, site-specific soil properties of mountain fen such as chemistry (the statistically significant differences were noted only in the case of total organic carbon content), vegetation structure, and soil microarthropod communities. By changing site-specific conditions, landslides influence on the biodiversity and peatland ecosystems functioning. Conclusion Our results clearly demonstrate that the landslide itself initiated a complex and lengthy process of changes in biological aspects of peatlands including the biodiversity of the underground fauna and plant community. Soil microarthropod communities represented by Collembola can be used as a good indicator of mountain fen restoration process.

AB Remote sensing techniques have potential for peatland monitoring, but most previous work has focused on spectral approaches that often result in poor discrimination of cover types and neglect structural information. Peatlands contain structural "microtopes" (e.g., hummocks and hollows) which are linked to hydrology, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and information on Surface structure is thus a useful proxy for peatland condition. The objective of this work was to develop and rest a new eco-hydrological mapping technique for ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands using a combined spectral-structural remote sensing approach. The study site was Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. Airborne light dectection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used with IKONOS data in a combined multispectral-structural approach for mapping peatland condition classes. LiDAR data were preprocessed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land Surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semi-variogram analysis) were extracted. These were assimilated alongside IKONOS data into a maximum likelihood classification procedure, and thematic outputs were compared. Ecological survey data were used to validate the results. Considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland classes were achieved when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semi-variance were included. Specifically, the classification accuracy improved From 71.8% (IKONOS data only) to 88.0% when a LiDAR semi-variance product was used. Of note was the improved delineation of management classes (including Eriophorum bog, active raised bog and degraded raised bog). The application of a combined textural-optical approach can improve land cover mapping in areas where reliance on purely spectral discrimination approaches would other-wise result in considerable thematic uncertainty

AB Dominant plant functional groups (PFGs) found in boreal rich fens include sedges, grasses, horsetails, and cinquefoils (obligate wetland shrubs). Precipitation regime shift and permafrost thaw due to climate change will likely trigger changes in fen plant community structure through shifts in these PFGs, and it is thus crucial to understand how these PFGs will impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics to predict and model peatland-climate feedbacks. In this study, we detail the above and belowground effects of these PFGs on aspects of carbon cycling using a mesocosm approach. We hypothesized that PFGs capable of aerating the rhizosphere (sedges, horsetails, and grasses) would oxidize the belowground environment supporting higher redox potentials, a favorable environment for decomposition, and higher CO2:CH4 in pore water and gas efflux measurements than PFGs lacking aerenchyma (cinquefoil, unplanted control). Overall, sedges, horsetail and grasses had an oxidizing effect on rhizosphere pore water chemistry, producing an environment more favorable for methanotrophy during the growing season, as supported by an approximate isotopic enrichment of pore water methane (delta(CH4)-C-13) by 5 parts per thousand, and isotopic depletion in pore water carbon dioxide (delta(CO2)-C-13) by 10 parts per thousand, relative to cinquefoil treatments. Cinquefoil and unplanted control treatments fostered a reducing environment more favorable for methanogenesis. In addition, cinquefoil appeared to slow decomposition in comparison with the other PFGs. These findings, paired with PFG effects on oxidation-reduction potential and CO2 and CH4 production, point to the ability of rich fen plant communities to moderate biogeochemistry, specifically carbon cycling, in response to changing climatic conditions.

AB Restoration of extracted horticultural peatlands commonly includes distribution of vegetation and propagules from nearby undisturbed sites over the recently-exposed surface. The resulting growth includes both mosses and vascular plants, which are important contributors to returning a peatland to a net carbon-storing ecosystem. Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux has not been widely investigated in these restored ecosystems. We compared the N2O flux from plots containing a vascular plant, Eriophorum vaginatum, to plots lacking vascular plant cover at a recently restored peatland. We hypothesized that E. vaginatum would result in decreased N2O emissions compared to areas with only moss or bare peat due to rapid plant uptake of peat nitrogen. After an early-summer pulse of emitted N2O, study plots containing E. vaginatum transitioned to net consumers of N2O while bare plots remained sources as the summer progressed. Furthermore, E. vaginatum growing in the wettest parts of the study site also had significantly more extractable nitrogen in pore water collected from 75 cm below the surface, beyond the depth of most roots. We suggest the priming effect driven by the roots of this vascular plant, combined with high water levels, frees some nitrogen from previously-inaccessible recalcitrant organic matter that then is taken up by plant roots and/or soil microorganisms, preventing its release as N2O. Vascular plants may play important roles in both greenhouse gas processes and in the nutrient cycles of restored peatlands and these complex processes need further investigation to guide effective restoration efforts that aim to return these disturbed ecosystems to net greenhouse gas sinks.

AB Factors controlling dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) production in degraded fen peatlands remains largely equivocal. Thus, the purpose of this research was to determine whether short-term changes in DOC and DON content and microbial properties are related to variations in weather conditions, soil properties and human activity. The study was conducted in May and September 2017 & ndash;2019 to determine the seasonal variations in the abovementioned parameters in soil layers (0 & ndash;30 cm) of a long-term agricultural peatland additionally affected by open-pit mining. We found that the most critical environmental factors that shape microbial community structure and activity are air temperature and precipitation, which explained 59.9% of the variability. Air temperature was also the most important explanatory factors for DOC and DON variation, which explained 18.9% of the total variability. Moreover, in the case of DOC and DON production, significant positive correlations with soil organic carbon content (DOC r = 0.46, p < 0.01; DON r = 0.54, p < 0.001) was found. The potential impact of open-pit mines on the DOC and DON production was not confirmed, as there was no significant difference between sites located in the depression cones (caused by lignite mining) and those sites affected exclusively by agriculture drainage. This work hopes to contribute towards a deeper understanding of the variables and dependencies that affect the production of labile organic forms in degraded fen peatland soils in the temperate climate zone.& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Testate amoebae are a group of moisture-sensitive, shell-producing protozoa that have been widely used as indicators of changes in mean water-table depth within oligotrophic peatlands. However, short-term environmental variability (i.e., sub-annual) also probably influences community composition. The objective of this study was to assess the potential influence of short-term environmental variability on the composition of testate amoeba communities in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. Testate amoebae and environmental conditions, including hourly measurements of relative humidity within the upper centimeter of the peatland surface, were examined throughout the 2008 growing season at 72 microsites within 11 peatlands of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, USA. Relationships among testate amoeba communities, vegetation, depth to water table, pH, and an index of short-term environmental variability (EVI), were examined using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and correlation analysis. Results suggest that EVI influences testate amoeba communities, with some taxa more abundant under highly variable conditions (e.g., Arcella discoides, Difflugia pulex, and Hyalosphenia subflava) and others more abundant when environmental conditions at the peatland surface were relatively stable (e.g., Archerella flavum and Bullinularia indica). The magnitude of environmental variability experienced at the peatland surface appears to be primarily controlled by vegetation composition and density. In particular, sites with dense Sphagnum cover had lower EVI values than sites with loose-growing Sphagnum or vegetation dominated by vascular plants and/or non-Sphagnum bryophytes. Our results suggest that more environmental information may be inferred from testate amoebae than previously recognized. Knowledge of relationships between testate amoebae and short-term environmental variability should lead to more detailed and refined environmental inferences.

AB Land atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) in peatlands exhibits marked seasonal and interannual variability, which subsequently affects the carbon (C) sink strength of catchments across multiple temporal scales. Long-term studies are needed to fully capture the natural variability and therefore identify the key hydrometeorological drivers in the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2. Since 2002, NEE has been measured continuously by eddycovariance at Auchencorth Moss, a temperate lowland peatland in central Scotland. Hence this is one of the longest peatland NEE studies to date. For 11 years, the site was a consistent, yet variable, atmospheric CO2 sink ranging from -5.2 to -135.9 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1) (mean of -64.1 +/- 33.6 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Inter-annual variability in NEE was positively correlated to the length of the growing season. Mean winter air temperature explained 87% of the inter-annual variability in the sink strength of the following summer, indicating an effect of winter climate on local phenology. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was enhanced by drought, which also depressed gross primary productivity (GPP). The CO2 uptake rate during the growing season was comparable to three other sites with long-term NEE records; however, the emission rate during the dormant season was significantly higher. To summarise, the NEE of the peatland studied is modulated by two dominant factors:
   - phenology of the plant community, which is driven by winter air temperature and impacts photosynthetic potential and net CO2 uptake during the growing season (colder winters are linked to lower summer NEE),
   - water table level, which enhanced soil respiration and decreased GPP during dry spells.
   Although summer dry spells were sporadic during the study period, the positive effects of the current climatic trend towards milder winters on the site's CO2 sink strength could be offset by changes in precipitation patterns especially during the growing season.

AB Ombrotrophic peat bogs have been widely used to evaluate long-term records of atmospheric mercury (Hg) deposition. One of the major aims of these investigations is the estimation of the increase in atmospheric Hg fluxes during the industrial age compared to preindustrial fluxes. Comparability of Hg accumulation rates calculated from density, peat accumulation rates, and Hg concentrations requires linearity between these parameters. Peat formation is a dynamic process accompanied by intense mass loss and alteration of the organic material. Our investigations on three peat cores from the Magellanic Moorlands, Chile, indicate that Hg concentrations in peat strongly depend on peat humification. Moreover, differences in mass accumulation rates during peat evolution are not compensated by linear changes in density, peat accumulation, or Hg concentrations. We suggest that Hg accumulation rates be normalized to carbon accumulation rates to achieve comparability of Hg accumulation rates derived from differently altered peat sections. Normalization to the carbon accumulation rates reduces Hg accumulation rates in less degraded peat sections in the upper peat layers by factors of more than 2. Our results suggest that the increase in Hg deposition rates during modern times derived from ombrotrophic peat bogs are potentially overestimated if Hg accumulation rates are not corrected for mass accumulation rates.

AB An imbalanced nutrient status in Scots pine stands on drained mires is primarily a consequence of excess nitrogen (N) in relation to mineral nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). In this study, the variation of foliar N, P, and K concentrations relative to some site and environmental characteristics was examined. Foliar nutrient concentrations were determined on needle samples collected from mires representing different drainage ages, site types, geographical locations and annual weather conditions. In the overall data (n = 971 samples in 333 stands) the foliar N concentration varied between 6.7 and 24.2 mg g(-1), the P concentration between 0.83 and 2.32 mg g(-1), and the K concentration between 2.22 and 6.23 mg g(-1). The original (pre-drainage) mire site type proved to be an important factor in explaining the nutrient status of the trees: on originally forested sites, the nutrient balance (N versus K; N versus P) was mostly adequate, whereas on sparsely forested and treeless sites, K deficiency was common. N deficiency was the most common in forested 'nitrogen-poor' sites, while P and K deficiencies were more common in originally treeless or sparsely forested 'nitrogen rich' sites, where the nutrient imbalance was also the greatest. Over the whole data, 29% of the cases were diagnosed to be N-deficient, 51% P-deficient, and 25% K-deficient. The foliar N concentration increased with increasing temperature sum. The foliar K concentration decreased with increasing depth of the peat layer. On former treeless or sparsely forested sites, foliar K decreased slightly with increasing drainage age. In contrast, on thin-peated sites the foliar P concentration increased with increasing drainage age. The climate conditions (location), the original site type of the mire and peat thickness should be taken into account when planning silvicultural measures on mires drained for forestry.

AB Limited areas of post-mined peatlands are recolonized by Sphagnum-dominated communities. This study aims to recognize the spontaneous Sphagnum re-establishment process and to verify if Sphagnum directly colonizes the residual peat. Conditions favoring Sphagnum revegetation are suggested. Analyses of vegetation macrofossils of the newly formed peat allow the identification of colonizing species and vegetation succession profile. Botanical components of the pioneer horizon suggest that Sphagnum species can directly colonize the residual peat. When Polytrichum strictum (Kaulf..) Presl and Eriophorum spissum Fernald are present as early colonists, they are rapidly overgrown by Sphagnum species in the succession profile. Vegetation succession resulted mainly in the formation of hummocks and lawns dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr., Sphagnum capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw., and Sphagnum magellanicum Brid., with a mole or less dense ericaceous shrub cover. Floristic, hydrological, and chemical features indicate that a fibric peat accumulation ecosystem is progressively or partially restored.

AB Peatland is a significant ecosystem that has accumulated one-third of the soil carbon in boreal regions. However, the net carbon balance, particularly with current carbon emissions, remains unclear. In this study, the annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from a peatland located in Northeast China are reported. Ecosystem respiration fluxes from the shrub-moss-and Eriophorum-dominated communities in the peatland varied from 12 to 272 mg Cm-2 h(-2) during the snow-free season, and the Eriophorumdominated community emitted more CO2. Rates of ecosystem respiration were strongly regulated by temperature and water table depth. The CH4 fluxes emitted from the peatland throughout a year varied with the type of the vegetation community during the snow-free season. No distinct episodic CH4 efflux during the freeze-thaw cycles was observed from the shrub-moss-dominated community, whereas a subtle pulse of CH4 was found in the Eriophorum-dominated community. The annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from the peatland were 356 and 1.51 g Cm-2 per year, respectively. The contributions of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the snowy season to annual emissions were much lower than those found in other boreal peatlands, whereas 24% of the annual methane flux was emitted during the freeze-thaw cycles. The results highlight the importance of gaseous carbon efflux in the estimation of carbon flux from peatlands, as well as the contribution of carbon efflux during the snow-covered season.

AB Bogs, as nutrient-poor ecosystems, are particularly sensitive to atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Nitrogen deposition alters bog plant community composition and can limit their ability to sequester carbon (C). Spectroscopy is a promising approach for studying how N deposition affects bogs because of its ability to remotely determine changes in plant species composition in the long term as well as shorter-term changes in foliar chemistry. However, there is limited knowledge on the extent to which bog plants differ in their foliar spectral properties, how N deposition might affect those properties, and whether subtle inter- or intraspecific changes in foliar traits can be spectrally detected. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of N deposition on foliar traits and spectra. Using an integrating sphere fitted to a field spectrometer, we measured spectral properties of leaves from the four most common vascular plant species (Chamaedaphne calyculata,Kalmia angustifolia,Rhododendron groenlandicumandEriophorum vaginatum) in three bogs in southern Quebec and Ontario, Canada, exposed to different atmospheric N deposition levels, including one subjected to a 18-year N fertilization experiment. We also measured chemical and morphological properties of those leaves. We found detectable intraspecific changes in leaf structural traits and chemistry (namely chlorophyllband N concentrations) with increasing N deposition and identified spectral regions that helped distinguish the site-specific populations within each species. Most of the variation in leaf spectral, chemical, and morphological properties was among species. As such, species had distinct spectral foliar signatures, allowing us to identify them with high accuracy with partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLSDA). Predictions of foliar traits from spectra using partial least squares regression (PLSR) were generally accurate, particularly for the concentrations of N and C, soluble C, leaf water, and dry matter content (<10% RMSEP). However, these multi-species PLSR models were not accurate within species, where the range of values was narrow. To improve the detection of short-term intraspecific changes in functional traits, models should be trained with more species-specific data. Our field study showing clear differences in foliar spectra and traits among species, and some within-species differences due to N deposition, suggest that spectroscopy is a promising approach for assessing long-term vegetation changes in bogs subject to atmospheric pollution.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

DT Article
ID MIRE; COAL
AB Although no precise modern analogue exists for the peat-forming ecosystems (mires) of Tertiary times, it is argued that the principles underlying peat formation are essentially unchanged in the sense that a peat-forming ecosystem has an incomplete decomposition process (normally because of waterlogging) , leaving a residue of organic material in its overall energy-Row budget. The study of modern mires is therefore of relevance to Tertiary coal geologists, The classification of modern mires is best achieved by reference to their hydrological characteristics, particularly the source of water entering the system. Flow-fed (rheotrophic) mires are often relatively rich in nutrients and elastic, while rainfed (ombrotrophic) mires are poor. The transition from one hydrological state to the other can occur during mire development and involves a physical elevation of the mire surface by the growth of peat.
   Such mires have a two-layered (diplotelmic) structure in which the surface layer (acrotelm) is periodically aerobic, has a loose structure and a high hydraulic conductivity, while the lower layer (catotelm) is compacted, anaerobic and has a low hydraulic conductivity. The hydrological outcome is that precipitation landing upon a raised, ombrotrophic mire drains from the elevated mire surface laterally through the acrotelm. The water retention of the mire and its elevated water table is dependent on the poor water conductivity of the catotelm. The transition to the ombrotrophic condition is accompanied by higher rates of pear accumulation and increasing mire acidity. It begins with isolated colonization of hummock-forming plants that later converge into an extended cupola. This ecological transition may be a consequence of external changes, such as climatic alteration (increased precipitation: evaporation ratio) or autogenic, internal successional developments. Basin subsidence, however, or eustatic sea-level rise in the case of coastal systems, can operate in the reverse direction and prevent the permanent establishment of an ombrotrophic system.
   The ombrotrophic mire is ultimately limited in the depth of its pear development by microbial respiration within the catotelm. As the catotelm extends with pear accumulation, the total respiratory activity of the profile will equilibrate with primary productivity and peat formation slows down to an eventual standstill. On the assumption that peatland hydrology operated in a similar way in former times, the deep peats (and eventually coals) of Tertiary times can best be explained, therefore, in terms of stacks of sequential mires rather than single, continuously forming ecosystems.

AB It is estimated that in the northern hemisphere one-third of the world pool of soil carbon is contained in peat resulting from an incomplete decomposition of plant remains. The time course for the decomposition of the predominant plant litters on a Pennine moorland in northern England is reported for a study extending over 23 years. Spatial variation of the weight remaining of decomposing litters increased with time. This experimental study gave an age for the upper layers of the bog and a curve for long-term decay based on direct observation rather than inferred from profile samples or from short-term observations. It showed that short-term observations can give misleading results in the long term, with a variety of litters with differing early decay rates ultimately making a similar contribution to accumulation. Spatial variation of the weight remaining of the decomposing litters increased with time, so that variation within micro-environments, or within apparantly uniform substrates, may contribute significantly to organic matter accumulation. An asymptotic curve best described the long-term course of decomposition leading to the accumulation of peat. The use of the model for the three litter types, Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum and Rubus chamaemorus, is described and the implication of the results for modelling of organic matter accumulation are then discussed.

AB There has been much debate about the role of above-ground vegetation mass in controlling species diversity in herbaceous vegetation. Here the results of a bracken control/heathland restoration experiment are described where a range of plants has established over an 18-year period on plots with a range of both species densities and biomass. Four components of above-ground mass were identified: bracken fronds, bracken litter, grass heath vegetation and Betula saplings. The relationship between species density and these mass variables, plus a range of derived ones, was explored.
   Two relationships were found: (1) a negative one between species density and total above-ground biomass, bracken frond biomass and bracken litter mass, and (2) a positive one between species density and grass heath biomass and the sum of all living biomass (bracken fronds, grass heath and Betula). No evidence was found in this study to support a 'hump-back' relationship described in other studies, but this may have been because all biomass values were too large. It was suggested that perhaps the 'hump' detected in other studies might reflect a balance between the positive and negative relationships identified here between living and dead material. Target thresholds were derived for each mass variable, above which there was a strong probability that the stand would be species-poor; threshold estimates were 500 g m(-2) for bracken fronds, 3000 g m(-2) for bracken litter and 4000 g m(-2) for both total bracken biomass and total above-ground mass. It was suggested that these thresholds could be used as a first approximation of target values to assess when the biodiversity of the site was in danger.

AB A report is given of a palaeoecological study based on the analysis of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and macrofossils of an excavated medieval house site and its underlying peat deposit at Poppendam, Waterland (The Netherlands). The house site represents one of the first human occupations in this former raised-bog area. The analysis includes a raised-bog sequence with cultural layers on top of it. A detailed reconstruction of the changing vegetation from natural raised-bog to cultural landscape is given. The main phases of the deposit comprise: a natural, undisturbed bog (from mid-Subboreal to the 8th century AD); a disturbed raised-bog with eutraphentic taxa prior to the first occupation (between the gth century and the first half of the 10th century AD); an anthropogenic accumulation layer of mixed former bog material, eutraphentic taxa and cultural indicators (from the first half of the 10th century AD onwards).
   Seeds and pollen of cultivated plants and vegetation of the Lolio-Potentillion anserinae alliance indicates a mixed agricultural economy in which domesticated animals played an important role. This is confirmed by the simultaneous occurrence of large numbers of ascospores of coprophilous Sordariaceae. Inundations of Lake Almere, as evident from the occurrence of brackish/salt elements, suggest that the lake had already become brackish/salt around the 8-9th century.
   Two methods for the reconstruction of palaeophytosociological communities containing halophytic plant species are presented. The Lolio-Potentillion anserinae alliance as an indication for inundations, lowering of the original bog surface and the occurrence of grazed, brackish grasslands is discussed.

AB Stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon dating, sediment and peat characteristics, and rates of peat and carbon accumulation from a soligenous peatland, or "bofedal," in the Chilean Altiplano shows the peatland to be unusually young, dynamic, and sensitive to environmental changes. The site lies in the National Park Nevado de Tres Cruces in the puna desert grassland at an elevation of 4300 m a.s.l. Eight peat cores were extracted from a 1.75-km transect yielding a maximum of 3.6 in of organic sediment. Organic matter began to accumulate 1700-1100 cal yr B.P. under a progressively and local climate, after a period when regional climate is believed to have been more humid than at present. Areas of greater relief and better drainage in the valley bottom eventually fostered the growth of a riparian cushion plant community after water flowing down the valley began to diminish. This led to rapid lateral expansion of the riparian peatland communities over open water in topographic depressions at a rate heretofore unprecedented in the peatland literature. It appears that development of the peatland has been encouraged by autoregulation of internal hydrology. The drainage impediment created by organic mass accumulation in lower-relief areas probably reduced the amount of water arriving at the lower reaches of the peatland. These areas have become progressively drier and have since died and oxidized. Through endogenous peat accumulation and a concomitant drainage impediment, the ecosystem has been migrating upstream over the past 50 years. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB It is important to understand the fate of carbon in boreal peatland soils in response to climate change because a substantial change in release of this carbon as CO2 and CH4 could influence the climate system. The goal of this research was to synthesize the results of a field water table manipulation experiment conducted in a boreal rich fen into a process-based model to understand how soil organic carbon (SOC) of the rich fen might respond to projected climate change. This model, the peatland version of the dynamic organic soil Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (peatland DOS-TEM), was calibrated with data collected during 2005-2011 from the control treatment of a boreal rich fen in the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX). The performance of the model was validated with the experimental data measured from the raised and lowered water-table treatments of APEX during the same period. The model was then applied to simulate future SOC dynamics of the rich fen control site under various CO2 emission scenarios. The results across these emissions scenarios suggest that the rate of SOC sequestration in the rich fen will increase between year 2012 and 2061 because the effects of warming increase heterotrophic respiration less than they increase carbon inputs via production. However, after 2061, the rate of SOC sequestration will be weakened and, as a result, the rich fen will likely become a carbon source to the atmosphere between 2062 and 2099. During this period, the effects of projected warming increase respiration so that it is greater than carbon inputs via production. Although changes in precipitation alone had relatively little effect on the dynamics of SOC, changes in precipitation did interact with warming to influence SOC dynamics for some climate scenarios.

AB The rewetting technique border irrigation was installed in a degraded fen peatland in northeastern Germany. Because of the prevailing site conditions, the technique resulted in two different rewetting variants (surface irrigation and temporary inundation) at the study site. This paper reports on the practicability of this technique and the influence of rewetting on vegetation development, decomposition processes and soil nutrient availability, and the possibilities for renewed peat accumulation. The technique proved to be suited for rewetting fen sites with a continuous slope, deep peat layer with low hydraulic conductivity, and upstream water recharge facilities. A subsidence of the ground-water levels during the summer months, however, could not be avoided in dry years. The vegetation changed slowly from species-poor grassland into typical fen plant communities, despite rewetting and soil tillage. Species richness, however, was higher in the surface irrigation than in the temporary inundation variant. A sufficient water supply proved to be absolutely necessary to retard decomposition processes because higher decomposition of root materials (i.e., higher k values) occurred under temporary inundated conditions. Generally, the higher water content in the soil after rewetting led to a lower nitrate-N-to-ammonium-N ratio in the topsoil in both rewetting variants. In the surface irrigation variant the mineral nitrogen content (Nmin) of the topsoil decreased from 7.8 to 4.4 g N/m(2), which is also correlated with the increase in water content of the soil. The low Nmin levels of fens which were never deeply drained (0.9-2.8 g N/m(2)), however, were not reached within the observation period of 3 years.

AB Drainage of peatlands is expected to turn these ecosystems into carbon sources to the atmosphere. We measured carbon dynamics of a drained forested peatland in southern Finland over 4 years, including one with severe drought during growing season. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method from a mast above the forest. Soil and forest floor CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured from the strips and from ditches with closed chambers. Biomass and litter production were sampled, and soil subsidence was measured by repeated levellings of the soil surface. The drained peatland ecosystem was a strong sink of carbon dioxide in all studied years. Soil CO2 balance was estimated by subtracting the carbon sink of the growing tree stand from NEE, and it showed that the soil itself was a carbon sink as well. A drought period in one summer significantly decreased the sink through decreased gross primary production. Drought also decreased ecosystem respiration. The site was a small sink for CH4, even when emissions from ditches were taken into account. Despite the continuous carbon sink, peat surface subsided slightly during the 10-year measurement period, which was probably mainly due to compaction of peat. It is concluded that even 50 years after drainage this peatland site acted as a soil C sink due to relatively small changes in the water table and in plant community structure compared to similar undrained sites, and the significantly increased tree stand growth and litter production. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB This study uses life-cycle analysis to examine the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Canadian peat industry for the period 1990-2000. GHG exchange is estimated for land-use change, peat extraction and processing, transport to market, and the in situ decomposition of extracted peat. The estimates, based on an additive GHG accounting model, show that the peat extraction life cycle emitted 0.54 X 10(6) t of GHG in 1990, increasing to 0.89 X 10(6) t in 2000 (expressed as CO2 equivalents using a 100-y time horizon). Peat decomposition associated with end use was the largest source of GHGs, comprising 71% of total emissions during this 11-y period. Land use change resulted in a switch of the peatlands from a GHG sink to a source and contributed an additional 15%. Peat transportation was responsible for 10% of total GHG emissions, and extraction and processing contributed 4%. It would take approximately 2000 y to restore the carbon pool to its original size if peatland restoration is successful and the cutover peatland once again becomes a net carbon sink.

AB A 3.86 m core of peat and organic lake mud from a polygonal peatland in the Lena River valley of Siberia was radiocarbon dated and analyzed for pollen, plant macrofossils, chrysophyte stomatocysts, stable isotopes, and charcoal. At around 7200 BP, a shallow lake or open-water wetland supported diverse aquatic macrophytes. The site had transformed initially into a richer fen with Carer, Comarum palustris, and Drepanocladus and later a poorer fen with Sphagnum which persisted until around 3000 BP. Fire may have been responsible for silt being blown onto the peatland, which changed the hydrological and geochemical conditions for development of the poor fen. Ice accretion led to an increase in the height of the centre of the polygon and expansion of Sphagnum peatland. O-18 values become progressively more enriched, which reflects more direct input of summer precipitation waters and less groundwater during this period. Finally, the peatland surface was elevated sufficiently to limit water and nutrient supply, thereby allowing Ericaceae and Betula to grow at the coring site. Fire burned the peatland surface and may have exaggerated the extremely slow rate of peat accumulation Fire may also be a factor in maintaining the open Larix dahurica forest in the region today, while climate may be contributing to reducing postfire regeneration. Fire and climate together may be controlling the character and composition of forests near tree line in the Lena River valley of this part of Siberia.

AB Peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth's land surface but boreal and subarctic peatlands store about 15-30% of the world's soil carbon ( C) as peat. Despite their potential for large positive feedbacks to the climate system through sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases, peatlands are not explicitly included in global climate models and therefore in predictions of future climate change. In April 2007 a symposium was held in Wageningen, the Netherlands, to advance our understanding of peatland C cycling. This paper synthesizes the main findings of the symposium, focusing on (i) small-scale processes, (ii) C fluxes at the landscape scale, and (iii) peatlands in the context of climate change.
   The main drivers controlling most are related to some aspects of hydrology. Despite high spatial and annual variability in Net Ecosystem Exchange ( NEE), the differences in cumulative annual NEE are more a function of broad scale geographic location and physical setting than internal factors, suggesting the existence of strong feedbacks. In contrast, trace gas emissions seem mainly controlled by local factors.
   Key uncertainties remain concerning the existence of perturbation thresholds, the relative strengths of the CO2 and CH4 feedback, the links among peatland surface climate, hydrology, ecosystem structure and function, and trace gas biogeochemistry as well as the similarity of process rates across peatland types and climatic zones. Progress on these research areas can only be realized by stronger co-operation between disciplines that address different spatial and temporal scales.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes from fixed sample plots in a minerotrophic fen and an ombrotrophic bog in southern Finland were measured by using a static chamber technique 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment. Methane emissions rose with rising water table after rewetting from 0.1 to 2.1 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the fen site and from 0.8 to 4.6 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the bag site remained at a lower level than emissions from similar pristine site types. At the fen site the emissions were related to the short-term succession of cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). Emissions showed high spatial and temporal variation with high emission peaks at the bog site. Temporal fluctuation of the emissions during the measurement season (from the end of May to the end of September) was correlated with pear temperature, while the seasonal fluxes were dependent on the moisture conditions in different microsites.

DE ombrotrophic; mire; conservation; hydrology; grazing
ID GREAT-BRITAIN; PEAT
AB The vegetation, physical characteristics and conservation value of mires (peatlands) within Kielder Forest, northern England, are described. A review of the options available for their conservation management examines the effects of changes in the water table, the impact of grazing livestock and changes brought about by neighbouring conifer plantations.
   These raised and blanket mires vary in size from 0.6 to 69.6 ha, and are dominated by ombrotrophic vegetation. Their main conservation value lies in their 'naturalness', which arises from the extensive nature of locally used stock grazing systems and the intrinsic difficulty of draining mires that lie in depressions and experience an upland climate. Such sites are rare and contain uncommon plants and invertebrates, whilst collectively these mires exhibit considerable topographical and hydrological variety,
   A review of the hydrological effects of conifer plantations on mire catchments concludes that the catchments probably have little, if any, influence on the mires themselves. Management of water flow on the mires has the objective of reducing the rate of discharge of precipitation from them by damming agricultural and forestry drainage channels.
   A review of the role of livestock grazing concludes that there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is required to maintain the mire plant communities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that its impact is minimal on vegetation over deep peat, and probably most influential on vegetation over shallower peat at mire margins.

AB Restoration of peatlands has been found to mitigate eutrophication due to the high and long-term capacity of peatlands to reduce nitrate (NO3-) fluxes. However, altered peat composition and/or contamination of the water used for rewetting can promote the release of dissolved substances, resulting in serious biogeochemical constraints on achievement of restoration goals. Elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release can alter the turnover of organic matter in rewetted fens and adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Increasing availability of soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) can significantly elevate primary productivity, stimulating eutrophication and associated problems. We conducted a laboratory study to evaluate the effect of rewetting long-term drained fens with NO3- polluted water on DOC and SRP release. The effects of peat decomposition, NO3- loading rate and temperature were considered. Different peat substrates from one degraded, drained fen in northeast Germany were incubated under stagnant, inundated conditions. Two levels of peat decomposition (high and moderate), two NO3- loads (40 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and 140 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and two incubation temperatures (20 degrees C and 5 degrees C) were studied. Peat types were characterized by means of a sequential chemical extraction procedure to estimate the size of the DOC and SRP mobile pools. It was shown that peat decomposition controlled SRP and DOC release due to significant differences in mobile C and P pools. Low temperature slowed the rates of microbiologically mediated processes involved in SRP and DOC turnover. To some extent, the effect of temperature modified the effect of peat decomposition. Due to complete NO3- removal at the peat surface layer (<1 cm), NO3- load did not influence SRP and DOC production in the peat, but did impact their release at the peat-water interface. Our study found that when highly decomposed peat is incubated at 20 degrees C under low nitrate conditions, a substantial amount of DOC is released. Similarly, SRP release only occurred under those same conditions. Results from our experiments provide insight into the potential release of DOC and SRP that could occur in rewetted fens.

AB Restoration of peatlands after peat extraction could be a benefit to the climate system. However a multi-year ecosystem-scale assessment of net carbon (C) sequestration is needed. We investigate the climate impact of active peatland restoration (rewetting and revegetating) using a chronosequence of C gas exchange measurements across post-extraction Canadian peatlands. An atmospheric perturbation model computed the instantaneous change in radiative forcing of CO2 and CH4 emissions/ uptake over 500 years. We found that using emission factors specific to an active restoration technique resulted in a radiative forcing reduction of 89% within 20 years compared to IPCC Tier 1 emission factors based on a wide range of rewetting activities. Immediate active restoration achieved a neutral climate impact (excluding C losses in the removed peat) about 155 years earlier than did a 20 year delay in restoration. A management plan that includes prompt active restoration is key to utilizing peatland restoration as a climate change mitigation strategy.

AB Previous studies of the N:P ratio in wetland plants have been carried out in northern hemisphere wetlands where atmospheric nitrogen deposition is higher. There is little research on foliar N:P ratio as a potential indicator of nutrient limitation in vegetation communities in southern hemisphere wetlands. This study aimed to redress this knowledge gap and answer the following questions: how well does the plant tissue nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratio predict wetland plant community nutrient limitation, as indicated by vegetation standing stocks and below-ground biomass, in southern hemisphere fens? Secondly, what are the impacts of realistic upper levels of farm nutrient run-off on natural montane fen vegetation? Low (35 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and high (70 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) levels of nitrate-N or ammonium-N with and without P (20 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) were added to 81 vegetation plots over a period of 2.75 years. Species composition, plant nutrient status, and above-ground live vegetation standing stocks were assessed after 3 years, and below-ground biomass after 2 years. Plant tissue analysis suggested the community was N limited or N and P co-limited; we found greater standing stocks of vegetation in plots treated with 70 kg ha(-1) year(-1) ammonium-N, indicating N limitation. No difference between other treatments was found in above-ground standing stocks or below-ground biomass. Plant species cover increased in both high N treatments, consistent with N limitation. These changes in plant species cover were accompanied by significant decreases in species richness in both high N treatments. Native species dominated the vegetation and this was unaffected by nutrient addition (90% cover). This is one of the first studies to test and find support for the N:P ratio in southern hemisphere wetlands. Observed declines in species richness after N fertilisation in an N-limited fen suggests increased N may pose risks to austral wetlands. Responses by plant communities (changes in composition, biomass) to lower levels of nutrient addition may require longer periods of fertilisation to be apparent in slow growing ecosystems.

AB The use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) as well as newer automated unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming a standard method in remote sensing studies requiring high spatial resolution (<1 m) and very precise temporal data to capture phenological events. In this study we use a low cost rotorcraft to map Eriophorum vaginatum at Mer Bleue, an ombrotrophic bog located east of Ottawa, ON, Canada. We focus on E. vaginatum because this sedge plays an important role in methane (CH4) gas exchange in peatlands. Using the remote controlled rotorcraft we were able to record, process, and mosaic 11.1 hectares of 4.5 cm spatial resolution imagery extracted from individual frames of video recordings (post georegistration RMSE 4.90 +/- 4.95 cm). Our results, based on a supervised classification (96% accuracy) of the red, green, blue image planes, indicate a total tussock cover of 2,417 m(2). Because the basal area of the plant is more relevant for calculating its contribution to the CH4 flux, the tussock area was related to the basal area from field data (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.0001). Our final results indicate a total basal area of 1,786 +/- 62.8 m(2). Based on temporal measurements of CH4 flux from the peatland as a whole that vary over the growing season, we estimate the E. vaginatum contribution to range from 3.0% to 17.3% of that total. Overall, our low cost approach was an effective non-destructive way to derive E. vaginatum coverage and estimate CH4 exchange over the growing season.

AB A 5-year litterbag study examined decomposition rates at four sites representing restiad peatland succession in Waikato, New Zealand. Early successional sites were dominated by Baumea rubiginosa, or Leptospermum scoparium, mid-successional by Empodisma robustum, and late successional by Sporadanthus ferrugineus. Leaf/culm materials from these species were placed on the surface, and roots of Empodisma and Sporadanthus buried at depths of 5, 25, and 55 cm to test the influence of succession on species and site decomposition rates. Typha latifolia leaves from a Canadian bog were placed at the surface and three depths to allow comparisons with northern peatlands. Litterbags were retrieved after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, and mass remaining characterized by an exponential model k value. Surface litter k values (0.12-0.80 y(-1)) decreased from early to late successional species; however, decomposition was slower at more waterlogged early successional sites. Buried litter k values (0.04-0.24 y(-1)) decreased with depth and increased from early to late successional sites, with Empodisma roots having the slowest rates. Few strong relationships existed between litter quality and decomposition rates. In contrast, water table regime strongly influenced decomposition rates; k values for the "standard" Typha litter decreased exponentially as period of saturation increased, irrespective of site successional status, nutrients, or other factors. Lower water tables in the more aerated later successional sites have led to faster decomposition rates. Ongoing drainage combined with the potential impacts of climate change may increase organic matter decomposition and accelerate carbon release into the atmosphere.

   TRENDS
AB A set of simple ecological models accounts well for the cumulative initiation of peatlands throughout North America in relation to glacial retreat. The most parsimonious form incorporates, first, a delay term to account for the lag during which newly deglaciated land became suitable for peatland initiation and, second, an intrinsic rate of initiation related to the probability of migration and establishment of plant propagules from elsewhere. The goodness of fit of the models, based on 1680 basal-peat dates throughout the continent, allows projection of past trends into the future. Factors contributing to the lag of about 4000 years between deglaciation and peatland initiation are suggested and data on colonization of deglaciated land by beavers (known to initiate peatlands) are presented. The rate of peatland initiation peaked between 7000 and 8000 years ago, but remains appreciable today. A marked depression of peatland initiation (8360-8040 BP) interrupted the peak rate. The time of the interruption matches the 8200 BP cold-dry event recorded in Greenland ice cores, and suggests that this event caused a substantial, continent-wide depression of an important ecosystem function, i.e., carbon sequestration from the atmosphere by peat deposition. Spontaneous initiation of new peatlands is projected to continue for millennia to come. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spatiotemporal variations in microbial gene abundances were investigated to identify potential zones of methanotroph and methanogen biomass in a peat bog in Sarobetsu-genya wetland. The abundances of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, pmoA, and mcrA were 10(7)-10(9), 10(7)-10(8), 10(4)-10(6), and 10(4)-10(7) copies g(-1) dry peat, respectively. Correlation analysis based on microbial gene abundances and environmental factors showed that the spatiotemporal distributions of the abundances of the four microbial genes in peat layers were similar. The mcrA abundance showed a significant negative correlation with the dissolved organic carbon content and a significant positive correlation with the peat temperature. The pmoA abundance was not detectable during the spring thaw when the lowest peat temperature at a depth of 50 cm was recorded. At a depth of 200 cm, the peat temperature exceeded 6A degrees C throughout the year, and the mcrA abundance exceeded 10(4) copies g(-1) dry peat. These results indicate that the seasonal microbial activity related to methane should be evaluated in not only the shallow but also the deep peat layers in order to elucidate the methane dynamics in boreal wetlands.

AB Extensive patterned mires in valley heads and on glacial benches in southern New Zealand: (45 degrees 22'S; 1250-1400 m.a.s.l.), and valley floors in Tierra del Fuego (54 degrees 53'S; 60-100 m.a.s.l.) have developed under cool, moist climatic conditions favourable for peat accumulation.
   In southern New Zealand's tussock grassland landscape, aapa mire pools (often with peat islands) and ridges, are elongated (pools: mean 24.5 +/- 2.4 m x 7.5 +/- 1.0 m) and aligned 90 degrees to gentle slopes. Feat depths (0.3-2.5 m) are greatest on downslope margins of pools and sometimes associated with basement profile concavities. Pools up to 1.3 m deep have peat bases, are generally not fed by nor linked to surface streams, and have steep downslope, with more gentle upslope, margins. Pools may be incipient (occupying small pear depressions), fluctuating or permanent. In steeper headwater sections, surface and underground channels link small stream pools. On glacial benches, pools (to 1 ha) occupy basement rock depressions with up to 1.5 m of underlying peat.
   Vegetation displays a repeating basic pattern. On pool rims aquatic mosses (Acrocladium samzentosum and/or Sphagnum falcatulum) cover steep pool edges; S. squarrosum inner faces of rims; S. cristatum, Carex galldichaudiana and C. lachenalii on rims and declines. The tall, vertical peat pedestals support a similar vegetation pattern. Carer gaudichaudiana occupies shore margins prone to intermittent flooding with peat-forming Sphagnum mosses absent. Islands are produced from elongated peninsulas or sinuate mainland shores. These persist if peat formation exceeds water level rise. Snow tussocks of Chionochloa macra grow on localised elevated areas unrelated to subsurface topography.
   In Tierra del Fuego, raised (4-6 m) rain-fed aapa mires, bordered by intermittent lagg streams, develop amongst partially cleared Nothofagus pumilio forest. Elongated (3-60 m length), steep-sided and island (circular: c. 2 m diameter)- studded pools, form generally parallel crescentic lines with regular to sinuate margins associated with incipient islands. Occasional islands are either decadent, or submerged and moribund. Sphagnum magellanicum and Empetrum rubrum dominate above water level, amongst pure stands of Marsippospermum grandiflorum on higher ground. Sphagnum fimbriatum characterises a narrow zone at water line.
   Vegetation/peat development reinforces pool-vegetation boundaries. Until drained, vegetation/firm peat development is prevented in pools greater than or equal to 20 cm deep. Following localised subterranean drainage, non-wetland species may colonise.
   Underlying topography, differential peat formation, hydrological and drainage properties, plus vegetation development all influence patterning in the mires. Biotic factors are emphasised over physical processes in the origin and maintenance of the patterned wetland systems but are not mutually exclusive.

AB The simultaneous impact of climate change and human activities on soil organic carbon content (SOC) in peatlands is insufficiently recognized, especially in relation to peatlands affected by open-pit lignite mining. Given their importance in climate change feedback loops, long-term observations of SOC changes in peatlands are essential. The aim of the study was to determine recent changes in the properties and SOC content/stock of agro-managed fen peatlands located adjacent to open-pit lignite mines. We studied two soil layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm) within 12 sampling plots in the Grojec Valley (Central Poland). Soil sample collection and field measurements took place in 2005 and again in 2015. The largest negative changes in soil properties (e.g. SOC content drop from 208 to 318 g kg(-1) in 2005 to 125-263 g kg(-1) in 2015 and SOC stock decrease from 12.1-16.2 kg m(-2) in 2005 to 9.22-14.5 kg m(-2) in 2015), as well as the largest variability of watertable level were recorded in the northern part of the study area, affected by long-term lignite mining (1982-2009). While such a strong changes were not observed in the plots from central and southern part of the valley (230-439 g kg(-1) in 2005 and 228-396 g kg(-1) in 2015; 11.5-29,2 kg m(-2) in 2005 and 13.4-36.1 kg m(-2), respectively). Our results showed that depletion of SOC content in lowland peatlands in the temperate climate zone (due to human activity and changeable weather conditions) will proceed unless we implement sustainable management practices or apply restoration plans at these sites.

AB Questions
   How does long-term increase in nutrient availability affect species composition, species diversity and functional composition in boreal rich fens, and how does this differ from short-term effects? What are the possible mechanisms behind the observed changes, and how does nutrient limitation influence species diversity in these communities?
   LocationMethodsSOlendet Nature Reserve, central Norway.
   A full-factorial field experiment. Plots in two localities received one of following treatments (n=3): no nutrient addition (control), N, P, K, NP, NK, PK and NPK addition. Cover of plant species was recorded before treatment, and after two and 15years of treatment.
   ResultsConclusionsTwo years of nutrient addition caused small changes in species composition, but addition of NP led to large increase in abundance of species with high ability to exploit the added nutrientsa direct result of the elimination of nutrient limitation in the communities. After 15years of nutrient addition there were significant changes following three different pathways, one for each of N, P and NP addition. The addition of NP led to large community shifts, considerable species turnover and reduced species and functional richness, mainly caused by increase in cover of highly competitive and tussock-forming grasses like Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca ovina and Molinia caerulea, out-competing other species, especially bryophytes. Addition of N led to smaller changes in species turnover, and without clear dominant species. Addition of P led to considerable species turnover, but no reduction in species or functional richness, and the bryophyte diversity increased. This is explained by the bryophytes' association with N-fixing cyanobacteria, suggesting less N limitation and a greater ability to utilize the added P when vascular plants suffer from N shortage. In addition, bryophytes are more sensitive to low P availability, due to larger P requirements compared to vascular plants. There was no effect of K addition.
   Both N and P limitation is essential for the maintenance of high species diversity in boreal rich fens, and P limitation controls bryophyte diversity. From a management perspective, N and P limitation is vital in the conservation of boreal rich fens or when a functional fen system is reestablished through restoration measures.

AB We investigated the relationship between soil pH/calcium content and species richness of vascular plants in seven broadly defined Central European vegetation types, using Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction and a phytosociological data set of 11,041 vegetation sample plots from the Czech Republic. The vegetation types included (A) broad-leaved deciduous forests, (B) meadows, (C) dry grasslands, (D) reed-bed and tall-sedge vegetation, (E) fens and transitional mires, (F) perennial synanthropic vegetation and (G) annual synanthropic vegetation. Relationships between local species richness (alpha diversity) and pH/calcium were positive for vegetation types A and C, negative for D and G, unimodal for E, and insignificant for B and F. Ellenberg soil reaction values explained 37% of variation in local species richness for vegetation type E, 24% for A, 13% for D, but only less than 4% for the others. Species pool size, i.e., the number of species that can potentially occur in a given habitat, was calculated for each plot using Beals index of sociological favourability applied to a large phytosociological database. For most vegetation types, the relationships between species pool size and pH/calcium were similar to the relationships between local species richness and pH/calcium, with the exception of meadows (weak unimodal) and perennial synanthropic vegetation (weak negative).
   These patterns suggest that for those types of Central European vegetation that developed independently of human influence in the Pleistocene or early Holocene (dry grasslands, deciduous forests), there are larger pools of calcicole than calcifuge species. This pattern is also found at the level of local species richness, where it is, however, less clearly pronounced, possibly due to the predominance of a few widespread and generalist calcifuges in acidic habitats. The unimodal pattern found in mires may result from similar underlying mechanisms, but in high pH environments mineral-rich spring waters probably decrease species richness by having toxic effects on plant growth. By contrast, vegetation types developed under direct human influence (meadows, synathropic vegetation) show weak negative or no relationships of local species richness or species pool to pH/calcium gradient. These results support the hypothesis of PARTEL (Ecology 83: 2361-2366, 2002) and EWALD (Folia Geobot. 38: 357-366, 2003), that the modem calcicole/calcifuge disparity in the species pool of Central European flora has resulted from historical and evolutionary processes that took place on high pH soils. In the Pleistocene, calcareous soils dominated both the dry continental landscapes of Central Europe and glacial refugia of temperate flora, which were mostly situated in southern European mountain ranges with abundant limestone and dolomite. The negative pattern of species richness along the pH/calcium gradient found in reed-bed and tall-sedge vegetation, however, is not consistent with this historical explanation.

AB Peatlands store a significant carbon (C) pool but global warming promotes growth of woody plants, which may affect the C balance of peatlands. As shrubs and trees form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi, which are potentially effective decomposers of recalcitrant organic matter, suitable tools to measure fungal biomass, necromass and turnover rates are needed. Here we present a method optimized for studying chitin, a marker of living and dead fungal mass in peatland ecosystems. Optimizations include enhancement of purification steps, which enabled measurements of chitin concentration from both peat and from mycorrhizal mycelia in ingrowth bags with quartz sand. Adjustments proposed here will enable studying the role of fungi in peatland ecosystems.

ID SOIL PROPERTIES; CARBON; STRATIGRAPHY; GERMANY; FENS
AB The application of electrical resistivity tomography to peatlands supports conventional coring by providing data on the current condition of peatlands, including data on stratigraphy, peat properties and thickness of organic deposits. Data on the current condition of drained peatlands are particularly required to improve estimates of carbon storage as well as losses and emissions from agriculturally used peatlands. However, most of the studies focusing on electrical resistivity tomography surveys have been conducted on natural peatlands with higher groundwater levels. Peatlands drained for agriculture have not often been studied using geophysical techniques. Drained sites are characterized by low groundwater levels and high groundwater fluctuations during the year, which lead to varying levels of water saturation. To validate better electrical resistivity tomography surveys of drained peatlands, the aim of this laboratory study is to investigate the influence of varying water saturation levels on electrical conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) for a variety of peat and gyttja types, as well as for different degrees of peat decomposition. Results show that different levels of water saturation strongly influence bulk electrical conductivity. Distinct differences in this relationship exist between peat and gyttja substrates and between different degrees of peat decomposition. Peat shows an exponential relationship for all degrees of decomposition, whereas gyttja, in particular organic-rich gyttja, is characterized by a rather unimodal relationship. The slopes for the relationship between electrical conductivity and water content are steeper at high degrees of decomposition than for peat of low degrees of decomposition. These results have direct implications for field electrical resistivity tomography surveys. In drained peatlands that are strongly susceptible to drying, electrical resistivity tomography surveys have a high potential to monitor the actual field water content. In addition, at comparable water saturations, high or low degrees of decomposition can be inferred from electrical conductivity.

AB Appropriate management of contemporary environments requires knowledge of their long-term history. We use palaeoecological data to explore how contemporary forest-steppe environments have been shaped by climate change and human impacts through the Holocene using the western Mid-Russian Upland as a case-study. Our paper presents new reconstructions of Mid- and Late Holocene climate, vegetation dynamics and local environmental change based on pollen, plant macrofossil and testate amoeba records from a site at Selikhovo (Mid-Russian Upland, Russia). Eutrophic fen vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis developed around 6800 cal year BP and has been resilient to episodes of local burning and variable input of mineral material through the Holocene. New and previously-published data show that the boundary between broadleaf forest and steppe occupied a similar position to present during the period 7000-4800 cal year BP, despite a warmer and drier climate, but shifted to the south following climate cooling and an increase in precipitation from 4800-2500 cal year BP. A subsequent decline in woodland cover was caused by both climate change and human impacts, with human activity becoming increasingly significant over the last two millennia. Prior to major human disturbance (about 1700 cal year BP) the landscape was dominated by mixed broadleaf-pine forests with some spruce covering about 60 % of the study area. Our results emphasize the variability of steppe-forest habitats over long time periods and the need to consider human impacts and climate change when setting targets for habitat conservation.

ID AGE CALIBRATION
AB The age and sequence of peat accumulation were investigated at a calcareous fen in northeastern Illinois, USA. The purpose of this study was to identify the processes that form and sustain marl flats, which are areas of marl or tufa substrate within the fen that contain numerous rare plant species. Geomorphic, stratigraphic, and radiocarbon evidence was used to establish the processes and chronology of peat accumulation and erosion adjacent to each marl flat. The age of the base of the peat deposit varies greatly throughout the fen, ranging from 14,679 calibrated years before present (cal. years BP) to nearly modem, indicating that colonization of the sand and gravel substrate by peat occurred throughout the period from the Late Pleistocene to present. Adjacent to one marl flat, trends in basal peat age and thickness show that peat accumulation has progressed laterally inward from both sides, suggesting that the marl flat has been infilling with peat progressively by accumulation at the margins since at least 5,370 cal. years BP or longer. A second marl flat in the fen is surrounded by older, thick peat of differing ages on either edge and is bounded by fresh scarps, indicating that the marl flat currently is expanding laterally by erosion into the preexisting peat blanket. These two examples suggest a continuously repeating process, where erosion of the accumulated peat blanket forms a marl flat, which is later covered by peat accumulation. Trends in basal peat age elsewhere in the fen suggest that other marl flats may have existed in the past that have been completely infilled with peat. This study suggests that marl flat formation is a natural process that has been occurring for millennia, continuously creating habitat for the rare plant species that occupy marl flats. There is no evidence that the marl flats at this site are indicative of anthropogenic disturbance, so that management options for these areas are limited to maintaining the quality and quantity of ground-water discharge that supports both peat formation and erosion.

AB Harvested sites rarely return to functional ecosystems after abandonment because drainage and peat extraction lower the water table and expose relatively decomposed peat, which is hydrologically unsuitable for Sphagnum moss reestablishment. Some natural regeneration of Sphagnum has occurred in isolated pockets on traditionally harvested (block-cut) sites, for reasons that are poorly understood, but are related to natural functions that regulate runoff and evaporation. This study evaluates the water balance of a naturally regenerated cutover bog and compares it with a nearby natural bog of similar size and origin, near Riviere du Loup, Quebec. Water balance results indicated that evapotranspiration was the major water loss from the harvested bog, comprising 92 and 84% of total outputs (2.9 mm day(-1)) during the 1997 and 1998 seasons, respectively. Despite denser tree cover at the harvested site, evapotranspiration from the natural bog was similar, although less spatially variable. At the harvested site, evaporative losses ranged from 1.9 mm day(-1) on raised baulks and roads to 3.6 mm day(-1) from moist surfaces with Sphagnum. Although about half of the ditches were:inactive or operating at only a fraction of their original efficiency, runoff was still significant at 12 and 24% of precipitation during the 1997 and 1998 study seasons, respectively. This compares with negligible rates of runoff at the natural bog. Thus the cutover bog, although abandoned over 25 years ago, has not regained its hydrological function. This is both a cause and effect of its inability to support renewed Sphagnum regeneration. Without suitable management (e.g. blocking ditches), this site is not likely to improve for a very long time. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An intact hydrologic regime and the presence of peat forming vegetation are critical for the persistence of fen wetlands. Fen restoration projects often focus on reestablishing water tables near the soil surface, with little effort directed toward identifying, historic hydrologic regimes, hydrologic modifications, and the sources of degradation. We used inconsistencies in the modern hydrologic regime and historic hydrologic indicators present in the soil seedbank, vegetation, and organic soil composition to identify areas of Drakesbad Meadow, a mountain fen in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, that had been degraded. A network of ground-water monitoring wells and piezometers were used to identify the hydrologic regime of the 4.7-ha site. The presence of thick organic soils in sites with deep late summer water tables, inconsistencies between species present in the seedbank and the existing vegetation, and the presence of dry meadow species such as Poapratensis and Hordeum brachyantherum in areas with organic soils were used to determine that 2.4 ha of the site was degraded. A drainage ditch within the fen and diversions of the fen's water supply caused by a road outside of the fen were identified as the source of hydrologic modification and degradation. These were restored by blocking the flow of water in the main drainage ditch and by installing a series of channels to allow water to cross the road. Reconnecting flow beneath the road resulted in raising the summer water table from 80 cm below the soil surface to less than 10 cm in areas downslope of the road. The addition of five sheet-metal dams perpendicular to flow in the main drainage ditch resulted in raising the water table to within 10 to 20 cm of the soil surface in areas adjacent to and down gradient of the ditch. Before restoration, average late August water table levels across the entire site were 30 cm below the soil surface, while average post-restoration water table levels were 19 cm. below the soil surface. One year following hydrologic restoration, the percent canopy cover of species indicative of uplands and wet meadows, but not fens including Deschampsia cespitosa, Hordeum brachyantherum, and Poa pratensis decreased compared with pre-restoration years, while the cover of the peat-forming species Carex utriculata, Scirpus microcarpus, and Carex simulata increased. It is clear from our study that fens in this region will not persist under drought-like conditions created by water diversions, yet well-designed restoration projects can be used to restore modified hydrologic regimes and peat-forming vegetation necessary for the persistence of fen wetlands.

AB With respect to their role in the global carbon cycle, natural peatlands are characterized by their ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. This trait is strongly connected to the water regime of these ecosystems. Large parts of the soil profile in natural peatlands are water saturated, leading to anoxic conditions and to a diminished decomposition of plant litter. In functioning peatlands, the rate of carbon fixation by plant photosynthesis is larger than the decomposition rate of dead organic material. Over time, the amount of carbon that remains in the soil and is not converted back to carbon dioxide grows. Land use of peatlands often goes along with water level manipulations and thereby with alterations of carbon flux dynamics. In this study, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements from a bog site in northwestern Germany that has been heavily degraded by peat mining are presented. Two contrasting types of management have been implemented at the site: (1) drainage during ongoing peat harvesting on one half of the central bog area and (2) rewetting on the other half that had been taken out of use shortly before measurements commenced. The presented 2-year data set was collected with an eddy covariance (EC) system set up on a central railroad dam that divides the two halves of the (former) peat harvesting area. We used footprint analysis to split the obtained CO2 and CH4 flux time series into data characterizing the gas exchange dynamics of both contrasting land use types individually. The time series gaps resulting from data division were filled using the response of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to environmental variables, footprint variability, and fuzzy transformations of seasonal and diurnal cyclicity. We used the gap-filled gas flux time series from 2 consecutive years to evaluate the impact of rewetting on the annual vertical carbon balances of the cutover bog. Rewetting had a considerable effect on the annual carbon fluxes and led to increased CH4 and decreased CO2 release.
   The larger relative difference between cumulative CO2 fluxes from the rewetted (13 +/- 6 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (22 +/- 7 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section occurred in the second observed year when rewetting apparently reduced CO2 emissions by 40 %. The absolute difference in annual CH4 flux sums was more similar between both years, while the relative difference of CH4 release between the rewetted (0.83 +/- 0.15 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (0.45 +/- 0.11 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section was larger in the first observed year, indicating a maximum increase in annual CH4 release of 84% caused by rewetting at this particular site during the study period.

AB In the Boreal Plain of Canada, the margins of peatland ecosystems that regulate solute and nutrient fluxes between peatlands and adjacent mineral uplands are prone to deep peat burning. Whether post-fire carbon accumulation is able to offset large carbon losses associated with the deep burning at peatland margins is unknown. For this reason, we examined how post-fire hydrological conditions (i.e. water table depth and periodicity, soil tension, and surface moisture content) and depth of burn were associated with moss recolonization at the peatland margins of three sites. We then interpreted these findings using a hydrogeological systems approach, given the importance of groundwater in determining conditions in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in peatlands. Peatland margins dominated by local groundwater flow from adjacent peatland middles were characterized by dynamic hydrological conditions that, when coupled with lowered peatland margin surface elevations due to deep burning, produced two common hydrological states: 1) flooding during wet periods and 2) rapid water table declines during dry periods. These dynamic hydrological states were unfavorable to peatland moss recolonization and bryophytes typical of post-fire recovery in mineral uplands became established. In contrast, at a peatland margin where post-fire hydrological conditions were moderated by larger-scale groundwater flow, flooding and rapid water table declines were infrequent and, subsequently, greater peatland-dwelling moss recolonization was observed. We argue that peatland margins poorly connected to larger-scale groundwater flow are not only prone to deep burning but also lags in post-fire moss recovery. Consequently, an associated reduction in post-fire peat accumulation may occur and negatively affect the net carbon sink status and ecohydrological and biogeochemical function of these peatlands.

AB The mechanisms involved in the initiation and development of the Greater Everglades peatland ecosystems remain a topic of discussion. In this study, we first present an overview of basal ages of peat deposits in South Florida, which shows two major episodes of peatland initiation between 7.0-4.5kyr and 3.5-2.0kyr. Our analysis of regional climate proxy data sets led to three alternative hypotheses that may explain the timing and duration of these two peatland initiation episodes: (1) decreased drainage due to relative sea level (RSL) rise during the Holocene, (2) gradual increase in precipitation throughout the Holocene, and (3) a combination of increasing precipitation, rising RSL, and oscillations in the climate system. We test whether these three hypotheses can explain the pattern of initiation and development of the Greater Everglades peatlands using models that simulate the nonlinear processes involved in peat production and decomposition. The model results suggest that RSL rise could explain the onset of peatland initiation and imply that the climate was wet enough for peat development also during the early Holocene. The first two hypothesized mechanisms in combination with climate oscillations may explain the onset of peat accumulation at 8.2kyr B.P. The two-phased character of peatland initiation maybe explained by the spatial distribution of local drainage conditions. As peatland development is highly nonlinear, our model uncovers a mechanistic way how peats can suddenly shift from a dry high equilibrium to a wet low equilibrium resulting in lake formation as observed in paleoecological studies in the Greater Everglades.

AB The western Palaearctic tundra is a breeding habitat for large populations of European geese. After their arrival in spring, pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) forage extensively on below-ground plant parts, using a feeding technique called grubbing that has substantial impact on the tundra vegetation. Previous studies have shown a high frequency of grubbing in lowland fen vegetation. In the present study, we examined the occurrence of grubbing in other habitat types on Spitsbergen, in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Goose grubbing was surveyed along 19 altitudinal transects, going from the valley bottom to altitudes dominated by scree. Grubbing was more frequent in the wet habitat type at low altitudes compared to the drier habitat type at higher altitudes. For the dry habitat type, a higher frequency of grubbing was found in study plots with a south-east facing exposure where snowmelt is expected to be early. This suggests that pink-footed geese primarily use dry vegetation types for grubbing when they are snow-free in early spring and the availability of snow-free patches of the preferred wet vegetation types in the lowlands is limited. Dry vegetation types have poorer recovery rates from disturbance than wet ones. Sites with early snowmelt and dry vegetation types may therefore be at greater risk of long-term habitat degradation. We conclude that the high growth rate of the Svalbard-breeding pink-footed goose population suggests that increasing impacts of grubbing can be expected and argue that a responsible monitoring of the effects on the tundra ecosystem is crucial.

AB 1. Globally, freshwater wetlands, including fen waters, are suffering from biodiversity loss due to eutrophication, water shortage and toxic substances, and to mitigate these pressures numerous restoration projects have been launched. Water quality data are generally used to evaluate the chances of reestablishment of aquatic vegetation in fen waters and shallow peat lakes. Here we investigated whether sediment characteristics, which are less prone to fluctuate in time, would result in more reliable predictions.
   2. To test if sediment characteristics can indeed be used not only for an easy and early diagnosis of nutrient availability and water quality changes in fen waters, but also for the prognosis of biodiversity response, we recorded the aquatic vegetation and collected surface water, sediment pore water and sediment samples in 145 fen waters in the Netherlands, Ireland and Poland.
   3. Endangered macrophyte species were more closely related to surface water chemistry than common species in terms of occurrence and abundance. Sites featuring endangered species appeared to have significantly lower turbidity and pH, and lower concentrations of SO4, PO4, total phosphorus (TP) and NH4 than other sites.
   4. PO4 and TP concentrations in the water layer increased markedly at PO4 concentrations above 5-10 mu mol L-1 in the sediment pore water. High surface water PO4 and TP concentrations appeared to be SO4-induced and only occurred below certain threshold values for pore water Fe:PO4 (3.5 mol mol(-1)) and total sediment Fe:P (10 mol mol(-1)).
   5. Interestingly, the occurrence of endangered species also correlated strongly with sediment and sediment pore water ratios; the number of endangered species increased markedly at pore water Fe:PO4 ratios above 1 mol mol(-1), whereas their actual abundance had the greatest increase at ratios above 10 mol mol(-1). Additionally, endangered species seemed to be more sensitive to accumulation of potentially toxic substances such as sulphide and ammonium than non-endangered species.
   6. As an indicator of both biogeochemical processes and biodiversity, pore water Fe:PO4 ratios could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool for the restoration of water quality and biodiversity in fen waters, e.g. for selecting the most promising sites for restoration and for optimization of restoration measures.

   IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
SO OIKOS

ID FEN VEGETATION; STANDING CROP; COMPETITION; TYPHA; WATER
AB Several studies have used plant community biomass to predict species richness with varying success. In this study we examined the relationship between species richness and biomass for 36 marsh communities from two different watersheds. In addition, we measured several environmental variables and estimated the potential richness (the total number of species known to be able to occur in a community type) for each community. Above-ground living and dead biomass combined was found to be weakly correlated with species richness (R2 = 0.02). Instead, a multiple regression model based on elevation (R2 = 0.47), salinity (R2 = 0.30), soil organic matter (R2 = 0.18), and biomass was able to explain 82% of the variance in species richness.
   It was found that environmental conditions could explain 89% of the variation in potential richness. Biomass had no relation to potential richness. When used as a predictor variable, potential richness was found to explain 72% of the variation in realized (observed) richness and biomass explained an additional 9% of the variance in realized richness. This finding suggests that realized richness in our system was controlled primarily by environmental regulation of potential richness and secondarily by biomass (as an indicator of competition).
   Further examination of the data revealed that when sites exposed to extreme environmental conditions were eliminated from the analysis, biomass became the primary predictor of realized richness and potential richness was of secondary importance. We conclude that community biomass has a limited capacity to predict species richness across a broad range of habitat conditions. Of particular importance is the inability of biomass to indicate the effects of environmental factors and evolutionary history on the potential species richness at a site.

AB The effects of long-term ozone fumigation on two common peatland plant species, a sedge Eriophorurn vaginatum L. and a moss Sphagnum papillosum Lindh., were studied applying peatland microcosms. The peat cores with intact vegetation were cored from an oligotrophic pine fen and partially embedded into the soil of an open-air experimental field for four growing seasons. The open-air ozone exposure field consists of eight circular plots of which four were fumigated with elevated ozone concentration (doubled ambient) and four were ambient controls. The results showed that E. vaginatum and S. papillosum can tolerate ozone better than expected. Elevated ozone concentration did not affect overall relative length growth of E. vaginatum or S. papillosum. The leaf cross-section area of E. vaginatum leaves was 8% bigger in the ozone treatment compared to that in the ambient control. Ultrastuctural variables did not show any significant treatment effect in E. vaginatum or in S. papillosum. Total chlorophyll (a + b) concentration tended to increase in early growing season under ozone exposure. During the first growing season, elevated ozone concentration decreased methanol-extractable, UV-absorbing compounds in E. vaginatum. The results suggest that E. vaginatum and S. papillosum are ozone tolerant plant species and are likely able to cope with expected increase in tropospheric ozone concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dendrochronological investigations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) growing on Mannikjarve peatland in central Estonia showed that annual tree growth of peatland pines can be used as a proxy for past variations of water table levels. Reconstruction of past water table levels can help us to better understand the dynamics of various ecological processes in peatlands, e.g. the formation of vegetation patterns or carbon and nitrogen cycling. Mannikjarve bog has one of the longest water table records in the boreal zone, continuously monitored since 1956. Common uncertainties encountered while working with peatland trees (e.g. narrow, missing and wedging rings) were in our case exacerbated with difficulties related to the instability of the relationship between tree growth and peatland environment. We hypothesized that the instable relationship was mainly due to a significant change of the limiting factor, i.e. the rise of the water table level due to human activity. To test our hypothesis we had to use several novel methods of tree-ring chronology analysis as well as to test explicitly whether undetected missing rings biased our results. Since the hypothesis that the instable relationship between tree growth and environment was caused by a change in limiting factor could not be rejected, we proceeded to find possible significant changes of past water table levels using structural analysis of the tree-ring chronologies. Our main conclusions were that peatland pines can be proxies to water table levels and that there were several shifting periods of high and low water table levels in the past 200 years.

AB Climatic change could bring about net release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and/or methane (CH4) from the deep peat deposits in northern peatlands into the atmosphere. To provide insight into this hypothesis, we studied net flux of CO2 and CH4 in Big Run Bog, West Virginia, which has a temperate climate, making it an analog to evaluate climatic change imposed on more northern counterparts. Net CO2 flux ranged from -564 to 300 mg C m-2 hr-1. Measurements made during the nighttime showed that net CO2 flux increased exponentially with increasing air temperature, whereas CO2 sequestration increased with increasing air temperature for daytime measurements. Net CH4 flux ranged from -2.3 to 70 mg C m-2 hr-1, showing no consistent relationship to temperature or water table level. Net efflux for both CO2 and CH4 was tenfold higher from peat cores incubated in a greenhouse compared to field measurements. Even cores drained and allowed to dry for 8 days showed moderately high flux for both CO2 and CH4. The enhanced efflux seemed to be due to altered hydrology rather than increased rates of bacterial production (measured in anoxic, in vitro incubations) which could account for only 50% of the whole-core flux. Presumably the remainder was CO2 and CH4 stored in the peat cores at the time of collection. Overall, the results suggest that a temperate climate imposed on northern peatlands could mobilize stored carbon and increase CO2 and CH4 efflux into the troposphere. Studies involving peat cores must insure that CO2 and CH4 dynamics measured in vitro mimic those in situ.

AB This study investigated the effect of the RADARSAT-1 incidence angle on the discrimination of the wetlands, including open bog, treed bog, and marsh, in the Mer Bleue bog conservation area in Ontario, Canada. The results demonstrated that RADARSAT-1 can penetrate tall herbaceous vegetation in marsh at all incidence angles and short shrub vegetation in open bog with standing water at low incidence angles only, which reveals that RADARSAT-1 backscatter double bounce from open wetlands ( marsh and bog) with standing water is related to the vegetation types. The analysis of the RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter of wetland and non-wetland land cover types confirmed that the backscatter return of each land cover type decreases as the incidence angle increases. It was also found that the separations of marsh, treed bog, and open bog without standing water do not vary significantly with increasing incidence angles. However, the incidence angle does affect the discrimination of open bog with standing water. The results from separability measures of land cover classes demonstrate that the combination of a low incidence angle (< 31 degrees) RADARSAT-1 standard beam mode image with Landsat-7 data can provide good separation for all class pairs in the study area. The combination of RADARSAT-1 standard beam mode 1 (S1) and Landsat-7 images gave better classification results than the combination of RADARSAT-1 standard beam mode 5 (S5) and Landsat-7 images: the classification accuracies ( kappa indices) of various wetlands increased in the range 0.02-0.13. For optimal spatial detail, fine beam mode data are desirable because of the higher spatial resolution (similar to 9 m). However, in terms of the discrimination and classification accuracy of wetlands, fine beam mode data are not suggested because of the high incidence angle. Therefore, it is concluded that a lower incidence angle RADARSAT-1 image ( e. g., S1) is the optimal beam mode when combining with Landsat images for the discrimination and classification of wetlands.

AB Peatlands represent globally-important ecosystems and carbon stores. However, large areas of peat land have been drained for agriculture, or peat has been harvested for use as fuel or in horticulture. Increasingly, these landscapes are being restored through ditch blocking and rewetting primarily to improve biodiversity and promote peat accumulation. To date we have little knowledge of how these interventions influence the microbial communities in peatlands. We compared the responses of dominant microbial consumers (testate amoebae) to drainage ditch restoration relative to unblocked ditches in a UK upland blanket peatland (Migneint, North Wales). Two techniques were used for restoration: (i) dammed ditches with re-profiling; and (ii) dammed ditches with pools of open water behind each dam. Testate communities in the inter-ditch areas changed markedly over time and between treatments illustrating the potential of this group of organisms as indicators of blanket peatland restoration status. However, the responses of testate amoebae to peat rewetting associated with restoration were partially obscured by inter-annual variability in weather conditions through the course of the experiment. Although there was considerable variability in the response of testate amoebae communities to peatland drain blocking, there were clearly more pronounced changes in samples from the dammed and reprofiled treatments including an increase in diversity, and the appearance of unambiguous wet-indicator species in relatively high abundances (includingAmphitrema stenostoma, Archerella flavum, Arcella discoides type, Difflugia bacillifera and Difflugia bacillarium). This reflects a shift towards overall wetter conditions across the site and the creation of new habitats. However, water-table was not a significant control on testate amoebae in this case, suggesting a poor relationship between water table and surface moisture in this sloping blanket peatland. Our findings highlight the potential of testate amoebae as bioindicators of peatland restoration success; however, there is a need for caution as mechanisms driving change in the microbial communities may be more complex than-first assumed. Several factors need to be taken into account when implementing biomonitoring studies in peatlands including: (i) the natural variability of the peatland ecosystem under changing weather conditions; (ii) any disturbance connected with the restoration procedures; and (iii) the timescales over which the ecosystem responds to the management intervention. Our results also suggest an indicator species approach based on population dynamics may be more appropriate for biomonitoring peatland restoration than examining changes at the community level.

AB Sedge dominated peatlands do not rehabilitate well after being drained for rangelands and specific approaches are required in order to restore these sites. Restoration by blocking drainage canals aims to recover peatland functions, principally by raising the water table. Field surveys in Ruoergai, China identified the status of peatland degradation and satellite image analysis concluded that most of Ruoergai's peatlands are degraded mainly due to drainage and overgrazing. The restoration approach used in Ruoergai resulted in increased water levels up to 26 cm higher than previously recorded in canals. Levels in shallow water canals also increased up to 50 cm, which led to an overflow of water and rewetting of the adjacent peatlands. This resulted in one peat-mining site being filled with water and aquatic vegetation. Pioneering vegetation including Heleocharis Horsetail (Equisetum heleocharis) and Halerpestes (Halerpestes tricuspis) colonized in the restored sites. It was concluded that blocking canals could be an effective method to restore hydrological function of drained peatlands and contribute to vegetation recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The extent to which complex interrelationships between plants and microorganisms influence organic matter dynamics is critical to our understanding of global C cycles in changing environments. We examined the hypothesis that patterns of soil microbial activity and functional composition differ among vegetation types in northern peatland ecosystems. Microbial characteristics were compared among peatlands differing in plant growth form (tree, shrub/moss, sedge) in two regions (New York State and West Virginia). Microbial activity (basal respiration) was greater in surface (0-15 cm) than subsurface (15-30 cm) peat and from sites dominated by shrubs and Sphagnum moss (3.9 +/- 0.65 mug C g(-1) h(-1)) compared to forested (1.8 +/- 0.20 mug C g(-1) h(-1)) or sedge-dominated sites (1.9 +/- 0.38 mug C g(-1) h(-1)). Microbial activity was not related to decomposability of peat organic matter among vegetation types, and activity was unexpectedly higher in sites with lower peat pH and higher water table level. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) did not show a clear pattern among vegetation types, but was greater in surface than subsurface peat. Microbial responsiveness to added glucose was very low. The ratio of basal respiration to SIR varied between 0.39 and 0.72 and, like activity, was highest in shrub/Sphagnum sites. Microbial substrate utilization patterns (assayed with BIOLOG(R) GN plates) also differed between shrub/Sphagnum sites and forest or sedge sites, suggesting that C fluxes were mediated by different assemblages of microorganisms in shrub/Sphagnum peatlands. Principal component (PC) scores indicated more utilization of N-containing compounds and carboxylic acids, and less utilization of carbohydrates by microbial communities in shrub/Sphagnum sites. PC scores were much more variable both within and among vegetation types for sites in West Virginia than in New York State, and a greater diversity of C sources were utilized in WV (57 +/- 3) than NYS (47 +/- 2) peat. Our results suggest a link between microbial respiratory activity and microbial functional composition as they vary among these peatland vegetation types. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane (CH4) net flux were made in a boreal fen, typical of the most abundant peatlands in western Canada during May-September 2007. The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the magnitude of diurnal and seasonal variation in CH4 net flux, (ii) the relationship between the temporally varying flux rates and associated changes in controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and (iii) the contribution of CH4 emission to the ecosystem growing season carbon budget. There was significant diurnal variation in CH4 emission during the peak of the growing season that was strongly correlated with associated changes in solar radiation, latent heat flux, air temperature and ecosystem conductance to water vapor. During days 181-215, nighttime average CH4 efflux was only 47% of the average midday values. The peak value for daily average CH4 emission rate was approximately 80 nmol m-2 s-1 (4.6 mg CH4 m-2 h-1), and seasonal variation in CH4 flux was strongly correlated with changes in soil temperature. Integrated over the entire measurement period [days 144-269 (late May-late September)], the total CH4 emission was 3.2 g CH4 m-2, which was quite low relative to other wetland ecosystems and to the simultaneous high rate of ecosystem net CO2 sequestration that was measured (18.1 mol CO2 m-2 or 217 g C m-2). We estimate that the negative radiative forcing (cooling) associated with net carbon storage over the life of the peatland (approximately 2200 years) was at least twice the value of positive radiative forcing (warming) caused by net CH4 emission over the last 50 years.

AB Microbes involved in decomposition within peatlands and the conditions that influence their activities have implications for C and greenhouse gas exchange. The objectives of this research were to characterize the role of fungal and bacterial activities in peatlands using selective antibiotic inhibition techniques across a nutrient gradient (rich to poor fens) and to search for environmental controls on the activity of each group. Bacterial activities predominated across a range of rich to poor boreal peatlands in central Ontario, Canada, although fungal activity became increasingly important in the poor sites. Linkages between soil pH and nutrient status and fungal and bacterial activities were found. However, they did not confirm our initial hypotheses that bacterial activity would be low in poor sites due to proton stress and low nutrient (particularly N) availability, whereas, fungal activity would be low in rich sites due to increased competitive ability of bacteria under near neutral pH conditions and high nutrient availability. Further work across these sites aimed at characterizing the phylogeny of the rhizosphere fungi is needed to determine if increased presence of mycorrhizae in poor sites could have explained our observed patterns. However, regardless of fungal: bacterial activity ratio differences across sites and its associated controls, microbial CO2 production rates across fen types did not vary significantly, suggesting that the proportion of bacteria and fungi may not matter to broader carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in peat soils.

AB Peatlands are a major source of methylmercury that contaminates downstream aquatic food webs. The large store of mercury (Hg) in peatlands could be a source of Hg for over a century even if deposition is dramatically reduced. However, the reliability of Hg mass balances can be questioned due to missing long-term land-atmosphere flux measurements. We used a novel micrometeorological system for continuous measurement of Hg peatland-atmosphere exchange to derive the first annual Hg budget for a peatland. The evasion of Hg (9.4 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) over the course of a year was seven times greater than stream Hg export, and over two times greater than wet bulk deposition to the boreal peatland. Measurements of dissolved gaseous Hg in the peat pore water also indicate Hg evasion. The net efflux may result from recent declines in atmospheric Hg concentrations that have turned the peatland from a net sink into a source of atmospheric Hg. This net Hg loss suggests that open boreal peatlands and downstream ecosystems can recover more rapidly from past atmospheric Hg deposition than previously assumed. This has important implications for future levels of methylmercury in boreal freshwater fish and the estimation of historical Hg accumulation rates from peat profiles.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions are important in the global atmospheric chemistry and their feedbacks to global warming are uncertain. Global warming is expected to trigger vegetation changes and water table drawdown in boreal peatlands, such changes have only been investigated on isoprene emission but never on other BVOCs. We aimed at distinguishing the BVOCs released from vascular plants, mosses and peat in hummocks (dry microsites) and hollows (wet microsites) of boreal peatland microcosms maintained in growth chambers. We also assessed the effect of water table drawdown (-20 cm) on the BVOC emissions in hollow microcosms. BVOC emissions were measured from peat samples underneath the moss surface after the 7-week-long experiment to investigate whether the potential effects of vegetation and water table drawdown were shown. BVOCs were sampled using a conventional chamber method, collected on adsorbent and analyzed with GC MS. In hummock microcosms, vascular plants increased the monoterpene emissions compared with the treatment where all above-ground vegetation was removed while no effect was detected on the sesquiterpenes, other reactive VOCs (ORVOCs) and other VOCs. Peat layer from underneath the surface with intact vegetation had the highest sesquiterpene emissions. In hollow microcosms, intact vegetation had the highest sesquiterpene emissions. Water table drawdown decreased monoterpene and other VOC emissions. Specific compounds could be closely associated to the natural/lowered water tables. Peat layer from underneath the surface of hollows with intact vegetation had the highest emissions of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and ORVOCs whereas water table drawdown decreased those emissions. The results suggest that global warming would change the BVOC emission mixtures from boreal peatlands following changes in vegetation composition and water table drawdown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A semi-natural grassland in Sweden was exposed to an elevated CO2 concentration during a six-year open-top chamber experiment. Vegetation composition was assessed twice a year using the point-intercept method. The field had been grazed previously, but when the experiment started this was replaced with a cutting regime with one cut (down to ground level) each year in early August. From the third to the sixth year of the study the harvested material was divided into legumes, non-leguminous forbs and grasses, dried and weighed.
   Elevated CO2 had an effect on species composition (as analysed by Principal Component Analysis) that increased over time. It also tended to increase diversity (Shannon index) in summer, but reduce it in spring. However, the effects of the weather and/or time on species composition and diversity were much more prominent than CO2 effects. Since the weather was largely directional over time (from dry to wet), with the exception of the fifth year, it was difficult to distinguish between weather effects and changes caused by a changed management regime. In all treatments, grasses increased over time in both mass and point-intercept measurements, whereas non-leguminous forbs decreased in mass, but not in point-intercept measurements. Legumes increased in the point-intercept measurements, but not in biomass, at elevated CO2, but not in the other treatments.
   Overall, we found that elevated CO2 affected species composition; however, it was only one of many factors and a rather weak one.

AB Monitoring tools are needed to assess changes in peatland biotic communities and ecosystem functions in response to on-going climate and other environmental changes. Although the responses of soil organisms and plants to ecological gradients and perturbations do not always correlate, peatland monitoring is mainly based on vegetation surveys. Testate amoebae, a group of protists, are important contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling in organic soils and are useful bioindicators in peatland ecology and paleoecology. There is however little comparative data on the value of testate amoebae, vascular plants and bryophytes as bioindicators of micro-environmental gradients in peatlands.
   We compared the relationships of testate amoebae, bryophytes, and vascular plants with soil temperature, water table depth, micro-habitats and the carbon and nitrogen content of Sphagnum mosses in four peatlands along a 1300 m altitudinal gradient in Switzerland. We used the full diversity of vascular plants and bryophyte but only a selection of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba morpho-taxa (i.e. species or species-complexes).
   Indirect and direct gradient ordinations, multiple factor analysis (MFA) and transfer function models for inferring water table depth showed that a selection of ten testate amoeba taxa are more powerful (% variance explained in RDA) and accurate (discrimination among habitats) indicators of local conditions (micro-habitat type, water table depth and Sphagnum C/N ratio) than the vegetation (vascular plants and bryophytes either individually or combined and considering the full diversity).
   Our study showed that a limited list of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba taxa have higher bioindication value than the full bryophytes and vascular plants. Furthermore, testate amoebae can be analyzed on samples collected at any season (accessibility allowing and if precise sampling sites are well marked) - a clear advantage for biomonitoring and can be used to infer past changes from the peat record at the same taxonomic resolution. This simple approach could therefore be very useful for biomonitoring of peatlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peat profiles were sampled from a raised bog and an interior fen located in the boreal James Bay Lowlands, Northern Ontario, and a cold-temperate swamp and a cold-temperate bog in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, southern Ontario. An examination of the micromorphology and maceral compositions of the peats indicates that considerable differences exist between environments. The boreal bog and fen both consist predominantly of relatively unaltered textinite (commonly Sphagnum-derived), with higher liptinite contents in the fen profile attributable to the more diverse vegetation. Both the cold-temperate swamp and bog show high levels of humification at the surface, possibly partially attributable to recent climatic warming trends causing a decline in water table elevation. In all profiles, funginite was persistent, ranging from 2 to 10% of the total maceral content, indicating that aerobic conditions generally prevailed at the surface at the time of deposition. The influence of depositional environment and vegetation type on the resulting peat was born out in plots of Tissue Preservation Index vs. Gelification Index. The petrographic study also demonstrated that none of the profiles contained high ineaodetrinite/semifusinite contents comparable to those within cold-climate cratonic Permian Gondwana coals. Since the oxidation processes leading to the formation of inertinite are considered to take place at the peat stage, if the peats studied were to contain a similar maceral assemblage upon coalification, inertinite precursors may be present in the peat. The lack of petrographic similarity between the Holocene peats and the Permian coals may be related to a number of factors. The decrease in water table elevation possibly responsible for the inertinization of the Permian coals may have occurred following the cessation of peat formation, not concurrently with accumulation, and is potentially attributable to long-term factors such as climatic warming. The change in the peat-forming vegetation (from Permian Glossopteris- and Gangamopteris-dominated communities to Holocene Sphagnum and coniferous vegetation) alters the characteristics of the initial botanical starting materials, and some aspects of the ecology, particularly trophic and pH conditions, which control the post-depositional alteration of the plant materials and the resulting maceral assemblages.

AB Fire, including prescribed burning, is common on peatlands globally and can affect vegetation, including peat-forming Sphagnum mosses, and affect ecosystem services. We monitored vegetation in different burn-age categories at three UK peatland sites over a 19-month period. Half of the plots had Sphagnum fragments added and their survival was assessed. Changes in vegetation composition over time, and associations between vegetation composition, site and burn-age category were investigated. Plots in the most recently burned category were likely to have more bare peat, a thinner moss layer and lower vascular plant strata. Graminoid cover initially increased after burning but was low after 10+ years. Dwarf shrub cover increased after burning and remained high after 10+ years. At the most Sphagnum-rich site, a high proportion of existing Sphagnum cover was bleached one year after burning, but recovery occurred during the study period. Sphagnum re-introduction success decreased over the study period in the most recent and intermediate burn-age categories at the most Sphagnum-poor site. These results show that burning rotation length is an important factor in determining site-level vegetation composition on burned sites. More frequent burning will result in a greater proportion of land in the early post-burning stages, potentially resulting in a thinner moss layer, more bare peat and less healthy Sphagnum, with potential consequences for carbon balance. No evidence was found to support the use of burning as a tool to increase existing Sphagnum or promote Sphagnum re-establishment success.

AB Warming Arctic temperatures have led to permafrost thaw that threatens to release previously sequestered mercury (Hg) back into the environment. Mobilisation of Hg in permafrost waters is of concern, as Hg methylation produced under water-saturated conditions results in the neurotoxin, methyl Hg (MeHg). Thawing permafrost may enhance Hg export, but the magnitude and mechanisms of this mobilisation within Arctic ecosystems remain poorly understood. Such uncertainty limits prognostic modelling of Hg mobilisation and impedes a comprehensive assessment of its threat to Arctic ecosystems and peoples. Here, we address this knowledge gap through an assessment of Hg dynamics across a well-studied permafrost thaw sequence at the peak of the growing season in biologically active peat overlying permafrost, quantifying total gaseous mercury (TGM) fluxes, total mercury (Hg-Tot) in the active layer peat, porewater MeHg concentrations, and identifying microbes with the potential to methylate Hg. During the initial thaw, TGM is liberated, likely by photoreduction from permafrost where it was previously stored for decades to centuries. As thawing proceeds, TGM is largely driven by hydrologic changes as evidenced by Hg accumulation in water-logged, organic-rich peat sediments in fen sites. MeHg in porewaters increase across the thaw gradient, a pattern coincident with increases in the relative abundance of microbes possibly containing genes allowing for methylation of ionic Hg. Findings suggest that under changing climate, frozen, well-drained habitats will thaw and collapse into saturated landscapes, increasing the production of MeHg and providing a significant source of the toxic, bioaccumulative contaminant.

AB Peatlands are globally important long-term sinks of carbon, however there is concern that enhanced peat decomposition and moss moisture stress due to climate change mediated drought will reduce moss productivity making these ecosystems vulnerable to carbon loss and associated long-term degradation. Peatlands are resilient to summer drought moss stress because of negative ecohydrological feedbacks that generally maintain a wet peat surface, but where feedbacks may be contingent on peat depth. We tested this 'survival of the deepest' hypothesis by examining water table (WT) position, near-surface moisture content, and soil water tension in peatlands that differ in size, peat depth, and catchment area during a summer drought. All shallow sites (<40 cm depth) lost their WT (i.e., the groundwater well was dry) for considerable time during the drought period. Near-surface soil water tension increased dramatically at shallow sites following WT loss, increasing similar to 5-7.5x greater at shallow sites compared to deep sites (>= 40 cm depth). During a mid-summer drought intensive field survey, we found that 60-67% of plots at shallow sites exceeded a 100 mb tension threshold used to infer moss water stress. Unlike the shallow sites, tension typically did not exceed this 100 mb threshold at the deep sites. Using species dependent water content - chlorophyll fluorescence thresholds and relations between volumetric water content and WT depth, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that moss had nearly twice the likelihood of being stressed at shallow sites (0.38 +/- 0.24) compared to deep sites (0.22 +/- 0.18). This study provides evidence that mosses in shallow peatland may be particularly vulnerable to warmer and drier climates in the future, but where species composition may play an important role. We argue that a critical 'threshold' peat depth specific for different hydrogeological and hydroclimatic regions can be used to assess what peatlands are especially vulnerable to climate change mediated drought.

AB Safely treating wastewater in remote communities and mining operations in sub-arctic Canada is critical to protecting the surrounding aquatic ecosystems. Undisturbed fen peatlands have been used to minimize the release of contaminants to the aquatic ecosystems; however, there is a limited understanding of wastewater transport or polishing in undisturbed fen peatlands. To elucidate these processes, a small (9800 m(2), similar to 250 m long) ladder fen was continuously injected with a wastewater surrogate derived from a custom fertilizer blend and 38 m(3) day(-1) of water for 51 days. The simulated wastewater included sulphate (27.2 mg L-1), nitrate (7.6 mg L-1), ammonium (9.1 mg L-1), phosphate (7.4 mg L-1), and chloride (47.2 mg L-1). Major ion, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) pore water concentrations were measured throughout the study period. No wastewater contaminants were detected in the site outlet (similar to 250 m down-gradient) and most wastewater contaminants, except for SO42- and Cl-, remained relatively immobile. Within the SO42- plume, MeHg and THg concentrations became highly elevated relative to background (up to 10 ng L-1, similar to three to five-fold increase) and MeHg comprised 60-100% of dissolved THg in the pore water. No MeHg or THg was exported at the outflow. The large increase in THg cannot be solely accounted for by the increase in MeHg and was likely due to enhanced decomposition of the peat substrate by increased microbial activity due to electron acceptor loading. Since the added nutrients were effectively transformed, sequestered or otherwise removed from pore waters in this experimental system, it appears that fen peatlands have a large capacity to safely treat residential wastewater nutrients; however, the inadvertent increases in THg and MeHg require further investigation and potential management.

ID PEAT
AB Ombrotrophic peatlands in North America are harvested mainly for horticultural purposes. Following intense exploitation, these peatlands are generally abandoned to natural regeneration. The abandoned sites usually remain barren or poorly revegetated by a few vascular plants for several years. The post-harvested sites are not usually recolonized by Sphagnum species (pear mosses), which are the key species to restore peatland functions. The objective of this study was to develop restoration techniques for post-harvested peatlands. The experiments centred on Sphagnum reintroduction. since peat mosses are responsible for peat accumulation. Vegetative Sphagnum fragments were used as diaspores. Various methods of Sphagnum reintroduction were tested to ensure reliable colonization. A microrelief formed of ridges and depressions provided humid conditions in depressions which favored Sphagnum establishment. Reintroducing Sphagnum diaspores in combination with such companion plant species as Eriophorum angustifolium also had a positive effect on the survival of peat mosses. A phosphorus amendment led to improved establishment of Sphagna and companion plant species.

TI Rewetting former agricultural peatlands: Topsoil removal as a
   prerequisite to avoid strong nutrient and greenhouse gas emissions

AB Globally 15%, and in Europe over 50%, of all peatlands have been drained for agricultural use leading to high carbon (C) losses, severe land subsidence and increased flooding risks. For the restoration of C sequestration and peat formation, abandoned peatlands are being rewetted at a large scale, but this transforms them into strong methane (CH4) sources. Furthermore, due to the high topsoil nutrient contents and/or high buffering capacities of water used for rewetting, this will inevitably result in eutrophication of restored peatlands and downstream areas, which may compromise the regrowth of peat forming vegetation including Sphagnum spp.
   To experimentally determine the extent of these negative side effects in relation to water quality, and to test topsoil removal as an abatement strategy, we used a controlled laboratory approach in which topsoil and subsoil monoliths of a former agricultural peatland were rewetted with water of different qualities (+P, +HCO3-, +P/+HCO3- and Control), mimicking rainwater vs. surface water storage. In addition, two different Sphagnum moss species (S. squarrosum and S. palustre) were compared.
   Without topsoil removal, rewetting led to high P and N mobilisation, algal blooms, and high CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) emissions. P-rich water resulted in further eutrophication. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) enrichment by surface water not only stimulated P release and CO2 emission, but also strongly reduced Sphagnum vitality.
   We conclude that topsoil removal will, at least in initial stages of rewetting, strongly reduce eutrophication problems (by 80-90%), CH4 emission (99%), DOC loss (60%) and global warming potential (50-70%) of rewetted former agricultural peatlands. Furthermore, to reduce mineralisation rates and enable Sphagnum growth, storage of rainwater rather than surface water is preferred. Finally, removed topsoils can be reused in adjacent subsiding agricultural areas, and thereby optimise the overall C balance and allow higher water levels in rewetted peatlands.

AB Peatlands contain approximately 25% of the total soil organic carbon, despite covering only 3% of earth's land surface. The ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical functions of peatlands are tightly coupled to climate. Therefore, both direct human impacts and indirect effects of climate change can threaten the ecological function of peatlands through changes in hydrology. However, little is known about how peatland ecosystems, and specifically their biogeochemistry, carbon cycling, and development, may respond to climatic change. In this study, the Peat Accumulation Model was adapted to investigate the response of peatland development and carbon cycling to climatic change through simulating changes in precipitation and temperature at different stages of peatland development history. The warming and wetting were imposed on this system at 10,000 years since its initialization (mid-development stage) and at 20,000 years since its initialization (late-development stage). Here, it was revealed that peatlands can switch between carbon sinks and sources suddenly, but the extent to which the change takes place depends on the developmental stage of peatland ecosystems. The simulation results for the late-development stage showed that peatlands could function as carbon sources once warming and wetting was imposed but that peatland ecosystems during the mid-development stage can still function as carbon sinks under warming and wetting conditions. Moreover, peatland ecosystems have self-regulation capabilities so that they can go back to their normal ecological and biogeochemical functions under newly stabilized climates. Also, it is the change in temperature that results in the fundamental change in peatland development and carbon cycling. This study indicates that the response of peatland ecosystems to climate change is largely determined by their developmental stages.

AB Changes to climate are projected over the next 50 years for many peatland areas. As decomposition of peat forming vegetation is likely to be intrinsically linked to these changes in climate, a clear understanding of climate-peat dynamics is required. There is concern that increased temperature and decreased precipitation could increase the rate of decomposition and put the carbon sink status of many peatlands at risk, yet few studies have examined the impact of both climatic factors together. To better understand the sensitivity of peatland decomposition to changes in both temperature and precipitation and their interaction, we conducted a short-term laboratory experiment in which plant litters and peat soil were incubated, in isolation, in a factorial design. Treatments simulated baseline and projected climate averages derived from the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09) for Exmoor, a climatically marginal peatland in SW England. Regular carbon dioxide flux measurements were made throughout the simulation, as well as total mass loss and total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached. The largest effect on carbon loss in this multifactor experiment was from substrate, with Sphagnum/peat releasing significantly less C in total during the experiment than dwarf shrubs/graminoids. Climate effects were substrate specific, with the drier rainfall treatment increasing the DOC leaching from Callum, but decreasing it from Sphagnum. Partitioning between CO2 and DOC was also affected by climate, but only for the peat and Sphagnum samples, where the future climate scenarios (warmer and drier) resulted in a greater proportion of C lost in gaseous form. These results suggest that indirect effects of climate through changes in species composition in peatlands could ultimately turn out to be more important for litter decomposition than direct effects of climate change from increased temperatures and decreased rainfall.

ID NORTHERN; ACCUMULATION; ECOSYSTEMS; TUNDRA; BOG
AB Stratigraphic analyses of peal composition, LOI, pollen, spores, macrofossils, charcoal and AMS ages are used to reconstruct the peatland, vegetation and climatic dynamics in the Pur-Taz region of western Siberia over 5000 years (9300-4500 BP). Section stratigraphy shows many changes from shallow lake sediment to different combinations of forested or open sedge, moss, and Equisetum fen and peatland environments. Macrofossil and pollen data indicate that Larix sibirica and Betula pubescens trees were the first to arrive, followed by Picea obovata. The dominance of Picea macrofossils 6000-5000 BP in the Pur-Taz peatland along with regional Picea pollen maxima indicate warmer conditions and movement of the spruce treeline northward at this time. The decline of pollen and macrofossils from all of these tree species in uppermost peals suggests a change in the environment less favorable for their growth, perhaps cooler temperatures and/or less moisture. Of major significance is the evidence for old ages of the uppermost peals in this area of Siberia, suggesting a real lack of peal accumulation in recent millennia or recent oxidation of uppermost peat.

AB Laboratory columns (80 cm long, 10 cm diameter) of peat were constructed from samples collected from a subarctic fen, a temperate bog and a temperate swamp. Temperature and water table position were manipulated to establish their influence on emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the columns. A factorial design experiment revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences in emission of these gases related to peat type, temperature and water table position, as well as an interaction between temperature and water table. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 at 23-degrees-C were an average of 2.4 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, than those at 10-degrees-C. Compared to emissions when the columns were saturated, water table at a depth of 40 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 4.3 times and decreased CH4 emissions by an average of 5.0 times. There were significant temporal variations in gas emissions during the 6-week experiment, presumably related to variations in microbial populations and substrate availability. Using columns with static water table depths of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 cm, CO2 emissions showed a positive, linear relation with depth, whereas CH4 emissions revealed a negative, logarithmic relation with depth. Lowering and then raising the water table from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm revealed weak evidence of hysteresis in CO2 emissions between the falling and rising water table limbs. Hysteresis (falling > rising limb) was very pronounced for CH4 emissions, attributed to a release of CH4 stored in pore-water and a lag in the development of anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis on the rising limb. Decreases in atmospheric pressure were correlated with abnormally large emissions of CO2 and CH4 on the falling limb. Peat slurries incubated in flasks revealed few differences between the three peat types in the rates of CO2 production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. There were, however, major differences between peat types in the rates of CH4 consumption under aerobic incubation conditions and CH4 production under anaerobic conditions (bog > fen > swamp), which explain the differences in response of the peat types in the column experiment.

AB The carbon sink potential of peatlands depends on the balance of carbon uptake by plants and microbial decomposition. The rates of both these processes will increase with warming but it remains unclear which will dominate the global peatland response. Here we examine the global relationship between peatland carbon accumulation rates during the last millennium and planetary-scale climate space. A positive relationship is found between carbon accumulation and cumulative photosynthetically active radiation during the growing season for mid- to high-latitude peatlands in both hemispheres. However, this relationship reverses at lower latitudes, suggesting that carbon accumulation is lower under the warmest climate regimes. Projections under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios indicate that the present-day global sink will increase slightly until around AD 2100 but decline thereafter. Peatlands will remain a carbon sink in the future, but their response to warming switches from a negative to a positive climate feedback (decreased carbon sink with warming) at the end of the twenty-first century.

AB We used variation partitioning to assess the relative importance of drainage, climate and local vegetation composition for the development of a raised bog. As a case study we selected Teici (Teici) Bog in Latvia (north-east Europe). Explanatory variables together explained 74 % of the variation in peat accumulation and only the residue of 26 % remained unexplained. Our study showed that the local vegetation composition and dominant Sphagnum species significantly influence peat accumulation rates. The results of linear models revealed that, under natural conditions, minor drainage and even strong drainage of the peat is associated with a positive growth balance of the system. However, drainage systems can have a measurable impact on peatland ecosystems situated farther away. Our study demonstrates that the average peat accumulation rate in Teici Bog over the last 150 years was 3.5 mm per year. Although the peat accumulation rate has been affected by drainage over the last half-century, it is still 2.8 mm per year. There was no strong correlation with the historical climate record, suggesting that the bog area has buffered the influence of climate change over the last 150 years.

AB The net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange (NEE) between boreal bogs and the atmosphere and its environmental drivers remains understudied despite the large carbon store of these northern ecosystems. We present NEE measurements using the eddy covariance technique in a boreal ombrotrophic bog over five growing seasons and four winters. Inter-annual variability in CO2 uptake was most pronounced in June-September (-4 to -122 g CO2-C m(-2)), less in March-May (-1 to -21 g CO2-C m(-2)) and very small in October-November (-2 to -4 g CO2-C m(-2)). Variability in NEE between years was linked primarily to changes in water table depth (WTD). Strong and significant relationships (r(2) > 0.89, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) were found between summer (June-September) maximum photosynthetic rate (A (max)), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity and WTD. Adding air temperature through multiple regression analysis further increased correlation between summer A (max), NEP, and WTD (r(2) = 0.96, p = 0.05). In contrast to previous studies examining controls on peatland CO2 exchange, no relationships were found between productivity or cumulative exchange and early season temperature, timing of the snowmelt or growing season length.

AB Bogs are globally important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) due to the accumulation of partially decomposed litter that forms peat. Because bogs receive their nutrients from the atmosphere, the world-wide increase of nitrogen (N) deposition is expected to affect litter decomposition and, ultimately, the rate of C accumulation. However, the mechanism of such biogeochemical alteration remains unclear and quantification of the effect of N addition on litter accumulation has yet to be done. Here, we show that 7 similar to years of N addition to a bog decreased the C similar to N ratio, increased the bacterial biomass and stimulated the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes in surface peat. Furthermore, N addition modified nutrient limitation of microbes during litter decomposition so that phosphorus became a primary limiting nutrient. Alteration of N release from decomposing litter affected bog water chemistry and the competitive balance between peat-forming mosses and vascular plants. We estimate that deposition of about 4 g similar to N similar to m-2 similar to yr-1 will cause a mean annual reduction of fresh litter C accumulation of about 40 similar to g similar to m-2 primarily as a consequence of decreased litter production from peat-forming mosses. Our findings show that N deposition interacts with both above and below ground components of biodiversity to threaten the ability of bogs to act as N-sinks, which may offset the positive effects of N on C accumulation seen in other ecosystems.

AB We investigated the developmental and hydrological history of a Sphagnum-dominated, kettle peatland in Upper Michigan using testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, and pollen. Our primary objective was to determine if the paleohydrological record of the peatland represents a record of past climate variability at subcentennial to millennial time scales. To assess the role of miltennial-scale climate variability on peatland paleohydrology, we compared the timing of peatland and upland vegetation changes. To investigate the role of higher-frequency climate variability on peatland paleohydrology, we used testate amoebae to reconstruct a high-resolution, hydrologic history of the peatland for the past 5100 years, and compared this record to other regional records of paleoclimate and vegetation. Comparisons revealed coherent patterns of hydrological, vegetational, and climatic changes, suggesting that peatland paleohydrology responded to climate variability at millennial to sub-centennial time scales. Although ombrotrophic peatlands have been the focus of most high-resolution peatland paleoclimate research, paleohydrological records from Sphagnum-dominated, closed-basin peatlands record high-frequency and low-magnitude climatic changes and thus represent a significant source of unexplored paleoclimate data.

AB This study aimed to measure the effects of ecological restoration on blanket peat water table depths and CO2 fluxes. The flux of CO2 and water table depths were measured on eight sites for 5 years. Results suggest that sites with revegetation alongside slope stabilisation have the highest rates of photosynthesis and are the largest net (daylight hours) sinks of CO2. Bare sites are the largest net sources of CO2 and have the deepest water table depths. Sites with gully wall stabilisation are between 5 and 8 times more likely to be net CO2 sinks than the bare sites. Revegetation without gully flow blocking using plastic dams does not have a large effect on water table depths in and around the gullies investigated whereas a blocked gully has water table depths comparable to a naturally revegetating gully. A 10 cm lowering in water table depth decreases the probability of observing a net CO2 sink, on a given site, by up to 30 %. The most important conclusion of this research was that restoration interventions are effective at increasing the likelihood of net CO2 sink behaviour and raising water tables on degraded, climatically marginal blanket bog.

AB Knowledge of whether a peatland is fed by a surface aquifer or is providing water to the aquifer can lead to different aquifer and wetland management strategies. Few studies have been conducted to investigate aquifer-peatland connections, because flow connections are difficult to measure and can be spatially and temporally variable. The objective of this study was to combine chemical and botanical indicators of groundwater inflow to Sphagnum-dominated peatlands for a better classification of their water sources. Available knowledge of peatland geomorphic setting, water chemistry, and vegetation data for 12 aquifer-peatland systems of the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and of the St. Lawrence Lowlands, two contrasting regions of southern Quebec (Canada), were used to derive indicators of groundwater inflow. Total dissolved solids (TDS) is identified as a comprehensive indicator of water mineralization. Threshold values of 16 mg/1 (Abitibi-Temiscamingue) and 22 mg/1 (St. Lawrence Lowlands) were found to indicate the presence of groundwater within the peatland. Results show that combining chemical (TDS) and botanical indicators can detect the presence of groundwater inflow into most of the studied peatlands. The indicators are more efficient on slope peatlands, where groundwater inflow is more substantial and less spatially variable, than in basin peatlands. A two-step approach is proposed: (1) identify the geomorphic setting of the peatland, and (2) estimate the chemical and botanical indicators. This approach is low-cost and easy to implement, and thus can be used on a large number of sites to assess the presence of groundwater inflow to peatlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heathland has become fragmented throughout its European range with many countries losing 60-90% of their heathland area during the 20th century. A small, isolated area of wet heathland within permitted ball clay workings in Dorset (England) was translocated in October 1993 to an engineered receptor cell fed by groundwater and direct precipitation in order to mitigate the otherwise total loss of the wet heath. The aims were to rescue the wet heathland and to re-establish a community type similar to the wet heath that originally occurred at the donor site prior to the recent development of vegetation communities and birch colonisation associated with drier conditions. Vegetation monitoring over 12 years up to 2005 indicated that the experimental translocation successfully fulfilled the aims for a period of 7 years when the hydrological regime of the receptor site was actively managed. There was development of a mosaic of wet heath and mire vegetation community types including Sphagnum lawns and open bog pools. However, when active management ceased, the receptor site became drier and species were lost. Multivariate analysis revealed a trajectory of progressive rapid chronological change during 1994 and 1995 followed by a period of relative stability between 1996 and 2000 which coincided with greater species density. Subsequently up to 2005, the plant community became less species-rich and the plant community reverted to a species structure similar to that which occurred in 1994/1995. The importance of hydrological regime for plant community structure was tested using fixed-quadrat data and the water level measurements made in the period 1995-1998. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) multivariate analysis revealed a hydrological gradient with a significant seasonal effect of water table depth in the first half of the year and close association of the least wet quadrat location and non-mire species. Overall, the results support the use of translocation as a means of rescuing wet heath habitat which would otherwise be lost due to change in land use. There is a risk of failure when translocating a complex ecosystem such as wet heath but ecological engineering provides an insight into defining the risk. Our results demonstrated that an ecologically acceptable outcome for a wet heath translocation can be achieved with careful design and implementation and sensitive management of the receptor site. However, it is essential to secure long-term hydrological and vegetation management in order to provide a sustainable outcome for long-term survival of a target wet heath community.

AB South Park is a high-elevation, semi-arid, treeless intermountain basin in central Colorado. A few extreme rich fens occur on the western margin and in the center of South Park where regional and local groundwater flow systems discharge to the ground surface. Over the past 40 years there has been extensive peat mining in these fens, but restoration methods have yet to be developed and successfully applied. The first part of this study compared the naturally reestablished vegetation on six mined peatlands with six pristine sites, while the second part of the study tested different revegetation techniques in 27 plots with varying depths to the water table. The six mined sites had only 30 plant species as compared with 122 species in the unmined sites; 43% of the species in the mined sites were not present in the undisturbed fens. Even after 40 years the sedges and willows that dominate the undisturbed sites were largely absent on the mined sites. The revegetation experiments seeded eight species, transplanted Carex aquatilis (water sedge) seedlings, transplanted rhizomes from six species, and transplanted four species of willow cuttings. Of the eight species seeded, only Triglochin maritima (arrowgrass) germinated and established seedlings. C. aquatilis seedlings, rhizome transplants of C. aquatilis, Kobresia simpliciuscula (elk sedge), and Juncus arcticus (arctic rush), and willow cuttings all had differing patterns of survival with respect to the annual maximum height of the water table. These results indicate that the dominant species can be successfully reintroduced to mined surfaces with the appropriate hydrologic conditions, but human intervention will be necessary to rapidly re-establish these species. The slow rate of peat accumulation means that restoration of the mined fens will require hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

DT Article
ID SOUTHERN FINLAND; MIRES; DECAY
AB Paludification intensity and pear deposition on Haukkasuo bog in southeastern Finland were studied with peat stratigraphic investigations by taking 79 samples for C-14 carbon dating and 164 volumetric samples. Feat formation of Haukkasuo, a concentric raised bog, began about 10 000 cal. BP. Lateral expansion has been largely controlled by the flat clayey floor, which has favoured rapid growth of the bog. During the first 400 years of its existence the bog covered one-fifth, and in the following 2000 years one-half, of its present extent. The long-term carbon accumulation rate averages 22.3 g C/m(2)/yr in the central part of Haukkasuo and 16.7 g C/m(2)/yr in its margins. The highest rates of carbon accumulation over 500-year periods were recorded in the central part of the bog in 6500-5500, 3500-2500 and 1500-0 cal. BP. The rate of vertical peat increment was higher than average in these periods, and the peat was mainly slightly humified and, when close to the surface, uncompacted. The rate of carbon accumulation was lowest in 5500-3500 and 2500-2000 cal. BP, when the rate of vertical growth was lower than average and the peat was more humified than average. The formation of peat, the rate of vertical peat increment and the succession of peat types in Haukkasuo have mainly been controlled by hydrological changes caused by local factors, although climatic factors might also be important. In particular, the formation of slightly humified peat in 3300-2700 cal. BP and during the last 1300 years can be related to humid climate.

AB Wetlands can either be net sinks or net sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), depending on the mean annual water level and other factors like average annual temperature, vegetation development, and land use. Whereas drained and agriculturally used peatlands tend to be carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) sources but methane (CH4) sinks, restored (i.e. rewetted) peatlands rather incorporate CO2, tend to be N2O neutral and release CH4. One of the aims of peatland restoration is to decrease their global warming potential (GWP) by reducing GHG emissions.
   We estimated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence over a period of 2 yr (1 July 2007-30 June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in northwest Germany. We set up three study sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (deeply drained, mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4-5 cuts per year); extensive grassland (rewetted, no fertilizer or manure, up to 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). Daily and annual greenhouse gas exchange was estimated based on closed-chamber measurements. CH4 and N2O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements were carried out every 34 weeks. Annual sums of CH4 and N2O fluxes were estimated by linear interpolation while NEE was modelled.
   Regarding GWP, the intensive grassland site emitted 564 +/- 255 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 850 +/- 238 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in the first (2007/2008) and the second (2008/2009) measuring year, respectively. The GWP of the extensive grassland amounted to -129 +/- 231 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 94 +/- 200 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), while it added up to 45 +/- 117 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and -101 +/- 93 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the near-natural site. In contrast, in calendar year 2008 GWP aggregated to 441 +/- 201 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), 14 +/- 162 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 31 +/- 75 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) for the intensive grassland, extensive grassland, and near-natural site, respectively.
   Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands. Extensively used grassland on moderately drained peat approaches the carbon sequestration potential of near-natural sites, although it may oscillate between being a small sink and being a small source depending on inter-annual climatic variability.

AB It is widely known that peatlands are a significant carbon (C) stock. Most peatlands are located in boreal and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere but some occur also at high altitude and, contrary to the first; their contribution in terms of carbon sequestration is far less studied. In the Alps, there are numerous small peatlands, which are threatened by increasing temperatures and an alteration of their water balance. The aim of this study was to investigate the carbon fluxes of a small-scale fen in the Alps over three years (2012-2014).
   During the study period, the peatland experienced a high interannual variation in weather conditions while it acted as a carbon source based on CO2 emissions (NEE: 180.7 +/- 65.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) for all three years. This was mainly due to the short net C uptake period (73 7 days) and high respiration. Ecosystem respiration and summer gross primary production were both very high compared to other peatlands around the world and compared to a nearby low productive grassland. In wintertime, the soil did not freeze, resulting in a slow decomposition of the organic matter. Low methane fluxes were recorded during a 10-month measurement campaign, for a total of 3.2 g C-CH4 m(-2) over the December 2013-September 2014 period. Our findings suggest that the interannual variability of temperature and soil water content exert a strong influence on the carbon balance of peatlands of the Alps and that could further worsen depending upon the magnitude of climate change.

AB Patterns in aquatic Clitellata assemblage composition are known to be driven by several environmental gradients, with water chemistry and substratum characteristics being particularly important. In this study we explored 54 isolated spring fens across the eastern Czech Republic and Slovakia. These fens varied in calcium and magnesium concentrations, forming a sharp and well defined environmental gradient running from calcium-poor acidic fens to extremely calcium-rich tufa-forming fens. We found that the main changes in clitellate species composition were controlled by this gradient, and/or total organic carbon content, over a wide area, including fen sites differing in other environmental conditions and historical development. However, this pattern was weakened in sites with a high organic matter content, which represented a second driver of change in assemblage composition along with water temperature. Three main types of fens were determined using cluster analysis based on clitellate assemblage composition. However, only the first type, which included tufa-forming fens, was found to fit with the previously established spring fen types based on vegetation (i.e. extremely mineral-rich fens with a tufa, brown-moss mineral-rich fens, mineral-rich Sphagnum fens and mineral-poor Sphagnum fens). The second clitellate type included sites with low temperatures and occasional desiccation, while the third type was characterised by high temperatures and trophy. Using eight environmental predictors, we were able to significantly explain changes in the population abundances of all 12 common species (i.e. recorded at 15-plus sites). The results from individual species modelling also suggests that an increase in organic matter content can trigger compositional shifts towards assemblages of common eurytopic tubificid species. Thus, human-induced eutrophication and negative changes in spring fen hydrology, mainly drying up, can represent a serious threat for species-specific assemblages of aquatic clitellates, especially at alkaline sites due to their isolated and spatially limited nature.

TI LATE GLACIAL AND HOLOCENE VEGETATION HISTORY AT GOVERNOR BOG, KING
   VALLEY, WESTERN TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Excavation of peat and clay filling a sink hole has provided a relatively long late glacial to Holocene pollen/vegetation record for the King Valley.  The record shows a change from alpine herbland, Microstrobos scrub and heath at 13 ka BP to Eucalyptus subalpine woodland.  Phyllocladus-Nothofagus rainforest succeeded after 12.5 ka BP but degenerated to scrub rainforest after 11 ka BP, when Lagarostrobos franklinii expanded.  The sequence of local changes occurred while the sink-hole lake was being rapidly infilled and converted to topogenous peat around 12 ka BP.
   Examination of the timing of changes in vegetation associations in other pollen profiles from different altitudes in western Tasmania indicates that many of the changes are non-synchronous and cannot be related directly to climatic events.  They probably reflect the effects of both biological and local environmental factors.
   The major regional climatic change from alpine to temperate conditions on the lowlands occurred ca. 13 ka BP.  Demonstration of non-synchronous changes in the late glacial to early Holocene pollen/vegetation associations at several sites contrasts with the view of Markgraf et al., who infer synchronous changes related to climate.  There are no indications in the pollen/vegetation sequence of either Allerod or Younger Dryas events in western Tasmania.

AB The patterned microtopography of subarctic mires generates a variety of environmental conditions, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) dynamics vary spatially among different plant community types (PCTs). We studied the CO2 and CH4 exchange between a subarctic fen and the atmosphere at Kaamanen in northern Finland based on flux chamber and eddy covariance measurements in 2017-2018. We observed strong spatial variation in carbon dynamics between the four main PCTs studied, which were largely controlled by water table level and differences in vegetation composition. The ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) increased gradually from the wettest PCT to the drier ones, and both ER and GPP were larger for all PCTs during the warmer and drier growing season 2018. We estimated that in 2017 the growing season CO2 balances of the PCTs ranged from -20 g C m(-2) (Trichophorum tussock PCT) to 64 g C m(-2) (string margin PCT), while in 2018 all PCTs were small CO2 sources (10-22 g C m(-2)). We observed small growing season CH4 emissions (< 1 g C m -2 ) from the driest PCT, while the other three PCTs had significantly larger emissions (mean 7.9, range 5.6-10.1 g C m(-2)) during the two growing seasons. Compared to the annual CO2 balance (-8.5 +/- 4.0 g C m(-2)) of the fen in 2017, in 2018 the annual balance (-5.6 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2)) was affected by an earlier onset of photosynthesis in spring, which increased the CO2 sink, and a drought event during summer, which decreased the sink. The CH4 emissions were also affected by the drought. The annual CH4 balance of the fen was 7.3 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) in 2017 and 6.2 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) in 2018. Thus, the carbon balance of the fen was close to zero in both years. The PCTs that were adapted to drier conditions provided ecosystem-level resilience to carbon loss due to water level drawdown.

AB Growth and decomposition of Sphagnum controls turnover of a large global store of soil organic carbon. We investigated variation in morphological and physiological traits of Sphagnum shoots, and related this variation to canopy variables relevant to peatland carbon cycling. We sampled Sphagnum along a bog plateau-swamp forest gradient and measured a suite of shoot traits and canopy variables. Major axes of variation were identified using principal component analysis and correlated with canopy variables such as growth, biomass and decomposition. We also examined scaling of shoot traits with one another and with canopy variables. Two distinct tradeoffs in shoot traits emerged. From dry to wet habitats, individual metabolic rates and capitulum size increased while numerical density decreased, leading to faster growth and elongation on an individual basis. From treed to open habitats, photosynthetic efficiency decreased and photosynthetic biomass increased, driving faster growth on an area basis and slower litter mass loss. The tradeoffs identified have important implications for peatlands undergoing climate-related changes in water and light availability. Sphagnum trait comparisons, combined with scaling analyses, offer a promising approach to understanding and predicting the effects of environmental change on peatland carbon cycling.

AB Carbon accumulation and storage is a defining characteristic of peatland ecosystems. Decomposition of peat releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to receiving waters and can be an important fraction of the peatland carbon budget, along with being an important modifier of downstream water quality. Changes in temperature and hydrological processes under future climate scenarios are expected to impact decomposition processes in peatlands with unclear ramifications for both the quantity and the quality of the DOC released. We experimentally examined the individual and interactive effects of increased temperature, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and lower water table position on peatland decomposition and the quantity and quality of porewater DOC in intact, replicated peat monoliths in a full factorial design. Decomposition rates and porewater DOC concentrations significantly increased under elevated temperature conditions; however, the quality of this carbon was variable, showing signs of both increased lability and recalcitrance. Lowered water table treatments also increased decomposition rates, although the high water conditions prompted greater porewater DOC concentrations and lability. It is expected that elevated decomposition rates under future climate scenarios will alter porewater DOC quantity in peatlands; however, we suggest that contributions from the aboveground system are needed to fully understand changes in DOC quality and subsequent ecosystem dynamics.

AB Losses of dry mass of the dominant litter, a standard litter (Carer aquatilis), and cellulose (Whatman filterpaper) were examined by the litter bag technique in three fens (riverine sedge fen, lacustrine sedge fen, floating sedge fen) and two marshes (lacustrine marsh, riverine marsh). Local Carex lasiocarpa had a similar mass loss in marshes (mean of 63%) and in fens (mean of 59%) over 456 days in 1993 and 1994. Typha latifolia decomposed at a similar rate as the local C. lasiocarpa in the lacustrine marsh, whereas Salix pedicellaris decomposed significantly slower than the local C lasiocarpa in the floating sedge fen (FSF). Overall, the mass loss of the standard plant litter was not significantly different between the fens (mean of 72%) and the marshes (mean of 69%). However, cellulose decomposed significantly faster in the marshes (mean of 67%) than it did in the fens (mean of 28%) over 100 days in 1994. Decay of Carer aquatilis was best related to ammonium (NH4+) (r = 0.73) in fens and the water level relative to the peat surface (r = 0.74) in marshes. Standard plant litter decomposition was best explained by surface water concentrations of NH4+(r = 0.89) in fens and by soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP)(r = 0.89) in marshes. Cellulose decomposition was best related to SRP in fens (r = 0.70) and marshes (r = 0.64) alike. An arithmetic/logarithmic decay model most accurately described plant mass losses during decomposition (59%) compared to the widely used logarithmic/arithmetic model (12%).

AB Peatlands of all latitudes play an integral role in global climate change by serving as a carbon sink and a primary source of atmospheric methane; however, the microbial ecology of mid-latitude peatlands is vastly understudied. Herein, next generation Illumina amplicon sequencing of small subunit rRNA genes was utilized to elucidate the microbial communities in three southern Appalachian peatlands. In contrast to northern peatlands, Proteobacteria dominated over Acidobacteria in all three sites. An average of 11 bacterial phyla was detected at relative abundance values >1%, with three candidate divisions (OP3, WS3 and NC10) represented, indicating high phylogenetic diversity. Physiological traits of isolates within the candidate alphaproteobacterial order, Ellin 329, obtained here and in previous studies indicate that bacteria of this order may be involved in hydrolysis of poly-, di- and monosaccharides. Community analyses indicate that Ellin 329 is the third most abundant order and is most abundant near the surface layers where plant litter decomposition should be primarily occurring. In sum, members of Ellin 329 likely play important roles in organic matter decomposition, in southern Appalachian peatlands and should be investigated further in other peatlands and ecosystem types.

The sequence evolved from a lacustrine phase (between 12,700 cal yr BP and 12,000 cal yr BP) into an ombrotrophic peat bog (12,000-7600 cal yr BP), accumulated in drier climate conditions, with a subdued water table. Subsequently, wetter conditions occurred, with an elevated water table until 6220 cal yr BP, when the peat bog was flooded and peat accumulation paused, a depositional hiatus being marked by a clayey layer. Peat started to accumulate again ca. 100 years ago, under drier conditions. The peat bog records the local and regional responses to rapid climate change events that occurred at 11,400-11,250, 10,500-10,200, 9400-9200, and 8300-8250 cal yr BP. Our quantitative reconstruction of hydrological changes, as well as pre-existing ones for this region, show similar conditions to those that occurred in Central-Eastern Europe between 12,700 and 7600 cal yr BP, but differ from those that occurred between 7600 and 6220 cal yr BP, suggesting a distinct regional character of Middle Holocene climate conditions in Romania.

Nusantara Bioscience 8: 201-206. Peatland forest is one of ecosystems that are susceptible to the alterations of water regimes. Our previous study demonstrated that hydrologic conditions are predominant variables in determining carbon respiration rates from peat soils. However, we have limited empirical measures of how hydrologic conditions (i. e., soil water table) affect the carbon respirations. A study had been conducted to ascertain the effects of water table levels on soil CO2 respirations of West Kalimantan coastal forested and bare peatland. We simulated natural intact peat core condition by designing 25 of "a double bucket" water level experiment using 5 levels of water tables (0-40cm) and measure soil CO2 respiration at soil surfaces. Results showed that water table levels significantly affected soil CO2 respiration, as well as peat microclimate conditions. Results also demonstrated that forest canopy had significant effects on reducing peat CO2 respiration through its function in maintaining site-environment conditions compared to bare peatland site. This study reveals that it is important to maintain peatland water level close to peat surface and to maintain forest/vegetation covered on peatlands to reduce soil CO2 emissions.

AB Despite the importance of peatlands as a major store of sequestered carbon and the role of fungi in releasing sequestered C, we know little about the community structure of fungi in peatlands. We investigated these across a gradient of naturally regenerating peatland vegetation using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of fragments of the fungal rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Significant changes in the fungal community structure of peat samples at different stages of regeneration were observed, which relate to the composition of the vegetation recolonizing these sites. Cloning and sequence analysis also demonstrated a potential shift in the relative abundance of the main fungal phyla. Some of the clones identified to genus level were highly related to fungi known to play a role in the degradation of plant litter or wood in similar ecosystems and/or form mycorrhizal associations. In addition, several fungal isolates highly related to peat clones were obtained, and their enzymic capacity to degrade structural plant tissues was assessed. Together, these results suggest that the fungal community composition of peat may be an important indicator of the status of regeneration and potential carbon sequestration of cutover peatlands.

AB Drainage, vegetation removal and harvesting, and vegetation restoration have a profound effect on carbon cycling in peatlands. Through laboratory incubations of 114 peat samples collected from the surface layer and just above and just below the water table at 13 sites, we examined the potential for carbon dioxide (CO2) production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and methane (CH4) production under anaerobic conditions. CO2 production rates ranged from 0.04 to 1.05 mg g(-1) d(-1) under aerobic conditions and 0.01 to 0.29 mg g(-1) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions. Rates of CO2 production were generally smallest in the lower parts of the profiles and at the recently restored sites where deep peat was exposed at the surface; they were largest in the freshly-formed surface peat at the undisturbed bog and older restoration sites where a strong cover of vegetation had developed. The CO2 production potentials were negatively correlated with the Von Post Index of decomposition, and aerobic: anaerobic production ratios averaged 4.3:1. Largest rates of anaerobic CH4 production occurred in samples close to the soil surface with fresh peat accumulation and a high water table, and smallest rates were in samples from the subsurface of sites with a low water table. Anaerobic CH4 production was significantly positively correlated with aerobic and anaerobic CO2 production. These production potentials show that drainage, harvesting, and restoration change the ability of the peat profile to produce and emit CO2 and CH4.

AB With the increase in the drainage and extraction of peat for horticultural, agricultural and energy purposes worldwide, there is an increased pressure to restore hydrological conditions essential to the re-establishment of Sphagnum mosses and, therefore, carbon sequestration. Measurements of ecosystem CO2 were conducted Lit a recently restored vacuum harvested bog in Eastern Quebec, Canada. The peatland was restored by blocking the drainage networks to return optimal water table positions for the growth of Sphagnum mosses and the spreading of a dense straw mulch layer to reduce evaporative losses and stabilize the surface for the moss re-growth. However, the return Of the moss species is a gradual process and previous studies have suggested that initially the carbon loss from the system actually increase as the mulch decomposes. We examined old and new mulch CO2 production in lab incubations and scaled these results to the ecosystem level in order to determine if mulch decomposition is impeding the net carbon sink function of this peatland. At mean growing season temperatures fresh mulch was observed to release 151.5 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day, while older mulch released 145 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day. Furthermore, under moist conditions the CO2 release increased for all mulches. However, contrary to most assumptions, Q(10) values for all mulches decreased with increasing temperatures and were greater for older mulch than for fresh. Thus, in the short term, the application of a surface straw mulch layer can have significant effects on the carbon balance of a restored peatland. Due to the decomposition of this mulch layer over the first several seasons of restoration, the peatland became a larger source of CO2, despite the increase in production of a re-emerging vegetation layer.

AB Ice-wedge polygon mires feature a micro-relief of dry ridges, shallow wet depressions, deeper wet troughs and transitional sites, resulting in a local mosaic of vegetation. The correct recognition of these landscape elements in palaeoecological studies of peat sections requires insight about the suitability of proxies and their potential for palaeoecological reconstruction in order to reconstruct vegetation and wetness patterns as well as dynamics. This paper analyses a 105.5cm long peat section with a base dating to about 4000calyr BP from an ice-wedge polygon mire near Kytalyk (NE Siberia). Pollen, macrofossils, testate amoebae, geochemistry and sediment properties were analysed in order to compare the suitability of these proxies to reconstruct past surface wetness. The proxies show similar wetness trends. Pollen and geochemistry data did not always permit wetness reconstruction, the former because many pollen types do not allow the identification of taxa at a low taxonomic resolution, the latter because later taphonomic processes modify chemical variables in deeper peat layers. Macrofossils provided the most detailed wetness reconstruction, because they could be identified to genera or species, for which the moisture requirements are accurately known from their present-day distribution in ice-wedge polygons. All proxies, except geochemistry, show an obvious change from wet to dry conditions at around 20cm depth. However, as the proxies sometimes show contradictory results, a multi-proxy approach is preferable over a single proxy interpretation as it allows the reconstruction of environmental development in a broader palaeoecological context.

AB The Zoige peatland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in the world, is currently experiencing unprecedented water stress due to climate change and human activities. However, the consequences for emissions of greenhouse gases have not been well studied. We conducted a 40-month in situ field experiment (including deep, shallow and control water table treatments) to examine the effect of drainage on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). The results showed that drainage significantly increased the emission rates and the total cumulative emissions of CO2 (i.e., ecosystem respiration) and N2O, and reduced CH4 emissions. However, under drained conditions, the cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O increased significantly during the growing season (May to September) only, whereas the cumulative emissions of CH4 decreased significantly during both the growing season and the non-growing season (October to April). In addition, drainage significantly increased the biomass of aerobic bacteria and methanotrophs. These results indicate that emissions of greenhouse gases in the Zoige peatland are sensitive to short-term drainage and that future studies should consider the response of greenhouse gas fluxes to environmental changes in the non-growing season.

AB Forty percentage of UK peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, which has caused serious peat wastage and associated greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)). In this study, we evaluated potential trade-offs between water-table management practices for minimizing peat wastage and greenhouse gas emissions, while seeking to sustain romaine lettuce production: one of the most economically relevant crop in the East Anglian Fenlands. In a controlled environment experiment, we measured lettuce yield, CO2, CH4 fluxes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from an agricultural fen soil at two temperatures (ambient and +2 degrees C) and three water-table levels (-30 cm, -40 cm and -50 cm below the surface). We showed that increasing the water table from the currently used field level of -50 cm to -40 cm and -30 cm reduced CO2 emissions, did not affect CH4 fluxes, but significantly reduced yield and increased DOC leaching. Warming of 2 degrees C increased both lettuce yield (fresh leaf biomass) and peat decomposition through the loss of carbon as CO2 and DOC. However, there was no difference in the dry leaf biomass between the intermediate (-40 cm) and the low (-50 cm) water table, suggesting that romaine lettuce grown at this higher water level should have similar energetic value as the crop cultivated at -50 cm, representing a possible compromise to decrease peat oxidation and maintain agricultural production.

AB Recent advances in peatland restoration techniques have succeeded in establishing Sphagnum moss on the remnant cutover peat surface following peat extraction: however, evaluating restoration success remains a key issue. We argue that a Sphagnum-dominated peatland can only be considered functionally 'restored' once organic matter accumulation has achieved a thickness where the mean water table position in a drought year does not extend into the underlying formerly cutover peat surface. Here we monitor the spatio-temporal development of organic matter accumulation in a new peat layer for the first 8 years following the restoration of a Quebec peatland and couple a simple acrotelm carbon accumulation model and ecohydrological model to assess peatland restoration success.
   We determined that organic matter accumulation increased from 2.3 +/- 1.7 cm 4 years post-restoration to 13.6 +/- 6.5 cm 8 years post-restoration. For comparison, at an adjacent non-restored section of the peatland organic matter accumulation was significantly lower (p<0.001 for all years), with mean thicknesses of 0.2 +/- 0.6 and 0.8 +/- 1.2 cm for 24 and 28 years post-extraction, respectively. Given the mean summer water deficit at the site (-64 mm), our ecohydrological modeling results suggest that a 19-cm-thick moss layer would be required to offset the water table decrease induced by the summer water deficit. Given the current rate of organic matter accumulation, net primary productivity and the new peat layer decomposition rates determined using litter bags, we estimate it will take 17 years post-restoration to accumulate a 19-cm moss layer. Consequently, we argue that successful peatland restoration may be achieved in the medium-term and that our simple modeling approach can be useful in assessing the long-term impact of restoration on atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration.

AB We use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes from a Kenai Peninsula, Alaska fen spanning the late-glacial and Holocene to enhance our understanding of peatland hydrology and nutrient cycling. We find that isotopic values for carbon and nitrogen are lighter in the late-glacial and early Holocene (-28 to -34 parts per thousand and 0 to -4 parts per thousand, respectively) than the remainder of the record. The light delta C-13 value corresponds with submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation during the late-glacial, suggesting high respired carbon input. Similarly, light delta N-15 values imply that nitrogen is derived from sediment and groundwater sources. Early Holocene delta(13) values ranging from -30 parts per thousand to -34 parts per thousand infer high recycled carbon uptake from methanogenesis, related to the warm climate and the wet swale environment. A shift to heavier delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic values similar to 9600 cal yr BP coincides with a change in the lithology to Sphagnum-dominated peat, indicative of peat accumulation above the water table. A shift to lighter values from 5500 to 4200 cal yr BP coincides with a period of glacial recession related to warmer conditions, whereas a subsequent period of heavier values is correlative with glacial advance culminating at 3000 cal yr BP, suggesting that the hydrology of this peatland is closely linked with the glacial meltwater. delta N-15 remains near 0 parts per thousand, relatively close to the atmospheric value of delta N-15, throughout the Holocene, suggesting that the fen has been supported by N-fixation. We propose that groundwater on the Kenai lowlands was fed by subglacial meltwater, and the warm early Holocene summers resulted in high glacial ablation and groundwater recharge, sustaining a high Swanson Fen water table. Cooler temperatures resulted in a decrease of glacial meltwater input at the close of the early Holocene. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change and associated sea level rise will likely affect coastal ecosystems and lead to more frequent inundations. Plants are an important control for methane (CH4) emissions in peatlands because the metabolism of the living plant can either enhance or attenuate CH4 emissions and plant litter supplies an easily available carbon source for methanogenesis. Here we compare the contribution of various dominant plant species to methane emissions in a degraded, rewetted coastal brackish fen at the southern Baltic Sea coast in Northeast Germany. We analyse one year of bi-weekly static closed chamber data gathered at measurement spots that were located in different mono-dominant vegetation stands (Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C.Gmel.) Palla, Carex acutiformis Ehrh.). Furthermore, data on water level, water temperature, conductivity (sulphate), and several peat characteristics were recorded. Generally, the annual methane emissions were low with an average across vegetation stands of 14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), which we related to high decomposition of peat after drainage and to relatively low water levels in summer. Nevertheless, methane emissions varied between different vegetation types with significantly higher methane fluxes (31.8 +/- A 5.7 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1)) from Bolboschoenus maritimus stands compared to Carex acutiformis and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani stands (4.3 +/- A 1.2 and 5.7 +/- A 2.4 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), respectively). None of the environmental variables that have been recorded can explain this difference. Thus, vegetation composition seems to be an important driver for methane emissions in coastal brackish fens and may therefore be crucial with regard to recreation measures.

AB The drainage of a riparian peatland interspersed with organic and mineral substrates in Northern Germany has led to subsidence morphology due to mineralisation, initial settlement and shrinkage processes causing cultivation problems and yield declines. To explain the relevancy of shrinkage to changes of the surface morphology and soil properties, organic and mineral substrates were analysed with regard to (1) shrinkage potential (i.e. the maximum shrinkage), (2) shrinkage curve, (3) actual in situ shrinkage and (4) irreversible shrinkage proportions.
   The investigated substrates are sedge peat, peat-clay, half-bog and alluvial sand of Fibric Limnic Histosols (Drainic) and a glacial clay for comparison. The methods used to obtain the shrinkage curves include the consideration of crack formation due to desiccation, as digital photography and image analysis were used in addition to height change measurements. To characterise the actual in situ shrinkage, continuous records of the soil matric potential for a 4.5-year period at two different intensively drained Histosols (moderately and deeply drained: mean groundwater table 0.6 and 1.7 m under ground level) were accomplished in four depths (15, 40, 70, 100 cm).
   The measured shrinkage potentials vary between 2% (alluvial sand) and 65% (peat-clay). The sedge peat and peat-clay are characterised by distinct higher shrinkage potentials compared to the glacial clay and show distinct proportional shrinkage. It has to be pointed out that the soil volume loss partly even exceeds the loss in water volume. The sedge peat does not reach residual or zero shrinkage but shows distinct structural shrinkage at initial desiccation. For the moderately drained site, matric potentials reached up to -60 kPa in summer in 15-cm depth, whilst capillary rise almost prevented desiccation of deeper zones. For the deeply drained site, summer desiccation reached deeper zones as well (matric potential up to -50 kPa in 40-cm depth) due to absent capillary rise. In the range of actually occurring maximum desiccation, the half-bog and peat-clay with high decomposed organic matter are particularly affected by shrinkage with volume decreases of 10-14%, in contrast to the fibred sedge peat with only 4%. When uniquely shrunken substrates will be re-wetted, distinct irreversible shrinkage proportions reaching between 18% and 31% subsequent to drying to a matric potential of -50 kPa and re-saturation were measured.
   Particularly, the organic-rich substrates appeared as characteristically sensitive to soil shrinkage. Contrary to mineral substrates, they lack in solid particles, leading, along with high hydraulic stresses due to dominantly finer pores, to intense volume decreases after desiccation. These substrates therefore partly also lack in residual or zero shrinkage, and the soil volume loss can even exceed the water loss due to shrinkage. Accordingly, the alterations of soil properties, e.g. conductivities, are especially pronounced.
   The calculated proportion of actual in situ shrinkage (0.5 to 1 dm) to total subsidence of the investigated peatland is rather low for the deeply drained site in comparison to initial settlement (2-3 dm) and long-term active mineralisation (e.g. 4 dm in 40 years, mineralisation rate 1 cm year(-1)) but accelerates the latter because of enhanced aeration due to crack formation. Irreversible shrinkage is one reason why re-wetted fen peats do not retrieve their initial volume as well as their initial physical and hydraulic properties. Thus, a re-wetting of drained fen peats can only preserve the present condition.
   To impede the further impairment of riparian peatlands, it is necessary to maintain a near-surface water table particularly throughout the summer months, when high desiccation occurs, leading to a spatially differentiated proportion of initial settlement, shrinkage and mineralisation, causing subsidence morphology. Our recommendation is a drainage depth of less than 60 cm to enable pasture or grassland land use and to minimise mineralisation as well as structure formation in the (sub)soil.

AB Karkevagge, an alpine ecosystem in the subarctic, has been the subject of scientific study for half a century. We investigated the relationship of its vegetation to soil properties. At the lowest elevations, on stable portions of the landscape dominated by Betula and Empetrum, are found Spodosols developed in glacio-fluvial sediments. Cryosaprists occur in scattered bedrock depressions with bog-type vegetation. Cryofluvents are found in flood-prone areas covered by dwarf-willow thickets. Intermediate elevations have meadow-type vegetation with Cryofluvents on floodplains and on lower colluvial slopes, Cryaquents in wetter areas, and Cryorthents on steeper soliflucted slopes. Above that, on steep, west-facing Dryas-covered colluvial slopes, soils are Ca-rich Eutrocryepts and Haplocryolls. The highest-elevation soils are infertile with poor horizonation, despite their possible antiquity, and vegetation that is largely cryptogams. Dystrocryepts occur on more stable alpine locations; Cryorthents on soliflucted areas; and Haploturbels, with shallow permafrost, above 1400 m. Measured annual soil temperatures range from +2.4degreesC at a Dryas site to -3.4degreesC at 1585 to at an alpine cryptogam site. Vegetation distribution in Karkevagge is related to climatic factors, which are controlled by elevation and landscape position, and edaphic factors, which control soil moisture and nutrient availability.

AB Question: Flood disturbance in peatlands can create temporary or permanently submerged areas where tolerant species may persist and replace intolerant species over time. Fen moss species and communities occur along a hummock-hollow gradient in natural ecosystems, but their resistance and resilience to different durations of submergence has yet to be tested. We asked what are the short- and long-term effects of submergence duration on four common boreal fen moss species and the implications for ecosystem resilience?
   Location: Rich fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
   Methods: To examine the effect of submergence duration on fen moss species and communities, we harvested and submerged monoculture plugs dominated by Hamatocaulis vernicosus, Sphagnum warnstorfii, Tomentypnum nitens and Aulacomnium palustre in the field under rich fen water for 1-8 weeks. After submergence, we planted the plugs in bare peat at the same site to evaluate the short- and long-term responses of each species and changes in moss community composition over time.
   Results: We found that moss species response to duration of submergence is not strictly related to their occurrence along a hummock-hollow gradient and that tolerant species maintain or restore moss cover. H. vernicosus was most tolerant to submergence of all durations, whereas S. warnstorfii was nearly eliminated by submergence. Over the long term, more tolerant species replaced less tolerant species, increasing diversity and moss community resilience. Overall, moss communities without S. warnstorfii were resilient to 4 weeks of submergence because T. nitens and H. vernicosus maintained dominance or established where the cover of less resilient species was limited.
   Conclusions: We show that moss species varied in their responses to submergence duration, resulting in shifts in community composition and long-term effects on community resilience with longer durations of submergence. This provides insight into how moss communities provide stability to peatlands in response to disturbance through shifts in community composition that support tolerant dominant species.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated large carbon (C) stocks, acting as a long-term atmospheric C sink since the last deglaciation. How these C-rich ecosystems will respond to future climate change, however, is still poorly understood. Furthermore, many northern peatlands exist in regions underlain by permafrost, adding to the challenge of projecting C balance under changing climate and permafrost dynamics. In this study, we used a paleoecological approach to examine the effect of past climates and local disturbances on vegetation and C accumulation at a peatland complex on the southern Seward Peninsula, Alaska over the past similar to 15 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). We analyzed two cores about 30 m apart, NL10-1 (from a permafrost peat plateau) and NL10-2 (from an adjacent thermokarst collapse-scar bog), for peat organic matter (OM), C accumulation rates, macrofossil, pollen and grain size analysis.
   A wet rich fen occurred during the initial stages of peatland development at the thermokarst site (NL10-2). The presence of tree pollen from Picea spp. and Larix laricinia at 13.5-12.1 ka indicates a warm regional climate, corresponding with the well-documented Bolling-Allerod warm period. A cold and dry climate interval at 12.1-11.1 ka is indicated by the disappearance of tree pollen and increase in Poaceae pollen and an increase in woody material, likely representing a local expression of the Younger Dryas (YD) event. Following the YD, the warm Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) is characterized by the presence of Populus pollen, while the presence of Sphagnum spp. and increased C accumulation rates suggest high peatland productivity under a warm climate. Toward the end of the HTM and throughout the mid-Holocene a wet climate-induced several major flooding disturbance events at 10 ka, 8.1 ka, 6 ka, 5.4 ka and 4.7 ka, as evidenced by decreases in OM, and increases in coarse sand abundance and aquatic fossils (algae Chara and water fleas Daphnia). The initial peatland at permafrost site (NL10-1) is characterized by rapid C accumulation (66 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), high OM content and a peak in Sphagnum spp. at 5.8-4.6 ka, suggesting the lack of permafrost. A transition to extremely low C accumulation rates of 6.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) after 4.5 ka at this site suggests the onset of permafrost aggradation, likely in response to Neoglacial climate cooling as documented across the circum-Arctic region. A similar decrease in C accumulation rates also occurred at non-permafrost site NL10-2. Time-weighted C accumulation rates are 21.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for core NL10-1 during the last similar to 6.5 ka and 14.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for core NL10-2 during the last similar to 15 ka. Evidence from peat-core analysis and historical aerial photographs shows an abrupt increase in Sphagnum spp. and decrease in area of thermokarst lakes over the last century, suggesting major changes in hydrology and ecosystem structure, likely due to recent climate warming.
   Our results show that the thermokarst-permafrost complex was much more dynamic with high C accumulation rates under warmer climates in the past, while permafrost was stabilized and C accumulation slowed down following the Neoglacial cooling in the late Holocene. Furthermore, permafrost presence at local scales is controlled by both regional climate and site-specific factors, highlighting the challenge in projecting responses of permafrost peatlands and their C dynamics to future climate change.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought is projected to increase within the boreal region under future climatic conditions. Peatlands are widely considered to regulate water loss under drought conditions, increasing surface resistance (r(s)) and reducing evaporative losses. This maintains peat moisture content, increasing the resilience of these globally important carbon stores. However, the magnitude and form of this important negative feedback response remains uncertain. To address this, we monitored the response of r(s) to drought within four peat cores under controlled meteorological conditions. When the water-table was dropped to a depth of 0.30m and the humidity reduced to <= 40%, a step shift in r(s) from similar to 50 s m(-1) up to 1000 s m(-1) was observed within burned and unburned peat, which virtually shuts down evaporation, limiting water loss. We show that measured near-surface tension cannot be used to directly calculate this transition in peat surface resistance. However, empirical relationships that account for strong vertical variations in tension through the near-surface and/or disequilibrium between pore air and near-surface pore water pressure provide the potential to incorporate this negative feedback response into peatland ecohydrological models. Further observations are necessary to examine this response under dynamic atmospheric conditions. We suggest that the link between surface temperature and evaporation provides potential to further examine this feedback in either burned peatlands or peatlands with a low vascular vegetation cover.

AB Peatland surface motion is a key property of peatland that relates to condition. However, field-based techniques to measure surface motion are not cost-effective over large areas and long time periods. An alternative method that can quantify peatland surface motion over large areas is interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Although field validation of the accuracy of this method is difficult, the value of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) as a means of quantifying peat condition can be tested. To achieve this, the characteristics of InSAR time series measured over an 18-month period at 22 peatland sites in the Flow Country northern Scotland were compared to site condition assessment based on plant functional type and site management history. Sites in good condition dominated by Sphagnum display long-term stability or growth and a seasonal cycle with maximum uplift and subsidence in August-November and April-June, respectively. Drier and partially drained sites dominated by shrubs display long-term subsidence with maximum uplift and subsidence in July-October and February-June, respectively. Heavily degraded sites with large bare peat extent display subsidence with no distinct seasonal oscillations. Seasonal oscillation in surface motion at sites with a dominant nonvascular plant community is interpreted as resulting from changes in seasonal evaporative demand. On sites with extensive vascular plants cover and falling water table, surface oscillations are interpreted as representing sustained drawdown during the growing season and subsequent recharge in late winter. This study highlights the potential to use InSAR to characterize peatland condition and provide a new view of the surface dynamics of peatland landscapes.

AB At high latitudes, winter climate change alters snow cover and, consequently, may cause a sustained change in soil frost dynamics. Altered winter soil conditions could influence the ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) and, in turn, provide feedbacks to ongoing climate change. To investigate the mechanisms that modify the peatland CO2 exchange in response to altered winter soil frost, we conducted a snow exclusion experiment to enhance winter soil frost and to evaluate its short-term (1-3 years) and long-term (11 years) effects on CO2 fluxes during subsequent growing seasons in a boreal peatland. In the first 3 years after initiating the treatment, no significant effects were observed on either gross primary production (GPP) or ecosystem respiration (ER). However, after 11 years, the temperature sensitivity of ER was reduced in the treatment plots relative to the control, resulting in an overall lower ER in the former. Furthermore, early growing season GPP was also lower in the treatment plots than in the controls during periods with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) >= 800 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), corresponding to lower sedge leaf biomass in the treatment plots during the same period. During the peak growing season, a higher GPP was observed in the treatment plots under the low light condition (i.e. PPFD 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) compared to the control. As Sphagnum moss maximizes photosynthesis at low light levels, this GPP difference between the plots may have been due to greater moss photosynthesis, as indicated by greater moss biomass production, in the treatment plots relative to the controls. Our study highlights the different responses to enhanced winter soil frost among plant functional types which regulate CO2 fluxes, suggesting that winter climate change could considerably alter the growing season CO2 exchange in boreal peatlands through its effect on vegetation development.

AB Fungi play a pivotal role in the carbon sequestration potential of boreal peatlands through the process of decomposition. As such, climate-driven changes in the diversity and community composition of peatland fungal communities could have substantial impacts on carbon release from these ecosystems, especially in subsurface peat that represents an important global carbon stock. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing of rDNA to examine fungal communities after 18 months in intact peatland mesocosms subjected to conditions associated with Canada's future climate, including: warming, elevated atmospheric CO2 and lowered water table. Warming was the main driver of changes in fungal communities across three depths of the peat profile with both Ascomycotaand Basidiomycota-dominated groups becoming more homogenous under warming conditions. Specific changes in fungal functional groups, however, were temperature dependent with potential cellulose decomposers and mycorrhizal root-associated fungi from Basidiomycota dominant under warming of +4 degrees C, whereas there was a prevalence of potential lignocellulose decomposers and mycorrhizal root-associated fungi from Ascomycota under +8 degrees C warming. These climate change-induced shifts in the structure of fungal communities in favour of recalcitrant compound decomposers observed across a depth gradient, may reduce long-term carbon storage of boreal peatlands under future climate change scenarios.

DE coal sedimentology; coal quality; partings; ash; sulphur
ID DEPOSITIONAL MODELS
AB A detailed sedimentological investigation of the Jurassic-Cretaceous Mist Mountain Formation in the southern Canadian Cordillera was undertaken to determine what, if any, sedimentological factors control coal quality and seam geometry. In the Line Creek area, the Mist Mountain Formation is divisible into two units based on abundance and lateral continuity of facies. The lower unit consists of alternating laterally extensive coal seams and thick, widespread channel sandstones interspersed with crevasse splay and flood plain facies sediments. The lower unit was deposited in an interdeltaic coastal plain environment protected from marine incursion by the beach ridge-dune sandstones of the underlying Morissey Formation. The upper unit of the Mist Mountain Formation was deposited in a distal alluvial-fluvial flood plain environment and has similar facies to the lower unit but coal seams and channel sandstones are less laterally continuous and thinner than in the lower unit. Channel sandstones decrease in number and thickness up-section, and are replaced by an increasing abundance of coal Seams, flood plain and crevasse splay facies sediments. Seam geometry and ash data indicate that elastic sedimentation had only Limited influence on pear (coal) accumulation in the Mist Mountain Formation. While the geometry of the seams reflects the proximity of under- and overlying channel sandstones, neither abundance nor mineralogy of the coal ash reflects changes in surrounding elastic sediments. The Mist Mountain Formation peat mires were thus not obviously influenced by coeval fluvial activity. Characteristics of the lower unit suggest pear mires developed only during hiatus in elastic deposition, whereas upper unit coals appear to have formed in at least partially domed mires contemporaneous with elastic sedimentation. The vitrinite content:of the coal increases up-section at the expense of semifusinite, possibly reflecting an increase in the proportion of arborescent vegetation in the mire with time and a lower susceptibility to fires.

AB The profile distribution, generation, and emission of CO2 and CH4 in the bog soils of four experimental plots in European Russia and Eastern Siberia have been studied using original experimental procedures. The effective diffusion coefficients of gases were determined in peatlands for the entire range of aeration porosity; upward and downward vertical fluxes were evaluated. The total production of gases by the peatland during the vegetation period was estimated from the kinetic balance model of their behavior in the soil. It was shown that the generation intensity of greenhouse gases in bogs can significantly (by 10-20%) exceed their emission from the surface. The information about the gas-generating function of bog is used for the determination of their carbon sequestration capacity.

DE blanket mire; degradation; erosion; gully development
ID EROSION; EXTENT
AB This paper provides the first systematic assessment of blanket mire degradation in the east Cheviot Hills, Northumberland. The extent of erosion is mapped over a 32 km(2) area of peat. Erosion affects 37% of the blanket peat. Erosion forms consist of anastomosing (7%), linear (21%) and dendritic (9%) gully systems together with peat slides (<1%). Topography is the primary influence on gully system pattern. Spatial variations in gully form can be partly explained by position in the stream network (stream order) and local variations in the depth of peat. A sequential scheme of gully development is described. Gullies evolve initially through a phase of rapid downcutting to the peat base, followed by lateral erosion and gully widening becoming dominant through a process of roughly parallel wall retreat. As gully width increases re-deposition of peat occurs and revegetation occurs on the gully floor. Comparative photography reveals that gully patterns have been stable over the past 32 years and in some areas for over 70 years. It is possible that gully systems in places are in excess of 500 years old.

AB Vegetation and hydrology are important controlling factors in peatland methane dynamics. This study aimed at investigating the role of vegetation components, sedges, dwarf shrubs, and Sphagnum mosses, in methane fluxes of a boreal fen under natural and experimental water level draw-down conditions. We measured the fluxes during growing seasons 2001-2004 using the static chamber technique in a field experiment where the role of the ecosystem components was assessed via plant removal treatments. The first year was a calibration year after which the water level draw-down and vegetation removal treatments were applied. Under natural water level conditions, plant-mediated fluxes comprised 68%-78% of the mean growing season flux (1:73 +/- 0:17 gCH(4) m(-2) month 1 from June to September), of which Sphagnum mosses and sedges accounted for one-fourth and three-fourths, respectively. The presence of dwarf shrubs, on the other hand, had a slightly attenuating effect on the fluxes. In water level drawdown conditions, the mean flux was close to zero (0:03 +/- 0:03 gCH(4) m(-2) month(-1)) and the presence and absence of the plant groups had a negligible effect. In conclusion, water level acted as a switch; only in natural water level conditions did vegetation regulate the net fluxes. The results are relevant for assessing the response of fen peatland fluxes to changing climatic conditions, as water level drawdown and the consequent vegetation succession are the major projected impacts of climate change on northern peatlands.

AB Little attention has been devoted to the investigation of the formation and functioning of ecotones at the interfaces between the upland and riparian zones. The margins of riparian mires act as redox geochemical barriers. Such biogeochemical hot spots retain elements that have leached From upland soils, favouring the growth of mesomorphic plants in hydromorphic soils. This paper aims to clarify the correspondence of vegetation borders to horizontal redox barriers of a Northern European moraine plain in Estonia.
   24 random transects were surveyed on the moraine plain, sampled across sharp soil moisture boundaries as proxies of redox barriers. The shifts in vegetation perpendicular to the boundaries were investigated. Curves of Euclidean distance were computed by moving a 20 m split-window along transects. The curves showed peaks of high dissimilarity a few metres below the redox barriers in the sites of natural soil moisture. In artificially drained sites, the relict redox barriers poorly corresponded to the vegetation borders. We conclude that in the studied moraine plain, the vegetation boundaries between riparian mires and uplands correspond to the redox barriers. The same can be set as a hypothesis for Northern European moraine plains. Related ecotones can be observed on the footslopes, revealing redox barrier in the landscape and related hot spots in cultural landscapes. In field margins, the redox barriers and corresponding ecotones occur below cultivation terraces. The ecotones may represent functional boundaries for delineating wetlands. Man-made drainage removes soil redox barriers and corresponding vegetation boundaries, making the landscape uniform and therefore vulnerable to disturbances. As a management implication, footslope ecotones should he preserved in their natural condition. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier Gmbh. All rights reserved.

AB The balance of primary production and decomposition in northern peatlands may shift due to climate change, with potential feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nitrogen availability will modulate this shift, but little is known about the drivers of soil nitrogen dynamics in these environments. We used a long-term (9 years) open top chamber (OTC) experiment in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat bog in sub-arctic Sweden, to test for the interactive effects of spring warming, summer warming and winter snow addition on soil nitrogen fluxes, potential activities of nitrogen cycle enzymes, and soil microbial community composition. These simultaneous measurements allowed us to identify the level of organization at which climate change impacts are apparent, an important requirement for developing truly mechanistic understanding. Organic-N pools and fluxes were an order of magnitude higher than inorganic-N pools and fluxes. Summer warming approximately doubled fluxes of soil organic nitrogen and ammonia over the growing season. Such a large increase under 1 degrees C warming is unlikely to be due to kinetic effects, and we propose that it is linked to an observed seasonal decrease in microbial biomass, suggesting that N flux is driven by a substantial late-season dieback of microbes. This change in N cycle dynamics was not reflected in any of the measured potential peptidase activities. Moreover, the soil microbial community structure was apparently stable across treatments, suggesting a non-specific microbial dieback. Our results show that in these widespread peat bogs, where many plant species are capable of organic-N uptake, organic soil N dynamics are quantitatively far more important than the commonly studied inorganic-N dynamics. Understanding of climate change effects on organic soil N cycling in this system will be advanced by closer investigation of the seasonal dynamics of the microbial biomass and the input of substrates that maintain it.

AB High water tables (WT) stabilise peatland carbon (C) through regulation of biogeochemical processes. The impact of peatland WT on ecosystem function, including C exchange, alters over time, and the factors that cause some peatlands to display resilience and others to undergo degradation are poorly understood. Here we use CO2 flux measurements, measured by eddy covariance, to compare ecosystem function between two raised bogs; one drainage-affected, with a deep and fluctuating water table and the other near-natural, with a shallow and stable water table. The drainage-affected bog was found to be a moderate sink for CO2 (69 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), which was 134 g C m(-2) yr(-1) less than the near-natural bog (203 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Greater ecosystem productivity has allowed the drainage-impacted bog to act as a CO2 sink despite higher ecosystem respiration; most likely due to an increase in photosynthetic capacity caused by expansion of ericaceous shrub cover. The tolerance of the vegetation community, particularly the main peat former Empodisma robustum (Restionaceae), to low and fluctuating WT appears to have been key in allowing the site to remain a sink. Despite the current resilience of the ecosystem CO2 sink, we found gross primary production to be limited under both high and low water tables, even in a year with typical rainfall. This is best explained by the limited physiological ability of ericaceous shrubs to tolerate a fluctuating WT. As such we hypothesise that if the WT continues to drop and become even more unstable, then without further vegetation change, a reduction in gross primary production is likely which may in turn cause the site to become a source for CO2.

AB Landslides have emerged as one of the most important disturbance agents in mountainous ecosystems. in mountainous regions in Japan, the locations of old landslides often have heterogeneous vegetation that is peculiar to landslide areas. However, little is known about how and why vegetation patterns differ among landslide sites within a region. In this study, I describe the variations in vegetation at different landslide sites within a region and examine the possible causes of the regional diversity of vegetation at these sites. I classified the vegetation on 1703 landslides by interpreting aerial photos of the 1421 km(2) study region. Nine types of vegetation were classified. The results show that the heterogeneity of the vegetation increased with the maximum snow depth, and the number of vegetation types on landslide bodies increased with latitude and altitude. Among the 1703 landslides studied herein, 62 included mires (wetlands). Sites with mires were concentrated in areas with heavy snowfall and certain lithologies, such as ultramafic rocks and nonalkaline mafic volcanic rocks. My analysis using Random Forest, a machine-learning algorithm, indicates that maximum snow depth and summer temperatures had the greatest impact on the number of vegetation types and mires on the landslide bodies. The results of this study suggest that snowy conditions have long-term effects on vegetation structure and diversity on old landslide sites.

AB The humification process is one of the least understood and most intriguing aspects of humus chemistry and vital to the global carbon (C) cycle. Peatlands represent the largest terrestrial reservoirs of organic C and support a unique biodiversity, but are also natural archives of climate and environmental changes. In fact, cores from ombrotrophic peatlands are commonly used to reconstruct environmental impacts by human activities during the past decades, centuries and millennia. Understanding the extent to which bogs may serve as reliable archives is of paramount importance in order to ensure that chronological information about natural and human-induced environmental changes are effectively preserved in peat deposits rather than irretrievably affected by humification. Structural changes of the organic matter which constitutes peat are often evaluated by various indirect measures of the degree of humification. Numerous methods and proxies have been proposed and used during the last century, often providing contrasting or inconsistent results. Here, we tested multiple physical, chemical, spectroscopic and thermal approaches using peat samples collected from nine bogs on four continents. Despite the different climatic conditions, botanical composition, depth and age of peat formation, we show that the H/C ratio is the simplest, most widely valid and cost-effective humification proxy and should find universal application to multi-proxy geochemical and paleoenvironmental studies. Moreover, we show that, on average, threequarters of the organic C in the studied bogs is in a comparatively undecomposed state, and thus vulnerable to climate changes.

AB Plant species of the intermediate life strategy type are characteristic for species-rich grasslands, which are sensitive to changes in the level of disturbance. Germination and early establishment of seedlings is expected to be the most crucial stage, limiting the successful colonization of appropriate sites. Valeriana dioica is a typical plant of calcareous fens, which are dependent on regular suppression of strong competitors by means of moderate land use. It is endangered in many parts of Central Europe, including Lower Austria. We studied the effects of light, temperature and pretreatment (cold stratification) on the germination success of V. dioica seeds and the role of litter produced by different competitors on the early establishment of seedlings. We tested seeds from five populations differing in the level of competition for light and considered also the morphological variability of propagules and maternal plants. We found that V. dioica is able to germinate without light. It showed high germination percentages both under high summer temperatures independent of cold stratification and at low temperatures, but only after the stratification. Litter produced by dicotyledonous forbs was less hampering for the seedlings than that of small sedges or grasses. Valeriana dioica possesses a broad regeneration niche and is able to use gaps for germination and establishment both in spring and in summer. It reproduces successfully in herb-dominated fen meadow vegetation but disappears from reed communities. This study demonstrates the significant plasticity of the regeneration niche for a species with an intermediate life strategy and also stresses the importance of gaps for its reproduction.

AB In the near future, climate change will increasingly affect export of carbon (C) from peatlands. Terminal mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a source of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, CO2, and methane, CH4) for the atmosphere, and may contribute to climatic warming. Quantitative understanding of sources, dispersion pathways, and degradation of DOC produced in peat bogs is important for predictions of global change dynamics. Here we explore the potential of combining C isotope ratios of isotopically stratified, Pb-210-dated peat deposits and C isotope ratios of DOC exported via runoff to determine the depth and age of the predominant DOC source. In a poorly drained, Sphagnum-derived peat bog in the Czech Republic, delta C-13 values of bulk peat increased downcore to a depth of 10 cm. The C isotope signatures of fresh DOC and bulk peat differ only insignificantly, because C isotope changes in maturating peat require multiple microbial modifications of the organic matter taking place over relatively long time periods. Based on 41 samplings of runoff, 70% of exported DOC originated from peat substrate 1 to 10 years old, 2-10 cm deep. Recently photosynthesized DOC (< 1 year old) contributed about 5% to runoff DOC, whereas approximately 25% of exported DOC was derived from peat layers older than 10 years. Because biogenic methane at the study site contained isotopically extremely light C (delta C-13 values of -64.2 to -53.2 parts per thousand), it would seem reasonable to expect residual DOC following partial decomposition to become isotopically heavier. A short-term laboratory incubation of wet peat samples from four depths at mid-summer temperatures indicated more complicated delta C-13 systematics. The initial limited amount of DOC in the leachate was isotopically heavy, compared to bulk peat, but after 18 days delta C-13(DOC) became lower, converging to the C isotope signature of bulk peat. Such delta C-13 systematics can be explained by multi-step isotope effects associated with different reaction rates during substrate decomposition. Limitations of using the combination of within-bog delta C-13 systematics and Pb-210 dating of recent peat accretion are discussed. Horizontal heterogeneity in substrate C isotope signatures is one of the main sources of uncertainty of this approach to DOC source apportionment in peaty soils.

AB Milled peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere are frequently restored in order to mitigate negative effects of climate change and to benefit biodiversity. The aims of this study are to analyse the development of vegetation on milled peatlands in Estonia after restoration using the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT), relate the plant functional type cover with peat chemical factors, and study correlations between bryophyte and vascular plant cover on sites with different vegetation composition. Nutrient-poor (NP) Viru and nutrient-rich (NR) Ohtu milled peatlands in Northern Estonia were restored via MLTT between 2006 and 2008. Plant species cover was determined annually or biannually from 2009 to 2018, on permanent plots established during the restoration of both sites. Plant functional type cover was assessed in relation to peat chemical properties and time since restoration. The nutrient status of the restoration site plays a major role in vegetation succession, even if similar restoration methods have been applied. Vascular plant cover, especially evergreen shrubs, increased with time since restoration, while bryophyte (mainly Sphagnum) cover increased at the NP site and decreased at the NR site. At the NR site bryophyte cover decreased with increasing vascular plant cover, while the opposite pattern was observed at the NP site.

AB We measured year-round landscape-scale methane (CH4) flux in a boreal bog from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique. The objectives of the study were to investigate the controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season and to quantify the annual CH4 flux budget. The daily average growing season water table (WT) ranged from -0.33 to - 0.08 m in 2014 and from -0.36 to - 0.08 m in 2015. Strong seasonal variability in the daily average CH4 fluxes was observed in both 2014 and 2015, ranging from near zero before May to a peak of above 20 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the middle-late August in 2014 and in the early-middle September in 2015. Soil temperature at 50 cm and water table exerted interactive impact on the seasonal variation in the daily average growing season CH4 flux in both years. Soil temperature at 1 cm was negatively related to CH4 flux when water table dropped more than 0.25 m below the peat surface in 2015 growing season, suggesting that the seasonal variation in CH4 flux was dominated by the variation due to CH 4 oxidation. During the non-growing season, the daily variation in CH4 fluxes was mostly related to friction velocity in both years. In addition, daily average CH4 flux was linearly related to net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) when daily NEE was negative (Le., days with CO2 uptake larger than ecosystem respiration), but there was no correlation between them when NEE was positive (days with ecosystem respiration dominated over CO2 uptake) during the growing season. We found that this boreal bog acted as a small CH4 source of 3.7 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) from May 2014 to April 2015 and 3.1 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) from May 2015 to April 2016. These values were at the lower end of the range of CH4 emission rates reported for boreal peatlands. Non-growing season CH4 emissions accounted for 41% (the first study year) and 39% (the second study year) of the annual emissions, highlighting the importance of non-growing season CH4 emissions in estimating the annual CH4 budget and the feedback to climate.

AB This study was conducted at 17 peatlands in the Czech Republic mined either by the traditional block-cut method or industrially. Phytosociological releves of 5 x 5 m were carried out in representative parts of successional stages in disturbed peatlands. Age and environmental characteristics were assessed for each releve (position of water table, water pH, substratum chemistry, geographical area) or each locality (altitude, average annual temperature and precipitation). Phytosociological releves recorded in natural vegetation, representing the respective target stages, were included into some analyses. Altogether, 210 releves were analysed by the DCA ordination. Separately, releves from milled and block-cut sites were elaborated by CCA with marginal and partial effects calculated. Despite the great variability in vegetation, especially among industrially harvested sites, there is a general tendency for peatland vegetation to recover spontaneously, especially at traditionally harvested sites, which all were, however, older than 50 years. The vegetation at the younger industrially harvested sites exhibited only a tendency to recover. All environmental variables investigated had at least some significant effect on the vegetation pattern, among them, soil pH, water table, nitrates, successional age and geographical location were most important. Abiotic site factors together and geographical location appeared to be more important in determining species composition than successional age.

AB Biomass and carbon accumulation into tree stand and distribution between tree stand components was studied in two undrained and four drained Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated peatland stands in southern Finland. On the drained sites, the amount and distribution of biomass above-ground was rather similar to pine-dominated stands on upland sites when drainage age of the site was thought to represent the stand age. The proportion of estimated below-ground biomass of the total pine biomass was ca. 30% on all sites studied which is mon than on upland sites with supposedly similar growth potential. Due to the bigger amount of below-ground biomass, there is, on average, more biomass and thus also carbon in relation to stem volume in peatland stands than upland stands, when southern boreal Scots pine stands are examined. Equations for estimating the amount of carbon accumulating in the tree stand along with increasing stem volume are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Sea-level rise coupled with land subsidence from wetland drainage exposes increasingly large areas of coastal peatlands to seawater intrusion. Seawater contains high concentrations of sulfate (SO42-), which can alter the decomposition of organic matter thereby releasing organic and inorganic solutes from peat. In this study, a flow-through reactor system was used in order to examine the transport of SO42- through peat as well as its effect on solute release. Moderately-decomposed fen peat samples received input solutions with SO42- concentrations of 0, 100, 700, and 2,700mg L-1; sample effluent was analyzed for a variety of geochemical parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) as well as the concentrations of major cations and anions. The input solution remained anoxic throughout the experiment; however, no signs of a pronounced SO42- reduction were detected in the effluent. SO42- transport in the fen peat resembled non-reactive bromide (Br-) transport, indicating that in the absence of SO42- reduction the anion may be considered a conservative tracer. However, slightly elevated concentrations of DOC and TDN, associated with raised SO42- levels, suggest the minor desorption of organic acids through anion exchange. An increased solute release due to stimulated decomposition processes, including SO42- reduction, was observed for samples with acetate as an additional marine carbon source included in their input solution. The solute release of peats with different degrees of decomposition differed greatly under SO42--enriched conditions where strongly-decomposed fen peat samples released the highest concentrations of DOC, DIC and TDN.

AB 1. We separated the effects of plant species controls on decomposition rates from environmental controls in northern peatlands using a full factorial, reciprocal transplant experiment of eight dominant bryophytes in four distinct peatland types in boreal Alberta, Canada. Standard fractionation techniques as well as compound-specific pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry were used to identify a biochemical mechanism underlying any interspecific differences in decomposition rates.
   2. We found that over a 3-year field incubation, individual moss species and not micro-environmental conditions controlled early stages of decomposition. Across species, Sphagnum mosses exhibited a trade-off in resource partitioning into metabolic and structural carbohydrates, a pattern that served as a strong predictor of litter decomposition.
   3. Decomposition rates showed a negative co-variation between species and their microtopographic position, as species that live in hummocks decomposed slowly but hummock microhabitats themselves corresponded to rapid decomposition rates. By forming litter that degrades slowly, hummock mosses appear to promote the maintenance of macropore structure in surface peat hummocks that aid in water retention.
   4. Synthesis. Many northern regions are experiencing rapid climate warming that is expected to accelerate the decomposition of large soil carbon pools stored within peatlands. However, our results suggest that some common peatland moss species form tissue that resists decomposition across a range of peatland environments, suggesting that moss resource allocation could stabilize peatland carbon losses under a changing climate.

AB Rewetting of drained fens is necessary to stop further soil degradation and to reestablish important ecological functions. However, substantial changes of peat characteristics in the upper soil layers, due to drainage and land use, could counteract their recovery as nutrient-poor systems for an unknown period. We assessed the importance of altered peat properties, such as the degree of peat decomposition and the amount of redox-sensitive phosphorus (P) compounds, for P mobilization in different degraded fens. An experimental design involving 63 intact peat cores from fens with varying drainage and land-use histories was developed to quantify the mobilization of P, as well as that of iron (Fe), ammonium, carbon dioxide, and methane, all indicators of organic-matter decomposition and/or P-releasing processes. We found that net P release rates in peat cores with highly decomposed peat (range: 0.1-52.3 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were significantly correlated to the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive compounds and the molar Fe: P as well as Al:P ratios of peat. We conclude that the following general rules apply for P mobilization in rewetted fens: (1) elevated levels of P release rates and P concentrations in pore water up to three orders of magnitude larger than under natural reference conditions can only be expected for rewetted fens whose surface soil layers consist of highly decomposed peat; (2) peat characteristics, such as the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive Fe(III) compounds (positive correlation) and molar ratios of Fe: P or Al: P (negative correlations), explain the high range of P release rates; and (3) a critical P export to adjacent lakes or rivers can only be expected if molar Fe: P ratios of highly decomposed peat are less than 10.

AB Rewetting drained peatlands creates favorable reduced conditions for denitrification, but, the potential of restored peatlands to act as N2O sink is poorly characterized. We monitored N2O emissions in rewetted peatlands converted to rice paddies with a range of soil organic carbon (SOC) (6%, 11%, and 23%) during the growing season. Negative N2O emissions were repeatedly observed in all sites, which were not affected by nitrogen fertilization at 80 kg N ha(-1). The highest consumption rates amounted to 8.2 tones CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1), 32% of the average CO2 emissions from drained peat soils. Porewater N2O concentrations were frequently less than the calculated in situ N2O equilibrium concentrations, suggesting diffusional constraints on atmospheric N2O into pore water. Redox potentials were correlated to N2O emission rates (r(2) = 0.40, p < 0.01). However, relatively higher frequencies and magnitudes of negative N2O emissions were mostly observed during the period of water draw down for rice harvest activities, especially in the field with the highest SOC. It is likely that reducing water depth by drainage reduced the diffusional barrier for atmospheric N2O into the soil. In all, the capacity of rewetted peatlands to act as atmospheric N2O sinks can be significant and seemingly can be managed through manipulating water depths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Piping and woody plants in peatlands: Cause or effect?

LA English
DT Article
ID GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; BLANKET PEAT; RUNOFF; INFILTRATION; PIPEFLOW
AB This paper presents, for the first time, evidence to show that Calluna species are one causative factor of piping in blanket peat catchments. Ground-penetrating radar survey on 960 plots illustrated that piping was prevalent throughout blanket peats. However, soil pipe occurrence was significantly higher where bare peat (149 pipes/ km) or Calluna (87 pipes/ km) were present compared to other species (67 pipes/ km). A case study catchment where there was an altitudinal limit to Calluna provided some control over potential factors that may lead to an association between piping and Calluna. Under the controlled conditions of topographic index, peat depth, and water table, piping was greater under the Calluna-covered peat than under other vegetation covers. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that 10 years worth of rainfall was enough to almost double the proportion of macropore flow occurring in recently colonized Calluna peatlands. This suggests that given enough water and time, the woody Calluna plants result in water being preferentially channeled through the upper peat. Improvements are therefore required in our understanding of the relationships between peatland plant nutrient and water supply and the feedbacks between ecosystem functioning and landform development. These results are also important given the propensity to encourage Calluna growth for game bird enhancement in many northern peatlands.

AB There are fears that global warming will lead to degradation of peatlands, higher emissions of greenhouse gases from peat, and accelerated warming. Anaerobic decomposition of organic soils produces methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. Two peat bogs differing in mean annual temperature, Velke Darko (VD, Czech Republic, 7.2 A degrees C), and Stor myran (SA, Sweden, 4.0 A degrees C), were selected for a comparative study of how organic soils in different climatic zones will respond to warmer and drier conditions. Twenty peat cores from each bog were incubated in growth chambers. Under present-day summer conditions, VD produced 14 times more CH4 than SA. Two different warming scenarios were used. Peat-core replicates were kept at temperatures of 11 versus 16 A degrees C, and 11 versus 22 A degrees C. From 11 to 16 A degrees C, the CH4 production slightly decreased at SA, and slightly increased at VD. From 11 to 22 A degrees C, the CH4 production increased 9 times at SA, but slightly decreased at VD. After an 8-month incubation, peat cores under drying conditions (water table at -14 cm) were compared to samples with original water table (-2 cm). Drying conditions led to a steeper reduction in CH4 production at VD, compared to SA. The CH4 production decreased more than 100 times at VD. Then, the combined effect of simultaneous warming and drying at 11 and 22 A degrees C was studied. We did not find any significant effect of interactions between increasing temperature and decreasing water table level. Overall, the warmer site VD responded more strongly to the simulated climate change than the colder site SA.

AB Testate amoebae consist of a group of protists producing protective external coats (tests), which potentially allows them to be used in palaeoecological studies. They are known to be good indicators of several ecological parameters such as water chemistry, moisture and water table level in substrate, and especially peat moisture. Because of their strong dependence on environmental variables it is assumed that each bog microform (e.g. hummock, hollow) is characterized by a different assemblage of testate amoebae. The distribution of testate amoebae assemblages in peat bog of north-eastern Estonia was studied along the gradient from hummock to hollow in the upper 30 cm of the peat layer along a transect of 10 m. The composition and abundance of testate amoebae communities were analyzed in the samples collected (peat sampler, 5 cm diameter) from each sample point (at a distance of 2.5 m from each other) from hummock to hollow.
   Indicatory species specific to certain bog microforms (representing a set of environmental variables) were found, as well as other species typical for individual environment variables such as depth, peat decomposition degree, and distance to water table or local vegetation. Data analysis showed that distinct bog microforms are better described by abundance of particular testate amoebae species in peat than by species proportions in total abundance of the assemblage. The frequency of occurrence of species with dry environment preference correlates well with arboreal and Calluna vulgaris pollen and high degree of decomposition of peat; it all indicates a dryer environment and possibly is referring to a hummock microform. Amphitrema flavum correlates well with Sphagnum; this correlation increases with the A. flavum shift downwards from Sphagnum up to 4 cm.
   Testate amoebae assemblages in different bog microforms, even within 10 m, are distinctly different. To pay attention to possible changes of bog microforms in time is therefore crucial for reconstructing the palaeohydrological history of bogs.

Four local pollen assemblage zones as reflecting the dominant plant communities of the surrounding territories during the Holocene were assigned. Analysis of plant macrofossils resulted in the identification of the stages of floating mat vegetation development in the Late Holocene. The atypical sequence of peat deposition, with transition mire peat located above raised bog peat, was identified. Sediment accumulation rate was calculated according to radiocarbon dating.

AB Store Mosse (the 'Great Bog' in Swedish) is one of the most extensive bog complexes in southern Sweden (similar to 77 km(2)), where pioneering palaeoenvironmental research has been carried out since the early 20th century. This includes, for example, vegetation changes, carbon and nitrogen dynamics, peat decomposition, atmospheric metal pollution, mineral dust deposition, dendrochronology, and tephrochronology. Even though organic matter (OM) represents the bulk of the peat mass and its compositional change has the potential to provide crucial ecological information on bog responses to environmental factors, peat OM molecular composition has not been addressed in detail. Here, a 568-cm-deep peat sequence was studied at high resolution, by attenuated reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) in the mid-infrared region (4000-400 cm(-1)). Principal components analysis was performed on selected absorbances and change-point modelling was applied to the records to determine the timing of changes. Four components accounted for peat composition: (i) depletion/accumulation of labile (i.e. carbohydrates) and recalcitrant (i.e. lignin and other aromatics, aliphatics, organic acids and some N compounds) compounds, due to peat decomposition; (ii) variations in N compounds and carbohydrates; (iii) residual variation of lignin and organic acids; and (iv) residual variation of aliphatic structures. Peat decomposition showed two main patterns: a long-term trend highly correlated to peat age (r = 0.87), and a short-term trend, which showed five main phases of increased decomposition (at similar to 8.4-8.1, similar to 7.0-5.6, similar to 3.5-3.1, similar to 2.7-2.1 and similar to 1.6-1.3 ka) - mostly corresponding to drier climate and its effect on bog hydrology. The high peat accumulation event (similar to 5.6-3.9 ka), described in earlier studies, is characterized by the lowest degree of peat decomposition of the whole record. Given that FTIR-ATR is a quick, non-destructive, cost-effective technique, our results indicate that it can be applied in a systematic way (including multicore studies) to peat research and provide relevant information on the evolution of peatlands.

AB Historically, northern peatlands have functioned as a carbon sink, sequestering large amounts of soil organic carbon, mainly due to low decomposition in cold, largely waterlogged soils(1,2). The water table, an essential determinant of soil-organic-carbon dynamics(3-10), interacts with soil organic carbon. Because of the high water-holding capacity of peat and its low hydraulic conductivity, accumulation of soil organic carbon raises the water table, which lowers decomposition rates of soil organic carbon in a positive feedback loop. This two-way interaction between hydrology and biogeochemistry has been noted(3,5-8), but is not reproduced in process-based simulations(9). Here we present simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical soil model with peat depths that are continuously updated from the dynamic balance of soil organic carbon. Our model reproduces dynamics of shallow and deep peatlands in northern Manitoba, Canada, on both short and longer timescales. We find that the feedback between the water table and peat depth increases the sensitivity of peat decomposition to temperature, and intensifies the loss of soil organic carbon in a changing climate. In our long-term simulation, an experimental warming of 4 degrees C causes a 40% loss of soil organic carbon from the shallow peat and 86% from the deep peat. We conclude that peatlands will quickly respond to the expected warming in this century by losing labile soil organic carbon during dry periods.

AB Large-scale peat extraction, in Finland and elsewhere, typically takes place on rather small extraction sites but has major impacts on surrounding aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The environmental conditions prior to drainage (baseline conditions) must be quantified in a statutory environmental impact assessment (EIA), but this is generally difficult due to lack of historical data. In this study, we developed and tested a method for EIA based on a reference area approach and remote sensing. The method calculates the normalized difference vegetation index in preextraction and postextraction periods using Landsat images of affected areas and reference surrounding areas. In a case study, we applied the method to assess changes after peat extraction at a site in northern Finland. The peat extraction area showed significant transformation from peatland vegetation to bare soil. Adjacent areas downstream and upstream were also affected by extraction. These results indicate that our method is a useful tool for EIA of peatland drainage.

AB During the last decades an increasing area of drained peatlands has been rewetted. Especially in Germany, rewetting is the principal treatment on cutover sites when peat extraction is finished. The objectives are bog restoration and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The first sites were rewetted in the 1980s. Thus, there is a good opportunity to study long-term effects of rewetting on greenhouse gas exchange, which has not been done so far on temperate cutover peatlands. Moreover, Sphagnum cultivating may become a new way to use cutover peatlands and agriculturally used peatlands as it permits the economical use of bogs under wet conditions. The climate impact of such measures has not been studied yet.
   We conducted a field study on the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide at three rewetted sites with a gradient from dry to wet conditions and at a Sphagnum cultivation site in NW Germany over the course of more than 2 years. Gas fluxes were measured using transparent and opaque closed chambers. The ecosystem respiration (CO2) and the net ecosystem exchange (CO2) were modelled at a high temporal resolution. Measured and modelled values fit very well together. Annually cumulated gas flux rates, net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) and global warming potential (GWP) balances were determined. The annual net ecosystem exchange (CO2) varied strongly at the rewetted sites (from -201.7 +/- 126.8 to 29.7 +/- 112.7 gCO(2)-C m(-2) a(-1)) due to differing weather conditions, water levels and vegetation. The Sphagnum cultivation site was a sink of CO2 (-118.8 +/- 48.1 and -78.6 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2) a(-1)). The annual CH4 balances ranged between 16.2 +/- 2.2 and 24.2 +/- 5.0 gCH(4)-C-2 a(-1) at two inundated sites, while one rewetted site with a comparatively low water level and the Sphagnum farming site show CH4 fluxes close to 0. The net N2O fluxes were low and not significantly different between the four sites.
   The annual NECB was between -185.5 +/- 126.9 and 49.9 +/- 112.8 gCO(2)-Cm(-2)a(-1) at the rewetted sites and -115.8 +/- 48.1 and -77 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1) at the Sphagnum cultivating site. The annual GWP100 balances ranged from -280.5 +/- 465.2 to 644.5 +/- 413.6 gCO(2)-eq.m(-2) a(-1) at the rewetted sites. In contrast, the Sphagnum farming site had a cooling impact on the climate in both years (-356.8 +/- 176.5 and -234.9 +/- 145.9 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1)). If the carbon exported through the harvest of the Sphagnum biomass and the additional CO2 emission from the decay of the organic material is considered, the NECB and GWP100 balances are near neutral.
   Peat mining sites are likely to become net carbon sinks and a peat accumulating ("growing") peatland within 30 years of rewetting, but the GWP100 balance may still be positive. A recommended measure for rewetting is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground.
   Sphagnum farming is a climate-friendly alternative to conventional commercial use of bogs. A year-round constant water level of a few centimetres below ground level should be maintained.

AB Net primary production in wetlands of continental western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba) is mapped of wetlands, with peatlands representing and summarized by wetland type and ecoregion. The region contains 405 300 km(2) 90.1% of all wetlands. Based on a regional synthesis of published values, of net primary production, shrubby swamp and marsh wetlands produce more biomass annually through the process of net primary production than peatlands. Different peatland types appear to sequester similar amounts of plant biomass on an annual basis, with the exception of permafrost bogs that sequester less. Wetland net primary production for the region is calculated as 2.1 x 10(14) g yr(-1) of plant biomass, with 73.5% sequestered in peatlands. This is equivalent to 9.95 x 10(13) g yr-1 of carbon. Provincially this carbon is partitioned into 50%, for Manitoba, 30% for Alberta, and 20% for Saskatchewan. ON or the last 1000 years, an average of only 5% of this biomass (and carbon) accumulate as peat, with most lost through the process of decomposition. When the annual amount of carbon that accumulates a, peat is compared to the amount emitted provincially as anthropogenic greenhouse gases, wetlands present in each of the provinces accumulate 4% (Alberta), 8% (Saskatchewan), and 62% (Manitoba) of the emitted carbon annually. Wetlands in continental western Canada are a significant, active biosphere carbon sink following accumulation patterns of the last one thousand years. Future changes, particularly in fire frequency or intensity. may alter this accumulation pattern.

AB Black carbon (BC) is produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and emissions are influenced by human activities. Due to its refractory nature and long half-life times, BC contributes to carbon sequestration in soils. Here, we investigated BC concentrations and storage in peatlands of the Changbai Mountains (Northeast China) and reconstructed historical trends of deposition fluxes from four peat cores. Results showed that there were no significant differences of BC deposition fluxes in different cores sampled at similar altitudes, but BC deposition fluxes at low altitudes were stronger influenced by human activities than those at high altitudes. During the last 150 years, more BC was emitted by increasing anthropogenic sources, and therefore the BC deposition fluxes accordingly increased. Total BC storage in peat soils of the Changbai Mountains was estimated to 1.61 Tg (5.13 Gg C km(-2)) and a deposition flux of 3.30 Gg yr(-1) of BC was calculated. The high BC deposition fluxes the fact that about 5% of carbon storage in peatland could be regarded as BC support that BC represents an important fraction of carbon storage in peatland ecosystems.

AB Digger's Creek Bog, an Empodisma minus-Callistemon pityoides-Sphagnum cristatum shrubby subalpine peat bog, alt. c. 1690 m, not far below local altitudinal tree-line, began development > 10 000 years before present as an Astelia sp.-Carex alpine soak. Surrounding vegetation was a grassy alpine herbfield with many Asteraceae, Apiaceae and Gentianella diemensis, corresponding to the regional Club Lake Zone C, dated to the same period. Astelia died out c. 6500 years before present approximately at the Club Lake C/D 1 boundary, marked by spread of Pomaderris in subjacent montane forests. Thereafter, shrubs, mainly Myrtaceae and Epacridaceae, and Restionaceae (Empodisma and Restio australis) dominated the bog. Epacris cf. paludosa and C. pityoides seem to have been the earliest shrubs to invade, Baeckea, probably B. gunniana, and Richea continentis reaching maximum prominence 5000-3000 years before present. Sphagnum was uncommon until recently. Regional arboreal pollen enable comparisons with other sites in south-eastern Australia but immigration of the tree-line species Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. niphophila (snowgum) is not well expressed in the pollen spectra. Surface and near-surface counts of this species are higher than at any preceding time, and correspond most closely to surface counts in adjacent young snowgum woodland. The co-occurrence of weed pollens, probably associated with the late 19th and early 20th century practice of summer pasturing stock on the alpine-subalpine tract, suggests that pasturing and burning, responsible for widespread severe fires on this range, led both to the formation of dense even-aged snowgum woodland that had been open and patchy at this altitude, and a spread of Sphagnum on the bog surface.

AB The heterogeneous Boreal Shield forest in Canada is one of the most extensive pristine forests remaining in the world and is being intensely harvested. We studied the spatial variability of organic and inorganic N cycling processes in three Boreal Shield catchments in northwestern Ontario for 2 years before and I year following clearcutting. Net N mineralization rates were similar among upland conifer, upland deciduous and peatland stands, ranging from negligible to 150 mg kg(-1) in the forest floor/peat soils and -30 to 40 mg kg(-1) in mineral soils of the upland stands over the growing season. Net nitrification rates were generally negative, < 10% of net mineralization rates, and similar among the landscape units. Reciprocal transplants of forest floor/peat and mineral soil from the uncut and cut stands indicated that changes in environmental conditions in the clearcut influenced net N mineralization by 50-fold and nitrification rates by nine-fold in the peatlands but not the coniferous uplands. Net inorganic N cycling rates measured the 1st year following clearcutting were within the natural range of variability, which is consistent with previous studies in northern coniferous and aspen forests. In contrast with the literature however, no difference in soil dissolved organic N mobilization rates (peatland stand range: 0.2 to 4.8 mg kg(-1) d(-1); upland coniferous stand range: -0.1 to 2.3 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) were found between uncut and recently clearcut stands.

AB Large tracts of arctic and subarctic peatlands are underlain by permafrost. These peatlands store large quantities of carbon (C), and are currently under severe threat from climate change. The aim of this study was to determine the size and organic chemistry of the easily degradable C pool in permafrost peatlands and link the functional organic chemistry to temperature and moisture controls of greenhouse gas emissions. First, we used a combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments to assess the influence of increased temperature and flooding on CO2 and CH4 emissions from sixteen permafrost peatlands in subarctic Sweden and Canada. Second, we determined the variation in organic matter chemistry and the associated microbial community composition of the peat active layer, with depth using quantitative C-13 solid-state NMR and molecular biomarkers respectively. We demonstrate that the peat organic chemistry strongly controls CO2 release from peat and that ca. 35 and 26% of the peat organic matter, at the Swedish and Canadian peatlands sites, respectively, is easily degradable by heterotrophic microorganisms. In contrast to CO2, CH4 emissions were decoupled from peat functional organic chemistry. We show a strong relationship between the microbial community structure and the peat organic chemistry suggesting that substrate type and abundance is an important driver of microbial composition in sub-arctic peatlands. Despite considerable variation in peat chemistry and microbial community composition with depth the temperature sensitivity was comparable throughout the active layer. Our study shows that functional organic chemistry controls both soil respiration rates and the composition of the microbial community. Furthermore, if these peatlands collapse and flood on thawing, they are unlikely to become large emitters of CH4 without additional input of labile substrates. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands store an immense pool of soil carbon vulnerable to microbial oxidation due to drought and intentional draining. We used amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to (i) examine how fungi are influenced by depth in the peat profile, water table and plant functional group at the onset of a multiyear mesocosm experiment, and (ii) test if fungi are correlated with abiotic variables of peat and pore water. We hypothesized that each factor influenced fungi, but that depth would have the strongest effect early in the experiment. We found that (i) communities were strongly depth stratified; fungi were four times more abundant in the upper (10-20 cm) than the lower (30-40 cm) depth, and dominance shifted from ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophs and endophytes with increasing depth; (ii) the influence of plant functional group was depth dependent, with Ericaceae structuring the community in the upper peat only; (iii) water table had minor influences; and (iv) communities strongly covaried with abiotic variables, including indices of peat and pore water carbon quality. Our results highlight the importance of vertical stratification to peatland fungi, and the depth dependency of plant functional group effects, which must be considered when elucidating the role of fungi in peatland carbon dynamics.

AB Drought conditions are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the climate changes, representing a threat to carbon sequestered in peat soils. Downstream water treatment works are also at risk of regulatory compliance failures and higher treatment costs due to the increase in riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) often observed after droughts. More frequent droughts may also shift dominant vegetation in peatlands from Sphagnum moss to more drought-tolerant species. This paper examines the impact of drought on the production and treatability of DOC from four vegetation litters (Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus, Molinia caerulea and Sphagnum spp.) and a peat soil. We found that mild droughts caused a 39.6% increase in DOC production from peat and that peat DOC that had been exposed to oxygen was harder to remove by conventional water treatment processes (coagulation/flocculation). Drought had no effect on the amount of DOC production from vegetation litters; however large variation was observed between typical peatland species (Sphagnum and Calluna) and drought-tolerant grassland species (Juncus and Molinia), with the latter producing more DOC per unit weight. This would therefore suggest the increase in riverine DOC often observed post-drought is due entirely to soil microbial processes and DOC solubility rather than litter layer effects. Long-term shifts in species diversity may, therefore, be the most important impact of drought on litter layer DOC flux, whereas pulses related to drought may be observed in peat soils and are likely to become more common in the future. These results pro-vide evidence in support of catchment management which increases the resilience of peat soils to drought, such as ditch blocking to raise water tables.

AB We characterized dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition throughout the peat column at the Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota and tested the hypothesis that redox oscillations associated with cycles of wetting and drying at the surface of the fluctuating water table correlate with increased carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen turn over. We found significant vertical stratification of DOM molecular composition and excitation-emission matrix parallel factor analysis components within the peat column. In particular, the intermediate depth zone (similar to 50cm) was identified as a zone where maximum decomposition and turnover is taking place. Surface DOM was dominated by inputs from surface vegetation. The intermediate depth zone was an area of high organic matter reactivity and increased microbial activity with diagenetic formation of many unique compounds, among them polycyclic aromatic compounds that contain both nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms. These compounds have been previously observed in coal-derived compounds and were assumed to be responsible for coal's biological activity. Biological processes triggered by redox oscillations taking place at the intermediate depth zone of the peat profile at the S1 bog are assumed to be responsible for the formation of these heteroatomic PACs in this system. Alternatively, these compounds could stem from black carbon and nitrogen derived from fires that have occurred at the site in the past. Surface and deep DOM exhibited more similar characteristics, compared to the intermediate depth zone, with the deep layer exhibiting greater input of microbially degraded organic matter than the surface suggesting that the entire peat profile consists of similar parent material at different degrees of decomposition and that lateral and vertical advection of pore water from the surface to the deeper horizons is responsible for such similarities. Our findings suggest that molecular composition of DOM in peatland pore water is dynamic and is a function of ecosystem activity, water table, redox oscillation, and pore water advection.
   Plain Language Summary We found strong vertical stratification in dissolved organic matter molecular composition and optical properties within the peat column at the S1 bog. Surface samples were dominated by inputs from surface vegetation. The intermediate depth (similar to 50cm) was an area of high reactivity and increased microbial activity with diagenetic formation of many unique compounds such as polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) that contain both nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms. These compounds were previously observed in coal-derived products and were assumed to be responsible for coal's biological activity. Biological processes taking place at the intermediate depth zone of the peat profile at the S1 bog are assumed to be responsible for the formation of these heteroatomic PACs in our system. Conversely, these compounds might stem from black carbon and nitrogen from potential fires that occurred at the site in the past.

AB Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was studied in a bog located in the middle taiga of Siberia using two approaches, the accumulation of peat above the hypocotyl of pine trees, and the eddy covariance flux methodology. NEP was 0.84 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using the peat accumulation method; it was 0.43-0.62 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using eddy covariance over three growing seasons. These data were compared with NEP of the surrounding forest, which was 0.6 tC +/- 1.1 hat yr(-1). The trees growing on the bog reached a total height of about 3 m and an age of 80-120 yr when peat accumulation reached 0.5-0.6 m. At that stage the growth rate of the oldest trees declined. This indicates that there is a maximum age that can be reached by trees growing on hummocks (<150 yr), depending on conditions. The data show that the determination of NEP in bogs by using the peat accumulation above the hypocotyl is a useful method which can be applied on a wide range of bog types, but it may systematically overestimate NEP. The total sink capacity for carbon assimilation of bogs is comparable to that of forest, although methane emissions and losses of dissolved organic carbon must be taken into account when assessing the regional carbon cycle.

AB The recently formed surface layers of peatlands are archives of past environmental conditions and can have a temporal resolution considerably greater than deeper layers. The low density and conditions of fluctuating water table have hindered attempts to construct chronologies for these peats. We tested the use of the radiocarbon bomb pulse to date recently accumulated peat in a blanket mire. The site was chosen because the peat profiles contained independent chronological markers in the form of charcoal-rich layers produced from known burning events. We compared chronologies derived from accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 analysis of plant macrofossils against these chronological markers. The bomb C-14-derived chronologies were in broad agreement with the charcoal dating evidence. However, there were uncertainties in the final interpretation of the C-14 results because the pattern of C-14 concentration in the peat profiles did not follow closely the known atmospheric C-14 record. Furthermore, samples of different macrofossil materials from the same depth contained considerable differences in C-14. Suggested explanations for the observed results include the following: i) minor disturbance at the site, ii) in-situ contamination of the C-14 samples by carbonaceous soot, and iii) differential incorporation of plant material during blanket peat growth.

AB Peatlands are large terrestrial stores of carbon, and sustained CO2 sinks, but over the last century large areas have been drained for agriculture and forestry, potentially converting them into net carbon sources. More recently, some peatlands have been re-wetted by blocking drainage ditches, with the aims of enhancing biodiversity, mitigating flooding, and promoting carbon storage. One potential detrimental consequence of peatland re-wetting is an increase in methane (CH4) emissions, offsetting the benefits of increased CO2 sequestration. We examined differences in CH4 emissions between an area of ditch-drained blanket bog, and an adjacent area where drainage ditches were recently infilled. Results showed that Eriophorum vaginatum colonization led to a "hotspot'' of CH4 emissions from the infilled ditches themselves, with smaller increases in CH4 from other re-wetted areas. Extrapolated to the area of blanket bog surrounding the study site, we estimated that CH4 emissions were around 60 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) prior to drainage, reducing to 44 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) after drainage. We calculated that fully re-wetting this area would initially increase emissions to a peak of around 120 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1), with around two-thirds of the increase (and 90% of the increase over pre-drainage conditions) attributable to CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum-colonized infilled ditches, despite these areas only occupying 7% of the landscape. We predicted that emissions should eventually decline toward pre-drainage values as the ecosystem recovers, but only if Sphagnum mosses displace E. vaginatum from the infilled ditches. These results have implications for peatland management for climate change mitigation, suggesting that restoration methods should aim, if possible, to avoid the colonization of infilled ditches by aerenchymatous species such as E. vaginatum, and to encourage Sphagnum establishment.

AB In the organic-rich environments of peatlands and peaty riparian zones, dissolved organic matter (DOM) can act as a carrier for major and trace elements. However, the mobilization and export patterns of elements from these systems are largely unknown. This study elucidates the annual and short-term event-based dynamics of major and trace element concentrations in a headwater stream draining an ombrotrophic peatland and a peaty riparian zone. Elements are expected to exhibit specific export patterns depending on their biogeochemical reactivity and source area. We hypothesize that most elements are released during organic matter decomposition and are co-transported with DOM in the bog catchment, whereas in the riparian zone, other element pools, such as shallow groundwater, also play a major role.
   Most of the variance in the data, as revealed by Principal Component Analysis, integrated the DOM concentration pattern (element loadings > 0.8: Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Li, Co, As, Sr, Cd, Pb, and DOC). Ca, Mg and Sr were also found to load on this principal component, suggesting that the main control on element mobilization is not DOM, but rather similar source areas and mobilization processes. The DOM-related export was driven by plant uptake, plant decomposition and the bog water level in terms of hydrologic connectivity. The differences between the bog and the riparian zone were mainly driven by different hydrologic conditions and additional elemental sources, such as mineral weathering. The export patterns of Rb, Cs, K, NO3- and SO42- were predominantly controlled by the season and plant uptake, and they were particularly exported by a surficial fast flow path. In addition to other elements, Ga, Y and Ba were enriched in the upper peat and organic soil layer, likely due to anthropogenic pollution. The specific export pattern of these latter elements indicates their predominant mobilization by the dissolution of dust particles and their subsequent mobilization by coupling to DOM.

AB Peatlands contain approximately 25% of the global soil carbon (C), despite covering only 3% of the earth's land surface. In order to evaluate the role of peatlands in global C cycling, models of ecosystem biogeochemistry are required, but peatland ecosystems present a number of unique challenges, particularly how to deal with the large variability that occurs at scales of one to several metres. In models, spatial variability is considered either explicitly for each individual unit and the outputs averaged, referred to as flux upscaling, or implicitly by weighting model parameters by the fractional occurrence of the individual units, referred to as parameter upscaling. The advantage of parameter upscaling is that it is much more computationally efficient: a requirement for hemispheric scale simulations. In this study we determined the differences between modelling a raised bog peatland with hummock-hollow microtopography using flux and parameter upscaling. We used the McGill Wetland Model (MWM), a process-based ecosystem C model for peatlands, configured for hummocks and hollows separately and then a weighted mixture of both. The simulated output based on flux and parameter upscaling was compared with eddy-covariance tower measurements. We found that net ecosystem production (NEP) for hollows was much larger than that for hummocks because total ecosystem respiration (TER) for hummocks was greater while gross primary production (GPP) did not differ significantly between the two topographic features. However, despite differences in components of NEP between hummocks and hollows, there was no statistically significant difference between the NEP based on flux and parameter upscaling using the MWM. Both flux and parameter upscaling show equivalent capability to capture the magnitude, direction, seasonality and inter-annual variability. The root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) are 0.66, 0.45, and 0.49g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively for GPP, TER and NEP based on the flux upscaling, while 0.67, 0.44, and 0.48 gC m(-2) day(-1), respectively based on the parameter upscaling. The degree of agreement (d*) is 0.96, 0.97, and 0.88, respectively for GPP, TER and NEP based on the flux upscaling, while 0.96, 0.97, and 0.89, respectively based on the parameter upscaling. This result suggests that differences in processes caused by peatland microtopography scale linearly, which means an ecosystem-level model set-up (i.e. parameter upscaling scheme), is sufficient to simulate the C cycling.

AB More than 75% of the original restiad peat bogs of the Waikato region, New Zealand, have been converted to agricultural use. Restiad bogs are also mined for peat but there is little information on methods for the post-harvest restoration of restiad bogs. We established a restoration trial on a mined bog with a full factorial experiment of four fertiliser additions (nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrogen plus phosphorus, and control), three seed additions (Leptospermian seoparhan, Sporadanthus ferrugineus, and no seed added [control] and three cultivation techniques (lightly-tilled, deeply-tilled and raised). All combinations were duplicated in 5 x 5 in plots. The first restoration goal was to establish rapidly a vegetation cover to minimise peat degradation. All plots in the raised cultivation treatments exceeded 88% cover by 2 years, whereas the other cultivation treatments had significantly less cover, ranging between 1 and 75%. The best combination within the raised treatments was nitrogen plus phosphorus fertiliser with L. scoparium seed, which reached 100% cover. A second goal was to establish the late successional species S. ferrugineus. Although cover of this species was greatest on the raised plots (up to 32%), the benefits of seed and fertiliser applications were not clear. Measured changes in nitrogen and phosphorus pools showed that nutrient status of the peat had returned to background levels within 2 years, minimising the potential for invasion by weeds with greater nutrient requirements, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Questions: Ecological restoration has traditionally been evaluated with analyses focused on species identities and abundances. These analyses provide no ecological explanation to why certain species change in abundance. One solution may be a functional trait analysis. We asked whether shifts in functional traits could explain vegetation changes in fens restored through tree cutting and rewetting, and how the functional traits in the restored sites compare to those of the reference site?
   Location: Three former rich fens in east-central Sweden.
   Methods: Tree cutting and rewetting were applied in a factorial design, and species and abundance data were recorded for 8yrs. Abundance data and trait data of canopy height, specific leaf area (SLA) and diaspore mass were used to calculate functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional dispersion (FDis) and community-weighted mean (CWM) of functional traits. Data were analysed in a linear mixed effect model for vascular plants and bryophytes jointly, and for vascular plants separately. Results of restoration treatments were compared to data from a reference site.
   Results: Among vascular plants, tree cutting caused a decrease in SLA, as shade-sensitive species increased. In accordance with the change in SLA, FDis increased. In the joint analysis, tree cutting led to increased FDis, FDiv and FRic, indicating reduced filtering caused by the removal of the shading canopy, which allowed shade-sensitive species to establish. The comparison to the reference site shows that even after 8yrs, the restoration treatments have higher trait diversity than the reference site, indicating that the restoration sites have a too relaxed trait filter compared to conditions in an undisturbed fen. Our interpretation is that this is primarily caused by insufficient rewetting (and increased nutrient availability) that allow species of both natural and degraded fen conditions to co-exist, and which failed to suppress the regrowth of trees.
   Conclusions: Analysis of functional diversity improves our understanding of the ecological mechanisms affecting restoration results, and allows comparison among regions and communities with different species composition.

AB The South American Altiplano is one of the largest semiarid high-altitude plateaus in the world. Within the Altiplano, peatlands known as "bofedales" are important components of regional hydrology and provide key water resources and ecosystem services to Andean communities. Warming temperatures, changes in hydroclimate, and shifting atmospheric circulation patterns all affect peatland dynamics and hydrology. It is therefore urgent to better understand the relationships between climate variability and the spatiotemporal variations in peatland productivity across the Altiplano. Here, we explore climate influences on peatland vegetation using 31 years of Landsat data. We focus specifically on the bofedal network in the western Altiplano, the driest sector of the plateau, and use the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of productivity. We develop temporally and spatially continuous NDVI products at multiple scales in order to evaluate relationships with climate variables over the past three decades. We demonstrate that cumulative precipitation and snow persistence over the prior 2 years are strongly associated with growing season productivity. A step change in peatland productivity between 2013-2015 drives an increasing trend in NDVI and is likely a response to consecutive years of anomalously high snow accumulation and rainfall. Early summer minimum temperatures emerge as a secondary influence on productivity. Understanding large-scale productivity dynamics and characterizing the response of bofedales to climate variability over the last three decades provides a baseline to monitor the responses of Andean peatlands to climate change.

AB The activity of extracellular phenol oxidases is believed to play a critical role in decomposition processes in peatlands. The water logged, acidic conditions, and recalcitrant litter from the peatland vegetation, lead to exceptionally high phenolics in the peat. In order to quantify the activity of oxidative enzymes involved in the modification and break down of phenolic compounds two types of assays are primarily utilized: L-DOPA and ABTS. This note focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. Both assays involve a redox reaction and the resulting oxidized chromophore is measured spectrophotometrically. However, in the presence of reducing agents such as the phenolics commonly found in peat the colorimetric reaction is reversed and cannot be used to quantify phenol oxidase activity.

AB Pollen records across parts of Ireland, England and northern Scotland show a dramatic collapse in Pinus pollen percentages at approximately 4000 radiocarbon years BP. This phenomenon has attracted much palaeoecological interest and several hypotheses have been put forward to account for this often synchronous and rapid reduction in pine from mid-Holocene woodland. Explanations for the 'pine decline' include prehistoric human activity, climatic change, in particular a substantial increase in precipitation resulting in increased mire wetness, and airborne pollution associated with the deposition of tephra. Hitherto, one largely untested hypothesis is that mineral deficiency could adversely affect pine growth and regeneration on mire surfaces. The discovery of pine-tree remains (wood pieces, stumps and trunks) within a peat located at Cadogan's Bog on the Mizen Peninsula, southwest Ireland, provided an opportunity to investigate the history of Pinus sylvestris and also to assess the importance of mineral nutrition in maintaining pine growth on mires. Pollen, plant macrofossils, microscopic charcoal and geochemical data are presented from a radiocarbon dated monolith extracted from this peat together with tree ring-width data and radiocarbon dated age estimates from subfossil wood. Analyses of these data suggest that peat accumulation commenced at the site around 6000 years BP when pine was the dominant local tree. Thereafter Pinus pollen percentages diminish in two stages, with the second decline taking place around 4160 +/- 50 years BP. Concomitant with this decline in Pinus pollen, there is a noticeable, short-lived increase in wet-loving mire taxa and a decrease in the concentration of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, iron and zinc. These results suggest that increased mire surface wetness, possibly the result of a change in climate, created conditions unsuitable for pine growth c. 4000 years BP. Mire surface wetness, coupled with a period of associated nutrient deficiency, appears to be a possible explanation for a lack of subsequent pine-seedling establishment for most of the later Holocene.

AB The wetlands of Elk Island National Park, located in central Alberta, are characterized by their vegetation and relationships between vegetation, surface water chemistry, and hydrotopographic parameters. Thirteen marsh, swamp, fen, and bog communities are described on the basis of TWINSPAN and the Canadian Wetland Classification System. Species distribution in Elk Island is related to surface water cation gradients of corrected conductivity, pH, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Hydrotopographic features such as water level, hummock height, elevation of the site, and the number of inlet and outlet streams are of secondary importance. Nutrient levels (nitrogen and phosphorus) in surface waters are less significant. Significant correlations were not obtained between vegetation and surface water nitrate levels or peat depth. Marshes, swamps, and moderate-rich fens at Elk Island are circumneutral in pH and rich in calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Poor fens and bogs are acidic, with lower amounts of mineral cations. The ionic gradient at Elk Island is related to fluctuating water tables and water source (ombrogenous vs. minerogenous). Hydrotopography influences the water chemistry. At Elk Island, marshes and swamps are low elevational wetlands and have the highest number of inlet and outlet streams; fens are found at intermediate elevations with fewer inlet and outlet streams; and bogs are found at the highest elevations with the fewest number of inlet and outlet streams.

AB Forest and peatland ecosystems constitute the two major carbon pools in the boreal region. We assess the evolution in total storage and partitioning of ecosystem carbon following recent paludification of forest into peatland at two sites in Northeast European Russia. Based on radiocarbon dating of basal peat and quantification of total ecosystem carbon storage, our results show that paludification rates and its consequences for carbon storage vary significantly between sites. A peatland expanding on ground with steeper slopes has experienced a slow lateral advance in recent times, about 2.6 m on average per century, whereas a peatland in flatter terrain has expanded much more rapidly, about 35 m on average per century. The total ecosystem carbon storage (sum of phytomass, top soil organics or peat, and 30 cm of underlying mineral soil) showed a long-term trend toward increased ecosystem C storage following the replacement of forest (mean value = 20.8 kg C/m(2), range = 13.0-43.4 kg C/m(2)) by peatland (>100 kg C/m(2) in the deepest peat deposits). However, the transitional stage in which the forest is replaced by the margin of the peatland results in a short-term decrease of carbon stored in the ecosystem with a mean loss of 7.5 kg C/m(2). After the initiation of a peatland through paludification, a period of decades to centuries of peat accumulation is needed to compensate for the initial loss of carbon. In the short term, an intensification of the paludification process could lead to a loss of carbon stored in the boreal region.

AB Drainage and rewetting of peatlands changes their carbon (C) dynamics. We measured C stocks in the soil and biomass of drained and rewetted peatland forests in the region of the National Park Hunsruck-Hochwald, Germany. A detailed soil map was produced, showing the important soil properties for soil C stocks. Based on the horizon-substrate combination as well as LiDAR data, the spatial distribution of soil and forest C stocks was analysed. Our results show that our peatland sites have shallow soils with a heterogeneous spatial distribution. Mean (+/- SE) soil C stocks in the monitoring sites are 121(+/- 8) t ha(-1) whereas the forest stores on average 71(+/- 0.2) t ha(-1) of C in the biomass. Tree removal in the drained peatlands reduced the total C stocks by 4,430 t. The quality and longevity of the wood products that arise from tree removal will determine whether or not the harvested portion of the C captured by the trees is sequestered over long timescales. Additionally, the success of rewetting activities and the potential soil carbon sequestration or (non-) soil carbon loss will determine whether these ecosystems are carbon sinks or sources. An extrapolation of our data resulted in estimated C stocks of 171,530 t and 544,282 t for peatland soils and for the spruce forest, respectively, for the whole area of the National Park (about 10,000 ha).

AB 1 Analyses are presented of major ions (H+ Ca-2,Ca- Mg2+, K+ Na+, C-, and SO42-) and some other variables in surface-water samples, at roughly two-month intervals from March 1992 to May 1993, from a blanket bog in south-west England and a blanket bog and two raised bogs in northern England.
   2 Metallic cation concentrations were generally lower in winter and higher in summer, but there was much short-term variation reflecting varying weather conditions. High Na+ inputs in rain led to high concentrations of other cations, including Ca2+;, by cation exchange with the pear.
   3 K+ showed a peak in early or late spring, with a decline through the growing season and autumn possibly related to plant uptake. Its concentration in the surface water is probably also strongly influenced by the amount and timing of rainfall.
   4 The pH was stable within c. 0.2 units for much of the year, but tended to fall in dry periods, especially in summer, and when total ionic concentration rose through large additions of Na+ in rain, At some sites there were sharp falls of pH in late summer associated with oxidation of sulphides in the pear.
   5 With changing concentration, the relative proportions of univalent and divalent ions in the water approximated to theoretical expectation for cation exchange, the plot of log Sigma(divalent ions) against log C(univalent ions) giving a slope close to 2.0.
   6 The Ca2+/Mg2+ quotient, probably buffered by cation exchange with the peat, was nearly constant round the year at all sites, but varied from site to site.
   7 Cl- was relatively constant for much of the year; a strong late-winter peak at the northern sites was evidently due to high rainwater input during stormy westerly weather. The summer increase in cations was mainly balanced by increased organic anions (humic substances) or SO4-2.
   8 The data indicate retention of a substantial part of the SO42- input in the peat for much of the year at most sites, with episodes of SO42- and acidity generation during summer periods of low water level. All the bogs were effective sinks for atmospheric NO,- inputs except at near-freezing temperatures in winter.
   9 Anion deficit, optical absorbance at 320 nm and total Fe concentration were all highest in summer and lowest in winter; all are related to the concentration of dissolved organic matter.
   10 Temporal changes in surface-water chemistry were least marked at the wettest and most oceanic blanket-bog site (Plym Head, Dartmoor), and most pronounced on a lowland raised bog subject to relatively low rainfall (Helwith Moss, N. Yorkshire).

AB Forested peatlands contain large pools of terrestrial carbon. As well as drainage, forest management such as fertilizer application can affect these pools. We studied the effect of wood ash (application rates 0, 5 and 15 t ha-1) on the heterotrophic soil respiration (CO2 efflux), cellulose decomposition, soil nutrients, biomass production and amount of C accumulated in a tree stand on a pine-dominated drained mire in central Finland. The ash was spread 13 years before the respiration measurements. The annual CO2 efflux was statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable. Wood ash application increased the amounts of mineral nutrients of peat substantially and increased soil pH in the uppermost 10 cm layer by 1.52 pH units. In the surface peat, the decomposition rate of cellulose in the ash plots was roughly double that in control plots. Annual CO2 efflux was least on the unfertilized site, 238 g CO2-C m-2 year-1. The use of wood ash nearly doubled CO2 efflux to 420475 g CO2-Cm-2 year-1 on plots fertilized with 515 t ha-1 of ash, respectively. Furthermore, ash treatments resulted also in increased stand growth, and during the measurement year, the growing stand on ash plots accumulated carbon 1112 times faster than the control plot. The difference between peat C emission and amount of C sequestered by trees on the ash plots was 4358 g C m-2, while on the control plot it was 204 g C m-2. Our conclusion is that adding wood ash as a fertilizer increases more C sequestration in the tree stand than C efflux from the peat.

AB More than 3800 coal thickness measurements, proximate analyses from 97 localities, and stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses from more than 300 outcrops and cores were used in conjunction with previously reported palynological and petrographic studies to map individual benches of the coal and document bench-scale variability in the Fin Clay (Hazard No. 4) coal bed across a 1860 km(2) area of the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field. The bench architecture of the Fire Clay coal bed consists of uncommon leader benches, a persistent but variable lower bench, a widespread, and generally thick upper bench, and local, variable rider benches. Rheotrophic conditions are inferred for the leader benches and lower bench based on sedimentological associations, mixed palynomorph assemblages, locally common cannel coal layers, and generally high ash yields. The lower bench consistently exhibits vertical variability in petrography and palynology that reflects changing trophic conditions as topographic depressions infilled. Infilling also led to unconfined flooding and ultimately the drowning of the lower bench mire. The drowned mire was covered by an air-fall volcanic-ash deposit, which produced the characteristic flint clay parting. The extent and uniform thickness of the parting suggests that the ash layer was deposited in water on a relatively flat surface without a thick canopy or extensive standing vegetation across most of the study area. Ash deposits led to regional pending and establishment of a second planar mire. Because the topography had become a broadly uniform, nutrient-rich surface, upper-bench peats became widespread with large areas of the min distant to elastic sources. Vertical sections of thick (> 70 cm), low-ash yield, upper coal bench show a common palynomorph change from arborescent lycopod dominance upward to fern and densospore-producing, small lycopod dominance, inferred as a shift from planar to ombrotrophic mire phases. Domed mires appear to have been surrounded by wide areas of planar mires, where the coal was thinner (< 70 cm), higher in ash yield, and dominated by arborescent lycopods. Rectangular thickness trends suggest that syndepositional faulting influenced peat accumulation and possibly the position of thr domed mire phase, Faulting also influenced post-deposition clastic environments of deposition, resulting in sandstone channels with angular changes in orientation. Channnels and lateral facies were locally draped by high-ash-yield rider coal benches, which sometimes merged with the upper coal bench. These arborescent-lycopod dominant rider coal benches were profoundly controlled by paleotopography, much like the leader coal benches. Each of the benches of coal documented here represent distinctly different mires that came together to form the Fire Clay coal bed, rather than a single mire periodically split by elastic influx, This is significant as each bench of the coal has its own characteristics, which contribute to the total coal characteristics. The large data set allows interpretation of both vertical and lateral limits to postulated domed phases in the upper coal bench and to the delineation of subtle tec tunic structures that allow for meaningful thickness projections beyond the limits of present mining.

AB A low-lying coastal harvested bog in New Brunswick was inundated by a storm surge in January 2000 and commercially abandoned due to saltwater contamination. This study examines the hydrological processes controlling the seasonal and annual variability of salinity, and its long-term persistence. In the summer period there were two distinct hydrological zones characterized by differences in salinity, elevation, compressibility, soil moisture content, and water-table position. Low-lying sites had higher and more stable surface salinity concentrations (mean 5.7 parts per thousand, coefficient of variation 0.57) than slightly elevated sites (mean 2.9 parts per thousand, coefficient of variation 1.13) that experienced more evaporative enrichment. Salts permeated the peat column to a depth of at least 95 cm, with peak salinity occurring 35-75 cm below the surface. A persistent downward hydraulic gradient also indicated downward advective transport of salts, suggesting that over the long term salts will be leached out of the system.

Low soil moisture levels, that characterise these hotspots before rewetting, regenerate electron acceptors and provide carbon and nutrients which stimulate phenol oxidase-mediated release of phenolic compounds from the peat matrix upon waterlogging. Electron acceptors are then consumed sequentially, eventually favouring CH(4) production and rising pH, despite accumulating SO(4) levels. The latter two processes promote positive feedback to increased phenol oxidase activities and the release of even more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CH(4) from the peat matrix. Hotspot formation therefore represents an inextricably linked physico-chemical and biological positive feedback mechanism. Such hotspots account for a large proportion of the mean increase in carbon loss due to rewetting of this naturally drained peatland (e.g. at maximum mean DOC concentrations: with hotspot 997%; without hotspot 102%) and are not "outliers" but important drivers of biogeochemical fluxes that should be included in budgets for carbon and other elements (e.g. sulphur). As such, understanding hotspot formation should allow improved management strategies for restoration, carbon stocks, drinking water quality and even future geo-engineering options in the face of changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange was measured during the 1990 growing season (June to August) along a transect starting 10 km inland from James Bay and extending 100 km interior to Kinosheo Lake, Ontario. Sites were chosen in three distinct areas: a coastal fen, an interior fen, and a bog. For the most productive sites in the bog net daily uptake rates reached a maximum of 2.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) with an area-weighted exchange of 0.3 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) near midsummer. This site was estimated to be a net carbon source of 9 g C-CO2 m(-2) to the atmosphere over a 153-day growing season. The interior fen was less productive on a daily basis with a net maximum uptake of 0.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and with corresponding area-weighted uptake of 0.1 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during midsummer. Early and late season release of carbon to the atmosphere resulted in a net loss of 21 g C-CO2 m(-2) over the growing season from this site. The coastal fen was the most productive site with uptake rates peaking near 1.7 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) which corresponded to an area-weighted uptake of 0.8 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during midsummer and an estimated net uptake of 6 g C-CO2 m(-2) for the growing season. Associated with net CO2 exchange measurements, multispectral reflectance properties of the sites were measured over the growing season using portable radiometers. These properties were related to exchange rates with the goal of examining the potential for. satellite remote sensing to monitor biosphere/atmosphere CO2 exchange in this biome. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed fi om surface reflectance was correlated with net CO2 exchange for all sites with the exception of areas with large proportions of Sphagnum moss cover. These mosses have greater near-infrared reflectance than typical surrounding vegetation and may require special adjustment for regional exchange/remote sensing applications.

AB Peatlands are spatially heterogeneous ecosystems that develop due to a complex set of autogenic physical and biogeochemical processes and allogenic factors such as the climate and topography. They are significant stocks of global soil carbon, and therefore predicting the depth of peatlands is an important part of establishing an accurate assessment of their magnitude. Yet there have been few attempts to account for both internal and external processes when predicting the depth of peatlands. Using blanket peatlands in Great Britain as a case study, we compare a linear and geostatistical (spatial) model and several sets of covariates applicable for peatlands around the world that have developed over hilly or undulating terrain. We hypothesized that the spatial model would act as a proxy for the autogenic processes in peatlands that can mediate the accumulation of peat on plateaus or shallow slopes. Our findings show that the spatial model performs better than the linear model in all cases-root mean square errors (RMSE) are lower, and 95% prediction intervals are narrower. In support of our hypothesis, the spatial model also better predicts the deeper areas of peat, and we show that its predictive performance in areas of deep peat is dependent on depth observations being spatially autocorrelated. Where they are not, the spatial model performs only slightly better than the linear model. As a result, we recommend that practitioners carrying out depth surveys fully account for the variation of topographic features in prediction locations, and that sampling approach adopted enables observations to be spatially autocorrelated.

AB The vegetation and floristic patterns in and around a coastal lagoon are described from quadrat sampling and related to several environmental factors (elevation, water depth, soil organic content, and pH).  A cluster analysis was used to identify 14 communities while a detrended correspondence analysis ordinated the quadrats.  The ordination's Axis 1 was correlated with water depth/elevation, while Axis 2 was correlated with soil organic content and, in the opposite direction, with soil pH.
   Two vegetation development sequences are proposed for the dune hollow-ridge system:  one in the hollows involving stages of aquatic, bog, and forest vegetation; the second on the ridges where forest composition changes in response to increasing soil development.  Rates of succession are presumably very slow.
   Formal protection of the lagoon within the World Heritage area is justified because of its ecological, conservation, and scenic values; in light of diminishing natural wetlands; and the common occurrence of a vulnerable macrophyte, Myriophyllum robustum, in the lagoon.

AB The biochemical composition of a peat core from James Bay Lowland, Canada, was used to assess the extent of peat decomposition and diagenetic alteration. Our goal was to identify environmental controls on peat decomposition, particularly its sensitivity to naturally occurring changes in temperature, oxygen exposure time, and vegetation. All three varied substantially during the last 7000years, providing a natural experiment for evaluating their effects on decomposition. The bottom 50cm of the core formed during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (7000-4000years B.P.), when mean annual air temperature was likely 1-2 degrees C warmer than present. A reconstruction of the water table level using testate amoebae indicated oxygen exposure time was highest in the subsequent upper portion of the core between 150 and 225cm depth (from 2560 to 4210years B.P.) and the plant community shifted from mostly Sphagnum to vascular plant dominance. Several independent biochemical indices indicated that decomposition was greatest in this interval. Hydrolysable amino acid yields, hydroxyproline yields, and acid:aldehyde ratios of syringyl lignin phenols were higher, while hydrolysable neutral sugar yields and carbon:nitrogen ratios were lower in this zone of both vascular plant vegetation and elevated oxygen exposure time. Thus, peat formed during the Holocene Climatic Optimum did not appear to be more extensively decomposed than peat formed during subsequent cooler periods. Comparison with a core from the West Siberian Lowland, Russia, indicates that oxygen exposure time and vegetation are both important controls on decomposition, while temperature appears to be of secondary importance. The low apparent sensitivity of decomposition to temperature is consistent with recent observations of a positive correlation between peat accumulation rates and mean annual temperature, suggesting that contemporary warming could enhance peatland carbon sequestration, although this could be offset by an increasing contribution of vascular plants to the vegetation.

AB The halting of biodiversity decline of wetlands necessitates ecosystem protection, restoration and re-creation of all wetland types preferably in all suitable landscapes. As peat wetlands (bogs and fens) are superior as carbon stores, and because of their rarity they have a higher biodiversity value relative to other wetland types, they need to be prioritised for protection and restoration. The hydrological, pH, and nutrient conditions essential to each type of wetland that need to be understood and provided for during development are discussed for The Netherlands' and New Zealand. Case studies describe freshwater wetland management and challenges during urbanisation in the Stad van de Zon and Blauwestad in The Netherlands, and in the Styx valley and Pegasus in Christchurch, New Zealand. A summary of the history of urbanisation and wetland destruction, and of biodiversity management for each country provides a context for the case studies. These case studies demonstrate the degree to which the relative values of bogs, fens and swamps, with respect to biodiversity and carbon sequestration, are understood and managed using diverse protection measures, within the boundaries of new urban developments and in adjacent ecological corridors.

AB Often there are significant positive interspecific relationships between leaf area per unit dry mass (SLA) and foliar phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations ([P] and [N]). Most of these studies have been conducted on moderately acidic soils, and little is known of the generality of these relations as potentially affected by soil characteristics. We investigated foliage mineral composition in relation to leaf structure in a wooded meadow on calcareous alkaline soil, in a bog on strongly acidic soil, and in a flood plain on moderately acidic soil. Foliar nutrient contents and fertilization experiments indicated that foliage physiological activity was co-limited by both P and N availabilities in the wooded meadow, by P in the bog. and by N in the flood plain. In the wooded meadow and in the bog, there were positive relationships between SLA and P concentration ([P]), and no relationship between SLA and nitrogen concentration [N]. Given that the fraction of support tissues generally increases with decreasing SLA, the requirement for mineral nutrients is lower at low SLA. Thus, these contrasting relations between mineral nutrients and SLA suggest that P was distributed in a more "optimal" manner among the leaves with varying structure than N in P-limited communities. In the flood plain, SLA was positively related to both [P] and [N], possibly manifesting a strategy to cope with N limitations by enhancing N turnover, and accordingly, greater P requirement for nucleic acid formation in N-limited soils. Total variation in foliar structural and chemical characteristics was similar in all sites, and was mainly determined by variation among the species. Part of this variability was explained by life form and plant size. [P] was higher in trees than in shrubs, and [P] and P/N ratio increased with increasing total plant height, indicating that P nutrition was improved relative to N nutrition with increasing plant size. Since the capture of less mobile soil elements such as P is dependent on extensive root systems, but not that of readily mobile and temporarily variable elements such as N, this correlation was attributed to more extensive root systems in larger plants. Our study indicates that foliar structure vs. [N] and [P] relations may be separately regulated, but also that the generality of leaf structure vs. nutrient content relations may vary depending on soil conditions.

AB Analyses of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were used to assess variation in community structure and total microbial biomass in two boreal peatlands in Sweden, The total PLFA concentration in peat ranged from 0.16 to 7.0 nmol g of wet peat(-1) L (median, 0.70 nmol g of wet peat(-1)). Principal-component analysis of PLFA data revealed that the degree of depth-related variation in PLFA composition was high among peatland habitats, with general differences between wet sites, with water tables within a few centimeters of the moss surface, and dry sites, with water tables >10 cm below the moss surface, However, variation in PLFA composition over the growing season was negligible, In the principal-component analyses, most PLFAs were determined to be parts of clusters of covarying fatty acids, suggesting that they originated in the same functional groups of microorganisms, Major clusters were formed by monounsaturated (typical of gram-negative eubacteria), terminally branched (gram-positive or anaerobic gram-negative eubacteria), methyl-branched and branched unsaturated (sulfate-reducing bacteria and/or actinomycetes), omega 8 monounsaturated (methane-oxidizing bacteria), and polyunsaturated (eucaryotes) PLFAs, Within the clusters, PLFAs had rather distinct concentration-depth distributions, For example, PLFAs from sulfate-reducing bacteria and/or actinomycetes and those from methane-oxidizing bacteria had maximum concentrations slightly below and at the average water table depth, respectively.

AB Drainage ditches and ground-water gradients in abandoned agricultural sapric peatlands (mucklands) produce distinctive vegetation patterns. Ditches in abandoned mucklands were ineffective in creating ground-water depression in adjacent soil, while ditches in a newly-cleared muckland were effective in doing so. Upon abandonment, drainage ditches are subject to bank erosion and sedimentation. Coupled with years of soil subsidence and an altered hydrologic regime, ditches lose effectiveness in draining and function merely as small-scale topographic depressions, providing linear zones of seasonally high water levels. Species are distributed on abandoned mucklands in association with soil moisture conditions induced by topographic variation at both small (i.e., ditches) and larger (i.e., site-wide) spatial scales. Vegetation that is usually restricted to moist or saturated soils had greater cover closer to or within drainage ditches or in other topographically low areas, while species with low fidelity to saturated soil dominated the remaining drier areas. Some shrub species had slightly greater stem densities either within or immediately adjacent to ditches, resulting in a ''parallel'' distribution (i.e., illustrating ditch-fidelity). Species having higher affinity to lower soil moisture conditions, such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), showed significantly greater stem density in areas farther away from ditches. Ground-water levels are of primary importance in affecting distribution patterns on naturally revegetating, abandoned agricultural mucklands. The accuracy of the wetland indicator status for woody and herbaceous species encountered on these abandoned mucklands is supported quantitatively by direct gradient analysis. The functioning of existing drainage ditch systems should be assessed prior to any mitigation or restoration activities.

AB The results of complex investigations that have been carried out since 2007 in large bog ecosystems (Zehlau, Bolshoe Mokhovoe, and Koz'e) located in Kaliningrad oblast in two largest landscape areas, glaciolacustrine plains in the central part of the region and coastal lowlands of the southern coast of Curonian Lagoon and the delta of the Neman River, are presented. It is established that the intensive development of mires and their transition to the raised bog stage occurred in the territory of Kaliningrad oblast later than in most of the forest zone in European Russia, where this process was noted as early as during the Atlantic. On the glaciolacustrine flat plains in the central part of Kaliningrad oblast, where there were no deep depressions, the mire formation process was manifested weakly for a long time. A colder and more humid climate, which is a condition necessary for the raised bog peat accumulation and rapid expansion of bogs to the adjacent forest area, occurred only in the Subatlantic.

AB Peatlands are globally known as major deposits of fresh water and carbon, affecting the planet's weather and local hydrology; for hearing unique plant and animal species, contributing to biodiversity; and because they represent a Major economic resource to humanity. Peatlands are dominated by plants forming dense populations, especially Sphagnum moss and vascular plants belonging to the Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. They present high water table levels and I deep organic matter layer (peat) below the living layer of plants. The use of fire and logging to clear forests in poor drainage soils have generated a kind of ecosystem similar to peatlands, dominated by Sphagnum moss, where peat accumulation is very low or absent (anthropogenic peatlands or -pomponales"). Compared with natural peatlands, they share the presence of Sphagnum, but they are very different in the use human beings give to them. While natural peatlands are used for peat extraction, anthropogenic peatlands are harvested for the superficial layer of living moss. The ecological consequences after both extractive activities are also different. The aim of this work is to compare the floristic composition and water table levels between natural and anthropogenic peatlands. We sampled natural and anthropogenic peatlands with and without Sphagnum extraction. We registered 74 taxa (eight lichens, 19 bryophytes and 47 vascular plants). Differences in floristic composition allow LIS to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic peatlands. Water table levels also differ between Study sites, being less superficial in natural and anthropogenic peatlands without moss extraction. The hydrological alterations after peatland exploitation would bring serious ecological consequences to Chiloe island, since its only source of water comes from rainfall and is stored in these large reservoirs called peatlands.

AB Experiments in a rewetted fen show large differences in root decomposition rates among Phragmites australis, Carex paniculata, and Carex riparia. With equal water table fluctuations no differences in decomposition were observed in the two rewetting variants, with temporary standing and constantly flowing water. The marked differences among species are therefore attributed to differences in plant material quality, though C/N ratio is shown not to be of main influence. Based on low decomposition rates, Phragmites australis proved the species most suitable for (renewed) peat accumulation under sufficient wet conditions.

DE Peat; Coring; Carbon; Sampling; Soil
ID PEATLANDS; CYCLE; SOIL
AB Many international protocols (e.g., REDD+) are developing inventories of ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes at country and regional scales, which can include peatlands. As the only nationally implemented field inventory and remeasurement of forest soils in the US, the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) samples the top 20 cm of organic soils, but there is a large unsampled fraction of soil carbon stored in America's peatland forests. Improved methods could allow the FIA program to more comprehensively estimate soil carbon stocks and stock change in forested peatlands. We evaluated six rapid peat sampling methods in northern peatlands: 1) general probing of peat thickness, 2) general probing of peat thickness by general vegetation type, 3) partial profile coring #1, 0-20 cm, 4) partial profile coring #2, 25-75 cm, 5) partial profile coring #3, 50-100 cm, 6) intermittent profile coring and compared them to 7) measurements derived from whole profile sampling. We also tested our methods against an independent database of 85 peat cores collected from Manitoba, Canada. Overall, we found that the 0-20 cm partial profile core method was the least accurate method and should not be used (64-67 % accurate). The remaining rapid peat sampling methods all provided accuracies > 85 % compared to whole profile sampling. In conclusion, we found that there are several good options for rapidly sampling peat C stocks that if incorporated, could greatly increase our estimates of carbon stored in peat.

AB Abandoned drained peatlands pose the greatest danger in terms of peat fires. This is especially true of abandoned, unrestored peat milling fields, the maximum areas of which are located in Moscow Oblast. The most effective way to reduce the fire hazard and improve the ecological condition of such lands in the absence of economic reasons for their use is rewetting and peatland restoration. It is necessary to prioritize objects for rewetting and to monitor the effectiveness of measures taken. Such objects can be of considerable size, difficult to pass and not amenable to ground mapping. Fires and rewetting contribute to rapid changes in vegetation cover. Their monitoring requires remote sensing data and, above all, multispectral satellite data. The large number of objects, their spatial distribution and the need for multi-year observations require a combination of data from different satellites. We present the experience of monitoring more than 73 thousand hectares of peatlands in Moscow Oblast rewetted in 2010-2013 after the fires of 2010. Current results show a reduction in the areas of open peat and dry grass vegetation, insignificant changes in the areas occupied by coniferous trees and progressive expansion of the area occupied by deciduous trees and shrubs, as well as an increase of hydrophilic communities and open water after rewetting and subsequent maintenance of the area. The developed and tested methodology makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of peatland rewetting to reduce the risk of peat fires, as well as to identify areas requiring additional measures. The proposed algorithm ensures reliable allocation in semi-automatic mode of 6 classes of vegetation/land cover, different in fire hazard and basic environmental characteristics that determine the fluxes of greenhouse gases, biodiversity and other ecosystem functions.

AB In boreal bogs plant species are low in number, but they differ greatly in their growth forms and photosynthetic properties. We assessed how ecosystem carbon (C) sink dynamics were affected by seasonal variations in the photosynthetic rate and leaf area of different species. Photosynthetic properties (light response parameters), leaf area development and areal cover (abundance) of the species were used to quantify species-specific net and gross photosynthesis rates (P-N and P-G, respectively), which were summed to express ecosystem-level P-N and P-G. The ecosystem-level P-G was compared with a gross primary production (GPP) estimate derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements.
   Species areal cover, rather than differences in photosynthetic properties, determined the species with the highest P-G of both vascular plants and Sphagna. Species-specific contributions to the ecosystem P-G varied over the growing season, which, in turn, determined the seasonal variation in ecosystem P-G. The upscaled growing season P-G estimate, 230 gCm (-2), agreed well with the GPP estimated by the EC (243 gCm (-2)).
   Sphagna were superior to vascular plants in ecosystemlevel P-G throughout the growing season but had a lower P-N. P-N results indicated that areal cover of the species, together with their differences in photosynthetic parameters, shape the ecosystem-level C balance. Species with low areal cover but high photosynthetic efficiency appear to be potentially important for the ecosystem C sink. Results imply that func-tional diversity, i. e., the presence of plant groups with different seasonal timing and efficiency of photosynthesis, may increase the stability of C sinks of boreal bogs.

AB This paper describes the development of a fractional shrub/tree cover in open mire land using logistic regression and airborne remote sensing data (the DSM is derived from colour infrared images). The present study was carried out in the framework of the Swiss Mire Protection Program, where shrub encroachment is a key issue. An example of the use of this modelling approach in a mire biotope in the Pre-alpine zone of central Switzerland is presented. As a first step, a DSM was automatically generated using an image matching approach from 12 colour infrared (CIR) aerial images. Two discrete forest masks with different levels of detail were then generated combining a canopy cover derived from the DSM with a multi-resolution segmentation and a fuzzy classification. Then, fractional shrub/tree covers for open mire land were calculated using six explanatory variables derived from the DSM only and the forest masks as the response variable. Validation with field samples revealed highest accuracies for the cover stratum 30-100%. An advantage of this approach for future mire protection work is that small shrubs and single trees of open mire land can be modelled with high accuracy and the estimated cover is not restricted to a simple forest/nonforest decision. The optimal, most reliable cover stratum can be achieved by individually tuning the probability threshold of the fractional shrub/tree covers according to the individual vegetation characteristics of a mire ecosystem. This study clearly revealed that 3-dimensional information, as obtained by digital photogrammetry, is indispensable for modelling tree and shrub occurrence.

AB Peatlands cover about 21% of the landscape and contain about 80% of the soil carbon stock in western Canada. However, the current rates of carbon accumulation and the environmental controls on ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration in peatland ecosystems are poorly understood. As part of Fluxnet-Canada, we continuously measured net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) using the eddy covariance, technique in a treed fen dominated by stunted Picea mariana and Larix laricina trees during August 2003-December 2004. The total carbon stock in the ecosystem was approximately 51,000 g C m(-2), with only 540 g C m(-2) contributed by live above ground vegetation. The NEE measurements were used to parameterize simple physiological models to assess temporal variation in maximum ecosystem photosynthesis (A(max)) and ecosystem respiration rate at 10 degrees C (R-10). During mid-summer the ecosystem had a relatively high A(max) (approx. 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with relatively low R-10 (approx. 4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The peak mid-day NEE uptake rate during July and August was 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The ecosystem showed large seasonal variation in photosynthetic and respiratory activity that was correlated with shifts in temperature, with both spring increases and fall decreases in A(max) well predicted by the mean daily air temperature averaged over the preceding 21 days. Leaf-level gas exchange and spectral reflectance measurements also suggested that seasonal changes in photosynthetic activity were primarily controlled by shifts in temperature. Ecosystem respiration was strongly correlated with changes in ecosystem photosynthesis during the growing season, suggesting important links between plant activity and mycorrhizae and microbial activity in the shallow layers of the peat. Only very low rates of respiration were observed during the winter months. During 2004, the peatland recorded a net annual gain of 144 g C m(-2) year(-1), the result of a difference between gross photosynthesis of 713 and total ecosystem respiration of 569 g C m(-2) year(-1).

AB Rates of anaerobic respiration are of central importance for the long-term burial of carbon (C) in peatlands, which are a relevant sink in the global C cycle. To identify constraints on anaerobic peat decomposition, we determined detailed concentration depth profiles of decomposition end-products, i.e. methane (CH4) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), along with concentrations of relevant decomposition intermediates at an ombrotrophic Canadian peat bog. The magnitude of in situ net production rates of DIC and CH4 was estimated by inverse pore-water modeling. Vertical transport in the peat was slow and dominated by diffusion leading to the buildup of DIC and CH4 with depth (5500 mu mol L-1 DIC, 500 mu mol L-1 CH4). Highest DIC and CH4 production rates occurred close to the water table (decomposition constant k(d) similar to 10(-3)-10(-4) a(-1)) or in some distinct zones at depth (k(d) similar to 10(-4) a(-1)). Deeper into the peat, decomposition proceeded very slowly at about k(d) = 10(-7) a(-1). This pattern could be related to thermodynamic and transport constraints. The accumulation of metabolic end-products diminished in situ energy yields of acetoclastic methanogenesis to the threshold for microbially mediated processes (-20 to -25 kJ mol(-1) CH4). The methanogenic precursor acetate also accumulated (150 mu mol L-1). In line with these findings, CH4 was formed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at Gibbs free energies of -35 to -40 kJ mol(-1) CH4. This was indicated by an isotopic fractionation alpha(CO2-CH4) of 1.069-1.079. Fermentative degradation of acetate, propionate and butyrate attained Gibbs free energies close to 0 kJ mol-1 substrate. Although methanogenesis was apparently limited by some other factor in some peat layers, transport and thermodynamic constraints likely impeded respiratory processes in the deeper peat. Constraints on the removal of DIC and CH4 may thus slow decomposition and contribute to the sustained burial of C in northern peatlands. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A model was developed that classified and projected the distribution of seven different types of peatlands in the Mackenzie River Basin. The model was based an the relationships between bryophyte indicator species, the types of peatlands they characterize, and regional climate. The model used the presence, absence, and abundance of 15 bryophyte indicator species to classify 81 peatlands in the study area into seven groups. Abundance values were calculated for each of the indicator species along three climatic gradients-Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), Mean Annual Total Precipitation (MATP), and Length of the Growing Season (LGS). The percent cover of all species were then ascribed to appropriate combinations of MAP, MATP, and LGS. The result produced a matrix consisting of 4,560 grid nodes,where each node was identified by values for each of the three climatic variables and the types of peatlands that could be found at that climate. An independent data set consisting of climatic and ecological values and vegetation cover for 115 sites was rued to test the ability and accuracy of the model to classify and project the climatic distribution of the seven peatland groups. The model correctly classified 106 of the 115 sites and of those, correctly projected the distribution of all but five of the test sites. The model accuracy was greater than or equal to 70% for six of the seven groups, and > 90% for three of those. The accuracy for the remaining group was 50% and errors were mostly caused by the failure to project the distribution of three of the test sites. Other errors include: the inability to classify lichen: dominated peatlands; the inclusion of,wet lawns in bogs into one of the groups which caused a southward extension of that group by approximately 200 km. The overall model accuracy was 88%.

AB Northern peatlands represent a long-term net sink for atmospheric CO2, but these ecosystems can shift from net carbon (C) sinks to sources based on changing climate and environmental conditions. In particular, changes in water availability associated with climate control peatland vegetation and carbon uptake processes. We examined the influence of changing hydrology on plant species abundance and ecosystem primary production in an Alaskan fen by manipulating the water table in field treatments to mimic either sustained flooding (raised water table) or drought (lowered water table) conditions for 6 years. We found that water table treatments altered plant species abundance by increasing sedge and grass cover in the raised water table treatment and reducing moss cover while increasing vascular green area in the lowered water table treatment. Gross primary productivity was lower in the lowered treatment than in the other plots, although there were no differences in total biomass or vascular net primary productivity among the treatments. Overall, our results indicate that vegetation abundance was more sensitive to variation in water table than total biomass and vascular biomass accrual. Finally, in our experimental peatland, drought had stronger consequences for change in vegetation abundance and ecosystem function than sustained flooding.

AB Current efforts to assess changes to the wetland hydrology caused by growing anthropogenic pressures in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) require well-founded spatial and temporal estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET), which is the dominant component of the water budget in this region. This study assessed growing season (May-September) and peak growing season (July) ET variability at a treed moderate-rich fen and treed poor fen (in 2013-2018), open poor fen (in 2011-2014), and saline fen (in 2015-2018) using eddy covariance technique and a set of complementary environmental data. Seasonal fluctuations in ET were positively related to net radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit and followed trends typical for the Boreal Plains (BP) and AOSR with highest rates in June-July. However, no strong effect of water table position on ET was found. Strong surface control on ET is evident from lower ET values than potential evapotranspiration (PET); the lowest ET/PET was observed at saline fen, followed by open fen, moderately treed fen, and heavily treed fen, suggesting a strong influence of vegetation on water loss. In most years PET exceeded precipitation (P), and positive relations between P/PET and ET were observed with the highest July ET rates occurring under P/PET similar to 1. However, during months with P/PET > 1, increased P/PET was associated with decreased July ET. With respect to 30-year mean values of air temperature and P in the area, both dry and wet, cool and warm growing seasons (GS) were observed. No clear trends between ET values and GS wetness/coldness were found, but all wet GS were characterized by peak growing seasons with high daily ET variability.

AB During 2 years (2009, 2010), CO2 fluxes were measured in an oligotrophic fen located at the ecotonal limit of forest tundra and lichen woodland, in northeastern Canada. Peatlands in this region have registered a rise in surface moisture since Little Ice Age, allowing an increase in their pool size and density. In the studied peatland, 83 % of the surface is covered either with pools (42 %), hollows (28 %) and lawns (13 %) all of which present a mean water table higher than 7 cm. We evaluated how these conditions might influence the CO2 balance in these poor fens located in the northeastern section of the La Grande river watershed. During the two years measurements, results indicate a net CO2 source with 404 (+/- 287) and 272 (+/- 250) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) emitted to the atmosphere throughout the growing seasons and winters. Modeled wintertime net ecosystem exchange resulted in a net loss of 150 (+/- 36) and 150 (+/- 37) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) in 2009 and 2010 respectively, while 248 (+/- 248) and 124 (+/- 195) g CO2 m(-2) was emitted during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. This high CO2 source can be attributed to three factors: (1) the length of the cold season which represented 210-214 days of net CO2 loss (2) a high pool/vegetated surface ratio since pools are a net source of CO2 and presented 38-40 % of the annual spatially weighted CO2 budget and (3) hydroclimatic conditions during the growing season as dryer and warmer conditions in 2009 reduced photosynthesis and increased respiration rates.

AB Changes in climate and land use pressures in the boreal region may influence peatland stream sediment organic carbon (C) dynamics. Fifteen to 50% of stream sediment organic C resides in recalcitrant pools, with the lipids accounting for up to 25% of the peatland C pool. Nevertheless, lipid mineralization within peatlands and their draining stream sediments is poorly understood. Potential esterase activity, which is known to be an important enzyme group in recalcitrant C decomposition, is presented as an indicator of lipid hydrolysis in three streams surrounding an intermediate fen peatland. Organic C concentration ranged from 5 to 250 g C kg(-1) sediment during the sampling period, with the recalcitrant C pool accounting for 15 to 20%. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were typical of humic-like substances, such as aliphatic compounds (including lipids), phenolic and other aromatic structures, carboxyl groups, and polysaccharide structures. Esterase activity was positively correlated with organic C and total nitrogen (N) concentrations, and sediment pH. Esterase was most active in the presence of high organic C fractions and recalcitrant C, supporting the hypothesis that lipid hydrolysis in the peatland stream sediments may be an important and underestimated component of peatland C sequestration dynamics.

AB During litho-stratigraphic studies of deposits in small mires in the upper basin of the Oder River, mid-Holocene hiatuses identified by the presence of horizons of strongly decomposed peat (HSDP), were identified at four sites. Radiocarbon dating results indicate long (10(3) years) breaks in peat accumulation and the dates obtained from the underlying layers of deposit are inconsistent with the pollen record. In order to explain these discrepancies, an attempt was made to recreate the conditions of HSDP formation under the influence of endo- and exogenous factors determining peatland productivity. In the light of macrofossil analysis, the development of HSDP during the Atlantic and Subboreal periods, when the humidity of habitats decreased, occurred at an advanced stage of development of swamps with Alnetea glutinosae forest communities. The gradual rise in water levels in the mires that started in the Subboreal period and intensified during the Subatlantic period was recorded as a slow shift in vegetation towards non-forest, sedge-moss communities belonging to the Magnocaricion alliance or the Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae class. One consequence of the mechanism of HSDP formation is the existence of limitations on the dating of the duration of the dry phase owing to the presence of organic matter of different ages in the degraded peat layer. The determination of the age of wet phases offers better prospects. In the light of radiocarbon dating, which is essentially in line with the pollen analysis results, the transition towards positive peatland productivity occurred between ca. 9th century BC and 7th century CE.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of the carbon dioxide flux from an ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Canada, were made between June 1, 1998, and May 31, 1999, Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) showed a distinct annual cycle, with net daily uptake increasing rapidly after snowmelt, peaking in midsummer and declining toward the fall. Summer (June to September) mean daily NEE flux was an uptake of -2.8 +/- 0.23 (standard error) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) but daily values ranged considerably from a loss of 4.8 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) to a maximum uptake of -8.3 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1). Daytime fluxes of CO2 were closely related to the photosynthetically active radiation flux, with derived relationships varying monthly. A curvilinear relationship developed between nighttime NEE and soil temperature produced a Q(10) value of 3.0. Throughout the late fall and the snow-covered periods (November 5 to April 6), mean daily fluxes showed a fairly constant efflux of similar to1.1 +/- 0.003 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1). The integrated non-growing season CO2 loss was 183 g CO2 m(-2). However, this was offset by gains during the long growing period resulting in an integrated annual NEE net uptake of 248 +/- 68 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) for this peatland, The growing season measurements of CO2 flux at this site were similar to those reported in the few previous studies on northern peatland ecosystems, but no previous annual estimates of NEE based on year-round measurements have been published for other peatlands. Compared to annual measurements at forest sites in North America, the net exchange at this site falls between that of a small annual loss recorded at a northern boreal spruce forest and the substantial uptakes measured at a temperate mixed forest and boreal aspen forest sites.

AB We focused on the gradient in moisture along transects of from 8 to 30 m in length from spring fen to semi-dry grassland vegetation. We selected an area in the calcium-rich part of the Western Carpathian flysch zone (Czech and Slovak Republics) where small spring-fed fens occur in close contact with semi-dry grasslands. Altogether 126 vegetation plots of 75 x 75 cm were sampled along 15 transects (one per locality) that each extended from the wettest part of a spring-fed fen into the surrounding semi-dry grassland. In addition, samples of standing plant biomass and soils were analysed for nutrients (N, P, K, C, Ca) and the upper-soil moisture measured. Using this study system and these sampling methods, we can test directly the effects of moisture and so avoid the confounding effects of different background environmental conditions that occur when data from many distinct sites is used. Data were processed using linear mixed-effect models and other statistical techniques. The trend in the number of species of vascular plants was unimodal with the optimum skewed towards lower moisture values. This response was not caused by an edge effect alone as replacing the moisture gradient with the positions of plots on transects resulted in a much weaker unirnodal relationship and there was a group of species that occurred mainly in the species-richest moderately moist plots but did not occur in fens or the driest grasslands. The correlations between species richness and productivity (positive) and soil calcium (negative) differed from most of those reported in the literature, which suggests that the observed relationship between species richness and moisture was probably not greatly confounded by these factors. Species richness correlated negatively and the percentage of endangered species positively with the N:P biomass ratio, which is in accordance with other published results, but their correlations with moisture were stronger. For bryophytes, species richness linearly decreased towards the dry plots and did not correlate with any of the nutrients measured. Most of the species of vascular plants and bryophytes in the wettest patches were fen specialists, while more generalists made up the species richness in grasslands, including the species-richest patches. For bryophytes, the percentage of specialists was very high in fen plots. Although Mantel tests showed that bryophyte and vascular plant species turnovers were similar, we recorded substantial differences in their species richness patterns. Comparison with the results of a previous study on molluscs revealed a greater similarity between bryophytes and molluscs than between molluscs and vascular plants in terms of correlations between species richness and environmental variables. We argue that soil moisture should be taken into account when explaining current patterns in diversity in extremely rich temperate grasslands.

AB Investigations of interstadials during early stages of glacial periods are of special interest, because they featured large-scale transformations of the climate system and the build-up of land-based ice sheets. Lacustrine sediment sequences are considered to be important natural archives that register past climate and environmental signals. Here, we present new multi-proxy data obtained from a palaeolake succession preserved in the inner-alpine terrace of Unterangerberg, Eastern Alps. These sediments formed during the second Early Wurmian Interstadial, equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a, and were used to reconstruct changes in lake conditions and to infer past air temperatures. The sediment geochemical data and subfossil aquatic biota provide evidence of a cyclic lake-fen-lake development during this interstadial. The proxy records reveal stable lacustrine conditions with dense charophyte meadows and abundant aquatic fauna during the early part of the interstadial, a progressive shallowing of the lake resulting in the spreading out of fen vegetation in the middle part, and a transition from wetland to a renewed shallow lake stage towards the end of the interstadial. Chironomids were used to reconstruct mean July air temperatures, employing a combined Norwegian-Swiss chironomid temperature inference model. The reconstruction indicates a temperature close to present-day values of ca. 18 degrees C in the middle part of the record, while temperatures of ca. 13-14 degrees C are recorded for the lower and upper parts. The proxy data from this palaeolake provide evidence of heat and drought in the middle part of MIS 5a, supported by the chironomid-based temperature reconstruction. Our reconstruction shows a climate pattern broadly similar to that found in pollen-based estimates of mean July air temperatures from sites in the northern Alpine foreland and compares well to other European palaeoclimatic reconstructions of MIS 5a climate.

AB A Late Pleistocene/Holocene paleoenvironmental record was obtained from the Rouer peatland (5 degrees 54 ' E, 49 degrees 45 ' N; 270 m a.s.l.), located in the Gutland area of southern Luxembourg. A total of six sediment samples were AMS radiocarbon-dated to obtain an age-depth model. XRF analyses and analyses of geochemical proxies of organic matter (TOC, TN, delta C-13, delta N-15) were conducted to identify major paleoenvironmental changes in the record. Pollen analysis reveals insights into the vegetation history throughout the last 14,000 cal. yr BP. The record offers unique insights into the evolution of local organic sediment/peat accumulation, as well as into the environmental history of the Gutland region and beyond. The accumulation of organic sediment and peat started at about 13,800 cal. yr BP before present. Until about 6000 cal. yr BP, periods of apparently stable climatic conditions had been interrupted repeatedly by pronounced episodes with increased input of minerogenic matter into the peat matrix (12,700-11,800 cal. yr BP; 11,500-11,300 cal. yr BP; 11,100-10,800 cal. yr BP; 9300 cal. yr BP; 8200 cal. yr BP), indicated by sudden increases of Ti/coh values. After 6000 cal. yr BP, environmental conditions stabilized. Between 4200 and 2800 cal. yr BP, during the Bronze Age, changes in the pollen spectrum indicate an increasing clearance of woodlands. Since the Roman period, an ongoing intensification of grassland farming and agriculture is evidenced. Lowest tree species abundances are witnessed during the Middle Ages. The Modern Era is characterized by enhanced sediment input due to soil erosion. In short, this record complements the Late Pleistocene/Holocene climatic history of the Gutland area and demonstrates that fen peat deposits can be valuable high-resolution paleoclimate archives.

AB Biogeochemical transformations of plant-derived soil organic matter (SOM) involve complex abiotic and microbially mediated reactions. One such reaction is halogenation, which occurs naturally in the soil environment and has been associated with enzymatic activity of decomposer organisms. Building on a recent finding that naturally produced organobromine is ubiquitous in SOM, we hypothesized that inorganic bromide could be subject to abiotic oxidations resulting in bromination of SOM. Through lab-based degradation treatments of plant material and soil humus, we have shown that abiotic bromination of particulate organic matter occurs in the presence of a range of inorganic oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide and assorted forms of ferric iron, producing both aliphatic and organobromine. Bromination of oak and pine litter is limited primarily by bromide concentration. Fresh plant material is more susceptible to bromination than decayed litter and soil humus, due to a labile pool of mainly aliphatic compounds that break down during early stages of SOM formation. As the first evidence of abiotic bromination of particulate SOM, this study identifies a mechanistic source of the natural organobromine in humic substances and the soil organic horizon. Formation of organobromine through oxidative treatments of plant material also provides insights into the relative stability of aromatic and aliphatic components of SOM.

   chamber measurements; mitigation action; data assimilation
AB Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) reservoirs, storing about one-third of the global terrestrial soil C pool. Anthropogenic influences, such as drainage for agriculture and forestry, lower the originally high groundwater level, leading to peat aeration and decomposition. This is particularly reflected in significant losses of CO2, while fluxes of N2O and CH4 are generally considered of minor importance for the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of cultivated peatlands in Scandinavia. Setting land aside from agricultural production has been proposed as a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from drained peatland, restore natural habitats, and increase C sequestration. However, the evidence for this is rather scarce unless drainage is terminated. In this study, we measured respiration using dark automatic chambers, and CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes using manual static chambers, on: 1) cultivated peatland and 2) adjacent set-aside peatland in Central Sweden. The set-aside site was found to be a greater source of respiration than the cultivated site, while higher N2O fluxes and lower CH4 uptake rates were observed for the cultivated site. However, to compare the full GHG balance and assess the abandonment of drained cultivated peatland, additional measures, such as gross primary production (GPP) but also dissolved organic C losses would have to be taken into account.

AB (1) There is evidence of gas-filled voids - 'bubbles' - in deep (> 50-100 cm) peat in North America.
   (2) I used corers, designed to collect samples of accurately known volume, to sample peat profiles down to maximum depth 700 cm at five varied bog sites in northern England and southern Scotland, and measured the proportion of space apparently occupied by bubbles.
   (3) Of 126 samples in peat below 50 cm depth, three had bubbles occupying 12-15 % of the volume (and one of these was at only 55 cm depth). The other 123 had apparent bubbles distributed in Gaussian fashion, positively and negatively, about zero proportion of total volume and with standard deviation less than 2 %, consistent with these 'bubbles' being measurement error.
   (4) In northern England and southern Scotland, compared with North America, less variable temperature and cooler summers may lead to concentrations of dissolved gas that are generally too low to allow bubbles to form. Even where bubbles do form in summer, they may re-dissolve at winter temperatures.

AB Northern peatlands sequester carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) over millennia, at variable rates that depend on climate, environmental variables and anthropogenic activity. The ombrotrophic peatlands of central and northern Alberta (Canada) have developed under variable climate conditions during the last hundreds to thousands of years, while in the course of the twentieth century, some regions were also likely subjected to anthropogenic disturbance. We aimed to quantify peat C and N accumulation rates for the last millennium from seven peatlands to estimate the relative influence of climate and anthropogenic disturbance on C accumulation dynamics. Peatlands have accumulated C at an average rate of 25.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) over the last millennium. Overall, climate was likely a major factor as, on average, highest apparent rates of C accumulation were found around 1100 CE, during the warmer Medieval Climate Anomaly, with lowest rates during the Little Ice Age, around 1750 CE. Local factors, such as disturbance, played a role in C sequestration at the site scale. The average N accumulation rate was 0.55 g N m(-2) year(-1), with high inter- and intra-site variability. In general, N accumulation mirrored patterns in C sequestration for peat deposited pre-1850 CE. However, higher N accumulation rates observed after 1850 CE, averaging 0.94 g N m(-2) year(-1), were not correlated with C accumulation. Moreover, some of the historically strongly accumulating sites may have become less efficient in sequestering C, and vice versa. All seven sites showed a marked decrease in delta N-15 when comparing pre- and post-1850 timeframes, consistent with increasing post-1850 N additions from an atmospheric source, likely biological N fixation. Overall, N was not a driving factor for C accumulation.

AB Accurate C-14 dating of peat samples is crucial if peat stratigraphics are to be used as historical archives. To analyse the variation in C-14 age within small peat samples, the C-14 age of different mire plant remains and peat fractions (n = 39) from 2 cm thick peat slices was determined using accelerator mass spectrometry. The C-14 ages of mosses were assumed to be the most accurate. To verify this we also tested the possibility that uncertainties could be introduced by mosses at the mire surface reassimilating CO2 produced during the decomposition of old peat. The average C-14 content of living mosses (110.5-110.9 absolute modem % (pM)) did not differ between three Sphagnum species, representing hummock-, carpet- and lawn-growing species, Their C-14 contents were also identical, within experimental limits, to the current C-14 content of the atmosphere. Depending on sampled depth and peat type, the differences in calibrated C-14 age between different fragments or fractions, within specific 2 cm thick peat samples, varied between 365 and similar to 1000 years, with one exceptional deviation of 2125 years in a sample from a mesotrophic sedge peat. Alkali-treated peat samples always gave greater ages than the corresponding untreated peat samples and small-size fractions (<0.045 mm), indicating that the fraction removed by standard alkali treatment is very similar to the small-size fraction. When compared to alkali-treated moss fragments, most other fractions and fragments deviated considerably. Even alkali-treated bulk samples deviated from, the alkali-treated moss fragments. We propose that Sphagnum plant fragments should be used in C-14 AMS dating of peat since they yield the most reliable C-14 dates.

ID HABITAT; AREA
AB Aim The state of peatlands in eastern Canada is of growing concern. This habitat is in decline due tu urban sprawl, agriculture, forestry, and peat mining. Moreover reduction and fragmentation have led to increasing isolation of remaining peatlands. We determined how bird species distribution in peatlands conforms to expectations drawn from island dynamics. We also determined the factors influencing the occurrence of 10 common peatland bird species, two of which rely mainly on peatlands for nesting in the study region.
   Location We sampled sixty-three peatlands in southern Quebec, Canada, within a landscape characterized by a mosaic of forest stands and farmland.
   Methods We sampled nesting bird populations within peatlands from 4 June to 14 July 1995, using both transect lines and fixed-radius point counts. Each sampled peatland was characterized by area, vegetation structure (microhabitats), and isolation. We used multiple regression to test the relationship between bird species richness, peatland area, heterogeneity, microhabitat richness, and relative isolation, after correction for sampling effort. Relationships between bird species abundances and the variables the environmental variables were investigated with Canonical Correspondence Analyses. We calculated probabilities of occurrence of individual species in peatlands by logistic regression, with the same explanatory variables as mentioned previously.
   Results Bird species richness was mainly explained by microhabitat richness, and to a lesser extent, by sampling effort. By contrast, the occurrence of more than half of the species was mainly explained by peatland microhabitat heterogeneity. Palm warbler Dendroica palmarum (Gmelin) and upland sandpipers Bartramia longicauda (Bechstein) were the only species less frequent in small and isolated peatlands than in other peatlands.
   Main conclusions The results for species richness support both the habitat diversity, and passive sampling hypotheses for patchy distribution of birds. By contrast, results from individual species emphasized the difference between factors affecting total species richness and individual species distribution. The distribution of palm warbler, the only species restricted to peatlands regionally, was consistent with expectations from island dynamics.

AB . Premise of the study : Serpentine soils have attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists for decades because of their high number of rare and endemic taxa, though less is known about the ecological factors that govern the diversity and composition of serpentine communities. Theory suggests that vegetation on these low-productivity soils will be relatively resilient to fire, the most common natural disturbance in serpentine systems.
   . Methods : We studied the recovery of vegetation in Darlingtonia fens, a unique habitat dominated by herbaceous perennials, from a major fire that burned similar to 202,000 ha in California and Oregon's Klamath Mountains in 2002. We established permanent plots in eight unburned and eight burned fens in 2003 and recorded percent cover of vascular plant species. We re-sampled plots each year through 2007.
   . Key results : Burned fens had less plant cover than unburned fens for 2 yr after the fire. Average species density was similar to 10% lower in burned fens 1 yr after the fire but similar to 4-8% higher for the next 4 yr. Burned fens exhibited greater evenness but not until 4 yr after the fire. Differences in community composition were detected between the two fen types, but species ranks were similar, and species neither were added to nor removed from the burned assemblages.
   . Conclusions : Burning of Darlingtonia fens has detectable, albeit modest, effects on serpentine communities. Because fens have little or no canopy cover, fire has little influence on light availability in this system. This relatively small resource change, combined with high soil moisture and well-developed underground organs of fen plants, produces a highly resilient assemblage.

AB Wildfire in boreal permafrost peatlands causes a thickening and warming of the seasonally thawed active layer, exposing large amounts of soil carbon to microbial processes and potential release as greenhouse gases. In this study, conducted in the discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada, we monitored soil thermal regime and soil respiration throughout the 2016 growing season at an unburned peat plateau and two nearby peat plateaus that burned 16 and 9 years prior to the study. Maximum seasonal soil temperature at 40 cm depth was 4 ;C warmer in the burned sites, and active layers were ?90 cm thicker compared to the unburned site. Despite the deeper and warmer seasonally thawed active layer, we found higher soil respiration in the unburned site during the first half of the growing season. We partitioned soil respiration into contribution from shallow and deep peat using a model driven by soil temperatures at 10 and 40 cm depths. Cumulative estimated deep soil respiration throughout the growing season was four times greater in the burned sites than in the unburned site, 32 and 8 g C m(?2) respectively. Concurrently, cumulative shallow soil respiration was estimated to be lower in the burned than unburned site, 49 and 80 g C m(?2) respectively, likely due to the removal of the microbially labile soil carbon in the shallow peat. Differences in deep contribution to soil respiration were supported by radiocarbon analysis in fall. With effects of wildfire on soil thermal regime lasting for up to 25 years in these ecosystems, we conclude that increased loss of deep, old, soil carbon during this period is of similar magnitude as the direct carbon losses from combustion during wildfire and thus needs to be considered when assessing overall impact of wildfire on carbon cycling in permafrost peatlands.

AB Freshwater peatlands represent an important component of global biogeochemistry through their role in carbon sequestration. Threats to carbon storage in freshwater peat include climate-related increases in rates of oxidation and methanogenesis, increased wildfires, drainage, and dissolved organic carbon export from runoff. This paper discusses the potential impact of sea level rise on carbon fluxes from coastal peatlands, an issue not addressed by previous studies describing threats to peatlands from global climate change. We estimate carbon stocks and potential emissions from a coastal freshwater peatland located in North Carolina, United States. Four scenarios for inundation were modeled using Hadley-CM3 scenarios (including the effects of collapsed barrier islands) with a lidar-derived digital elevation model. Monte Carlo analysis was used to address model uncertainty and sensitivity of carbon emission parameters for three scenarios. Total existing carbon storage (peat and vegetation) on the Peninsula (5671 km 2) was estimated to range between 155.5 and 201.0 TgC (95% confidence intervals). Sea level projections ranged from 0.35 to 1.38 m by the end of the century and were estimated to inundate between 1260 and 3020 km 2 of the Peninsula. Carbon emissions from inundation of peat and vegetation ranged from 4.7-20.9 TgC (assuming inundation preserved peat deposits) to 99.4-128.0 TgC (assuming 100% emissions of inundated peat). While considerable uncertainty exists regarding the fate of carbon fluxes, we identify 150,000 km 2 of freshwater peatlands worldwide below 5-m elevation and vulnerable to sea level rise. Our study suggests that future sea level rise may contribute a positive feedback to the global carbon cycle.

AB Soil carbon sequestration and avoidable emissions through peatland restoration are both strategies to tackle climate change. Here we compare their potential and environmental costs regarding nitrogen and land demand. In the event that no further areas are exploited, drained peatlands will cumulatively release 80.8 Gt carbon and 2.3 Gt nitrogen. This corresponds to a contemporary annual greenhouse gas emission of 1.91 (0.31-3.38) Gt CO2-eq. that could be saved with peatland restoration. Soil carbon sequestration on all agricultural land has comparable mitigation potential. However, additional nitrogen is needed to build up a similar carbon pool in organic matter of mineral soils, equivalent to 30-80% of the global fertilizer nitrogen application annually. Restoring peatlands is 3.4 times less nitrogen costly and involves a much smaller land area demand than mineral soil carbon sequestration, calling for a stronger consideration of peatland rehabilitation as a mitigation measure.

AB Plant litter chemistry is a key driver of decomposition in peatlands. This study explored the relative contributions of phylogeny and environment to litter chemistry of peat mosses (Sphagnum), the key peat-forming plants on earth.
   Fifteen Sphagnum species, representing three taxonomic sections ACUTIFOLIA, CUSPIDATA and SPHAGNUM, were sampled across a wide range of hydro-geochemical conditions. For all species we characterised chemical composition within (i) inorganic elements, (ii) carbohydrate polymers (iii) non-carbohydrates.
   The variation in carbohydrates was mostly explained by taxonomic section, suggesting phylogenetic conservation of carbohydrate composition. ACUTIFOLIA species invested relatively more in pectins, whereas CUSPIDATA and SPHAGNUM species invested more in hemicellulose. The composition of non-carbohydrates was mainly influenced by environment, except for some constituents for which the variation was more correlated to phylogeny. Finally, the variation in inorganic element concentrations mostly reflected hydro-geochemical conditions within and between peatlands.
   The separation into an environmentally independent, phylogenetically conserved group of compounds (structural carbohydrates) and an environmentally dependent, variable group of compounds (inorganic elements, non-carbohydrates) has important implications both for understanding patterns in and for upscaling of spatially variable ecosystem processes associated with peat decomposition such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB The relationship between diversity and productivity remains a contentious issue in ecology. Although some have asserted that the relationship is always hump-shaped, a comprehensive literature survey found no single relationship. We conducted a comprehensive examination of the components of scale (grain, focus and extent) across a geographic hierarchy (e.g. spatially defined) and two overlapping ecological hierarchies defined by formations and community types.
   We examined how species richness of terrestrial vascular plants varies with net primary productivity in 901 stands scattered across the state of Wisconsin, USA. We found no single relationship between species richness and productivity. Instead, the relationship depends on the components of scale (grain, focus or extent) and hierarchy (ecological or geographic). For the state as a whole, the relationship was U-shaped. Such U-shaped relationships, while found previously, have been noted rarely and ignored completely by theory. For the geographic hierarchy, with increasing extent the relationship went from hump-shaped to negative to U-shaped. Increasing the grain resulted in the opposite pattern, the relationship going from U-shaped to negative to hump-shaped. With increasing focus, the relationship became negative. For the ecological hierarchy among community types, increasing the grain changed the relationship to negative, whereas for the among-formation hierarchy, increasing the grain eliminated any relationships. In contrast, increasing the focus among community types strengthened the U-shaped relationship, but similarly eliminated it among formations. Decreasing the extent examining individual formations or community types - generally eliminated the relationship, although a negative relationship was found for prairies and sand barrens, a positive relationship was found for bracken grasslands, and U-shaped relationships were found for northern upland forests. These results have implications for how we study the effects of scale, its components, the effects of sampling bias, and the scale at which various causal mechanisms might be operating.

TI PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS IN FARM WOODLANDS
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Review
ID NATURE RESERVES; BRITISH
AB The Farm Woodlands Scheme (FWS) contains an implicit assumption that farm woodlands produce important benefits to wildlife.  The aim of this study was to discover whether there are benefits, in terms only of plant species richless, that can be discerned in farm woodlands that were established during the first half of the twentieth century.  A survey of 33 farm woodlands (0.1-30.6 ha) in the Vale of York produced lists of 54 species of trees and shrubs and 133 species of non-woody flowering plants and ferns.  Despite the sample including obviously different woodland types, no obvious reasons for the plant assemblages could be discovered.  Area was a good predictor of species richness, but, contrary to some expectations of island biogeography theory, neither isolation nor woodland shape could predict species richness.  The majority of typical woodland herbaceous species is absent in woodlands smaller than 1.5 ha.  To achieve the potential 'wildlife dividend' of the FWS, larger areas (at least 1.5 ha and preferably over 5 ha) should be planted, incorporating existing woody vegetation, but avoiding bogs and ancient meadow remnants.

AB Sphagnum mosses are keystone components of peatland ecosystems. They facilitate the accumulation of carbon in peat deposits, but climate change is predicted to expose peatland ecosystem to sustained and unprecedented warming leading to a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere. Sphagnum responses to climate change, and their interaction with other components of the ecosystem, will determine the future trajectory of carbon fluxes in peatlands. We measured the growth and productivity of Sphagnum in an ombrotrophic bog in northern Minnesota, where ten 12.8-m-diameter plots were exposed to a range of whole-ecosystem (air and soil) warming treatments (+0 to +9 degrees C) in ambient or elevated (+500 ppm) CO2. The experiment is unique in its spatial and temporal scale, a focus on response surface analysis encompassing the range of elevated temperature predicted to occur this century, and consideration of an effect of co-occurring CO2 altering the temperature response surface. In the second year of warming, dry matter increment of Sphagnum increased with modest warming to a maximum at 5 degrees C above ambient and decreased with additional warming. Sphagnum cover declined from close to 100% of the ground area to <50% in the warmest enclosures. After three years of warming, annual Sphagnum productivity declined linearly with increasing temperature (13-29 g C/m(2) per degrees C warming) due to widespread desiccation and loss of Sphagnum. Productivity was less in elevated CO2 enclosures, which we attribute to increased shading by shrubs. Sphagnum desiccation and growth responses were associated with the effects of warming on hydrology. The rapid decline of the Sphagnum community with sustained warming, which appears to be irreversible, can be expected to have many follow-on consequences to the structure and function of this and similar ecosystems, with significant feedbacks to the global carbon cycle and climate change.

AB Shallow ponds associated with peatlands in boreal Alberta contain large quantities of stored carbon in their peaty sediments, and exhibit spatial changes in response to dry or wet conditions. Peatland ponds around Utikuma Lake experienced a partial to nearly complete drawdown in 2002, in response to drought. A fourfold investigation was begun to assess the natural drought and flood cycles, assess the current C stocks along the shore, determine what species were colonizing the newly exposed shorelines, and to place the magnitude of the current drought into historical perspective. Ten vegetation communities were found to have colonized the exposed sediments. Paleostratigraphy shows that the surface communities differ markedly from paleocommunities. Stratigraphy of the wetland sediments demonstrates that only two changes occurred, one a successional switch from a sedge-dominated marsh to a forested bog, the other a much more recent disturbance that caused water levels near the pond to rise. No evidence of constantly changing paleocommunities was found, suggesting that previous droughts have not left a visible paleorecord. The more recent disturbance has likely redistributed peat into the pond basins and subsequently it has broken down to detritial peat, altering its physical structure, and perhaps its rate of decomposition. Continued exposure of the peat is likely to enhance decomposition. In this study both flooding and drought may have impacted the wetland in ways likely to result in higher rates of decomposition and enhanced CO2 emissions under global warming.

AB The tree population size structure and relationship between tree diameter and age were examined in a subalpine fen and surrounding Picea-Abies forest in northern Colorado. The fen, grades from a sedge fen, through an ecotone, to a treed fen (i.e. fen colonized by trees). Tree growth rate varies across the vegetational gradient, with the sedge fen having the slowest growth, and the upland forest having the fastest growth. Differences in growth rate are related to the average size of pest hummocks, with areas containing tall hummocks exhibiting the highest tree growth rates. Size structures display the characteristic reverse-J distribution generally indicative of stable populations, but forest vegetation is expanding into the open regions of the fen, and within the treed fen an increase in Abies lasiocarpa is occurring. These changes are primarily attributed to a positive feedback situation wherein the fen's surface is built up by peat accumulation. Distinct hummocks form first on the open fen but then coalesce to form raised peat islands in the treed fen. This new substrate provides habitat with a comparatively low water table and allows the growth of mesophytic forest vegetation. A pathway for this vegetational development is proposed.

AB Possible effects of chemical alterations in peat following re-wetting on their microbial characteristics are insufficiently known. Microbial biomass carbon (C-mic), nitrogen (N-mic, phosphorus (P-mic) and acid phosphatase activity were investigated in re-wetted virtually undisturbed and differently degraded peatlands (Histosols) in northeast Germany to assess re-wetting effects on microbial biomass production and phosphorus (P) cycling in one growing season. The virtually undisturbed Eutri-Ombric Histosol had the largest content of microbial biomass (C-mic: 2132 mg/kg. N-mic: 309 mg/kg and P-mic: 48 mg/kg means of six sampling dates, upper 10cm). Increasingly lower contents of microbial biomass were observed in the more strongly degraded peats of two Ombri-Sapric Histosols. Furthermore, the proportions of P-mic as a percent of total P (P-t) were smallest in the strongly degraded Ombric-Sapric Histosol (1.6% of P-t) and gradually larger with better peat conservation (2.6% of P-t in the moderately degraded Ombri-Sapric Histosol and 3.0% of P-t in the virtually undisturbed Eutri-Ombric Histosol). The acid phosphatase activity was always greatest in May, irrespective of peat degradation, This maximum was lower for the Eutri-Ombric Histosol (2633 mug nitrophenol/(g h)) than for the two Ombri-Sapric Histosols (3963 and 3212 mug nitrophenol/(gh)). In the two degraded peats, the temporal variation in phosphatase activity was also more pronounced. Our results, in particular the higher peak phosphatase activity combined with an incorporation of P into microbial biomass, indicate that peat degradation may enhance the phosphate input to soil solution. Thus, it is concluded that modified biological P cycling could contribute to increased risks of P losses to adjacent surface water after re-wetting of degraded peats. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Question: Peatlands are globally important for carbon storage due to the imbalance between plant biomass production and decomposition. Distribution of both live standing biomass (BM, dry mass g/m(2)) and biomass production (BMP, dry mass gm(-2) growing season(-1)) are known to be dependent on the water table (WT). However, the relations of BM and BMP to WT variation are poorly known. Here we investigated, how the above- and below-ground BM and BMP of three different plant functional types (PFTs), dwarf shrubs, sedges and Sphagnum mosses, relate to natural WT variation within an ombrotrophic boreal bog. In addition, we estimated ecosystem-level BMP and compared that with ecosystem net primary production (NPP) derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements.
   Location: Siikaneva bog, Ruovesi, Finland.
   Methods: We quantified above- and below-ground BM and BMP of PFTs along the WT gradient, divided into six plant community types. Plant community scale BM and BMP were up-scaled to the ecosystem level. NPP was derived from EC measurements using a literature-based ratio of heterotrophic respiration to total ecosystem respiration.
   Results: BM varied from 211 to 979 g/m(2) among the plant community types, decreasing gradually from dry to wet community types. In contrast, BMP was similar between plant community types (162-216 g/m(2)), except on nearly vegetation-free bare peat surfaces where it was low (38 g/m(2)). Vascular plant BM turnover rate (BMP:BM, per year) varied from 0.14 to 0.30 among the plant community types, being highest in sedge-dominated hollows. On average 56% of the vascular BM was produced below ground. Mosses, when present, produced on average 31% of the total BM, ranging from 16% to 53% depending on community type. EC-derived NPP was higher than measured BMP due to underestimation of certain components.
   Conclusions: We found that the diversity of PFTs decreases the spatial variability in productivity of a boreal bog ecosystem. The observed even distribution of BMP resulted from different WT optima and BMP:BM of dwarf shrubs, sedges and Sphagnum species. These differences in biomass turnover rate and species responses to environmental conditions may provide a resilience mechanism for bog ecosystems in changing conditions.

AB Carbon dioxide exchange was measured, using the eddy covariance technique, during a one and a half year period in 1994 and 1995. The measurements took place over a former true raised bog, characterized by a shallow peat layer and a vegetation dominated by Molinia caerulea. The growing season extended from May until late October, with a maximum LAI in August of 1.7.
   The carbon balance shows a net release of 97 g C m(-2) y(-1) (265 kg C ha(-1) y(-1)) from the peat bog ecosystem to the atmosphere. During June, July and August there is net consumption of CO2, while during the rest of the year there is net production of CO2. The average daytime assimilation rates ranged between - 0.2 and - 0.5 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (- 45 and -11.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), in a period where the LAI ranged between 1 and 1.7. A high vapour pressure deficit (> 15 hPa) corresponding with high temperatures was found to reduce the assimilation rate by on average 50%. Apart from these factors, LAI and the soil temperature codetermine the net exchange of CO2.
   The total nocturnal respiration during the growing season lies within the same order as the average daytime net assimilation rate. Temperature was found to be the main fatter controlling soil respiration, with a Q(10) of 4.8.

AB The study of mercury accumulation in peat cores provides an excellent opportunity to improve the knowledge on mercury cycling and depositional processes at remote locations far from pollution sources. We analyzed mercury concentrations in 150 peat samples from two cores from Rano Aroi (Easter Island, 27 degrees S) and in selected vegetation samples of present-day flora of the island, in order to characterize the mercury cycling for the last 71 ka BP. The mercury concentrations showed values ranging between 35 and 200 ng g(-1), except for a large maxima (1000 ng g(-1)) which occurred at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20 ka cal BP) in both peat cores. Low temperatures during the LGM would accelerate the atmospheric oxidation of Hg(0) to divalent mercury that, coupled with higher rainfall during this period, most likely resulted in a very efficient surface deposition of atmospheric mercury. Two exceptional short-lived Hg peaks occurred during the Holocene at 8.5 (350 ng g(-1)) and 4.7 (1000 ng g(-1)) ka cal BP. These values are higher than those recorded in most peat records belonging to the industrial period, highlighting that natural factors played a significant role in Hg accumulationsometimes even more so than anthropogenic sources. Our results suggest that wet deposition, linked to atmospheric oxidation, was the main process controlling the short-lived Hg events, both in the mire and in the catchment soils.

AB Understanding the controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange within saline boreal fens, appropriate natural analogs for landscape reclamation in areas affected by salinization in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, can provide insights into the biogeochemical and carbon sink functioning of constructed wetlands under saline conditions. Hence, this study aims to assess net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) of peatland and open-water areas within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) to determine environmental controls on CO(2)fluxes using community-scale CO(2)measurements along a salinity gradient. Strong positive correlations between NEE, GEP, leaf area index within peatland, and between GEP and vegetation density within open-water areas (ponds) were observed, demonstrating the importance of vegetation properties for carbon uptake. Strong negative correlations were found between NEE, GEP, R and water table depth and electrical conductivity within peatland. In contrast, GEP and R were positively correlated with phosphate concentrations in ponds, and electrical conductivity had no effect on CO(2)fluxes within ponds. In peatlands, links between CO(2)exchange and environmental factors were influenced by microtopography, and complex relationships between NEE, GEP, R and environmental variables were observed within depressions.

AB Elevated ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation has been reported to have few effects on plants but to alter the soil microbial community composition. However, the effects on soil microorganisms have to be mediated via plants, because direct radiation effects are only plausible on the uppermost millimeters of soil. Here, we assessed secondary effects of UVB on soil microbes. The responses in the dominant plant Eriophorum russeolum, peat pore water and microbial communities in the peat were recorded at a subarctic mire in the middle of the third growing season under field exposure simulating 20% depletion in the ozone layer. The UVB treatment significantly reduced the sucrose and the total soluble sugar (sucrose+glucose+fructose) concentration of the plant leaves while increasing the sucrose concentration in the belowground storage organ rhizome. The starch concentration of the leaves was also slightly reduced by elevated UVB. In the plant roots, carbohydrate concentrations remained unaffected but the total phenolics concentration increased under elevated UVB. We suggest that the simultaneously observed decrease in bacterial growth rate and the altered bacterial community composition are due to UVB-induced changes in the plant photosynthate allocation and potential changes in root exudation. There were no effects of elevated UVB on microbial biomass, peat pore water or nutrient concentrations in the peat. The observed responses are in line with the previously reported lower ecosystem dark respiration under elevated UVB, and they signify that the changed plant tissue quality and lower bacterial activity are likely to reduce decomposition.

AB We used methane-production measurements of slurried peat to study controls of methane production in six contrasting Appalachian wetland sites.  The sites differed widely in plant-community composition and in rates of methane production, which varied from 3-mu-mol/L/day in slurried-peat samples from a shrub-dominated bog to 216-mu-mol/L/day in peat from a spruce-forested wetland.  Three controlling factors of methane production were examined:  organic-chemical components of the peat (e.g., hot-water soluble, sulfuric acid soluble, sulfuric acid insoluble), concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, and rates of sulfate reduction.  Peats from shrub-dominated sites contained mostly acid-insoluble organic matter, which was presumably recalcitrant to microbial decomposition.  In contrast, peats from moss-and sedge-dominated sites contained mostly acid-soluble organic matter, which was presumably labile.  Differences of organic-chemical components of the peat could explain about 50% of the variation in rates of methane production among samples from the sites.  Rates of sulfate reduction in peat samples were relatively high (5-397-mu-mol/L/day), despite low in situ concentrations of dissolved sulfate (< 250-mu-mol/L), but sulfate reduction was not well correlated with rates of methane production, nor were concentrations of dissolved organic carbon.  Amendments of methanol and trimethylamine to peat samples from any individual site did not stimulate rates of methane production.  In general but not always, glucose, hydrogen, and acetate amendments stimulated rates of methane production.  Sulfate amendments that stimulated sulfate reduction also inhibited methane production by 90%; however, reversal of the inhibition was achieved by acetate and hydrogen amendments.  Control of methane production in these organic-rich wetlands is related more to organic-chemical components of the peat than to the activity of coincident sulfate-reducing bacteria.

AB A 415 cm thick permafrost peat section from the Verkhoyansk Mountains was radiocarbon-dated and studied using palaeobotanical and sedimentological approaches. Accumulation of organic-rich sediment commenced in a former oxbow lake, detached from a Dyanushka River meander during the Younger Dryas stadial, at similar to 12.5 kyr BP. Pollen data indicate that larch trees, shrub alder and dwarf birch were abundant in the vegetation at that time. Local presence of larch during the Younger Dryas is documented by well-preserved and radiocarbon-dated needles and cones. The early Holocene pollen assemblages reveal high percentages of Artemisia pollen, suggesting the presence of steppe-like communities around the site, possibly in response to a relatively warm and dry climate similar to 11.4-11.2 kyr BP. Both pollen and plant macrofossil data demonstrate that larch woods were common in the river valley. Remains of charcoal and pollen of Epilobium indicate fire events and mark a hiatus similar to 11.0-8.7 kyr BP. Changes in peat properties, C31/C27 alkane ratios and radiocarbon dates suggest that two other hiatuses occurred similar to 8.2-6.9 and similar to 6.7-0.6 kyr BP. Prior to 0.6 kyr BP, a major fire destroyed the mire surface. The upper 60 cm of the studied section is composed of aeolian sands modified in the uppermost part by the modern soil formation. For the first time, local growth of larch during the Younger Dryas has been verified in the western foreland of the Verkhoyansk Mountains (similar to 170 km south of the Arctic Circle), thus increasing our understanding of the quick reforestation of northern Eurasia by the early Holocene.

AB Peat accumulation makes nutrient-limited ombrotrophic bogs important carbon sinks, while enhanced atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition threatens this capacity. Here we show that the stoichiometry of peat and porewater, a control of plant growth and decomposition, has been altered in response to long-term N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization at Mer Bleue ombrotrophic bog in eastern Ontario, Canada. In N fertilized peat, receiving up to an additional 6.4 g N m(-2) y(-1) above ambient deposition, we found N significantly (p < 0.05) greater, P both significantly greater and smaller dependent on treatment concentration, calcium (Ca) and K concentrations significantly lower, relative to control plots. In NPK-fertilized peat, P was greater than control while Ca was significantly smaller. In the porewater of N- and NPK-fertilized peat, we observed significantly more ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphate, and dissolved organic phosphorus than in the controls. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that fertilization in all treatments increased decomposition, as indicated by residual enrichment of refractory moieties such as aromatics, carboxylates, and lignin, albeit only in the uppermost depths. Changes in peat quality may, however, not only relate to advanced decomposition but also to changes in litter input, as predominant vascular vegetation in the fertilized plots shared several features in FTIR spectra with samples of uppermost peat layers. Our results demonstrate that the peat in this ombrotrophic bog has responded to long-term fertilization with loss of Sphagnum moss and its filter function, increased shrub cover and enhanced decomposition.

AB Palaeoecological analyses of Falkland Island peat profiles have largely been confined to pollen analyses. In order to improve understanding of long-term Falkland Island peat development processes, the plant macrofossil and stable isotope stratigraphy of an 11,550 year Falkland Island Cortaderia pilosa ('white-grass') peat profile was investigated. The peatland developed into an acid, whitegrass peatland via a poor fen stage. Macrofossil charcoal indicate that local fires have frequently occurred throughout the development of the peatland. Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate changes in the intensity of burning which are likely to be related to changes in fuel types, abundance of fine fuels due to reduced evapotranspiration/higher rainfall (under weaker Southern Westerly Winds), peat moisture and human disturbance. Stable isotope and thermogravimetric analyses were used to identify a period of enhanced decomposition of the peat matrices dating from similar to 7020 cal yr BP, which possibly reflects increasing strength of the Southern Westerly winds. The application of Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses to the Falkland Island peat profile identified changes in fire intensity and decomposition which were not detectable using the techniques of macrofossil charcoal and plant macrofossil analyses.

AB Globally, peatlands provide an important sink of carbon in their near natural state but potentially act as a source of gaseous and dissolved carbon emission if not in good condition. There is a pressing need to remotely identify peatland sites requiring improvement and to monitor progress following restoration. A medium resolution model was developed based on a training dataset of peatland habitat condition and environmental covariates, such as morphological features, against information derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), covering Scotland (UK). The initial, unrestricted, model provided the probability of a site being in favourable condition. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves for restricted training data, limited to those located on a peat soil map, resulted in an accuracy of 0.915. The kappa statistic was 0.8151, suggesting good model fit. The derived map of predicted peatland condition at the suggested 0.56 threshold was corroborated by data from other sources, including known restoration sites, areas under known non-peatland land cover and previous vegetation survey data mapped onto inferred condition categories. The resulting locations of the areas of peatland modelled to be in favourable ecological condition were largely confined to the North and West of the country, which not only coincides with prior land use intensity but with published predictions of future retraction of the bioclimatic space for peatlands. The model is limited by a lack of spatially appropriate ground observations, and a lack of verification of peat depth at training site locations, hence future efforts to remotely assess peatland condition will require more appropriate ground-based monitoring. If appropriate ground-based observations could be collected, using remote sensing could be considered a cost-efficient means to provide data on changes in peatland habitat condition.

AB 1 Arctic ecosystems are sensitive to grazing because of their low overall net primary production. We therefore studied the effect of greater snow geese on the production of arctic graminoids.
   2 At Bylot Island, NWT (73 degrees N), breeding snow geese graze Eriophorum scheuchzeri and Dupontia fisheri in lowland polygon fens. Vegetation in seasonal exclosures was sampled at 2-week intervals from mid-June to mid-August 1990, 1991 and 1993 (ungrazed areas) and compared with plant growth in short-term exclosures set up over grazed areas. Standing crop (above-ground biomass), net above-ground primary production (NAPP) and nitrogen content were determined for both plant species.
   3 Goose faeces were used as an index of grazing intensity, Cumulative faeces counts increased from 2.2 faeces m(-2) in 1990-9.9 faeces m(-2) in 1993.
   4 Peak above-ground dry biomass of ungrazed areas averaged 33 g m(-2). In all years, goose grazing significantly reduced the above-ground biomass of Eriophorum and Dupontia. Over the 3 years, we estimated that geese consumed from 65 to 113% of the cumulative NAPP of Eriophorum, and from 30 to 78% of the cumulative NAPP of Dupontia. Consumption of Dupontia, but not Eriophorum, was related to grazing intensity.
   5 Cumulative NAPP of grazed areas was slightly lower than that of ungrazed areas at the end of the summer. On an individual plant basis, cumulative NAPP of Dupontia, but not of Eriophorum, was reduced by grazing. Nitrogen content of plants after grazing was higher than in ungrazed plants.
   6 Although grazed plants were able to grow new foliage, goose grazing did not enhance NAPP at Bylot Island as has been reported elsewhere. This could be either because grazing occurs too late in the season when the regrowth capacity of plants is low or because nutrients released from goose faeces are absorbed by mosses and are not immediately available to graminoids.

AB Background: Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site.
   Results: The OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500 km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95-97%. The CCQ was 85%, 85% and 71% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO(2 )flux which was 19% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands.
   Conclusions: The OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from "wetlands drainage and rewetting". The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios. However, the OBIA method is robust and accurate and could be used to assess the extent of drains in peatlands across the globe aiding the refinement of peatland carbon dynamics.

AB The paper presents original authors' data on the geochemical aspects and peat deposits and conditions of their accumulation at the three oligotrophic bogs in the south taiga subzone of West Siberia. These data were acquired with regard to a complex of factors impacting the development of peat deposits: the geomorphological setting in the landscape, the lithochemical composition of the underlying rocks, the physicochemical properties of the peat, and the contents of chemical elements and their distribution in the peat profiles. The impact of the geomorphological factor is reflected in the different ratios of peat layer thicknesses in the peat deposits of different type. The composition of the underlying rocks affected the concentration of elements and their distribution within the peat profile. The main element associations in the peat deposits of the bogs are identified using the method of principal components. The distribution of the elements in the peat deposits is shown to be differentially influenced by a number of factors: endogenous supply of elements from the underlying rocks and groundwater (Ca, Fe, Ti, Ni, Cu, Co, Cr, Ba, Cd, and Sr), the activity of redox processes (Mn, Pb, and Fe), redox-independent processes of the dissolution and mobilization of elements by plant roots (Ca, Cu, and Fe), the rate of peat decomposition (Mn, Pb, and the C/N ratio), the water level in the peatlands (C/N ratio), and atmospheric supply of anthropogenic compounds as a result of human activities (Pb).

AB 1 This investigation uses detailed stratigraphic studies across an uneroded area of hummock-and-hollow blanket mire adjacent to well-developed erosion gullies in the Southern Pennines to examine the formation of surface patterning and of reticulate (Type 1) gully systems.
   2 The stratigraphic profile of a 15-m section encompassing three hummocks, three hollows and an erosion gully is reconstructed from macrofossil and pollen analyses of twenty peat cores along the section.
   3 Contemporaneous levels in the profile are established from the pollen analyses, and dated by reference to radiocarbon assays of 12 peat samples spanning a time interval from 430 to 2695 years BP. Major increases or decreases in Plantago pollen occur at c. 100 BC, AD 350 and AD 1150 (based on calibrated radiocarbon dates).
   4 Periodic concentrations of carbonized plant material in the macrofossil analyses are shown to relate to a series of at least 15 laterally continuous burning horizons in the stratigraphic profile. Burning horizons at c. AD 1250, 1000 and 150, and 230, 380 and 860 BC (based on calibrated radiocarbon dates) are used in conjunction with the Plantago pollen horizons to reconstruct the changing configurations of the mire surface along the study transect over the last 2800 years.
   5 The reconstruction shows that microtopographic differentiation of the mire surface on Alport Moor into pools, hollows and hummocks resulted from differential rates of peat accumulation locally within a rather featureless vegetation cover that had developed by about 2200 years ago. Areas of retarded peat accumulation developed gradually into hollows and pools over a time-period of more than 1000 years. There is no evidence for the existence of a regeneration cycle of peat accumulation in the profiles.

AB The decomposition rate of four species of peat-forming plants typical of bog phytocenoses in the southern taiga subzone of Western Siberia-Sphagnum fuscum, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Eriophorum vaginatum, and Sphagnum angustifolium-was determined in the 3-yr field experiment. The research was performed by the method of partially isolated samples on the Timiryazevskoe and Bakcharskoe bogs, differing in their hydrological regime and temperature condition. Regardless of the chemical composition of the peat-forming plants, their decomposition was characterized by the most significant mass loss over the first year of studies. By the end of the third year, the destruction of plant residues was slowed down, and the decomposition constant value for all the studied plant species decreased by 1.2-2.8 times. The decomposition of peat-forming plants was the slowest under wetter conditions of the Bakcharskoe bog, where the mass losses of all the species studied, except for Eriophorum vaginatum, were 1.2-1.6 times lower than on the Timiryazevskoe bog. Over the three years of the experiment, the total mass loss and the decomposition constant value significantly differed for S. fuscum and Chamaedaphne calyculata, as well as for two sphagnum species (S. fuscum and S. angustifolium). Positive correlations between the mass loss of peat-forming plants (except for S. angustifolium) and the sums of temperatures of the peat deposit, exceeding 0, 5, and 10 degrees C, were revealed. The lowering of the water table level resulted in a significant increase in the intensity of the decomposition processes for all the studied plant species, except for Eriophorum vaginatum.

AB Two C-14 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) wiggle-match dated peat sequences from Denmark and northern England record changes in mire Surface wetness reconstructed using plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analyses. A number of significant mid-late Holocene climatic deteriorations (wet shifts) associated with declines in solar activity were recorded (at ca. 2150 cal. yr BC, 740 cal. yr BC, cal. yr AD 930, cal. yr AD 1020, cal. yr AD 1280-1300, cal. yr AD 1640 and cal. yr AD 1790-1830). The wet shifts identified from ca. cal. yr AD 930 are Concurrent with or lag decreases in solar activity by 10-50 years. These changes are replicated by previous records from these and other sites in the region and the new records provide improved precision for the ages of these changes. The rapidly accumulating (LIP to 2-3 yr cm(-1), similar to 1310 yr old, 34 14 C dates) Danish profile offers an unprecedented high-resolution record of climate change from a peat bog, and has effectively recorded a number of significant but short-lived climate change events since ca. cal. yr AD 690. The longer time intervals between samples and the greater length of time resolved by each sample in the British site due to slower peat accumulation rates (up to 11 yr cm(-1), similar to 5250 yr old, 42 14 C dates) acted as a natural smoothing filter preventing the clear registration of some of the rapid climate change events. Not all the significant rises in water table registered in the peat bog archives of the British and Danish sites have been caused by solar forcing, and may be the result of other processes Such as changes in other external forcing factors, the internal variability of the climate system or raised bog ecosystem.

AB Slow rates of plant production and decomposition in ombrotrophic bogs are believed to be partially the result of low nutrient availability. To test the effect of nutrient availability on decomposition, carbon dioxide ( CO2) flux dynamics, microbial biomass, and nutrients, we added nitrogen ( N) with phosphorus ( P) and potassium ( K), to prevent limitation of the latter 2 nutrients, over 2 growing seasons to plots at Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada. After the first growing season, increasing N fertilization ( with constant P and K) decreased in vitro CO2 production potential and increased microbial biomass measured with a chloroform fumigation- extraction technique in the upper peat profile, while by the end of the second season, CO2 production potential was increased in response to N plus PK treatment, presumably due to more easily decomposable newly formed plant material. In situ CO2 fluxes measured using chamber-techniques over the second year corroborated this presumption, with greater photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration ( ER) during high N plus PK treatments. The more efficient microbial community, with slower CO2 production potential and larger biomass, after the first year was characterized by larger fungal biomass measured with signature phospholipid fatty acids. The majority of N was likely quickly sequestered by the vegetation and transferred to dissolved organic forms and microbial biomass in the upper parts of the peat profile, while additional P relative to controls was distributed throughout the profile, implying that the vegetation at the site was N limited. However, in situ CO2 flux data suggested the possibility of P or NPK limitation. We hypothesize that nutrient deposition may lead to enhanced C uptake by altering the microbial community and decomposition, however this pattern disappears through subsequent changes in the vegetation and production of more readily decomposable plant tissues.

AB Decomposing leaf litter is a large supply of energy and nutrients for soil microorganisms. How long decaying leaves continue to fuel anaerobic microbial activity in wetland ecosystems is poorly understood. Here, we compare leaf litter from 15 tree species with different growth forms (angiosperms and gymnosperms, deciduous, and longer life span), using litterbags positioned for up to 4 years in a forested peatland in New York State. Periodically, we incubated partially decayed residue per species with fresh soil to assess its ability to fuel microbial methane (CH4) production and concomitant anaerobic carbon dioxide (CO2) production. Decay rates varied by leaf type: deciduous angiosperm > evergreen gymnosperm > deciduous gymnosperm. Decay rates were slower in leaf litter with a large concentration of lignin. Soil with residue of leaves decomposed for 338 days had greater rates of CH4 production (5.8 A mu mol g(-1) dry mass d(-1)) than less decomposed (< 0.42 A mu mol g(-1) dry mass d(-1)) or more decomposed (2.1 A mu mol g(-1) dry mass d(-1)) leaf residue. Species-driven differences in their ability to fuel CH4 production were evident throughout the study, whereas concomitant rates of CO2 production were more similar among species and declined with degree of decomposition. Methane production rates exhibited a positive correlation with pectin and the rate of pectin decomposition. This link between leaf litter decay rates, biochemical components in leaves, and microorganisms producing greenhouse gases should improve predictions of CH4 production in wetlands.

AB The northern and eastern sides of the Cuilcagh Mountain upland, in northwest Ireland, are mantled with over 50 km(2) of blanket bog that has experienced an unusually high spatial and temporal frequency of peat mass movements. In all, 29 peaty-debris slides, nine bog slides, two peat slides and five more peat landslides of uncertain type have been recorded within this study area. More than 27 km(2) of this peatland has been afforded several levels of statutory protection as well as international recognition of its geo-environmental importance. Field and laboratory investigations of the peat at several of the more recent failure sites showed it to be typical of Irish and Pennine (northern England) blanket bogs in most physical and hydrological respects. Field geomorphological evidence and modelling of stability thresholds indicate that the particular susceptibility of the Cuilcagh Mountain blanket bog to failure arises from two local factors: (i) the attainment of threshold maximum peat depths on the East Cuilcagh plateau, and (ii) the unconformable deposition of thin layers of glacial till (in places) and blanket peat over the pre-existing topographic surface formed from the major shale formations that underlie the northern slopes. With two exceptions, there is no conclusive evidence that human activities and management strategies for the area have had any significant influence on the occurrence of the peat landslides. The high frequency of large rainfall events since 1961 that did not trigger landslides suggests that failures are unlikely to become more frequent in response to climate change effects because they are controlled by slowly changing internal thresholds.

AB Biogenic NMVOCs are mainly formed by plants and microorganisms. They have strong impact on the local atmospheric chemistry when emitted to the atmosphere. The objective of this study was to determine if there are significant emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) from a subarctic mire in northern Sweden. Subarctic peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions are undergoing substantial environmental changes due to their high sensitivity to climate warming and there is need for including NMVOCs in the overall carbon budget. Automatic and manual chamber measurements were used to estimate NMVOC fluxes from three dominating subhabitats on the mire during three growing seasons. Emission rates varied and were related to plant species distribution and seasonal net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide. The highest fluxes were observed from wetter sites dominated by Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. Total NMVOC emissions from the mire (similar to 17 ha) is estimated to consist of similar to 150 kgC during a growing season with 150 d. NMVOC fluxes can account for similar to 5% of total net carbon exchange (-3177 kgC) at the mire during the same period. NMVOC emissions are therefore a significant component in a local carbon budget for peatlands.

AB Belowground climate change responses remain a key unknown in the Earth system. Plant fine-root response is especially important to understand because fine roots respond quickly to environmen-tal change, are responsible for nutrient and water uptake, and influence carbon cycling. However, fine-root responses to climate change are poorly constrained, especially in northern peatlands, which contain up to two-thirds of the world's soil carbon. We present fine-root responses to warming between +2 degrees C and 9 degrees C above ambient conditions in a whole-ecosystem peatland experi-ment. Warming strongly increased fine-root growth by over an order of magnitude in the warmest treatment, with stronger re-sponses in shrubs than in trees or graminoids. In the first year of treatment, the control (+0 degrees C) shrub fine-root growth of 0.9 km m(-2) y(-1) increased linearly by 1.2 km m(-2) y(-1) (130%) for every degree increase in soil temperature. An extended below -ground growing season accounted for 20% of this dramatic in-crease. In the second growing season of treatment, the shrub warming response rate increased to 2.54 km m(-2) degrees C-1. Soil mois-ture was negatively correlated with fine-root growth, highlighting that drying of these typically water-saturated ecosystems can fuel a surprising burst in shrub belowground productivity, one possible mechanism explaining the "shrubification" of northern peatlands in response to global change. This previously unrecognized mech-anism sheds light on how peatland fine-root response to warming and drying could be strong and rapid, with consequences for the belowground growing season duration, microtopography, vegetation composition, and ultimately, carbon function of these globally relevant carbon sinks.

AB We measured methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges from bare peat and Eriophorum vaginatum ssp. spissum tussocks at recently restored harvested peatlands near Shippagan, New Brunswick and Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec over three growing seasons (May to October). Average seasonal CH4 emission rates ranged from -1 to 65 mg (.) m(-2) (.) d(-1), with a generally weak relationship with water table position. A stronger relationship was seen between CH4 emissions and above-ground plant biomass. CH4 fluxes from E. vaginatum tussocks were larger than those from bare peat surfaces and increased with increasing above-ground biomass and photosynthetic rate. Clipping fresh leaves from tussocks reduced the CH4 emission rates by 79%. Photosynthesis rates were large in tussocks, ranging from 0.9 to 3.4 g CO2-C (.) m(-2) (.) h(-1) at high light levels, and respiration rates (autotrophic + heterotrophic) ranged from -0.1 to -1.3 g CO2-C (.) M-2 (.) h(-1). Some tussocks exhibited net CO2 loss to the atmosphere, even under high light levels. Although the rapid colonization of restored peat surfaces by E. vaginatum aids the development of other vascular plants and mosses, it increases the flux Of CH4 to the atmosphere and provides little or no net C accumulation on the peat surface.

AB aOverburden and tailings materials from oil sands production were used as construction materials as part of a novel attempt to create a self-sustaining, peat accumulating fen-upland ecosystem. To evaluate the potential for elemental release from the construction materials, total elemental concentrations in the tailings sand, petroleum coke and peat used to construct a fen ecosystem were determined using microwave-assisted acid digestions and compared to a leaching experiment conducted under environmentally-relevant conditions. A comparison of solid phase to aqueous Na, Ca, S and Mg concentrations showed they were highly leachable in the materials: Given that the concentrations of these elements can affect plant community structure, it is important to understand their leachability and mobility as they migrate between materials used to construct the system. To that end, a mass balance of aqueous Na, Ca, S and Mg was conducted based on leaching experiments and materials analysis coupled with existing data from the constructed system. The data indicate that there is a large pool of leachable Na, Ca, S and Mg in the system, estimated at 27 t of Na, 14 t of Ca, 37.3 t of S and 8.8 t of Mg. Since recharge mainly drives the fen-upland system water regime, and discharge in the fen, evapo-accumulation of these solutes on the surface may occur. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands in the Western Balkans are becoming rapidly reduced due to vegetation succession, further enhanced by climate change and abandonment of traditional land management practices. Currently, the peatlands of this region act as habitat islands embedded mainly in a forest landscape matrix. This allows them to host more forest and generalist species of animals and plants than would be expected from such ecosystem. We were interested in testing if a taxon, unspecialized for such extreme habitats, can maintain stable populations in a peatland, and how environmental fluctuations affect its spatio-temporal distributions along a successional gradient Terrestrial isopods were sampled in four habitat types: a fen, two successional habitats and a beech forest, with pitfall traps during two consecutive years. In total, 1069 individuals belonging to five species were recorded. Activity density increased more than four-fold along the successional gradient, from the fen to an older and more complex successional habitat. This pattern was governed by an increase in the structural complexity of the habitat, where succession habitats supported more favourable shelter sites for terrestrial isopods. Soil moisture decreased over 30% along the successional gradient Additionally, the older successional habitat was more nutrient rich than the fen, providing higher substrate quality for decomposers and enabling the survival of forest species. The fen was inhabited by a single species, Ligidium germanicum, while other species were extremely rare. Its seasonal activity started in the spring, reaching the maximum in June and decreasing at the end of summer. Spatial changes in isopod assemblages along the successional gradient imply that the groundwater level in the fen was sufficiently high to supress the invasion of forest species into the fen. Colonisation of the fen by terrestrial isopods will likely progress as environmental conditions become more suitable by progressive vegetation succession and climate change.

AB Northern peatlands contain up to 25% of the world's soil carbon (C) and have an estimated annual exchange of CO2-C with the atmosphere of 0.1-0.5 Pg yr(-1) and of CH4-C of 10-25 Tg yr(-1). Despite this overall importance to the global C cycle, there have been few, if any, complete multiyear annual C balances for these ecosystems. We report a 6-year balance computed from continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), regular instantaneous measurements of methane (CH4) emissions, and export of dissolved organic C (DOC) from a northern ombrotrophic bog. From these observations, we have constructed complete seasonal and annual C balances, examined their seasonal and interannual variability, and compared the mean 6-year contemporary C exchange with the apparent C accumulation for the last 3000 years obtained from C density and age-depth profiles from two peat cores. The 6-year mean NEE-C and CH4-C exchange, and net DOC loss are -40.2 +/- 40.5 (+/- 1 SD), 3.7 +/- 0.5, and 14.9 +/- 3.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), giving a 6-year mean balance of -21.5 +/- 39.0 g m(-2) yr(-1) (where positive exchange is a loss of C from the ecosystem). NEE had the largest magnitude and variability of the components of the C balance, but DOC and CH4 had similar proportional variabilities and their inclusion is essential to resolve the C balance. There are large interseasonal and interannual ranges to the exchanges due to variations in climatic conditions. We estimate from the largest and smallest seasonal exchanges, quasi-maximum limits of the annual C balance between 50 and -105 g m(-2) yr(-1). The net C accumulation rate obtained from the two peatland cores for the interval 400-3000 bp (samples from the anoxic layer only) were 21.9 +/- 2.8 and 14.0 +/- 37.6 g m(-2) yr(-1), which are not significantly different from the 6-year mean contemporary exchange.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated one third of the Earth's soil carbon stock since the last Ice Age. Rapid warming across northern biomes threatens to accelerate rates of peatland ecosystem respiration. Despite compensatory increases in net primary production, greater ecosystem respiration could signal the release of ancient, century- to millennia-old carbon from the peatland organic matter stock. Warming has already been shown to promote ancient peatland carbon release, but, despite the key role of vegetation in carbon dynamics, little is known about how plants influence the source of peatland ecosystem respiration. Here, we address this issue using insitu(14)C measurements of ecosystem respiration on an established peatland warming and vegetation manipulation experiment. Results show that warming of approximately 1 degrees C promotes respiration of ancient peatland carbon (up to 2100years old) when dwarf-shrubs or graminoids are present, an effect not observed when only bryophytes are present. We demonstrate that warming likely promotes ancient peatland carbon release via its control over organic inputs from vascular plants. Our findings suggest that dwarf-shrubs and graminoids prime microbial decomposition of previously locked-up' organic matter from potentially deep in the peat profile, facilitating liberation of ancient carbon as CO2. Furthermore, such plant-induced peat respiration could contribute up to 40% of ecosystem CO2 emissions. If consistent across other subarctic and arctic ecosystems, this represents a considerable fraction of ecosystem respiration that is currently not acknowledged by global carbon cycle models. Ultimately, greater contribution of ancient carbon to ecosystem respiration may signal the loss of a previously stable peatland carbon pool, creating potential feedbacks to future climate change.

AB Two peat profiles were collected in a peat bog located in Southern Poland and their geochronology were determined using Pb-210, Pu-238,Pu-239+240 and Cs-137 radiometric techniques. The Pb-210 chronologies were established using the constant rate of supply model (CRS) and are in good agreement with the Pu isotopes and Cs-137 time markers. Maximum activities of Pu isotopes were found at a depth corresponding to the early 1960s, which is the period characterized by the maximum nuclear weapon tests. The results showed that the Pb-210 method is the most accurate technique for the determination age and accumulation rate of a peat. The next part of this study calculated linear accumulation rates by analyzing Pu-238,Pu-239+240 and Cs-137 vertical distributions in the profiles. Activities of fallout isotopes were also measured in plants covering the peatland. The highest activities of Cs-137 and Pb-210 were found in Calluna vulgaris samples, and Pu239+24 were found only in two samples (C vulgaris and leaves of Oxycoccus quadripelatus).

AB We studied bacterial production and respiration in acidic, carbon-rich waters originating from natural, drained, and restored mires during dry and rainy summers. In addition, we tested how mixing of these waters with oligotrophic lake water affected short-term microbial activity and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). After mire restoration, concentrations of DOC, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), ammonium (NH4-N), and phosphate (PO4-P) increased in mire waters. Concentrations of DOC and organic N also increased after a rainy period in waters running from drained and natural mires. Bacterial production and respiration were strongly correlated with the concentrations of DOC, N, and P. Microbial activity in lake water was stimulated by these compounds in the mire waters. Bacterial growth efficiency was strongly related to the availability of NH4-N. Mixing of lake water with mire waters caused no additional stimulation of DOC decomposition; thus, our results do not support the "priming effect" hypothesis that lake-originated DOC would promote decomposition of recalcitrant mire-originated DOC in oligotrophic headwater lakes.

AB The end-Triassic mass extinction event (similar to 201.4 million years ago) caused major faunal and floral turnovers in both the marine and terrestrial realms. The biotic changes have been attributed to extreme greenhouse warming across the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary caused by massive release of carbon dioxide and/or methane related to extensive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), resulting in a more humid climate with increased storminess and lightning activity. Lightning strikes are considered the primary source of wildfires, producing charcoal, microscopically recognized as inertinite macerals. The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of pyrolytic origin and allochthonous charcoal in siliciclastic T-J boundary strata has suggested widespread wildfire activity at the time. We have investigated largely autochthonous coal and coaly beds across the T-J boundary in Sweden and Denmark. These beds consist of predominantly organic material from the in situ vegetation in the mires, and as the coaly beds represent a substantial period of time they are excellent environmental archives. We document a remarkable increase in inertinite content in the coal and coaly beds across the T-J boundary. We show estimated burning temperatures derived from inertinite reflectance measurements coupled with palynological data and conclude that pre-boundary late Rhaetian mire wildfires included high-temperature crown fires, whereas latest Rhaetian-Sinemurian mire wildfires were more frequent but dominated by lower temperature surface fires. Our results suggest a major change in the mire ecosystems across the T-J boundary from forested, conifer dominated mires to mires with a predominantly herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. Contrary to the overall regional vegetation for which onset of recovery commenced in the early Hettangian, the sensitive mire ecosystem remained affected during the Hettangian and did not start to recover until around the Hettangian-Sinemurian boundary. Decreasing inertinite content through the Lower Jurassic suggests that fire activity gradually resumed to considerable lower levels.

AB The Sanjiang Plain (SJP) wetland is the largest freshwater marshland in China. Peatlands were initiated early and are widely distributed across the SJP and form a large carbon (C) pool. Consequently, there is a growing interest in understanding past, present, and future peatland dynamics. Most studies on peatland dynamics have been carried out on boreal and subarctic region; however, there are limited data about peatland dynamics on temperate region, such as SJP wetland, which is sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. Here, we presented a data synthesis of basal peat ages, peatland area, and peat C accumulation rate in the SJP to examine Holocene peatland dynamics and climate sensitivity, along with total C storage and their future fate. We show that peatland initiation in the SJP started in the early Holocene, but the most intense period of peatland initiation occurred during the late Holocene, when the climate was colder and drier than the early and mid-Holocene. And the C accumulation rate also continued to increase during the late Holocene. Our results suggest that insolation and monsoon intensity as well as the local topographic characteristics and hydrology during the late Holocene in the SJP might have played an important role in causing the highest rates of peatland initiation and C accumulation. Based on the Second National Wetland Resources Survey data, we estimated that the total peatland covered an area of about 10,520km(2) on the SJP and currently stores similar to 0.26PgC. However, human activities, together with the widespread warming on the SJP over the past 60years, not only reduce the area of wetlands but also have switched it from being a net C sink to a significant C source.

AB This study explored the potential of optical and thermal satellite imagery to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the position of the water table depth (WTD) in the peat layer of northern bogs. We evaluated three different trapezoid models that are proposed in the literature for soil moisture monitoring in regions with mineral soils. Due to the tight capillary connection between water table and surface soil moisture, we hypothesized that the soil moisture indices retrieved from these models would be correlated with WTD measured in situ. Two trapezoid models were based on optical and thermal imagery, also known as Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Models (TOTRAM), and one was based on optical imagery alone, also known as the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM). The models were applied to Landsat imagery from 2008 to 2019 and the derived soil moisture indices were compared with in-situ WTD from eight locations in two Estonian bogs. Our results show that only the OPTRAM index was significantly (p-value < 0.05) correlated in time with WTD (average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.41 and 0.37, for original and anomaly time series, respectively), while the two tested TOTRAM indices were not. The highest temporal correlation coefficients (up to 0.8) were observed for OPTRAM over treeless parts of the bogs. An assessment of the spatial correlation between soil moisture indices and WTD indicated that all three models did not capture the spatial variation in water table depth. Instead, the spatial patterns of the indices were primarily attributable to vegetation patterns.

AB Wetlands restoration has been implemented on sites exploited for agricultural for over a decade in Eastern Europe. However, little is known about microbial diversity in this region. Microbial processes and patterns can be used as sensitive indicators of changes in environmental conditions. The responses of ciliates wetlands restoration are largely unexplored. Based on the results of a long-term study in fen of the Poleski National Park (Poland), we assumed that restoration causes changes in the physicochemical properties of fen water and sought to answer the question of how ciliate communities react to these changes and whether these microorganisms can play a significant role as bioindicators in evaluating the restoration process. Twenty taxa were recorded in the ciliate community, with 16 taxa found prior to restoration and 12 after restoration. Restoration clearly modified the taxonomic composition and abundance of ciliates. This was reflected in a decrease in the abundance and in the density of these protozoa and in a significant increase in the proportion of euplanktonic species. Before restoration, the most common ciliates were Cinetochilum margaritaceum and Strombidium viride, while the proportion of Paramecium bursaria increased after restoration. We also observed that the improvement in hydrological conditions, and hence the transformation of the vegetation structure in the peat bog, causes changes in the trophic structure of ciliates. The RDA analysis showed that all variables together accounted for 86.9% of the total variance. However, variables that significantly explained the variance in ciliate communities were water level, temperature, pH, and nutrients. Our results suggest that an indicator species approach based on functional groups may be appropriate for biomonitoring fens restoration.

AB Aims: To investigate the floristic and abiotic characteristics of the Habitats Directive priority habitat 'Petrifying springs with tufa formation (Cratoneurion)'. Location: The island of Ireland, north-western Europe. Methods: Vascular plants, bryophytes and abiotic variables were recorded in a field survey of 186 releves (4 m(2)). Releves were assigned to groups based on species composition, using fuzzy clustering and Indicator Species Analysis. Eight plant communities were described. Results: Group 1 Eucladium verticillatum-Pellia endiviifolia Tufa Cascades, of steep slopes, are related to Continental Eucladietum verticillati and Adiantion communities. Group 2 Palustriella commutata-Geranium robertianum Springheads and Group 3 Brachythecium rivularePlatyhy-pnidium riparioides Tufaceous Streams and Flushes are woodland communities related to the Equiseto telmatejae-Fraxinetum and the Pellio endiviifoliae-Cratoneuretum commutati. Groups 1 to 3 fall broadly within the Brachythecio rivularis-Cratoneuretum forest spring vegetation type. Group 4 Palustriella commutataAgrostis stolonifera Springheads are intermediate between Groups 1 to 3 and Groups 5 to 8. Group 5 Schoenus nigricans Springs, Group 6 Carex lepidocarpa Small Sedge Springs and Group 7 Palustriella falcata-Carex panicea Springs are transitional to Caricion davallianae small-sedge fen communities. Group 8 Saxifraga aizoides-Seligeria oelandica Springs are ecologically distinctive, species-rich assemblages confined to montane cliffs, with a restricted distribution in upland limestone regions, containing a number of nationally and internationally rare taxa. Of our eight groups, Groups 7 and 8 have the closest affinities with Cratoneureturn falcati spring communities. Abiotic variables differ significantly among the eight groups. Slope, macronutrient levels and shading by tree canopies are highly significantly related to the main axes of variation in the floristic data. Species diversity is inversely related to phosphate levels. Group 8 communities are irrigated by water of the highest pH and lowest solute concentrations. Conclusions: Our eight groups characterise variation within the habitat, elucidate ecological gradients with related habitats and facilitate conservation of this ecologically distinctive habitat.

AB Availability of reactive nitrogen (N-r; mainly ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-) via precipitation and upwelling groundwater affects carbon (C) accumulation in peat deposits and biological greenhouse gas emissions. Isotope composition of Nr was studied at Wolf Swamp (WS) and The Glades (GL), two peatlands located in western Maryland (U.S.), to provide a more robust understanding of N cycling at the ecosystem level. In recent years, both sites experienced a moderate atmospheric pollution (3-9 kg of deposited N-r ha(-1) yr(-1)), and possible additional N-r inputs via groundwater contaminated by fertilizers/livestock. Sampling of living Sphagnum, vertical peat profiles, atmospheric deposition, and surface bog water was carried out on October 22-24, 2017. The delta N-15(r) signatures of vertical precipitation were negative (mass-weighted means of similar to 7.2 and similar to 8.1% at WS and GL, respectively) despite reports that NOx emitted by coal-burning power plants, a precursor of deposited nitrate, had been extremely positive (up to +26 parts per thousand). Mean delta N-15 values at both sites increased in the order: vertical precipitation < living Sphagnum< atmospheric N-2 < surface bog water < maturating peat. Intermediate delta N-15 values of living Sphagnum (similar to 1.5 parts per thousand at both sites) suggested simultaneous incorporation of isotopically light atmospheric N-r and isotopically heavy N-r from bog water in the newly formed biomass. The delta N-15 values of bulk peat increased downcore by 4.5 and 4.9 parts per thousand at WS and GL, respectively. Gradual mineralization of organic N, mainly by nitrification and denitrification, is isotopically selective, leaving behind higher delta N-15 values of bulk peat at greater peat depths. Nitrogen concentration gradients and delta N-15 trends in vertical peat profiles at these locations therefore cannot be used as an archive of past changes in pollution levels and N isotope signatures of incoming N-r.

AB We discovered a 50-cm-thick peat deposit near Cape Rasmussen (65.2 degrees S), in the maritime Antarctic. To our knowledge, while aerobic 'moss banks' have often been examined, waterlogged 'peatlands' have never been described in this region before. The waterlogged system is approximately 100 m(2), with a shallow water table. Surface vegetation is dominated by Warnstorfia fontinaliopsis, a wet-adapted moss commonly found in the Antarctic Peninsula. Peat inception was dated at 2750 cal. BP and was followed by relatively rapid peat accumulation (similar to 0.1 cm/year) until 2150 cal. BP. Our multi-proxy analysis then shows a 2000-year-long stratigraphic hiatus as well as the recent resurgence of peat accumulation, sometime after 1950 AD. The existence of a thriving peatland at 2700-2150 cal. BP implies regionally warm summer conditions extending beyond the mid-Holocene; this finding is corroborated by many regional records showing moss bank initiation and decreased sea ice extent during this time period. Recent peatland recovery at the study site (<50 years ago) might have been triggered by ongoing rapid warming, as the area is experiencing climatic conditions approaching those found on milder, peatland-rich sub-Antarctic islands (50-60 degrees S). Assuming that colonization opportunities and stabilization mechanisms would allow peat to persist in Antarctica, our results suggest that longer and warmer growing seasons in the maritime Antarctic region may promote a more peatland-rich landscape in the future.

AB Measurements of the spatial variability of methane (CH4) emissions, net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and dissolved carbon (CH4, CO2, and DOC) were made in a boreal patterned peatland in northern Sweden in the summers (May to September) of 1992 and 1993. Carbon balance terms were measured and the carbon balance inferred at different peatland surface topography features (e.g. ridges, lawns, and pools) and at different positions within the peatland (e.g. plateau, margin). Combining these data permits a comparison of the carbon balance at the peatland scale for the two field seasons.
   Trends in the spatial variability of the net carbon storage, as determined by the difference between inputs and outputs, suggest that carbon storage decreased in lawns from the margin of the peatland to the central plateau, while the reverse trend occurred in ridges. This indicates a difference in carbon exchange processes between sites with different surface topography due to differences in soil moisture and temperature.
   Total carbon storage for the peatland, weighted for topographic variability, indicates that the peatland gained carbon in 1992 (2.0 g C m(-2)), but lost carbon in 1993 (-7.6 g C m(-2)). There was little variation in mean seasonal air temperature and total precipitation between the two years suggesting that the timing and magnitude of temperature and precipitation variation within the growing season are important for the season carbon balance. Because the carbon storage differences were small relative to the potential errors we conclude that the peatland was neither a net sink nor source of atmospheric carbon. This research demonstrates the importance of position in a peatland for the inference of long-term carbon accumulation and the assessment of contemporary exchange rates.

TI Drought years in peatland rewetting: rapid vegetation succession can
   maintain the net CO2 sink function

AB The rewetting of peatlands is regarded as an important nature-based climate solution and intended to reconcile climate protection with the restoration of self-regulating ecosystems that are resistant to climate impacts. Although the severity and frequency of droughts are predicted to increase as a consequence of climate change, it is not well understood whether such extreme events can jeopardize rewetting measures. The goal of this study was to better understand drought effects on vegetation development and the exchange of the two important greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4, especially in rewetted fens. Based on long-term reference records, we investigated anomalies in vegetation dynamics, CH4 emissions, and net CO2 exchange, including the component fluxes of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), in a rewetted fen during the extreme European summer drought in 2018. Drought-induced vegetation dynamics were derived from remotely sensed data.
   Since flooding in 2010, the fen was characterized by a patchy mosaic of open-water surfaces and vegetated areas. After years of stagnant vegetation development, drought acted as a trigger event for pioneer species such as Tephroseris palustris and Ranunculus sceleratus to rapidly close persistent vegetation gaps. The massive spread of vegetation assimilated substantial amounts of CO2. In 2018, the annual GEP budget increased by 20 % in comparison to average years (2010-2017). R-eco increased even by 40 %, but enhanced photosynthetic CO2 sequestration could compensate for half of the drought-induced increase in respiratory CO2 release. Altogether, the restored fen remained a net CO2 sink in the year of drought, though net CO2 sequestration was lower than in other years. CH4 emissions were 20 % below average on an annual basis, though stronger reduction effects occurred from August onwards, when daily fluxes were 60 % lower than in reference years.
   Our study reveals an important regulatory mechanism of restored fens to maintain their net CO2 sink function even in extremely dry years. It appears that, in times of more frequent climate extremes, fen restoration can create ecosystems resilient to drought. However, in order to comprehensively assess the mitigation prospects of peatland rewetting as a nature-based climate solution, further research needs to focus on the long-term effects of such extreme events beyond the actual drought period.

AB Peat deposits, which outcrop in the southern Agadia region in Trabzon, Northern Turkey, were studied by using chemical, organic geochemical, petrographic and palynological characteristics of peats. Palynological data indicate that the peats were deposited in terrestrial or lacustrine environments, comprising organic matter with an average composition of 70% woody, 19.3% herbaceous and 10.7% amorphous material. The peats are Holocene-recent in age. The peat organic matter that has been interpreted as immature based on the SCI (spore color index) analyses suggests that the peat organic matter was immature.
   Rock Eval analyses show that the average total organic carbon (TOC) content of the peat is 42%, and the average HI value is 315 mgHC/gTOC, which is very high for peat. The high 01 values (avg. 134 mgCO(2)/gTOC) point that the depositional environment of peats were deposits under oxic or suboxic conditions.
   The selected sample (ABY-13) with the highest extractable yield has TAR (Terrigenous/Aquatic Ratio) and CPI (Carbon Preference Index) index values of 2.4 and 3.4, respectively. These values reflect high levels of n-alkanes, supporting a terrestrial organic matter input. The P-aq (aquatic plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.6) indicates that there was a contribution from mixtures of submerged/floating, emergent and terrestrial plant mixtures. The P-wax (vascular plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.6) is a sign of moist and wetter conditions. The TOC, ACL, Q(wood/grass):C-27/C-31, Q(wood/plant) (C-27 + C-29)/(C-27 + C-29 + C-31) and Q(grass/plant):C-31/(C-27 + C-29 + C31) values indicate that woody plants were the dominant vegetation in the peat mire was woody plants, and the climate was relatively wet and cold.
   According to the m/z 191 and m/z 217 fragments tracking from GC-MS chromatogram data obtained using biomarker analyses, the lack of C-34 and C-35 homohopanes was interpreted as that organic matter was deposited under oxic or suboxic conditions. Moretane/hopane, Tm/Ts and Tm/C-30 pentacydic triterpane ratios also point indicate oxic and acidic conditions during the formation of the peat. The absence of 17 alpha(H)-28,30-bisnorhopane from the m/z 191 chromatograms support the interpretation that the Agacbasi Yayla peat was deposited in a terrestrial or lacustrine environment under oxic or suboxic conditions. The dominance of C-29 steranes indicates significant terrestrial organic matter input. Using sterane carbon number distributions the extract of the peat sample plots in the terrigenous region. Additionally, C-30 steranes, which imply marine environments, were not detected. The Ts/(Ts + Tm), ratios also suggest that the peat contained immature organic matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pools are common in northern peatlands but studies have seldom focused on their nutrient biogeochemistry, especially in relation to their morphological characteristics and through seasons. We determined the environmental characteristics controlling carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry in pools and assessed their evolution over the course of the 2016 growing season in a subboreal ombrotrophic peatland of eastern Canada. We showed that water chemistry variations in 62 pools were significantly explained by depth (81.9%) and the surrounding vegetation type (14.8%), but not by pool area or shape. Shallow pools had larger dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and lower pH than deep pools, while pools surrounded by coniferous trees had more recalcitrant DOC than pools where vegetation was dominated by mosses. The influence of depth on pool biogeochemistry was confirmed by the seasonal survey of pools of different sizes with 47.1% of the variation in pool water chemistry over time significantly explained. Of this, 67.3% was explained by the interaction between time and pool size and 32.7% by pool size alone. P concentrations were small in all pools all summer long and combined with high N:P ratios, are indicative of P-limitation. Our results show that pool biogeochemistry is influenced by internal processes and highlight the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of nutrient biogeochemistry in ombrotrophic peatlands.

AB The composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in vegetation of natural hummocky peatlands in the forest-tundra subzone of the Komi Republic and its possible impact on the composition of polyarenes in peat were assessed. The content of polyarenes was estimated by the method of highly efficient liquid chromatography. The accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was the highest in Polytrichum strictum, Betula pubescens, and shoots of Picea abies and smaller in Betula nana L., Salix lapponum L., and Carex limosa L. with the domination of low-molecular-weight PAHs. We did not reveal dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[ghi]perylene in plants: they could be the products of soil-forming processes. It is shown that distribution patterns of PAHs in the permafrost-affected soils of peat mounds (Hemic Folic Cryic Histosols) and in the soils of open-water mire pools (Fibric Floatic Histosols) are similar. Small quantities of low-molecular-weight polyarenes were normally accumulated in the seasonally thawed layer. The content of heavy structures (mainly, benzo[ghi]perylene) strongly increased at the contact with permafrost and then slightly decreased in the underlying permafrost. The composition of PAHs in the active layer mainly depended on composition of polyarenes in plants. At the contact with permafrost, the active synthesis or release of high-molecular-weight compounds took place. The influence of the composition of PAHs in plants on their composition in peat greatly depended on the degree of peat decomposition. Reasoning from the natural model of peat formation in open-water mire pools, the composition of polyarenes in the upper peat horizons of such sites was affected by recombination of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons in Sphagnum riparium and Eriophorum sp. In the course of long-term soil development, the decomposition of complex organic compounds in plant tissues (particularly, in Eriophorum sp.) results in the formation of heavy PAHs with a simultaneous increase in the content of low-molecular-weight polyarenes.

AB Boreal Sphagnum-dominated peatlands are known to emit isoprene in amounts comparable to emissions from boreal Picea abies-dominated forests. Due to its high reactivity, isoprene can affect the local climate. Increases in isoprene emission under elevated ozone concentration have been detected in a few plant species, but the effects at the ecosystem level are largely unknown. We investigated the isoprene emission from microcosms representing a boreal Sphagnum fen under lone-term realistically elevated ozone concentration in open-field conditions. The vegetation of the microcosms was dominated by Sphagnum papillosum Lindb. moss with dense Eriophorum vaginatum L. growth. The mean standardised emissions of isoprene under ambient and elevated ozone concentrations in the growing season of 2005 were on average 1.016 me m(-2) h(-1), and 1.308 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively. In August 2004, they were 0.434 mg m(-2) h(-1) under ambient, and 0.509 mg m(-2) h(-1) under elevated ozone concentration. Elevated ozone concentration had no statistically significant overall effects on the isoprene emission, although isoprene emissions tended to vary more and were slightly higher under ozone exposure during the warmest weather conditions. The results are in accordance with earlier observations of substantial isoprene emissions from boreal peatlands. As isoprene emissions from peatlands can be increased by ozone during warm periods, further research addressing this issue is needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1] Peatland drainage and peat extraction changes natural peatlands from a net carbon sink to that of a large net source due to increased respiration and the removal of carbon dioxide ( CO(2)) fixing vegetation. Restoration of these altered peatland ecosystems is being applied to reduce these carbon emissions. As peatland restoration is a new and emerging land-use management practice, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of restoration on the methane ( CH(4)) component of the carbon cycle at the Bois-des-Bel peatland located near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec from early May to mid October for several years. The seasonal CH(4) fluxes prior to restoration at an extracted ( cutover) and a restored peatland were not significantly different from each other or zero. However, three years postrestoration the seasonal CH(4) emissions at the restored site were 4.2 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), 4.6 times greater than the cutover site. Ponds and ditches at the restored site were seasonal CH(4) emission hot spots ( 0.3 and 2.9 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), respectively); however, emissions from herbaceous vegetation ( 1.0 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1)) were the dominant source of CH(4) from the restored peatland due to its large areal extent. CH(4) fluxes from the Bois-des-Bel peatland represented 14% of the total CO(2)-equivalent losses from the site. This study demonstrates the importance of vegetation succession on peatland-atmosphere flux of CH(4).

AB Mountain wetlands are unique ecosystems in the arid southern slopes of Alborz range, the second largest range in Iran. The spatial distribution characteristics of wetland vegetation in the arid region of the Alborz and the main factors affecting their distributional patterns were studied. A classification of vegetation and ecological characteristics were carried out using data extracted from 430 releves in 90 wetland sites. The data were analyzed using Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The wetland vegetation of Alborz Mountain was classified into four large groups. The first vegetation group was calcareous rich vegetation, mainly distributed in the river banks and characterized by helophytes such as Bolboschoenus (Willis as indicator species. The second group was saline transitional vegetation, distributed in the ecotone areas and dominated by Phragmites australis. The third vegetation group is wet meadow vegetation which mainly consists of geophytes, endemic and Irano-Turanian species, distributed in the higher altitudes. This vegetation is mainly characterized by indicator species such as Carex orbicularis, high level concentration of Fe2+ and percentage of organic matter in the soil. The fourth vegetation group is aquatic vegetation, distributed in the lakeshores. The aquatic group species are mainly hydrophytic such as Batrachium trichophyllum. The TWINSPAN vegetation groups could be also recognized in the DCA graphs and ecologically differentiated by ANOVA of studied variables. Four vegetation groups can be differentiated on two first axes of indirect ordination. There is a gradient of pH, EC and organic matter associated with altitude on the DCA diagram. Correlation analysis between the axes of DCA and environmental factors shows that altitude, soil texture and other dependant environmental variables (e.g. pH) are the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of wetland vegetation groups.

AB Understanding the ecohydrological responses of peatlands to climate change is particularly challenging over the late Holocene owing to the confounding influence of anthropogenic activity. To address this, a core spanning the last similar to 2400 years from a raised bog in northern England was analysed using a comprehensive suite of proxy methods in an attempt to elucidate the drivers of change. A testate amoebae-based transfer function was used to quantitatively reconstruct changes in water table depth, supported by humification analysis and a plant macrofossil-derived hydroclimatic index. Pollen and plant macrofossil data were used to examine regional and local vegetation change, and human impacts were inferred from charcoal and geochemistry. Chronological control was achieved through a Bayesian age-depth model based on AMS radiocarbon dates and spheroidal carbonaceous particles, from which peat and carbon accumulation rates were calculated. Phases of both increased and decreased bog surface wetness (inferred effective precipitation) are present, with dry phases at c. AD 320-830, AD 920-1190 and AD 1850 present, and a marked period of increased effective precipitation at c. AD 1460-1850. Coherence with other records from across Northern Europe suggests that these episodes are primarily driven by allogenic climatic change. Periods of high bog surface wetness correspond to the Wolf, Sporer and Maunder sunspot activity minima, suggesting solar forcing was a significant driver of climate change over the last similar to 1000 years. Following the intensification of agriculture and industry over the last two centuries, the combined climatic and anthropogenic forcing effects become increasingly difficult to separate due to increases in atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically derived pollutants, fertilising compounds, and additions of wind-blown soil dust. We illustrate the need for multiproxy approaches based on high-resolution palaeoecology and geochemistry to examine the recent trajectories of peatlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assessed whether peat mining intensity influences the use of bog ponds by green frogs (Rana clamitans). We selected 21 ponds in three areas undergoing different levels of peat mining: 1) mined (vegetation completely removed exposing bare peat, presence of drainage ditches with little or no water), 2) in preparation to be mined (vegetation intact but presence of drainage ditches filled with water), and 3) natural (vegetation intact, absence of drainage ditches). We estimated green frog abundance and reproduction using a combination of sampling techniques. Green frogs were detected more often at ponds in the moderately disturbed section than at ponds in either the mined bog or natural sections. Furthermore, no green frogs called at ponds on mined surfaces, as opposed to ponds on either natural or moderately disturbed surfaces. Tadpoles occurred only in the moderately disturbed section. This suggests that ponds on mined surfaces provide suboptimal habitat for green frogs. Within the moderately disturbed section, drainage ditches may provide additional breeding habitat and facilitate movements between ponds. However, if this positive effect occurs, it is only temporary because moderately disturbed sections are inevitably mined. Although preserving vegetated corridors or buffer zones around bog ponds within mined surfaces may not necessarily increase pond use by amphibians in the short term, it will facilitate the restoration phase of mined sites by providing a source of dispersers of bog plants and wildlife, including amphibians.

AB Testate amoeba analyses were realized to reconstruct Holocene hydroclimatic variations and carbon accumulation from two peat cores collected in a permafrost peatland located at the southern limit of the discontinuous permafrost zone near Kuujjuarapik, subarctic Quebec, Canada (55 degrees 13'N, 77 degrees 41'W). Results from the central core show synchronic changes with lake level variations from northeastern Quebec. Palsa aggradation has been identified from 660 to 140 cal. BP with changes in testate amoeba assemblages, reconstructed surface dryness and strongly decomposed peat. Our results also show that low carbon accumulation rates (9.5 g.m(-2).yr(-1) and 8.6 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) are linked to colder periods that may be associated with solar minima (AD 1460-1550 and AD 1645-1715). Recent warming of the last decades shows an important return to peat accumulation following permafrost degradation in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peat decomposition has micro-scale heterogeneity because the rate of decomposition differs between micro-local conditions related to pore distribution, botanical composition, and differences in plant parts. Therefore, the heterogeneity of peat decomposition degree in micro-scale can be a good indicator for further understanding of peat decomposition process. However, previous studies using "bulk analysis" have denoted peat heterogeneity as merely chemical structural diversity, and did not examine the heterogeneity of peat constituents at a microscopic level. This study aimed to obtain peat heterogeneity in the micro-scale as a new indicator of peat decomposition and conducted "heterogeneity analysis" as follows: (1) analyzing a decomposition index of individual peat micro-fragments using spectral data from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) micro-spectroscopy and principal component analysis (PCA) for specific absorption intensities, and (2) determining the distribution of peat decomposition index as an indicator of the heterogeneity of peaty soils. Twelve peaty horizons were sampled from three sites on coastal or alluvial plains. These horizons were buried under mineral soils used for rice cultivation. We applied PCA to 775 infrared (IR) spectra obtained from observed peat micro-fragments and calculated the micro-fragment decomposition degree (MDD) which was the first principal component score explained by a decrease in C-H single bonds and a relative increase in polymerized aromatic C=C double bonds. The distribution range of MDD demonstrated that heterogeneity of decomposition degree tends to be large in mid-decomposed peat. Moreover, the bimodal distribution pattern of MDD represented heterogeneous state formed by mineral inter-bedding in peat. Therefore, "heterogeneity analysis" could effectively represent the intrinsic heterogeneity of peat decomposition degree without losing the microscopic diversity.

AB Mountain peatlands in the temperate regions represent a small proportion of the global peatland resource, but play a unique, although less recognized role in the regional water and biogeochemical cycles. We conducted leaf and ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements during the growing period of 2008 to investigate the effects of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and ground water level (WL) on leaf gas exchange of two dominant herbaceous species, Molinia caerulea (L.) and Carex nigra (L.) in a mountain peatland. Implications of the leaf-level responses for net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were examined. Fluctuations in WL influenced soil water content (SWC) within the top 5 cm of the peat profile. Although midday leaf water potential during the day (I-md) was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with SWC in the 5 cm peat profile, there was no direct relationship between WL and plant water relations parameters. VPD and stomatal conductance (gs) were negatively correlated at VPD > 1 kPa regardless of the current WL status. Stomatal conductance was positively correlated with leaf assimilation (A) and root-shoot hydraulic conductance (Ks-l). A decline in NEE during summer was attributed to stomatal closure due to high VPD and low light utilization efficiency (alpha) of the vegetation. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was positively correlated with peat temperature at 10 cm depth. Our results suggest that increases in VPD, as a possible scenario of climate change, would lower the photosynthetic capacity of the herbaceous peatland vegetation, despite the high WL, and hence lower the potential of such peatlands as sinks for atmospheric CO2.

AB A process-based model has been developed in order to calculate methane emissions from natural wetlands as a function of the hydrologic and thermal conditions in the soil. The considered processes in the model are methane production, methane consumption and transport of methane by diffusion, ebullition and through plants. The model has been tested against data from a three-year field study from a Michigan peatland. The interannual and seasonal variations of the modelled methane emissions and methane concentration profiles are in good agreement with the observations. During the growing season the main emission pathway proceeds through plants. Ebullition occurs whenever the water table is above the soil surface, while diffusion is only significant in the first 15 days after a drop of the water table below the peat surface.

AB Lavas and sedimentary rocks of the Palaeogene Staffa Formation are exposed in the south-west of the Island of Mull in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland. Here, we present the results of an extensive programme of analysis of palynofloras from intravolcanic sedimentary rocks across this, the oldest part of the Mull Lava Field. This analysis has been allied to field and aerial photograph mapping, which have provided evidence that the earliest flows and sediments of the Staffa Formation were emplaced into two NW-SE trending fault controlled valleys. This extensional structural regime was also utilised by the NW-SE trending Mull dyke swami. Early syn-depositional movement on graben margin faults is indicated by anomalously thick alluvial sediments, and ponded lava flows on the downthrown sides. Sedimentary and palynofacies data indicate an overall southeasterly drainage direction for the Staffa Formation paleo-valley system, the palynofloras reflecting this in increased dominance of mire vegetation communities, in the wetter, lower reaches of the catchment. The palynofloras are subdivided into four ecological groupings. Mid to late succession communities dominate the two youngest depositional sequences of the lava field, reflecting the filling of the valley structures, and the development of an increasingly stable environment. The youngest surface includes the renowned Ardtun Leaf Beds, which are shown to be atypical of much of the Staffa Formation flora, being located on a graben margin alluvial fan. This youngest surface also provides evidence for the subsequent inversion of the original graben structure across the south of the area, while active eruption continued in the north. Inversion is attributed to the emplacement of the oldest members of the nearby Mull Central Complex, and heralds the eruption of the trap-forming Plateau Group lavas. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Kolkheti lowlands of western Georgia have a unique vegetation and a rich cultural history. Palynological and macrofossil analysis accompanied by AMS C-14-dates of the deposits of the Ispani 2 mire near Kobuleti allow the reconstruction of regional vegetation, environmental history and local peatland development within the context of Black Sea level and cultural changes. Comparison of two adjacent peatland cores confirms spatial differences in wetland development. Prior to 5400 cal yr BP, the Ispani basin was a floodplain of an active river system where overbank deposits with fluvially transported CASTANEA pollen were deposited. Subsequently, a lake or lagoon developed in which reeds expanded. These were succeeded by herb-rich open alder carrs. After 1900 cal yr BP, Carpinus and Fagus expanded on the dry grounds, where formerly Quercus was more abundant. Also Castanea declined. Local reedbeds, that burned regularly, succeeded the alder carr. After 1000 cal yr BP, a percolation bog developed resulting in the formation of 4 m of loose, porous, and largely undecomposed Sphagnum austinii peat with Molinia roots. The upper 50 cm of the analysed section show extensive human impact on the landscape during the 20th century. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inventories of natural assemblages of plant species are critical when planning ecological restoration of bogs. However, little is known about the regional variation in plant communities at the margins (laggs) of bogs, even though they are an integral element of raised bog ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated the regional patterns in the plant communities of bogs and laggs, and the factors that control them, for thirteen bogs in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Species richness was significantly higher in the bogs and laggs of the cooler, wetter Pacific Oceanic wetland region. Beta Diversity analyses showed that bogs in the Pacific Oceanic wetland region often shared species with their respective laggs, whereas half of the laggs in the warmer, drier Pacific Temperate wetland region had no species in common with the adjacent bogs and were thus more ecologically distinct from the bog. Primary climatic variables, such as mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature and latitude, as well as climate-influenced variables, such as pH, peat depth, and Na+ concentrations were the main correlates of plant species composition in the studied bogs. Site-specific factors, particularly depth to water table, and fraction of inorganic material in peat samples, were as strongly related to lagg plant communities as climate, while hydrochemistry appeared to have less influence.

TI Estimating belowground carbon stocks in peatlands of the Ecuadorian

AB The paramo ecoregion of Ecuador contains extensive peatlands that are known to contain carbon (C) dense soils capable of long-term C storage. Although high-altitude mountain peatlands are typically small when compared to low-altitude peatlands, they are abundant across the Andean landscape and are likely a key component in regional C cycling. Since efforts to quantify peatland distribution and C stocks across the tropical Andes have been limited due to the difficulty in sampling remote areas with very deep peat, there is a large knowledge gap in our quantification of the current C pools in the Andean mountains, which limits our ability to predict and monitor change from high rates of land use and climate change. In this paper we tested if ground-penetrating radar (GPR),combined with manual coring and C analysis, could be used for estimating C stocks in peatlands of the Ecuadorian paramo. Our results indicated that GPR was successful in quantifying peat depths and carbon stocks. Detection of volcanic horizons like tephra layers allowed further refinement of variability of C stocks within the peat column, while providing information on the lateral extent of tephras at high (centimeter-scale) resolution that may prove very useful for the correlation of time-stratigraphic markers between sediments in alpine peatlands. In conclusion, this paper provides a methodological basis for quantifying C stocks in high-altitude peatlands and to infer changes in the physical properties of soils that could be used as proxies for C content or paleoclimate reconstructions.

AB Sphagnum-dwelling testate amoebae are widely used in paleoclimate reconstructions as a proxy for climate-induced changes in bogs. However, the sensitivity of proxies to seasonal climate components is an important issue when interpreting proxy records. Here, we studied the effects of summer warming, winter snow addition solely and winter snow addition together with spring warming on testate amoeba assemblages after eight years of experimental field climate manipulations. All manipulations were accomplished using open top chambers in a dry blanket bog located in the sub-Arctic (Abisko, Sweden). We estimated sensitivity of abundance, diversity and assemblage structure of living and empty shell assemblages of testate amoebae in the living and decaying layers of Sphagnum. Our results show that, in a sub-arctic climate, testate amoebae are more sensitive to climate changes in the growing season than in winter. Summer warming reduced species richness and shifted assemblage composition towards predominance of xerophilous species for the living and empty shell assemblages in both layers. The higher soil temperatures during the growing season also decreased abundance of empty shells in both layers hinting at a possible increase in their decomposition rates. Thus, although possible effects of climate changes on preservation of empty shells should always be taken into account, species diversity and structure of testate amoeba assemblages in dry subarctic bogs are sensitive proxies for climatic changes during the growing season.

AB Soil temperature strongly influences physical, chemical, and biological activities in soil. However, soil temperature data for forest landscapes are scarce. For 6 yr, weekly soil temperatures were measured at two upland and four peatland sites in north central Minnesota. One upland site supported mature aspen forest, the other supported short grass. One peatland site was forested with black spruce, one supported tall willow and alder brush, and two had open vegetation - sedges and low shrubs. Mean annual air temperature averaged 3.6 degrees C. Mean annual soil temperatures at 10- to 200-cm depths ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 degrees C among the six sites. Soils with open vegetation, whether mineral or peat, averaged about 1 degrees C warmer annually and from 2 to 3 degrees C warmer during summer than the forested soils. The tall brush peatland was cooler than all other sites due to strong groundwater inputs. The mineral soils warmed more quickly in the spring, achieved higher temperatures in the summer, and cooled more quickly in the fall than the peat soils; however, the greatest temperature differences between mineral and peat soils occurred at or below 50 cm. In the upper 20 cm, vegetation and groundwater had greater effects on temperature than did soil type (mineral or peat). Summer soil temperatures were higher, relative to air temperature, during periods of greater precipitation. This effect was minimal at upland sites but substantial in the peatlands. In spite of the persistent sub-freezing air temperatures typical of Minnesota winters, significant frost developed in the soils only in those years when severe cold weather arrived before an insulating cover of snow had accumulated.

AB Mud Pond peatland (Moultonborough, New Hampshire) is an approximately 12 ha wetland with a flora that consists of 124 vascular plant species, representing 46 families. Among the flora of Mud Pond peatland were two New Hampshire Endangered species (Arethusa bulbosa and Carex diandra), one New Hampshire Threatened species (Lysimachia thrysiflora), and four New Hampshire Species of Special Concern (Calopogon tuberosus, Platanthera blephariglottis, Pogonia ophioglossoides, and Sarracenia purpurea). During field reconnaissance, the vegetation of Mud Pond peatland was qualitatively classified as follows: Nuphar variegata-Nymphaea odorata (aquatic), Carex lasiocarpa (sedge fringe), Vaccinium oxycoccos-Sarracenia purpurea (Sphagnum lawn), Picea mariana-carex trisperma (muskeg), Chamaedaphne calyculata (ericaceous scrub), Typha latifolia-Carex lacustris (marsh), and Nemopanthus mucronatus-Calamagrostis canadensis (lagg) communities. Based primarily on vegetation and basin characteristics, Mud Pond peatland can tentatively be classified as a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen.

AB Here we combine the use of geo-electrical techniques with geochemical analysis of the solid and liquid phase to determine subsurface properties and general peatland health. Active, degrading and restored peat locations were analysed from the same blanket bog site (ensuring they were under the same environmental conditions, such as rainfall and temperature) at the Garron Plateau, Northern Ireland. A normalized chargeability (ratio of resistivity (inverse of conductivity) and chargeability) profile was compared with organic composition analysis of the solid and liquid phases from active, degrading and restored locations. Results show that the degrading location is undergoing high rates of decomposition and loss of organic matter into the interstitial water, whereas the opposite is true for the active location. The restored peat is showing low rates of decomposition however has a high concentration of organic material in the pore water, primarily composing long chain aliphatic compounds, sourced from vascular plants. The ingression of vascular plants permits the diffusion of oxygen via roots into the subsurface and supports the oxidation of phenols by phenol oxidase, which produces phenoxy radicals and quinones (C=O double bonds). This production of conjugated quinones, which are characterized by a C=O double bond, in the aerated degrading and restored locations, increase the polarity, cation exchange capacity, and the normalized chargeability of the peat. This higher chargeability is not evident in the active peat due to decreased aerobic decomposition and a domination of sphagnum mosses. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Question: What are the relative influences of environment and space in structuring the plant composition in a peatland complex?
   Location: Lakkasuo, southern boreal zone, Finland.
   Method: We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) to model spatial structures in the plant composition of a peatland complex comprising ombrotrophic and minerotrophic, open and forested areas. We used redundancy analyses (RDA) and variation partitioning to assess the relative influences of chemical variables (peat and water characteristics), physical variables (hydrology, soil properties, shade), as well as broad-scale (4350 m) and medium-scale (100-350 m) spatial structures on vegetation assemblages.
   Results: We identified five different significant spatial patterns circumscribing (1) the minerotrophic-ombrotrophic gradient; (2) dry ombrotrophic and wet minerotrophic areas; (3) open and shaded areas; (4) dry open/shaded and wet patches within the ombrotrophic areas; and (5) dry open patches and dry forested patches. With spatial structures and environmental variables, we were able to model 30% of the variability in plant composition in the peatland complex, 13% of which was attributable to spatial structures alone.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that in the peatland complex, the spatial dependence processes were more important at the broadest scale, and found that patterns at a medium scale might reflect finer-scale patterns that were not investigated here. Spatial autocorrelation in vegetation composition in the peatland complex appeared to be driven by Sphagnum species. Our results emphasize that spatial modelling should be routinely implemented in studies looking at species composition, since they significantly increase the explained proportion of variance.

AB Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating techniques are used to characterise recent peat accumulation rates of two minerotrophic peatlands located in the La Grande Riviere hydrological watershed, in the James Bay region (Canada). several cores were collected during the summer 2005 in different parts of the two selected peatlands. These minerotrophic patterned peatlands are presently affected by erosion processes, expressed by progressive mechanical destruction of their pools borders. This erosion process is related to a water table rise induced by a regional increase of humidity since the last century. The main objective of the present paper is to (1) evaluate if Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating techniques can be applied to build accurate chronologies in these environments and (2) detect changes in the peat accumulation rates in regard to this amplification of humidity. In both sites, unsupported Pb-210 shows all exponential decreasing according to the depth. Chronologies inferred from Pb-210 allow to reconstruct peat accumulation rates since ca. 1855 AD. The Cs-137 data displayed evident mobility and diffusion, preventing the establishment of any sustained chronology based on these measurements. In the two sites, peat accumulation rates inferred from Pb-210 chronologies fluctuate between 0.005 and 0.038 g cm(-2) yr(-1). As a result, the rise of the water table during the last decade has not yet affected peat accumulation rates. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the effects of increasing atmospheric N deposition on net C and N accumulation in Sphagnum-dominated bogs, we conducted a laboratory mesocosm experiment. Following 45days of watering with N-free rainwater, mesocosms were exposed to simulated atmospheric N deposition values of 0, 4.14, 8.18, and 12.42mgNm(-2) da(-1) over a 108day period. We quantified N retention from leachate N concentrations and from changes in N contents of the Sphagnum/peat mesocosms. As N loading of simulated atmospheric N deposition increased, so did the net retention of simulated atmospherically deposited N. Our hypothesis of a decrease in N retention efficiency with increasing N loading was not observed. Further, for each N loading treatment, rates of retention of simulated atmospherically deposited N remained constant over time. We did not observe a threshold N deposition below which N would be retained in mesocosms and above which N passed through the mesocosms. Substantially more N was retained in mesocosms that was added in simulated atmospheric N deposition, suggesting an unaccounted for N source, most likely biological N-2 fixation. In locations where N-2 fixation represents a much greater source of new N to Sphagnum-dominated bogs, as in northern Alberta, Canada, increasing atmospheric N deposition may have a minimal effect on overall net N accumulation in peat.

AB Sphagnum bogs cover large continental areas and may play a major role as carbon sinks. They have also great biological, historical and palcoecological values. These features led to a large amount of research and publications, especially conceptual and numerical models in various scientific fields. Drawing on this literature, we propose an integrated conceptual model of bog functioning. The model is built on 8 basic assumptions acting at two scales: the ecosystem as a whole, the bog or mesotope and the microforms, the elementary systemic units. Five kinds of ecological constraints driving the ecosystem are defined too. Based on the assumptions, the constraints and bibliographical data, thresholds and positive and negative feedbacks are elucidated. The negative feedbacks controlling the development and homeostasis of the ecosystem are related to the balance between the vegetation which builds the peat body, the shape of the later and the water fluxes passing through it. The positive feedback allowing the establishment and the persistence of the ecosystem is related to peat moss engineering. Four positive feedback loops can stop the peat production, and lead to the destruction of the bog. Two loops are biological processes involving trees and blue moor grass (Molinia caerulea) which spread onto the bog. The two other loops are related to soil and shape disturbance and changes in production and degradation of the organic matter. The model is especially designed to help ecological monitoring and highlights the importance of an ecological diagnostic integrating plants, soil and water fluxes. Based on this model, action plans should focus on maintaining the negative feedbacks and the peat moss engineering while stopping the unfavourable other positive feedback loops.

AB We evaluated whether the kind of nutrient limitation (N, P, or K) may affect species richness-productivity patterns and subsequently may explain variation in species richness and in richness of threatened species. We present a data set from previous studies in wetlands in Poland, Belgium, and The Netherlands and examine species richness-productivity patterns for vascular plants in all 150 sites together as well as for N-, P-, and K-limited sites separately. The kind of nutrient limitation was assessed by N:P, N:K, and K: P ratios in the vegetation. Critical values for these ratios were derived from a literature review of fertilization experiments. The kind of nutrient limitation influenced species richness-productivity patterns in our 150 sites through large differences in productivity. P (co)limitation occurred only at low productivity, K (co)-limitation up to intermediate productivity, and N limitation along the entire productivity gradient. There was a decreasing trend in species richness with increasing productivity for K (co)-limited sites, whereas for both the N-limited sites and P (co)-limited sites a sort of "filled hump-shaped curve" was observed. The species richness-productivity relationship for threatened species was restricted to a much narrower productivity range than that for all species. Richness of threatened species was higher in P (co)-limited sites than in N-limited sites, suggesting that increased P availabilities in wetlands may be particularly important in causing disappearance of threatened species in western Europe. The role of nutrient limitation in species richness-productivity relationships not only reveals mechanisms that may explain variation in species richness and occurrence of threatened species, but it also may be important for nature management practice.

ID ORGANIC SOILS; LEVEL; RESPONSES
AB Swamps, bogs and fens are diverse wetland ecosystems found worldwide. Within each region, different ecological processes and species dominate them, yet water levels and saturation of sediments appear key to the maintenance of vegetation and the ecosystem as a whole. Consequently, understanding how vegetation responds to water levels in these ecosystems is critical to their future management. This paper describes the floristic patterns observed in an upland swamp on the Budderoo Plateau, Southern Highlands, NSW, and relates the distribution of the vegetation communities to groundwater depth, soil type and site attributes. Three distinct vegetation assemblages were identified associated with (1) the main swamp axis, (2) the swamp margin and (3) the adjacent hillslopes. Elevation above the central swamp axis was the variable most strongly related to vegetation structure. Relative changes in elevation create a drainage gradient that allows higher elevation areas (hillslope and swamp marginal zones) to drain more readily than areas in the main swamp axis. Variation in vegetation was also related to median groundwater depth. Finally, soil organic matter content was a contributing factor with the swamp axis and marginal zones mostly having fibric, highly organic soils in contrast to the sandy, loamy soils on the hillslopes.

ID AGE CALIBRATION; POLLEN; TREE; VEGETATION; SEDIMENTS
AB The current natural distribution of Taxus baccata L. in Belgium is limited to a few localities in the southern part of the country. In these localities, Taxus is predominantly growing on steep, calcareous slopes, which is believed to be its natural habitat in this part of the world. In Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, Taxus is considered not to be native and Taxus stands are interpreted there as being planted by humans or as garden escapes. The Holocene pollen and macrofossil data for Taxus, however, show a very different picture regarding abundance and geographical distribution, as well as habitat. It appears that during the Sub-boreal, Taxus grew in the coastal plain and the lower Scheldt valley, where it was part of the carr vegetation on peat. Before the end of the Sub-boreal, Taxus seems to have disappeared from this region, most probably because of the transition from the carr vegetation to (raised) bogs. Belgium is not the only case where such observations have been made. In other areas of northwestern Europe, Taxus also seems to have had a completely different distribution and ecology in the past, especially during the Sub-boreal.
   An overview of the palaeobotanical finds of Taxus baccata from Belgium is here given, supplemented with finds from neighbouring regions. The Holocene distribution and palaeo-ecology of Taxus baccata are discussed in a broader northwest European context.

TI Carbon emissions from a temperate peat fire and its relevance to
   interannual variability of trace atmospheric greenhouse gases

AB [1] The contribution of wildfire in peatlands outside of boreal and tropical regions to interannual variability of global carbon emissions has been relatively little studied. There are 0.19 to 0.88 million km(2) of localized peat deposits in the temperate zone ( 30 - 50 degrees latitude) where drainage and climate change may affect the status of this potentially large carbon pool. For example, in the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA, where wildfire is common, over 325 teragrams of carbon (Tg C) are stored in peat deposits up to 5 m deep. We estimated carbon emissions for a temperate peatland fire in North Carolina using remote sensing to reconstruct burn severity and topographic lidar to constrain peat burn depths. Total carbon emissions for the fire ranged from 1 to 3.8 Tg, with spatially heterogeneous patterns of carbon fluxes (0.2 to 11 kg C m(-2)) responding to variation in vegetation type, peat burn depth, soil substrate ( mineral or organic), and fire severity. To maintain a carbon sink in this region at the current rates of carbon sequestration (0.109 to 0.127 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) we estimated a fire return interval of greater than 20 - 80 years. Continued drainage and future drought could decrease the fire return interval to less than 20 years or increase peat burn depths thereby converting these peatlands into a net carbon source. On a global scale, this study suggests that temperate peatland fires may emit up to 0.32 petagrams of carbon during drought years, a significant contribution to interannual greenhouse gas variability.

AB Climate change has the potential to significantly impact the stability of large stocks of mercury (Hg) stored in peatland systems due to increasing temperatures, altered water table regimes and subsequent shifts in vascular plant communities. However, the Hg exchange dynamics between the atmosphere and peatlands are not well understood. At the PEATcosm Mesocosm Facility in Houghton, Michigan, total gaseous Hg (TGM) fluxes were monitored in a subset of 1-m(3) peat monoliths with altered water table positions (high and low) and vascular plant functional groups (sedge only, Ericaceae only or unmanipulated control) above the Sphagnum moss layer. At the SPRUCE bog in north-central Minnesota, TGM fluxes were measured from plots subjected to deep peat soil warming (up to +9 degrees C above ambient at a depth of 2 m). At PEATcosm, the strongest depositional trend was observed with the Low WT - sedge only treatment mesocosms with a mean TGM flux of -73.7 +/- 6.3 ng m(-2) d(-1), likely due to shuttling of Hg to the peat at depth by aerenchymous tissues. The highest total leaf surface and tissue Hg concentrations were observed with the Ericaceae shrubs. A negative correlation between TGM flux and Ericaceae total leaf surface area suggests an influence of shrubs in controlling Hg exchange through stomatal uptake, surface sorption and potentially, peat shading. Surface peat total Hg concentrations are highest in treatments with greatest deposition suggesting deposition controls Hg accumulation in surface peat. Fluxes in the SPRUCE plots ranged from -45.9 +/- 93.8 ng m(-2) d(-1) prior to the implementation of the deep warming treatments to -1.41 +/- 27.1 ng m(-2) d(-1) once warming targets were achieved at depth and +10.2 +/- 44.6 ng m(-2) d(-1) following prolonged deep soil warming. While these intervals did not differ significantly, a significant positive increase in the slope of the regression between flux and surface temperature was observed across the pre-treatment and warming periods. Shifts in vascular vegetation cover and peat warming as a result of climate change may significantly affect the dynamics of TGM fluxes between peatlands and the atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Flooding regime changes resulting from natural and human activity have been projected to affect wetland plant community structures and functions. It is therefore important to conduct investigations across a range of flooding gradients to assess the impact of flooding depth on wetland vegetation. We conducted this study to identify the pattern of plant height, species richness and aboveground biomass variation along the flooding gradient in floodplain wetlands located in Northeast China. We found that the response of dominant species height to the flooding gradient depends on specific species, i.e., a quadratic response for Carex lasiocarpa, a negative correlation for Calamagrostis angustifolia, and no response for Carex appendiculata. Species richness showed an intermediate effect along the vegetation zone from marsh to wet meadow while aboveground biomass increased. When the communities were analysed separately, only the water table depth had significant impact on species richness for two Carex communities and no variable for C. angustifolia community, while height of dominant species influenced aboveground biomass. When the three abovementioned communities were grouped together, variations in species richness were mainly determined by community type, water table depth and community mean height, while variations in aboveground biomass were driven by community type and the height of dominant species. These findings indicate that if habitat drying of these herbaceous wetlands in this region continues, then two Carex marshes would be replaced gradually by C. angustifolia wet meadow in the near future. This will lead to a reduction in biodiversity and an increase in productivity and carbon budget. Meanwhile, functional traits must be considered, and should be a focus of attention in future studies on the species diversity and ecosystem function in this region.

AB We use a network of cores from 77 peatland sites to determine controls on peat C content and peat C accumulation over the last 2000 years ( since 2 ka) across Russia's West Siberian Lowland (WSL), the world's largest wetland region. Our results show a significant influence of fossil plant composition on peat C content, with peats dominated by Sphagnum having a lower C content. Radiocarbon-derived C accumulation since 2 ka at 23 sites is highly variable from site to site, but displays a significant N-S trend of decreasing accumulation at higher latitudes. Northern WSL peatlands show relatively small C accumulation of 7 to 35 kg C m(-2) since 2 ka. In contrast, peatlands south of 60 degrees N show larger accumulation of 42 to 88 kg C m(-2). Carbon accumulation since 2 ka varies significantly with modern mean annual air temperature, with maximum C accumulation found between -1 and 0 degrees C. Rates of apparent C accumulation since 2 ka show no significant relationship to long-term Holocene averages based on total C accumulation. A GIS-based extrapolation of our site data suggests that a substantial amount (similar to 40%) of total WSL peat C has accumulated since 2 ka, with much of this accumulation south of 60 degrees N. The large peatlands in the southern WSL may be an important component of the Eurasian terrestrial C sink, and future warming could result in a shift northward in long-term WSL C sequestration.

AB In the present study the palaeoenvironmental setting of the coastal mire/swamp zone called 'Keri Lake', on Zakynthos Island, west Greece is presented. The mire/swamp area is famous for the asphalt-pitch seepages named as 'Herodotus-springs'. In order to interpret the Holocene evolution of the area, samples from four 7 m long vibracores were analyzed for their total organic carbon, total nitrogen and sulfur contents, as well as for their micro- and macro-fauna. The chronological framework of this study was based on three C-14 ages, while the age depth model and the sedimentation rate were estimated applying OxCal software. The age depth model indicates that the cores cover the period from the middle Holocene to present, with a mean sedimentation rate of 1 mm/yr. Before 4000 BP large part of the area inundated by the sea while after 4000 yrs BP the ecosystem changed to a high marsh and gradually to a fen environment, where peat accumulated under telmatic to limnotelmatic conditions. The trends and the ratios of the geochemical markers TOC, TN and TS clearly reflect the palaeoenvironmental change from terrestrial to fen depositional environments. The results show that during the middle Holocene the Herodotus Lake was influenced by sudden sea water inundation events, possibly as a result of high waves or storm events, while since the late Holocene the setting is that of a brackish coastal fen, where peat accumulates, under the significant inflow of fresh water that originates from the karstic systems of the catchment area.

AB Investigation of Scots pine annual radial increment was carried out in the surroundings of one of the largest pollution sources in Lithuania - the cement plant "Akmenes cementas". The main objective of the investigation was to analyse possible impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands growing in the local impact zone of the plant. Investigation has shown that in peat-bog sites active vegetation period temperature higher than the long-term average influences the formation of radial increment positively (r = 0.22-0.34; p < 0.05), and July precipitation higher than the long-term average causes the reduction of radial increment (r = -0.25; p < 0.05) of the investigated pines. Analysis of the relation between pine radial increment and plant emissions has shown that the strongest correlations are in the closest vicinity of the plant (r = -0.63; p < 0.05). Weaker, but statisticafly significant relations were found between radial increment of pines growing at a distance of 5-10 km from the plant and plant emissions (r = -0.49; p < 0.05), and for the most distant pine correlations became insignificant (p > 0.05). Linear regression results have shown that changes of the radial increment of pine stands closest to the plant are the biggest and they decrease with distance from the plant.

AB Increasing rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may reduce growth and accelerate decomposition of Sphagnum mosses in bogs. Sphagnum growth and rates of Sphagnum litter decomposition may also vary because of climate change as both processes are controlled by climatic factors. The initial purpose of this study was to assess if growth and litter decomposition of hummock and lawn Sphagnum species varied with increasing N input in a factorial mid-term (2002-2005) experiment of N and phosphorus (P) addition, in a bog on the southern Alps of Italy. However, as the experimental period was characterized by an exceptional heat wave in summer 2003, we also explored the interacting effects of fertilization and strongly varying climate on growth and decomposition rates of Sphagnum. The heat wave implied strong dehydration of the upper Sphagnum layer even if precipitation in summer 2003 did not differ appreciably from the overall mean. Sphagnum production was somewhat depressed by high levels (3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) of N addition without concomitant addition of P presumably because of nutrient imbalance in the tissues, but production rates were much lower than the overall means in 2003, when no effect of nutrient addition could be observed. Adding N at high level also increased the potential decay of Sphagnum litter. Higher CO2 emission from N-fertilized litter was due to amelioration of litter chemistry showing lower C/N quotients in the N-fertilized treatments. Rates of CO2 emission from incubated litter also were more strongly affected by water content than by nutrient status, with practically no CO2 emission detected when litter was dry. We conclude that higher rates of atmospheric N availability input may depress Sphagnum growth because of P, and presumably potassium, (co-)limitation. Higher N availability is also expected to promote potential decay of Sphagnum litter by ameliorating litter chemistry. However, both effects are less pronounced if the growing Sphagnum apex and the underlying senescing tissues dry out.

AB Aim Persistent sinks of atmospheric CO2 in undisturbed peatlands are not included in future projections of the global carbon budget. We aimed to explore possible responses of northern peatlands to future climate change and to quantify the role of northern peatlands in the carbon balance of the Northern Hemisphere.
   Location The terrestrial Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N).
   Time period 1861-2099.
   Major taxa studied Not a specific plant species, but a plant functional type is used by the model to represent an average of all vegetation growing in northern peatlands.
   Methods The ORCHIDEE-PEAT v.2.0 process-based land surface model was used to simulate area and carbon dynamics of northern peatlands. The model was driven up to the year 2099 by the global CO2 concentration from representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5 by corresponding climate projections from two general circulation models after bias correction.
   Results First, from 1861 to 2005 the mean annual carbon balance of northern peatlands was an atmospheric CO2 sink of 0.10 PgC/year, and this sink will roughly double in the future under both RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, whereas the total northern peatlands will be either a source of CO2 (IPSL-CM5A-LR) or near neutral (GFDL-ESM2M) by the end of the century under RCP8.5. Second, the peatlands in western Canada, western and northern Europe may experience reducing areas and may shift from being CO2 sinks to sources, especially under rapid climate warming. Third, peatland enhances soil carbon accumulation in the Northern Hemisphere (lands north of 30 degrees N).
   Main conclusions In this study, future changes in both northern peatland extent and peatland carbon storage are simulated. We highlight that undisturbed northern peatlands are small but persistent carbon sinks in the future; thus, it is important to protect these ecosystems.

   QUALITY; STREAMS; EXPORT
AB Peatland ecosystem services include drinking water provision, flood mitigation, habitat provision and carbon sequestration. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal is a key treatment process for the supply of potable water downstream from peat-dominated catchments. A transition from peat-forming Sphagnum moss to vascular plants has been observed in peatlands degraded by (a) land management, (b) atmospheric deposition and (c) climate change. Here within we show that the presence of vascular plants with higher annual above-ground biomass production leads to a seasonal addition of labile plant material into the peatland ecosystem as litter recalcitrance is lower. The net effect will be a smaller litter carbon pool due to higher rates of decomposition, and a greater seasonal pattern of DOC flux. Conventional water treatment involving coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation may be impeded by vascular plant-derived DOC. It has been shown that vascular plant-derived DOC is more difficult to remove via these methods than DOC derived from Sphagnum, whilst also being less susceptible to microbial mineralisation before reaching the treatment works. These results provide evidence that practices aimed at re-establishing Sphagnum moss on degraded peatlands could reduce costs and improve efficacy at water treatment works, offering an alternative to 'end-of-pipe' solutions through management of ecosystem service provision.

AB Methane production and consumption activities were examined in a Massachusetts peatland. Feat from depths of 5-35 cm incubated under anaerobic conditions, produced an average of 2 nmol CH4 g(-1) h(-1) with highest rates for peat fractions between 25-30 cm depth. Extracted microbial nucleic acids showed the strongest relative hybridization with a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe specific for Archaea with samples from the 25-30 cm depth. In aerobic laboratory incubations, the peat consumed methane with a maximum velocity of 67 nmol CH4 g(-1) h(-1) and a K-s of 1.6 mu M. Methane consumption activity was concentrated 4-9 cm below the peat surface, which corresponds to the aerobic, partially decomposed region in this peatland, Phospholipid fatty acid analysis of peat fractions demonstrated an abundance of methanotrophic bacteria within the region of methane consumption activity. Increases in temperature up to 30 degrees C produced an increase in methane consumption rates for shallow samples, but not for samples taken from depths greater than 9 cm. Nitrogen fixation experiments were carried out using N-15(2) uptake in order to avoid problems associated with inhibition of methanotrophy. These experiments demonstrated that methane in peat samples did not stimulate nitrogen fixation activity, nor could activity be correlated with the presence of methanotrophic bacteria in peat fractions.

AB Mires (peat-accumulating wetlands) occupy 8.1% of Russian territory and are especially numerous in the western Siberian Lowlands, where they can significantly modify atmospheric heat and water balances. They also influence air temperatures and humidity in the boundary layers closest to the earth's surface. The purpose of our study was to incorporate the influence of mires into the SL-AV numerical weather prediction model, which is used operationally in the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia. This was done by adjusting the multilayer soil component (by modifying the peat thermal conductivity in the heat diffusion equation and reformulating the lower boundary condition for Richard's equation), and reformulating both the evapotranspiration and runoff from mires. When evaporation from mires was incorporated into the SL-AV model, the latent heat flux in the areas dominated by mires increased strongly, resulting in surface cooling and hence reductions in the sensible heat flux and outgoing terrestrial long-wave radiation. Presented results show that including mires significantly decreased the bias and RMSE of predictions of temperature and relative humidity 2 m above the ground for lead times of 12, 36, and 60 h from 00 h Coordinated Universal Time (evening conditions), but did not eliminate the bias in forecasts for lead times of 24, 48, and 72 h (morning conditions) in Siberia. Different parameterizations of mire evapotranspiration are also compared.

AB 1. Agricultural peatlands and their associated drainage systems are often highly managed and exposed to anthropogenic pressures, such as eutrophication and stable water tables, maintained via drainage during periods of high rainfall and inlet of, alkaline-rich, waters during dry periods. These pressures promote peat degradation, resulting in the accumulation of fine-degraded peat particles that dramatically alter aquatic habitats by smothering surfaces and decreasing water quality. Consequential effects on benthic communities are expected but have not been investigated so far.
   2.We hypothesised that peat degradation can lead to the decline in submerged macrophytes, which are of critical importance to sustaining biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities. To investigate this, we analysed decadal (1985-2007) changes in benthic species richness in 29 peat ditches in the Netherlands and, to determine patterns of macroinvertebrate habitat occupancy, carried out a complementary field experiment with submerged artificial macrophytes, natural sediments and emergent bank vegetation.
   3. Results from long-term monitoring indicate that chemical conditions in agricultural peat ditches have improved slightly over the last decades; however, there has been a simultaneous decline in benthic invertebrate species richness and densities corresponding to a decline in the numbers of submerged macrophytes. The apparent dependence of macroinvertebrates on macrophytes was reinforced by our field experiment which revealed that invertebrate density was highest in submerged artificial plants, while invertebrate species richness was highest in natural emergent vegetation. Conversely, degraded peat sediments supported extremely few invertebrates.
   4. Our results clearly illustrate the strong influence of submerged macrophyte loss on macroinvertebrate assemblages in peatland waters. Furthermore, this suggests that improvements in water quality alone will not benefit invertebrates in the absence of suitable vegetative habitats.

AB Strong climate warming is predicted at higher latitudes this century, with potentially major consequences for productivity and carbon sequestration. Although northern peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil organic carbon, little is known about the long-term responses to experimental climate change of vascular plant communities in these Sphagnum-dominated ecosystems. We aimed to see how long-term experimental climate manipulations, relevant to different predicted future climate scenarios, affect total vascular plant abundance and species composition when the community is dominated by mosses. During 8 years, we investigated how the vascular plant community of a Sphagnum fuscum-dominated subarctic peat bog responded to six experimental climate regimes, including factorial combinations of summer as well as spring warming and a thicker snow cover. Vascular plant species composition in our peat bog was more stable than is typically observed in (sub)arctic experiments: neither changes in total vascular plant abundance, nor in individual species abundances, Shannon's diversity or evenness were found in response to the climate manipulations. For three key species (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Betula nana and S. fuscum) we also measured whether the treatments had a sustained effect on plant length growth responses and how these responses interacted. Contrasting with the stability at the community level, both key shrubs and the peatmoss showed sustained positive growth responses at the plant level to the climate treatments. However, a higher percentage of moss-encroached E. hermaphroditum shoots and a lack of change in B. nana net shrub height indicated encroachment by S. fuscum, resulting in long-term stability of the vascular community composition: in a warmer world, vascular species of subarctic peat bogs appear to just keep pace with growing Sphagnum in their race for space. Our findings contribute to general ecological theory by demonstrating that community resistance to environmental changes does not necessarily mean inertia in vegetation response.

AB In ombrotrophic peatlands, the moisture content of the acrotelm (vadoze zone) controls oxygen diffusion rates, redox state, and the turnover of organic matter. Thus, variably saturated flow processes determine whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon, and modelling these processes is crucial to assess effects of changed environmental conditions on the future development of these ecosystems. We show that the Richards equation can be used to accurately describe the moisture dynamics under evaporative conditions in variably saturated peat soil, encompassing the transition from the topmost living moss layer to the decomposed peat as part of the vadose zone. Soil hydraulic properties (SHP) were identified by inverse simulation of evaporation experiments on samples from the entire acrotelm. To obtain consistent descriptions of the observations, the traditional van GenuchtenMualem model was extended to account for non-capillary water storage and flow. We found that the SHP of the uppermost moss layer reflect a pore-size distribution (PSD) that combines three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum moss. For deeper samples, acrotelm pedogenesis changes the shape of the SHP due to the collapse of inter-plant pores and an infill with smaller particles. This leads to gradually more homogeneous and bi-modal PSDs with increasing depth, which in turn can serve as a proxy for increasing state of pedogenesis in peatlands. From this, we derive a nomenclature and size classification for the pore spaces of Sphagnum mosses and define inter-, intra-, and inner-plant pore spaces, with effective pore diameters of > 300, 300-30, and 30-10 mu m, respectively.

AB The fate of mineral nitrogen (N) in an oligotrophic fen, located in Monts de Forez (Puy-de-D.me department), was studied by N-15 tracking of 0.5 g (nitrogen) m(-2) year(-1) ammonitrate labelled on both ions (30% excess). Simulating atmospheric deposits, an important nutrient source in mires, N additions were made at two periods of the year, June and August, 1986, and the fate of the nitrogen was measured in October of the same year. Nitrogen recovery was measured in the living parts of Sphagnum fallax Klinggr., aerial and hypogeous parts of Carex rostrata Stokes, and in peat. Vegetation preferably absorbed nitrogen in June, as compared to August, the period during which nitrogen allocation to hypogeous phytomasses of Carex was the highest. As compared to Carex, Sphagnum has strong nitrogen assimilation and holding potentials. A nitrogen competition potential index or "nitrogen sink power" (PCN), calculated from recovery and stock data, showed that Sphagnum was more efficient at intercepting nitrogen in August, when rainfall is the lowest in the studied area. In peat, nitrogen recovery was strongest in August. Most of the microbial processes seem to occur in the first 10 cm. Gross nitrogen mineralization and immobilization, calculated from organic matter degradation, were estimated as 11.4 and 6.9 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The gross mineralization estimation according to the method of Fried and Dean was 17.2 g m(-2) year(-1). This overestimation might be attributed to an underestimation of the nitrogen derived from input in plants and an overestimation of nitrogen from peat.

AB The thawing of ice-rich permafrost soils in northern peatlands leads to the formation of thermokarst ponds, surrounded by organic-rich soils. These aquatic ecosystems are sites of intense microbial activity, and CO2 and CH4 emissions. Many of the pond systems in northern landscapes and their surrounding peatlands are hydrologically contiguous, but little is known about the microbial connectivity of concentric habitats around the thermokarst ponds, or the effects of peat accumulation and infilling on the microbial communities. Here we investigated microbial community structure and abundance in a thermokarst pond-peatland system in subarctic Canada. Several lineages were ubiquitous, supporting a prokaryotic continuum from the thermokarst pond to surrounding peatlands. However, the microbial community structure shifted from typical aerobic freshwater microorganisms (Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) in the pond towards acidophilic and anaerobic lineages (Acidobacteria and Choroflexi) in the connected peatland waters, likely selected by the acidification of the water by Sphagnum mosses. Marked changes in abundance and community composition of methane cycling microorganisms were detected along the thermokarst pond-peatland transects, suggesting fine tuning of C-1 carbon cycling within a highly connected system, and warranting the need for higher spatial resolution across the thermokarst landscape to accurately predict net greenhouse gas emissions from northern peatlands.

AB Despite the global importance of understanding the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition on carbon (C) cycling in northern peatlands, the control of N and P interactions through the 'enzymatic latch' mechanism has been largely overlooked. A long-term fertilization experiment in a moderate-rich fen in northeast China was conducted to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of how continuous N and P addition regulate key extracellular enzymes and their interactions, and the subsequent influences on organic C storage in peatlands. The results demonstrated that the growth of Sphagnum moss and vascular plants were both reduced by N addition but enhanced by P addition. Phenolic concentrations were higher in P addition treatments, as were phenol oxidase activities. In general, N addition played a critical role in regulating the stoichiometry of beta-D-glucosidase, N acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and phosphatase, while P addition was more important in regulating their activities. The direct and indirect effects due to fertilization and shifts in vegetational composition, respectively, weakened the 'enzymatic latch' mechanism that controls the decomposition of organic matter after long-term fertilization. Our results indicate that P likely plays a more important role than N in controlling microbial extracellular enzymatic activities and organic matter decomposition in northern minerotrophic peatlands. Consequently, the interactions between N and P is likely of primary significance in regulating the biogeochemical cycling of peatlands.

AB The goal of our work was to estimate the rate of the peat formation and mineralization at two depths: 30 cm (the aerobic zone) and 60 cm (the anaerobic zone). An experiment on peat incubation was performed for two years. In the first year, at the depth of 30 cm, the peat lost about 14% of its mass in the course of the mineralization and was replenished with plant residues, including roots of Eriophorum vaginatum. As a result, the apparent loss of peat was only about 0.8% of its initial mass. At the depth of 60 cm, the mineralization loss of peat in the first year was completely recovered due to the additional input of the root mass. In the second year, the rate of the peat mineralization increased. Over the two years of the studies, the apparent losses of the peat mass at the depths of 30 and 60 cm reached 7.5 and 2.8% of the initial peat mass, respectively. DOI: 10.1134/S1064229311020165

AB For the paleoreconstruction of permafrost peat mounds and the identification of plant communities participating in the formation of peat, the contents of n-alkanes (C-20-C-33) have been determined, and relative changes in the stable isotope compositions of carbon and nitrogen and the C/N ratio have been analysed. Several indices (CPI (alkanes), P (aq), P (wax)) have been calculated to assess the degree of decomposition of the peats studied and the contributions of different plant species to their formation. It has been found that shortand long-chain n-alkanes are concentrated in high-moor peat, while medium-chain alkanes are typical for transitional peat. Integrated analysis of the studied markers has shown that the botanical and material composition of peat, anaerobic conditions of bog formation, and permafrost play an important role in the preservation of organic carbon in permafrost peat mounds. Alternation of plant associations is the main reason for changes in n-alkane concentrations, C/N ratios, and delta 13C values.

AB We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), plant biomass and growth, species composition, peat microclimate, and litter decomposition in a fertilization experiment at Mer Bleue Bog, Ottawa, Ontario. The bog is located in the zone with the highest atmospheric nitrogen deposition for Canada, estimated at 0.8-1.2 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (wet deposition as NH4 and NO3). To establish the effect of nutrient addition on this ecosystem, we fertilized the bog with six treatments involving the application of 1.6-6 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (as NH4NO3), with and without P and K, in triplicate 3 m x 3 m plots. The initial 5-6 years have shown a loss of first Sphagnum, then Polytrichum mosses, and an increase in vascular plant biomass and leaf area index. Analyses of NEE, measured in situ with climate-controlled chambers, indicate that contrary to expectations, the treatments with the highest levels of nutrient addition showed lower rates of maximum NEE and gross photosynthesis, but little change in ecosystem respiration after 5 years. Although shrub biomass and leaf area increased in the high nutrient plots, loss of moss photosynthesis owing to nutrient toxicity, increased vascular plant shading and greater litter accumulation contributed to the lower levels of CO2 uptake. Our study highlights the importance of long-term experiments as we did not observe lower NEE until the fifth year of the experiment. However, this may be a transient response as the treatment plots continue to change. Higher levels of nutrients may cause changes in plant composition and productivity and decrease the ability of peatlands to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB Reconstructing landscapes after open pit mining of the Canadian oil sands presents enormous challenges. Freshwater peatlands dominate the pre-disturbance landscape; however, elevated salinity in the post-disturbance landscape will exclude the use of many freshwater vegetation species for reclamation. Successful reclamation will require plants to grow and accumulate peat despite elevated salinity. We evaluated the potential of salt-tolerant plants to accumulate peat by integrating plant production and decomposition rates in natural and oil sands wetlands across a salinity gradient. These wetlands were dominated by marsh-like vegetation with relatively rapid decomposition, especially of the belowground plant material. Aboveground production was high enough to compensate for rapid decomposition, resulting in mean annual organic matter accumulation of 307 g m(-2). Thus, both natural wetlands (which despite the elevated salinity had peat deposits >35 cm) and the oil sands wetlands accumulated organic matter during the study. There is potential for peat to accumulate in future oil sands wetlands, although long-term accumulation rates may be slower than in undisturbed freshwater fens and bogs. A reliable water supply and a host of other factors will be required for wetlands to accumulate organic matter, and eventually peat, in the post-mining landscape. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) isotope systematics in bog water sulfates were determined for six Sphagnum dominated wetlands located in the British Isles and the Czech Republic, Central Europe. Comparison of a polluted and unpolluted site showed that 4 times higher atmospheric S inputs led to 3 times higher bog water sulfate concentrations and substrate S concentrations, 3 times increased ranges of substrate S concentrations, and 3 times increased ranges of delta S-34 values. Sites with elevated atmospheric S inputs exhibited greater geochemical variability in wetland S species. Sulfate O - S isotope composition of bog pore water at a depth of 40 cm below surface differed from that of surface bog water, indicating that dissimilatory bacterial sulfate reduction, a process known to discriminate against the heavier isotopes O-18 and S-34, occurred in surface peat layers. While bacterial sulfate reduction remained to be one of the main isotope-selective processes for sulfate in peat, it could not fully explain the O - S isotope systematics of peat waters. The 'residual' sulfate was not simultaneously enriched in the heavier isotopes O-18 and S-34. Mixing of residual sulfate following bacterial sulfate reduction with the product of S2- reoxidation, cleavage of esters, and isotope exchange reactions may have contributed to the decoupling of the delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) values. Large within-site differences in delta O-18(SO4) and delta S-34(SO4) (up to 13 and 15 parts per thousand, respectively) indicated little communication between the 0 and 40 cm peat depth at some sites. Extremely high delta O-18(SO4) and delta S-34(SO4) values found in several peat bog water samples from Connemara ( Ireland), Thorne Moors ( England) and Ocean ( Czech Republic) were not seen in streams draining the wetlands. Direct runoff of atmogenic sulfate constituted a significant portion of the bog outflow. At the wetland scale, zones of dissimilatory bacterial sulfate reduction form pockets whose lateral hydrological fluxes are small.

AB Agricultural legacies shape soil seed banks, which in turn alter subsequent vegetation recovery. However, the role of legacy-impacted seed banks in shaping wetland-vegetation recovery is not well studied, and hydrologic context may alter impacts of seed bank legacies on extant vegetation. Here we compare seed banks and extant vegetation of four plowed fens to an on-site reference fen to determine (i) if plowing legacies have altered seed banks, (ii) if 13-year post-abandonment vegetation differs from the reference fen, and (iii) whether extant vegetation composition is different than that of seed banks in both reference and plowed fens. The relative abundance of key native graminoid and fen specialist species was greatly reduced in plowed-fen seed banks compared to the reference fen, while weedy/invasive species present in the post-agricultural fens' seed banks were absent from the reference fen. The depletion of normally dominant native graminoids from seed banks was reflected in extant vegetation. However, shallow water tables predicted shifts in extant vegetation from weedy-mesic annuals to areas dominated by either native clonal forbs or Phalaris arundinacea. In general, plowed plant communities had decreases relative abundance of weedy-mesic species and increased relative abundance clonal forbs or clonal-invasive graminoids compared to seed banks. Our results suggest that while depletion of native graminoids from seed banks plays a part in vegetation recovery, the abundance of weedy-mesic species was not reflected in the recovering vegetation in wetter areas.

AB Colorimetric measurements of alkaline extracts from two Swiss peat cores have provided a complete 14500-year-long record of peat humification, a proxy of effective precipitation. Peat from the cold Younger Dryas (11050-9550 cal. BC) was well preserved despite low levels of precipitation. A particularly dry period, peaking at c. 7100 cal. BC, is indicated by well-decomposed peat. Peat from c. 6750-4250 cal. BC shows a low degree of decomposition, indicating a wet bog surface despite relatively warm temperatures and therefore indicating high levels of precipitation. A sharp transition to higher levels of decomposition c. 4450-3750 cal. BC indicates a major transition to a drier bog surface. Subsequently, peat humification generally decreases towards the end of the deeper profile (c. cal. AD 1050), indicating a gradual return to wetter conditions. This gradual decrease is punctuated by periods of particularly low humification which appear to be due to shifts to higher levels of effective precipitation from c. 2500 to 1350 cal. BC, C. 1050 to 550 cal. BC, centered around 150 cal. BC, and from c. cal. AD 550 onwards. Anthropogenic influences appear to have affected peat humification at the site at least since the Middle Ages. This study indicates that humification in colder regions/time periods could be more affected by temperature than precipitation and vice versa.

AB The application of molecular approaches to palaeovegetation reconstruction in peat is still relatively rare, with molecular level studies of carbohydrate organic geochemistry being generally uncommon. In this report, neutral monosaccharides derived via acid hydrolysis were investigated in modern bog-forming plants in order to assess their potential application as biomarkers in peat palaeovegetation reconstruction. The concentrations of major neutral monosaccharides, i.e. glucose (Glu), xylose (Xyl), arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), rhamnose (Rha) and fucose (Fuc), were determined using gas chromatography (GC) for 7 lichens, 10 Sphagnurn species and 7 vascular plants collected from three ombrotrophic mires across northern Europe. Based on factor analysis of the modern plant monosaccharide compositions, two carbohydrate proxies: [(Man + Gal):(Ara + Xyl)] and % contributions of Rha and Fuc in total Glu-free monosaccharides [%(Rha + Fuc)], were selected as biomarkers for bog-forming plants. The three plant groups could be separated by [(Man + Gal):(Ara + Xyl)], which showed decreasing values following the order: lichens > Sphagna > vascular plants. The high [%(Rha + Fuc)] in Sphagna allowed their separation from lichens and vascular plants. These two factors were applied as plant group-specific indices to investigate vegetation change in a peat core from Kontolanrahka Bog, Finland. Our findings show strong correspondence with fossil plant abundances from the same core, thereby confirming the potential of carbohydrate compositional parameters as proxies for palaeovegetation reconstruction in peat bogs.

AB Urban and industrial developments were the reason for draining peatlands in the past which caused changes in their ecology. Restoration of the water regime aims to bring back their original functions. This study examines the natural recovery of peatland following re-wetting, blocking the drainage ditches. We used soil microbial activity, physicochemical properties and nematode communities as indicator taxa to describe restoration status five years after management. Data were compared to those obtained from adjacent degraded forest and meadow like habitats of former peatlands. Our results indicate that re-wetting had considerable effect to soil indices and nematodes. Soil moisture and organic carbon significantly increased, while pH has not changed. In contrast, soil enzymatic activity significantly decreased after re-wetting in the restored part of the peatland compared to the degraded habitats. These conditions were probably less favourable for small metazoans, because of their abundance; species number and diversity were significantly decreased after re-wetting management. The nematode trophic structure was also significantly degraded; the restored part of peatland had less omnivore and predators as well as plant parasites. We conclude that in respect to both biological indicators and basic soil properties analysed, blocking of drainage ditches creates capable conditions for natural peatland restoration.

AB Draining fen areas seriously impairs ecosystem services as carbon ( C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) accumulation. Fen restoration has become central in management efforts to recover these ecosystem services in the face of global climate change and water eutrophication challenges. However, restoration has resulted in the creation of shallow lakes, rather than former pristine fen conditions. A new sediment layer, where C, N, and P accumulate, forms at these novel ecosystems, and differs from peat accumulation occurring in natural fens. We performed an initial estimate of C, N, and P accumulation in water inundated fens, and their potential as C, N and P sinks within the temperate area is discussed. Furthermore, the roles of topsoil removal and ecosystem age were considered. A set of abandoned peat extraction sites (n = 6), and rewetted fens (n = 6) were selected. The effects of topsoil removal prior to restoration are represented by the former sites, which were created 20-86 years ago; and the absence of topsoil removal was represented by the latter, which were established 7-20 years ago. Sediment cores were obtained, and OC, N, and P accumulation rates estimated. Fossil diatoms in the sediment layer-peat interface were evaluated to ascertain trophic conditions in the initial lake formation stages. Surface water quality was analysed to describe current trophic conditions. Our results determined C, N, and P accumulation rates at inundated fens (133.89 +/- 7.23 g C m(-2) y(-1); 9.60 +/- 0.57 g N m-2 y-1; 0.88 +/- 0.08 g P m(-2) y(-1)) were within the range of natural fens, and other temperate aquatic ecosystems. Topsoil removal prevented eutrophication, and decreased C, N, and P accumulation (P < 0.01), although it remains questionable how rewetted sites lacking topsoil removal will function in the long-term. Results demonstrated OM mineralisation has been an ongoing process in the new sediment layer for several decades, what does not occur in water saturated peat at undisturbed pristine fens.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Peat cores were taken from two contrasting Sphagnum bogs in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland. At Etang de la Gruyere (EGr), 6.5 m of peat has accumulated during the past 10,000 years. In the first 100 cm of this profile there are several distinct peaks in ash content, but the values are well within the range for typical ombrotrophic Sphagnum bogs. There is also considerable variation in the concentrations of major and trace lithogenic metals (Al, Ti, Sc, Ca, Mg, Rb, and Sr), but most of this is simply a reflection of the natural variations in the amount of mineral matter in the peats. The Ca/Mg molar ratios in the peats at EGr are comparable to or lower than the average rainwater composition in this area, showing that this section of the peat core is ombrotrophic (i.e. rainwater-fed). In other words, the inorganic constituents in the surface peats at EGr were supplied exclusively by atmospheric deposition. This peat core, therefore, is suitable for studying the historical record of atmospheric metal deposition. Arsenic, Cu; Pb, Sb, and Zn are all more abundant in surface and near surface peat layers compared to deeper parts of the profile. Enrichment factors (EFs) for the profile were calculated conservatively by normalizing the metal/Sc ratios of individual peat samples to the average of the five lowest metal/Sc ratios in this part of the core (69-84 cm); these are tentatively assumed to represent pre-Industrial background values. The maximum EFs are approximately 5 times for Cu, 15 times for As, and 30 to 50 times for Pb, Sb, and Zn.
   At La Tourbiere des Genevez (TGe), 1.5 m of peat represents 4,800 years of peat formation. At this site, the ash contents are higher and increase progressively with depth to values which are characteristic of minerotrophic fen peats. The concentration profiles of Al, Ti, Sc, Ca, Mg, Rb, Sr show the same general trend. The Ca/Mg molar ratios of these peats are generally twice the rainwater average, showing that this bog is essentially minerotrophic (ie groundwater-fed). Thus, the inorganic constituents in these peats were provided by both atmospheric and hydrospheric processes. Despite this, the Cu, Pb, Sb, and Zn concentrations are generally very similar to those at EGr, especially in the uppermost part of the profile, indicating that recent atmospheric inputs also dominate the supply of these metals to this bog. However, the minimum Pb and Sb concentrations in this profile are approximately five times higher than the corresponding values at EGr. The minerotrophic profile at TGe, therefore, could not by itself be used Co calculate rates of atmospheric Pb and Sb deposition because it is impossible to distinguish between atmospheric and hydrospheric metal inputs.
   At TGe, As concentrations increase continuously with depth, reaching concentrations in the deeper, older peats which are more than 50 times higher than the 'background' As values at EGr. At this site the natural supply of As by mineral soil water completely masks the recent, elevated inputs contributed by atmospheric deposition. Thus, the peat core from TGe is also unsuitable for studying atmospheric As deposition.

AB Throughout the last two centuries peatlands have been subject to extensive drainage, typically through the digging of ditches. Ecosystem restoration now focusses on damming or infilling these ditches to increase biodiversity and to provide a range of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water provision. We surveyed 60 bog pools created following ditch blocking (alone) on a blanket bog in north Wales. Eighteen months after restoration the mean total pool vegetation cover was 76%. There was a strong negative relationship between pool depth and Eriophorum cover (r(2) = 0.74), and a weaker positive relationship between depth and Sphagnum cover (r(2) = 0.35). Observations showed that pools had been colonised by various invertebrate species. Pool dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were not connected to pool vegetation, suggesting that catchment-scale processes drive DOC. Other studies have shown that Eriophorum generates large methane fluxes, and that Sphagnum can act as a methane sink. Therefore we recommend that pools should be deeper than 0.5 m to give the greatest carbon benefit, whilst noting that this is unlikely to significantly affect DOC fluxes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10%-20% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.

AB Many wetland ecosystems such as peatlands and wet tundra hold large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their soils, and are thus important in the terrestrial C cycle. We have synthesized data on the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange obtained from eddy covariance measurements from 12 wetland sites, covering 1-7 years at each site, across Europe and North America, ranging from ombrotrophic and minerotrophic peatlands to wet tundra ecosystems, spanning temperate to arctic climate zones. The average summertime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was highly variable between sites. However, all sites with complete annual datasets, seven in total, acted as annual net sinks for atmospheric CO2. To evaluate the influence of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) on NEE, we first removed the artificial correlation emanating from the method of partitioning NEE into GPP and R-eco. After this correction neither R-eco (P = 0.162) nor GPP (P = 0.110) correlated significantly with NEE on an annual basis. Spatial variation in annual and summertime R-eco was associated with growing season period, air temperature, growing degree days, normalized difference vegetation index and vapour pressure deficit. GPP showed weaker correlations with environmental variables as compared with R-eco, the exception being leaf area index (LAI), which correlated with both GPP and NEE, but not with R-eco. Length of growing season period was found to be the most important variable describing the spatial variation in summertime GPP and R-eco; global warming will thus cause these components to increase. Annual GPP and NEE correlated significantly with LAI and pH, thus, in order to predict wetland C exchange, differences in ecosystem structure such as leaf area and biomass as well as nutritional status must be taken into account.

   ORGANOHALOGENS; ACCUMULATION; PEATLANDS; DYNAMICS; CHLORINE
AB Halogens are strongly enriched in peat and peatlands and such they are one of their largest active terrestrial reservoir. The enrichment of halogens in peat is mainly attributed to the formation of organohalogens and climatically controlled humification processes. However, little is known about release of halogens from the peat substrate and the distribution of halogens in the peat pore water. In this study we have investigated the distribution of chlorine, bromine and iodine in pore water of three pristine peat bogs located in the Magellanic Moorlands, southern Chile. Peat pore waters were collected using a sipping technique, which allows in situ sampling down to a depth greater than 6 m. Halogens and halogen species in pore water were determined by ion-chromatography (IC) (chlorine) and IC-ICPMS (bromine and iodine). Results show that halogen concentrations in pore water are 15-30 times higher than in rainwater. Mean concentrations of chlorine, bromine and iodine in pore water were 7-15 mg l(-1), 56-123 g l(-1), and 10-20 g l(-1), which correspond to mean proportions of 10-15%, 1-2.3% and 0.5-2.2% of total concentrations in peat, respectively. Organobromine and organoiodine were the predominant species in pore waters, whereas chlorine in pore water was mostly chloride. Advection and diffusion of halogens were found to be generally low and halogen concentrations appear to reflect release from the peat substrate. Release of bromine and iodine from peat depend on the degree of peat degradation, whereas this relationship is weak for chlorine. Relatively higher release of bromine and iodine was observed in less degraded peat sections, where the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was also the most intensive. It has been concluded that the release of halogenated dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the predominant mechanism of iodine and bromine release from peat.

DT Article
DE Carbon cycle; Land-use change; Populus trichocarpa; Mitigation; Drained
   wetland
AB Drainage of peatlands increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and can turn them into a carbon (C) source to the atmosphere. Afforestation of drained peatlands could help to reverse this process since the trees may enhance C sequestration. We followed the C and water dynamics of an afforested drained peatland in S-Iceland during a 2 year period, during which the Black Cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) plantation was 23-25 year old. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method and C pools of trees and ground vegetation were measured using the stock change method. Lateral losses of dissolved and particulated organic C (DOC, POC) were estimated from weekly water-runoff samples. Unexpectedly, the afforested drained peatland was a strong sink of carbon during the two years, with an average NEE value of 714 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Only 0.5% of the total NEE was lost through lateral DOC and POC transport, leaving 710 g C m(-2) yr(-1) as the total net ecosystem production (NEP). Ca. 91% of the observed NEP could be explained by the annual biomass increment of the Black Cottonwood trees and 1.3% by the ground vegetation. This means that the remaining 7.5% of the total NEP most likely accumulated in peat soil and litter, contributing to the soil C stocks. The dormant-season CO2 emissions were unexpectedly low, which was explained by a high groundwater level at this drained site outside the ca. 5 months of the active growing season. On average, 66% of the annual measured precipitation was estimated to have evaporated back to the atmosphere. This left 416 mm for potential runoff, which was somewhat lower value than the measured runoff (662 mm). These results indicate that during the age span of ca. 20-25 years, afforestation was a valid method to reverse the expected negative C-balance of this drained grassland pasture in Iceland. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB There are very few palaeoecological studies of thermal springs in central Europe, despite the fact that they are extreme but stable habitats that enabled the long-term survival of certain species and are located in areas for which there is little data about landscape history. In western Slovakia, close to Male Bielice village at the northern margin of the Pannonian-Carpathian boundary, a peat-forming warm spring is uniquely preserved, and it still harbours a rare plant, Cladium mariscus. This site is located in a region that is noteworthy for the occurrence of many rare, light-demanding species that have disjunct distributions or are at the limits of their distributions, which may indicate a long history of treeless habitats there. The geographical position of this study site thus provides a great opportunity to address the perennial debate about in situ relicts and the continuity of grasslands throughout the forest optimum. We analysed a Holocene sediment core for macrofossils of vascular plants, bryophytes and molluscs, and for pollen, which were surprisingly preserved in rather high diversity, which enabled a detailed reconstruction of the landscape history. We further reviewed the archaeological evidence. Using this multi-proxy approach, we were able to confirm (i) the early expansion of mesophilous trees (Ulmus, Fraxinus, Tilia and Quercus) in northern parts of the Carpathian-Pannonian boundary, but the onset of this expansion could not be dated precisely, (ii) the continual persistence of the Cladium mariscus population in the fen, and (iii) existence of open steppes and/or dry grasslands and open wetlands in this region throughout the Holocene. Since the Bronze Age, there are coincidences in the history of human settlement, local development of the fen and regional changes in the representation of particular habitats, including managed wet, mesic and semi-dry grasslands.

AB This article provides an overview of the effects of land-use on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and from peatlands in the Nordic countries based on the field data from about 100 studies. In addition, this review aims to identify the gaps in the present knowledge on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances associated with the land-use of these northern ecosystems. Northern peatlands have accumulated, as peat, a vast amount of carbon from the atmosphere since the last glaciation. However, the past land-use and present climate have evidently changed their GHG balance. Unmanaged boreal peatlands may act as net sources or sinks for CO2 and CH4 depending on the weather conditions. Drainage for agriculture has turned peatlands to significant sources of GHGs (mainly N2O and CO2). Annual mean GHG balances including net CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 2260, 2280 and 3140 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) (calculated using 100 year time horizon) for areas drained for grass swards, cereals or those left fallow, respectively. Even after cessetion of the cultivation practices, N2O and CO2 emissions remain high. The mean net GHG emissions in abandoned and afforested agricultural peatlands have been 1580 and 500 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), respectively. Peat extraction sites are net sources of GHGs with an average emission rate of 770 gCO(2) eq. m(-2). Cultivation of a perennial grass (e. g., reed canary grass) on an abandoned peat extraction site has been shown to convert such a site into a net sink of GHGs (-330 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). In contrast, despite restoration, such sites are known to emit GHGs (mean source of 480 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), mostly from high CH4 emissions). Peatland forests, originally drained for forestry, may act as net sinks (mean -780 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, the studies where all three GHGs have been measured at an ecosystem level in the forested peatlands are lacking. The data for restored peatland forests (clear cut and rewetted) indicate that such sites are on average a net sink (190 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). The mean emissions from drained peatlands presented here do not include emissions from ditches which form a part of the drainage network and can contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Peat soils submerged under water reservoirs have acted as sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O (mean annual emission 240 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, we cannot yet predict accurately the overall greenhouse gas fluxes of organic soils based on the site characteristics and land-use practices alone because the data on many land-use options and our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling associated with the gas fluxes are limited.

AB Peatlands store 30% of the world's terrestrial soil carbon (C) and those located at northern latitudes are expected to experience rapid climate warming. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes across a factorial design of in situ water table (control, drought, and flooded plots) and soil warming (control vs. warming via open top chambers) treatments for 2 years in a rich fen located just outside the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in interior Alaska. The drought (lowered water table position) treatment was a weak sink or small source of atmospheric CO2 compared to the moderate atmospheric CO2 sink at our control. This change in net ecosystem exchange was due to lower gross primary production and light-saturated photosynthesis rather than increased ecosystem respiration. The flooded (raised water table position) treatment was a greater CO2 sink in 2006 due largely to increased early season gross primary production and higher light-saturated photosynthesis. Although flooding did not have substantial effects on rates of ecosystem respiration, this water table treatment had lower maximum respiration rates and a higher temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration than the control plot. Surface soil warming increased both ecosystem respiration and gross primary production by approximately 16% compared to control (ambient temperature) plots, with no net effect on net ecosystem exchange. Results from this rich fen manipulation suggest that fast responses to drought will include reduced ecosystem C storage driven by plant stress, whereas inundation will increase ecosystem C storage by stimulating plant growth.

AB Peatlands and other wetlands are sinks for antimony (Sb), and solid natural organic matter (NOM) may play an important role in controlling Sb binding. However, direct evidence of Sb sequestration in natural peat samples is lacking. Here, we analyzed solid phase Sb, iron (Fe), and sulfur (5) as well as aqueous Sb speciation in three profiles up to a depth of 80 cm in a mine water impacted peatland in northern Finland. Linear combination fittings of extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra showed that Sb binding to Fe phases was of minor importance and observed only in the uppermost layers of the peatland. Instead, the dominant (to almost exclusive) sequestration mechanism was Sb(III) binding to oxygen-containing functional groups, and at greater depths, increasingly Sb(III) binding to thiol groups of NOM. Aqueous Sb speciation was dominated by antimonate, while antimonite concentrations were low, further supporting our findings of much higher reactivity of Sb(III) than Sb(V) toward peat surfaces. Insufficient residence time for efficient reduction of antimonate to antimonite currently hinders higher Sb removal in the studied peatland. Overall, our findings imply that Sb(III) binding to solid NOM acts as an important sequestration mechanism under reducing conditions in peatlands and other high-organic matter environments.

   mosses; Stable isotopes
AB Sedimentary deposits from glacier-fed peatlands provide records of past glacier variability, but the dynamics of these peat-forming ecosystems have rarely been investigated. Through multi-proxy analyses of a 204-cm peat core, we reconstructed the ecological response of a glacier-fed peatland on subantarctic South Georgia to climate and glacier variability over the last 4300 years. A stable peatland with rapid carbon accumulations and dynamic turnovers between brown mosses and monocots persisted between 4300 and 2550 cal yr BP when the up-valley cirque glacier was small under a regional hypsithermal climate. Carbon accumulation rates showed two peak periods driven by climate warming, reaching 140 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 4000-3500 cal yr BP and 70 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 3200-2700 cal yr BP. Paired delta C-13 and delta O-18 data from brown moss cellulose reveal several intervals of glacial meltwater inundation that caused short-term disturbances of the peatland vegetation, indicating that glacial meltwater potentially still affected the peatland ecosystem during this warm period. Moss-dominated vegetation was disrupted and peatland carbon accumulation rates decreased to 15 g C m(-2) yr(-1) after around 2550 cal yr BP when a cooling-driven glacier advance shifted the erosion and meltwater regime enhancing the glacial sediment influx onto the peatland. Although this enhanced regime of meltwater disturbance has continued since this transition, the brown moss habitat was gradually re-established during the medieval climate warming between 1200 and 600 cal yr BP and then became dominant shortly after that. This reestablishment of brown mosses might have benefited from a period of increased carbon accumulation rates up to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 1200-900 cal yr BP that built up the organic matter matrix and stabilized the habitat. We conclude that the ecosystem dynamics of glacier-fed peatlands is strongly shaped by the interplay between regional climate and glacier activity. This study also demonstrates the potential of stable isotope analysis in studying the paleohydrology of non -Sphagnum peatlands. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we provide eddy covariance measurements determining net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at a protected but moderately drained ombrotrophic bog in Northwestern Germany over three consecutive years. The region is dominated by intensive agricultural land use with total (wet and dry) atmospheric N deposition being about 25kgNha(-1)yr(-1). The investigated peat bog was a small net CO2 sink during all three years ranging from -9 to -73gCm(-2)yr(-1). We found temperature- and light-dependent ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production, respectively, but only weak correlations to water table depths despite large interannual and seasonal variability. Significant short-term effects of atmospheric N deposition on CO2 flux components could not be observed, as the primary controlling factors for N deposition and C sequestration, i.e., fertilization of adjacent fields as well as temperature and light availability, respectively, exceeded potential interactions between the two.

AB Peatlands are long term carbon catchments that sink atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and source methane (CH4). in the uplands of the United Kingdom ombrotrophic blanket peatlands commonly exist within Calluna vulgaris (L.) dominated moorland ecosystems. These landscapes contain a range of topographical features that influence local hydrology, climate and plant community composition. In this study we examined the variation in ecosystem CO2 respiration and net CH4 fluxes from typical plant-soil systems in dendritic drainage gullies and adjacent blanket peat during the growing season. Typically, Eriophorum spp., Sphagnum spp. and mixed grasses occupied gullies while C. uulgaris dominated in adjacent blanket peat. Gross CO2 respiration was highest in the areas of Eriophorum spp. (650 +/- 140 Mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)) compared to those with Sphagnum spp. (338 +/- 49 mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)), mixed grasses (342 +/- 91 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and C. vulgaris (174 +/- 63 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). Measurements of the net CH4 flux showed higher fluxes from the Eriophorum spp (2.2 +/- 0.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) locations compared to the Sphagnurn spp. (0.6 +/- 0.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), mixed grasses (0.1 +/- 0.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and a negligible flux detected from C. uulgaris (0.0 +/- 0.0 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1)) locations. A GIS approachwas applied to calculate the contribution of gullies to landscape scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Findings from the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK showed that although gullies occupied only 9.3% of the total land surface, gullies accounted for 95.8% and 21.6% of the peatland net CH4 and CO2 respiratory fluxes, respectively. The implication of these findings is that the relative contribution of characteristic gully systems need to be considered in estimates of landscape scale peatland greenhouse gas fluxes.

AB The runoff from blanket peatland catchments tends to be dominated by flashy stormflows. However, it is not known whether changes in vegetation cover influence the nature of stormflow hydrographs from blanket peatlands. This is important since degraded peatlands are of concern to restoration bodies who seek to understand the wider impacts of restoration investment on ecosystem services. This paper tests the hypothesis that peak flows are significantly higher and lag times shorter at the catchment scale when blanket peat vegetation cover is reduced. Storm hydrograph data from the 1950s to the present day are analysed from a blanket peat catchment in northern England. The proportion of the catchment that was vegetated appears to have declined between the early 1950s and mid 1970s and then increased again to the present day. The changes in the proportion of bare peat over the catchment are coincident with changes in storm hydrographs. Hydrographs were significantly peakier with higher peaks per unit of rainfall (0.40 m(3) mm(-1) compared with 0.27 m(3) mm(-1)) and narrower hydrograph shapes during the more eroded periods in the catchment and less so as the site has revegetated. Mean peak storm discharge was also significantly higher during the most eroded period. Thus, for the first time we have found evidence in a blanket peat headwater catchment that vegetation cover influences river flow response to rainfall. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In microplot experiments on two minerotrophic mire sites of northeastern Germany (a: highly degraded, shallow-Paulinenaue, Brandenburg; b: slightly degraded, deep-layer-Heinrichswalde, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) the fate of N-15-labelled fertilizer-N (120 kg N ha(-1) as (KNO3)-N-15, 46.94 at-% N-15(etc)) was investigated over one growing season. Only 53 to 69 % of the applied fertilizer-N (63 to 82 kg N ha(-1)) could be recovered. The plants had taken up about 70 to 79 % of this portion, that is about 16 % of their total N demand. At the end of the first year of experiment, about 21 to 30 % of the fertilizer-N recovered were in the soil, more than 90 % of which in 0-20 cm depth. It is assumed that the low rates of retrieval are due to gaseous losses of N-compounds (as N-2; N2O).

AB 1. A prerequisite for the restoration of desiccated bog remnants is rewetting the peat surface. Frequently in Europe, extensive areas are flooded in order to maximize water retention, and growth of peat mosses is often observed in the shallow zones. In deeper waters, regeneration appears to depend on whether residual peat will become buoyant and form floating rafts.
   2. In order to study the initial stages of peat bog regeneration, conditions required for peat buoyancy were studied on peat monoliths collected from three cut-over bog remnants in the Netherlands. The effects of different peat quality and water chemistry on buoyancy of the monoliths, as well as growth of Sphagnum cuspidatum and nutrient availability, were followed in a glasshouse experiment.
   3. Both groundwater and peat quality affected the buoyancy of the monoliths and the growth of S cuspidatum. When groundwater containing bicarbonate (1 mmol l(-1) HCO3-, pH 6.0) was applied, the pH of peat monoliths increased from c. 3.5 to c. 4.5 due to acid buffering. As a result, two of the peat types became more buoyant and the concentration, production and emissions of methane (CH4) increased. It was concluded that the increase in CH2 production, induced by the increased pH, was responsible for the buoyancy.
   4. When groundwater contained both HCO3- (1 mmol l(-1)) and sulphate (1 mmol l(-1)), pH was further increased to approximately pH 5.0 due to alkalinity generated by the SO42- reduction process. CH4 production, however, decreased because of interference from the SO42-, as confirmed in additional incubation experiments. Phosphate concentrations, however, greatly increased in the HCO3-/SO42- addition treatment due to the interaction between sulphide and iron phosphate precipitates.
   5. In one of the peat types, treatments did not influence CH4 production and buoyancy, most probably because of its low decomposability. The chemical characteristics of the peat, notably the concentrations of lignin and soluble phenolics as well as C:N, C:P and C:K ratios, were all higher than in the other two peat types.
   6. The increase of S. cuspidatum biomass during the experiment appeared to be strongly related to the N:P ratios of the capitula, which differed considerably among the three peat types.
   7. We conclude that when bog remnants are inundated the prospects for bog regeneration are largely determined by peat quality and water chemistry. Peat mats with low concentration of lignin and phenolics and low C:N ratios are most likely to become buoyant in water with a higher pH, so providing suitable environments for Sphagnum species. When peat quality is inadequate, either shallow inundation or the addition of suitable peat from elsewhere is indicated.

AB The role of plant phenology as a regulator for gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) in peatlands is empirically not well constrained. This is because proxies to track vegetation development with daily coverage at the ecosystem scale have only recently become available and the lack of such data has hampered the disentangling of biotic and abiotic effects. This study aimed at unraveling the mechanisms that regulate the seasonal variation in GEP across a network of eight European peatlands. Therefore, we described phenology with canopy greenness derived from digital repeat photography and disentangled the effects of radiation, temperature and phenology on GEP with commonality analysis and structural equation modeling. The resulting relational network could not only delineate direct effects but also accounted for possible effect combinations such as interdependencies (mediation) and interactions (moderation). We found that peatland GEP was controlled by the same mechanisms across all sites: phenology constituted a key predictor for the seasonal variation in GEP and further acted as a distinct mediator for temperature and radiation effects on GEP. In particular, the effect of air temperature on GEP was fully mediated through phenology, implying that direct temperature effects representing the thermoregulation of photosynthesis were negligible. The tight coupling between temperature, phenology and GEP applied especially to high latitude and high altitude peatlands and during phenological transition phases. Our study highlights the importance of phenological effects when evaluating the future response of peatland GEP to climate change. Climate change will affect peatland GEP especially through changing temperature patterns during plant phenologically sensitive phases in high latitude and high altitude regions.

AB Managers of restoration projects need readily applicable tools that give them an unequivocal declaration of success or failure based on primary goals that may vary according to different jurisdictions. We used restored extracted Sphagnum peatlands in Canada to illustrate how different types of plant communities assigned to different restoration outcomes can be identified from readily measurable descriptors. Vegetation was surveyed from 5-10 years after restoration at 2-3 year intervals in a total of 274 permanent plots in 66 restored peatlands located across 4500 km, from Alberta in the drier continental interior to the wetter maritime coastal province of New Brunswick. Plant community data were subjected to a k-means clustering that resulted in three restoration outcome categories. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model (the "declaration tool") correctly classified 91 % of the plots in a calibration database that included 75 % of the peatlands, and 93 % of the validation database (25 % of the peatlands), into the restoration outcome categories, using plant strata and number of years since restoration (only) as descriptors. The model includes classification functions that can be used to assign a new plot (not used to construct the model) to its restoration outcome category. We found that similar to 70 % of the severely degraded peatland is successfully regenerating towards the target plant community.

AB Background: Restoration aims at reversing the trend of habitat degradation, the major threat to biodiversity. In Finland, more than half of the original peatland area has been drained, and during recent years, restoration of some of the drained peatlands has been accomplished. Short-term effects of the restoration on peatland hydrology, chemistry and vegetation are promising but little is known about how other species groups apart from vascular plants and bryophytes respond to restoration efforts.
   Results: Here, we studied how abundance and species richness of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) respond to restoration. We sampled larvae in three sites (restored, drained, pristine) on each of 12 different study areas. We sampled Odonata larvae before restoration (n = 12), during the first (n = 10) and the third (n = 7) year after restoration and used generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effect of restoration. Drained sites had lower abundance and species richness than pristine sites. During the third year after restoration both abundance and species richness had risen in restored sites.
   Conclusions: Our results show that Odonata suffer from drainage, but seem to benefit from peatland restoration and are able to colonize newly formed water pools already within three years after restoration.

AB The restoration of drained peat bogs in Northwest (NW) Europe is an important task of soil protection, but needs to cope with warmer and drier summers. Our examination took place in the Pietzmoor bog (Schneverdingen, NW Germany) that had been drained for fuel peat extraction until the 1970s and rewetted since then. We determined carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux in situ and in laboratory incubations. Also, we analyzed pore water for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total and dissolved organic N (DON), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium, (NH4+) concentration. In Schneverdingen, the summer 2003 was record-breaking hot (mean temperature June to August elevated > 3 K compared to long-term average) and dry (precipitation during the same period < 59% of long-term average). In July 2003, the water table in the Pietzmoor subsided to > 42 cm below the surface in July 2003,when in Situ Soil CO2 efflux was up to 23.4 g m(-2) d(-1) compared to 15.7 g m(-2) d(-1) in September. Prior to March 2003, DOC concentrations in pore water were < 180,mg l(-1) and NH4+ was the dominant fraction of mineral N. In July 2003, DOC concentration rose to 249 g l(-1), DON concentrations. more than doubled, and NO3- became the dominant fraction of mineral N. Due to the increased future likelihood of,hot and dry summers in NW Germany, peat bog restoration efforts need take care that a water table close to the surface is maintained.

AB Rewetting of bogs after peat extraction in eutrophied, agricultural areas often results in mono-species stands of Juncus effusus L. In contrast to typical peat forming vegetation such as Sphagnum, J. effusus is highly productive and supplies large amounts of labile carbon, but it is still unknown how this species affects biogeochemistry and the potential of restored peatlands to store carbon. To study degradation of T. effusus litter of different quality and its effect on peat decomposition, we conducted a full-factorial, anaerobic incubation with dried, C-13 labelled litter (roots and shoots) of fertilized (C/N ratio 19.6, C/P ratio 55.3) and non -fertilized plants (C/N ratio 57.8, C/P ratio 304.5). We furthermore analyzed weakly (fibric) to highly (earthyfied) humified, and acidic Sphagnum-Eriophorum peat from three different rewetted and active peat extraction sites of the temperate, nemoral NW German Plain. Materials were incubated fully water saturated at 15 degrees C for 70 days; peat-only and litter incubations served as controls to the full-factorial re-combination of peat and litter. By this experimental design, we investigated the effect of fertilization on litter degradability, decomposition rates of litter in relation to peat, and the controls on decomposition rates to explain potential priming effects by recombination of fresh organic carbon and refractory peat. Surprisingly, fertilization of J. effusus only insignificantly affected decomposition rates between litter types. Decomposition rates of J. effusus litter were 2-18 times higher than of peat, and spectroscopic analysis of the organic matter confirmed the lability of litter and its leachates in comparison to peat. Decomposition rates were equally controlled (73% variance explained) by availability of terminal electron acceptors and the activity of hydrolyzing enzymes. However, hydrolase activity was strongly negatively correlated (R-2=0.95, P < 0.05) with aromaticity, suggesting an inhibitory effect. Furthermore, upon combination of litter and peat, litter was preferentially decomposed. Litter amendments in general lead to faster depletion of electron acceptors. Thus, in these anaerobic incubations, electron acceptor availability limited a priming effect on the comparably refractory peat, and importantly, input of labile carbon from J. effusus did not compromise the preservation of peat. Instead, rapid exhaustion of electron acceptors may even lead to preservation of this comparably readily decomposable plant litter.

AB How methane (CH4) fluxes from alpine peatlands, especially during freeze-thaw cycles, affect the global CH4 budget is poorly understood. The present research combined the eddy covariance method, incubation experiments and high-throughput sequencing to observe CH4 flux from an alpine fen during thawing-freezing periods over a period of four years. The response of CH4 production potential and methanogenic archaea to climate change was analyzed. We found a relatively high mean annual cumulative CH4 emission of 37.7 g CH4-C m(-2). The dominant contributor to CH4 emission was the thawing period: warmer, longer thawing periods contributed 69.1-88.6% to the annual CH4 budget. Non-thawing periods also contributed, with shorter frozen-thawing periods accounting for up to 18.5% and shorter thawing-freezing periods accounting for up to 8.8%. Over the course of a year, emission peaked in the peak growing season and at onset of thawing and freezing. In contrast, emission did not vary substantially during the frozen period. Daily mean emission was highest during the thawing period and lowest during the frozen period. Diurnal patterns of CH4 emission were similar among the four periods, with peaks ranging from 12:00 to 18:00 and the lowest emission around 00:00. Water table and temperature were the dominant factors controlling CH4 emissions during different thawing-freezing periods. Our results suggest that CH4 emission from peatland will change substantially as CH4 production, microbial composition, and patterns of thawing-freezing cycles change with global warming. Therefore, frequent monitoring of CH4 fluxes in more peatlands and in situ monitoring of methanogenesis and related microbes are needed to provide a clear picture of CH4 fluxes and the thawing-freezing processes that affect them.

AB A floristic data set spanning 15 years was compiled from vegetation surveys of Sphagnum peatlands across Tasmania. The data were ordinated by hybrid multi-dimensional scaling and a three-dimensional solution was most satisfactory. The strongest floristic gradient corresponded to changes in altitude and moisture. Original data were included from Sphagnum peatlands outside their commonly recorded altitudinal, geologic and geographic ranges. Several new types of Sphagnum peatland are described. While many of Tasmania's subalpine and alpine Sphagnum peatlands are protected within reserves, this is not the case for montane and lowland Sphagnum peatlands. During the past decade, the pressure on Sphagnum peatlands outside the Tasmanian reserve system has continued to increase. Threats such as Sphagnum-moss harvesting, peat mining, burning, grazing and forestry operations have an impact on both the number and condition of Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Fine root production and its relationships to aboveground plant components and environmental drivers such as water table have been poorly quantified in peatland ecosystems, despite being the primary input of labile carbon to peat soils. We studied the relationship between fine root (< 1 mm) production, aboveground biomass and growing season water table within an ombrotrophic peatland in eastern Ontario. We installed 80 in-growth bags (10 cm diameter) to measure fine root production over the full range of 40 cm in water table depth. The point-intersect method was used to estimate peak aboveground biomass components (total, leaf and stem) for the 0.36 m(2) area surrounding each in-growth bag. Mean fine root production was 108 +/- 71 g m(-2) y(-1) and was strongly related to both aboveground biomass and water table. Linear regression analysis showed strong allometric relationships between fine root production and aboveground biomass for shrubs (r (2) = 0.61, p < 0.001), suggesting that fine root production estimates can be approximated using aboveground biomass data. Water table had a significant effect on the allocation of biomass to fine roots, leaves and stems with a deeper water table significantly increasing both fine root production at depth and at each depth increment. Shrub biomass allocation to leaves and stems similarly shifted, with greater investment in stems relative to leaves with a deeper water table. As a result, greater fine root biomass was produced per unit leaf biomass in areas with a deeper water table, illustrating an important tradeoff between leaf and fine root tissues in drier conditions. Our results indicate that any drop in water table will likely increase aboveground biomass stocks and the influx of labile carbon to peat soils via fine roots and leaves.

SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
ID LOST RIVER PEATLAND; REGIONAL ESTIMATION; NORTHERN; RECHARGE; FLOW
AB Many ecosystems have evolved under conditions where ground water is critical to the survival of the unique species contained therein. One example is Nebraska's Sand Hills fens. The Sand Hills region comprises lush interdunal valleys amid grass-stabilized dunes. One valley type, fens, are ground water-fed wetlands that have several meters of saturated, organic soils comprising peat formed under anaerobic conditions where plant growth exceeds decomposition. These fens support unique flora and fauna such as rush aster and northern redbelly dace that are typically found in more boreal regions of North America. This study characterized the hydrogeology of a representative fen in the Jumbo Valley to explore how these relict species survive in a hot, arid climate and to understand present and historical relations between ground water and these unique ecosystems. Results indicate that ground water's present role in sustaining the fens is twofold: (1) wetland plant transpiration of shallow ground water across the valley creates a cooler, humid microclimate that sustains the fens in the region's hot, arid climate and (2) the large volume of ground water pumped through the fens by plant transpiration transports necessary nutrients to the root zone. Results suggest that, in the past, in addition to its sustaining role, ground water also played a vital role in fen development and in fen preservation through nearly 15,000 years of existence. Thus, as with like ecosystems, the role of ground water must be considered in future Sand Hills fen protection, restoration, and management.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to describe the mires of the river Ob valley in the south of Western Siberia focussed on their symmorphology and a phytosociological classification in order to compare them with corresponding plant communities in Europe. The area investigated covers about 250 km(2). Releves were made in transects from the Ob terraces to the river on sample plots covering between 4 and 25 m(2) in small sedge laws and up to 100 m(2) on forested sites. Furthermore, the spatial structure was investigated and the site ecology was characterized by indication values using the RAMENSKI approach.
   The most productive sedge communities were indicated by the Caricetum lasiocarpae. A Triglochin maritimum variant is largely comparable with the communities in Central Europe, whereas the Calamagrostis neglecta variant shows the highest floristic affinity with that occurring in northeastern Poland. A typical feature for the Ob alluvial mires is the Betula humilis shrubland. It is differentiated as a weakly characterized community and syntaxonomically it is included within the Caricion lasiocarpae. Less productive sedge-Amblystegiaceae-communities were classified as Caricetum diandrae, which in the valley mires preferentially is developed in a Carex limosa-facies. Comparable syntaxa from northeastern Poland have been classified as Caricetum limosodiandrae. The Cariceta lasiocarpae and diandrae in Western Siberia are differentiated from the European ones by species such as Rumex aquaticus, Cicuta virosa, Brachythecium mildeanum, Drepanocladus aduncus, Agrostis gigantea and Trisetum sibiricum.
   Tallsedge-willow communities were classified as Carici juncellae-Salicetum rosmarinifoliae spiraeetosum salicifoliae and, together with the Salix rosmarinifolia-Menyanthes trifoliata-community, included in the alliance Salicion cinereae. The regionally quite common birch-pine-carr communities were described as Carici appropinquatae-Pinetum sylvestris ass. nov., floristically characterized by the hummock forming sedges Carex appropinquata and C. cespitosa and regionally differentiated by Calliergonella cuspidata.
   Alder swamps that occur in Central European mire borders, in southern West Siberia were replaced by so called "Sogna"-communities in Western Siberia. They are characterized by a tall tree layer of Pinus sibirica and Picea obovata. The most productive sites, characterised by Duscheckia fruticosa, were classified as Duscheckic-Pinetum sibiricae ass. nov.

ID HOLOCENE PEAT; CLIMATE; RESPONSES
AB Peatlands are permanently flooded wetland ecosystems that accumulate organic matter, which is what makes them carbon sinks and resevoirs. Peatlands that are located in paramos help to maintain water balance in surrounding ecosystems and regulate the distribution of the water used by human communities. Currently, peatlands are affected by climate change, which disrupts the balance between plant production and decomposition. Peatlands dominated by Distichia muscoides are particularly important since they depend on glacial hydrology. This paper presents a climatic reconstruction over the last 200 years, based on the vegetation succession history recorded in core samples from two peatlands located in the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy. The reconstructed vegetation was compared with historical records of temperature and precipitation. Our results showed differences in the trajectories followed by the vegetation, with an increase in plant production and dominance of D. muscoides over the last two decades related to increases in temperature. The positive water balance generated by the global increase in temperature and glacial melting results in an abundance of vascular plants in the turbera. The effect of the El Nino event of 1998 is reflected in a major change in the trajectories of the vegetation at the two sites, with Sphagnum peat being replaced by peat formed from different mosses, limiting the ability of the peatland to store organic matter. The effects of climate change are multiplied by phenomena such as El Nino that can rapidly alter the evolution of an ecosystem, even one as highly resilient as peatlands.

AB During the past similar to 50 years, the number and area of lakes have declined in several regions in boreal forests. However, there has been substantial finer-scale heterogeneity; some lakes decreased in area, some showed no trend, and others increased. The objective of this study was to identify the primary mechanisms underlying heterogeneous trends in closed-basin lake area. Eight lake characteristics (delta O-18, electrical conductivity, surface : volume index, bank slope, floating mat width, peat depth, thaw depth at shoreline, and thaw depth at the forest boundary) were compared for 15 lake pairs in Alaskan boreal forest where one lake had decreased in area since similar to 1950, and the other had not. Mean differences in characteristics between paired lakes were used to identify the most likely of nine mechanistic scenarios that combined three potential mechanisms for decreasing lake area (talik drainage, surface water evaporation, and terrestrialization) with three potential mechanisms for nondecreasing lake area (subpermafrost groundwater recharge through an open talik, stable permafrost, and thermokarst). A priori expectations of the direction of mean differences between decreasing and nondecreasing paired lakes were generated for each scenario. Decreasing lakes had significantly greater electrical conductivity, greater surface : volume indices, shallower bank slopes, wider floating mats, greater peat depths, and shallower thaw depths at the forest boundary. These results indicated that the most likely scenario was terrestrialization as the mechanism for lake area reduction combined with thermokarst as the mechanism for nondecreasing lake area. Terrestrialization and thermokarst may have been enhanced by recent warming which has both accelerated permafrost thawing and lengthened the growing season, thereby increasing plant growth, floatingmat encroachment, transpiration rates, and the accumulation of organic matter in lake basins. The transition to peatlands associated with terrestrialization may provide a transient increase in carbon storage enhancing the role of northern ecosystems as major stores of global carbon.

AB The aim of this study is to detect how vegetation development proceeds after Sphagnum-peat mining and how physical and chemical factors in groundwater are related to the revegetation patterns in Sarobetsu mire, Hokkaido, Japan. A total of 189 plots on peat-mining sites were set in a chronosequence and 18 plots were set on unmined control sites. A vegetation survey was conducted, and seasonal changes in groundwater levels and chemistry (pH, electrical conductance, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, anions, and cations) were monitored. Species richness and plot cover tended to increase with increasing age, but were significantly lower in mined sites than in unmined sites dominated by Sphagnum spp. The trends in vegetation change were (1) bare ground, (2) grasslands dominated by grasses and sedges, e.g., Rhyncohospora alba, Phragmites communis, and Moliniopsis japonica and (3) Sphagnum-dominated vegetation. The characteristics of groundwater level during the plant-growth period mostly determined vegetation recovery, i.e., Sphagnum establishment was promoted when groundwater declined greatly in early summer. The patterns of temporal vegetation changes affected by groundwater characteristics were detected by chronological sequence, and hydrological factors in groundwater were more important for revegetation than chemical factors. The original vegetation has not returned after three decades.

AB Peatlands play an important role in modulating the climate, mainly through sequestration of carbon dioxide into peat carbon, which depends on the availability of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to mosses. Atmospheric Nr deposition in the UK has been above the critical load for functional and structural changes to peatlandmosses, thus threatening to accelerate their succession by vascular plants and increasing the possibility of Nr export to downstream ecosystems. The N balance of peatlands has received comparatively little attention, mainly due to the difficulty in measuring gaseous N losses as well as the Nr inputs due to biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). In this study we have estimated the mean annual N balance of an ombrotrophic bog (Migneint, North Wales) by measuring in situ N-2+ N2O gaseous fluxes and also BNF in peat and mosses. Fluvial N exportwas monitored through a continuous record of DON flux, while atmospheric N deposition was modelled on a 5 x 5 km grid. The mean annual N mass balancewas slightly positive (0.7 +/- 4.1 kgN ha(-1) y(-1)) and varied interannually indicating the fragile status of this bog ecosystem that has reached N saturation and is prone to becoming a net N source. Gaseous N losses were a major N output term accounting for 70% of the N inputs, mainly in the form of the inert N-2 gas, thus providing partial mitigation to the adverse effects of chronic Nr enrichment. BNF was suppressed by 69%, compared to rates in pristine bogs, but was still active, contributing similar to 2% of the N inputs. The long-term peat N storage rate (8.4 +/- 0.8 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) cannot be met by the measured N mass balance, showing that the bog catchment is losing more N than it can store due its saturated status.

AB The impact of short-term climate anomalies and disturbances on past plant communities can be understood using high temporal or contiguous sedimentary pollen analysis. The response of pollen assemblages to decadal- to multidecadal-scale moisture variability was analyzed for the time intervals 3000-2200 and 1400-500 cal. yr BP. The hydroclimate and vegetation history for Minden Bog in southeastern Michigan were reconstructed using analyses of sedimentary testate amoebae and pollen. Results indicated that moisture anomalies accounted for 3% to 24% of the variation in arboreal pollen abundance for Fagus, Pinus, Quercus, and Tsuga. Betula pollen percentages did not appear to be affected by moisture variability. Given the longevity of these taxa, rapid arboreal pollen assemblage responses to moisture variability at decadal to multidecadal timescales were likely due to climate-induced changes in pollen productivity. Our data suggest that pollen-climate relationships may be counterintuitive at these fine temporal scales. For example, Tsuga pollen percentages generally increased during short-term dry events, in contrast to expected decreases in abundance with drying at millennial timescales based on empirical pollen-climate relationships. Results suggest caution should be used when inferring subdecadal to multidecadal climate variation from highly resolved pollen records. Rather, high-resolution pollen data may more accurately represent superimposed plant responses that are the composite of reproductive output nested within long-term plant community compositional changes in response to climatic variation.

AB OPENLAND3 belongs to a suite of computer programs included in the POLLSCAPE simulation model. These programs make it possible to calculate estimates of pollen loadings in lake basins or bogs using vegetation data. OPENLAND3, written in Visual Basic 6, is designed to produce appropriate vegetation data files from vegetation maps stored in a Geographical Information System. It calculates percentage cover of plant taxa in concentric circles at increasing distances from a central point, using either real digitised maps or hypothetical maps (simulated landscape designs). Such data are necessary for simulation of pollen dispersal and deposition, and for calculation of pollen productivity estimates and relevant source area of pollen using specific mathematical models developed by palynologists, such as the Prentice-Sugita model. OPENLAND3 also produces output files needed to run RS-OPEN, another program included in POLLSCAPE, in order to obtain estimates of pollen loadings in lakes or bogs. The rationale of OPENLAND3, the algorithm used, and a modification of RS-OPEN (RS-OPEN2) are described. A test of the programme capability using a detailed vegetation map from southern Sweden shows that simulations using OPENLAND3 produce coherent results. Pollen loading for species characterized by high pollen productivity is higher than for species with low pollen productivity. Altering the wind speed has also a significant effect on pollen loading. As wind speed increases, the proportions of the light pollen decrease, while the heavy pollen types increase, which is what empirical data suggest, and what the model predicts in earlier studies.

AB The addition of phenolic compounds to peatland soils has been proposed as a means of enhancing the suppression of enzymes, reducing the rate of organic matter decomposition and increasing below-ground carbon sequestration. This study evaluated the potential of phenolic enrichment as a peatland restoration strategy by adding wood chips from common tree species to peat substrate and determining the impacts on key components of organic matter decomposition and Sphagnum growth. All treatments tended to increase the concentration of phenolics and suppress the activities of beta-glucosidase (measured as an indicator enzyme that plays a key role in cellulose decomposition), significantly so with the Spruce (Picea mariana) and Cedar (Thuja occidentalis) wood chips mixed into the peat. All substrate additions to the peat tended to reduce fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and significantly more so with surface additions of Spruce and Larch (Larix laricina) wood chips. The addition of woodchips per se had no detrimental effect on Sphagnum growth for any of the treatments. These results indicate that through the addition of phenolic compounds to peatlands, it may be possible to inhibit extracellular enzyme activities in order to reduce the flux of CO2 from soils to the atmosphere. Thus, organic soil conditioning could reduce the carbon footprint for commercial activities such as Sphagnum culture.

AB Holarctic mires are systems of great ecological value and limited alpine distribution. Their southernmost European boundary borders the Mediterranean region. Understanding how environmental factors influence the plant community distribution and its response to disturbances, especially in the water regime, is a key step for their management and conservation. Here, we report our study of the main ecological gradients that determine the distribution of different plant community types in the Trescuro mire system and their response to variations in the environmental conditions such as summer drought. We set up 30 sampling points across the vegetation mosaic where pH, electrical conductivity, water table depth, and ion concentration were recorded during the 2014 and 2015 summers. The results revealed that variation in the water table level is what most drives the vegetation distribution at the local scale, followed by the ion concentration. Soligenous communities, which are highly dependent on water run-off, were the most affected by the drought event in 2015. Because these communities are generally situated in the marginal parts of mire systems, summer drought periods may facilitate invasion by trees into the areas they occupy, which may eventually lead to a reduction of mire area. This study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of these unique and complex systems through elucidating the relationship between the vegetation and climatic variations.

AB Despite the importance of understanding controls on microbial carbon (C) mineralization in peat soils, the role of vascular plant root exudates is still unclear. To determine whether root exudates could stimulate enhanced decomposition of peat, we utilized an in-vitro method involving the addition of a solution similar to root exudates (6 glucose-C: 2 citrate-C: 2 amino acid-C, at 3 addition levels) to peat, incubating the mixture and measuring CO2 produced over 20 d and microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at the end of the incubation. We defined priming as inorganic C (IC) production (CO2 + calculated dissolved inorganic C) during the incubation being greater than that attributed to the control peat plus the added C. An addition level of 0.083 mg C g(-1) dry peat, estimated to represent root exudation over one 12-h sunny day in a bog, caused an enhancement in IC production that exceeded that produced in the controls and the amount of added C after 8 d, with rates levelling to control values after 15 d. At the end of the incubation nearly 3 times the amount added C had been mineralized, relative to the control, however this represented only 4% of total microbial respiration in the controls. Although the priming effect pattern appeared to be real throughout repeated measurements in our experiments, the statistical probabilities were not always large due to high variability in background CO2 production levels. Given the observed long lag-times and overall small magnitude and large variability in observed effects, we conclude that although priming of decomposition appears to occur in peatlands, it likely has only a minor overall impact on net C loss to the atmosphere.

   PEATLANDS; CO2 EXCHANGE; CH4 FLUXES; N2O; TILLAGE; GRASS; FORESTRY
AB Management of peat soils is regionally important as they cover large land areas and have important but conflicting ecosystems services. A recent management trend for drained peatlands is the control of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changes in agricultural practices, peatland restoration or paludiculture. Due to complex antagonistic controls of moisture, water table management can be difficult to use as a method for controlling GHG emissions. Past studies show that there is no obvious relationship between GHG emission rates and crop type, tillage intensity or fertilization rates. For drained peat soils, the best use options can vary from rewetting with reduced emission to efficient short term use to maximize the, profit per amount of greenhouse gas emitted. The GHG accounting should consider the entire life cycle of the peatland and the socio-economic benefits peatlands provide locally. Cultivating energy crops is a viable option especially for wet peat soils with poor drainage, but harvesting remains a challenge due to tractability of wet soils. Paludiculture in lowland floodplains can be a tool to mitigate regional flooding allowing water to be stored on these lands without much harm to crops. This can also increase regional biodiversity providing important habitats for birds and moisture tolerant plant species. However, on many peatlands rewetting is not possible due to their position in the landscape and the associated difficulty to maintain a high stable water table. While the goal of rewetting often is to encourage the return of peat forming plants and the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration, it is not well known if these plants will grow on peat soils that have been altered by the process of drainage and management. Therefore, it is important to consider peat quality and hydrology when choosing management options. Mapping of sites is recommended as a management tool to guide actions. The environmental status and socio-economic importance of the sites should be assessed both for continued cultivation but also for other ecosystem services such as restoration and hydrological functions (flood control). Farmers need advice, tools and training to find the best after-use option. Biofuels might provide a cost-efficient after use option for some sites. Peat extraction followed by rewetting might provide a sustainable option as rewetting is often easier if the peat is removed, starting the peat accumulation from scratch. Also this provides a way to finance the after-use. As impacts of land use are uncertain, new policies should consider multiple benefits and decisions should be based on scientific evidence and field scale observations. The need to further understand the key processes and long term effects of field scale land use manipulations is evident. The recommended actions for peatlands should be based on local condition and socio-economic needs to outline intermediate and long term plans. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Scientific results about the role of peatlands as sink or source of bromine are rather antithetic. Although several attempts have been performed to correlate Br content and peat decomposition/humification, the role of humic acids (HAS) as possible sink of this element has not been previously investigated. Two peat cores (2H and 2T), collected from the ombrotrophic bog Etang de la Gruere (Switzerland), were divided in several slices from which humic acids were successively extracted. Bromine content was determined in both peat and corresponding HAS samples using an Energy-dispersive miniprobe X-ray fluorescence multielement analysis (EMMA-XRF), Data show a greater "affinity" of Br for HAS rather than for corresponding bulk peat samples, especially in the first 24 cm of depth where Br concentration in HAS is 3.5 times higher than the one in peat; in particular, approximately 40% (average value) of the total Br in peat is stably incorporated into HAS molecules. Further, the observed correlation between the Br content in HAS and the Pb enrichment factor in peat, especially in the upper part of both profiles, suggests a possible role of HAS as geochemical sink of Br atmospheric deposition. Consequently, humification processes occurring in peat could promote Br accumulation in HAS, thus reflecting the deposition rate of this trace element. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) is an essential microbial process supplying available nitrogen (N) to Sphagnum mosses in ombrotrophic peatlands. Acetylene Reduction Assay (ARA) and the N-15(2) assimilation are the main methods used for the measurement of BNF. ARA is used as a proxy where the moles of ethylene (C2H4) produced from acetylene (C2H2) during incubation of mosses and peat are used to estimate the moles of N being fixed using a conversion factor (CF), thus relating the moles of C2H4 produced to the moles of N fixed. A theoretical CF of 3:1 originally developed for agricultural soils using pure nitrogenase enzymes is in use; in some cases a site specific CF is determined through parallel incubation of mosses and peat with ARA and N-15(2) assimilation methods to enable the application of ARA for subsequent BNF measurement at high resolution and low cost. However, in recent literature, the reported site and/or species specific CF for peatlands varies by an order of magnitude, thus raising the question if measured CFs are robust and consistent enough for the estimation of BNF in peatlands. Thus, we measured BNF using the ARA and the direct N-15(2) assimilation methods in three different peatlands across the UK during the growing season over two years. The incubations were carried out in parallel on the dominant Sphagnum spp. (S. cuspidatum, S. fallax, S. capillifolium, and S. papillosum) and top bulk peat (0-15 cm). Additional incubations were performed using the direct N-15(2) assimilation method with and without C2H2 addition to evaluate if C2H2 was supressing N assimilation through BNF all together in peatlands. According to the results, the CF varied from 0.001 to 5.363, with a median CF of 0.028 for both mosses and peat, which is far lower than the theoretical 3:1 CF. The CF was also highly variable with differences up to 3 orders of magnitude across the different Sphagnum species. The measured CF between years for the same species and across the three peatland sites varied significantly suggesting an inconsistent performance of ARA against the N-15 assimilation method. The generally low but highly varied CFs measured under this study shows that C2H2 differentially interferes with the activity of diazotrophic microbes, which results in an inconsistent CF at species, and site scales, and over time. In conclusion, ARA is not suitable as a proxy method for estimating and/or modelling BNF in peatlands.

AB To study the relationships between groups of organisms and the degree to which these relationships are consistent across major climatic gradients, we analysed the testate amoeba (Protozoa) communities, vegetation and water chemistry of one peatland in five countries: Switzerland, The Netherlands, Great Britain, Sweden and Finland, as part of the BERI (Bog Ecosystem Research Initiative) project. The relationships between the different data sets and subsets were investigated by means of detrended correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and Mantel permutation tests. The comparison of data on vegetation and testate amoebae showed that inter-site differences are more pronounced for the vegetation than for the testate amoebae species assemblage. Testate amoebae are a useful tool in multi-site studies and in environmental monitoring of peatlands because: (1) the number of species in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands is much higher than for mosses or vascular plants; (2) most peatland species are cosmopolitan in their distributions and therefore less affected than plants by biogeographical distribution patterns, thus differences in testate amoeba assemblages can be interpreted primarily in terms of ecology; (3) they are closely related to the ecological characteristics of the exact spot where they live, therefore they can be used to analyse small-scale gradients that play a major role in the functioning of peatland ecosystems. This study revealed the existence of small-scale vertical gradients within the vegetation and life-form niche separation in response to water chemistry. The deep-rooted plants such as Carex spp. and Eriophorum spp. are related to the chemistry of water sampled at or near the ground water table, whereas the mosses are not. Testate amoebae wereshown to be ecologically more closely related to the chemistry of water sampled at or near the water table level and to the mosses than to the deep-rooted plants.

AB Ground- and surface-water-fed peatlands (i.e., fens) of temperate Europe face high anthropogenic nutrient loads from atmospheric deposition, agricultural catchment areas, and from peat decomposition, if drained. As a result, nitrogen loads may exceed a fen's natural nutrient removal capacity, leading to increased eutrophication of adjacent water bodies. Therefore, it is important to address possible means to decrease a fen's nutrient load, including nutrient uptake by fen plants. To assess how much fen plants can contribute to nutrient removal by uptake, nutrient stocks of above- and below-ground biomass need to be quantified. Therefore, we investigated nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium uptake capacities of sedges (Carex species), which are common dominants in fen plant communities. We grew specimens of five Carex species with varying preferences in nutrient availability under controlled, different nutrient levels. We show that Carex above-ground biomass harvest can remove up to one third of a system's total nitrogen even at high loads of about 40 g nitrogen m & minus;2. Species-specific differences in biomass production, rather than preferences in nutrient availability under natural conditions, were drivers of standing nutrient stocks: Highly productive species, i.e., C. acutiformis and C. rostrata, had highest nutrient standing stocks across all nutrient levels. Amounts of nutrients stored in shoots increased almost linearly with increasing nutrient levels, whereas below-ground nutrient stocks species-specifically increased, saturated, or decreased, with increasing nutrient levels. As a rough estimate, depending on the species, 6 & ndash;16 cycles of an-nual above-ground harvest would suffice to decrease nitrogen concentrations from the highest to the lowest level used in this study. Overall, our results indicate that Carex biomass harvest can be an efficient means to coun-teract anthropogenic nitrogen eutrophication in fens.

AB The need to regenerate peatland forests is expected to increase in the near future in Finland due to harvest of large amounts of peatlands drained during the 1950s and 1960s. In anticipation of this, a new type of excavator-mounted rototiller for soil scarification in peatlands has been developed in Finland to improve the moisture conditions of the seedbed by mixing the ground vegetation, raw humus layer, and peat. The regeneration result of the new rototiller was compared with traditional patch scarification (i.e. scalping) in direct seeding of Scots pine in three forestry-drained peatland sites in eastern Finland. After two growing seasons, rototilling offered no advantage over scalping in terms of the number of established seedlings, probability of empty patches, or seedling height. Seedling establishment was on average higher on scalping (10%) than on rototilling (8%). The main problem in rototilling may have been the loose and porous structure of the seedbed resulting in drought and frost damages.

DE photosynthesis; carbon sequestering; bogs; boreal regions
AB Chlorophyll index (CI) on the test plots of a peat moss (Sphagnum magellanicum and S. fallax) high bog near Moscow was estimated to be 5.7 kg chlorophyll/ha in the beginning of July Based on CI data, the value of the specific photosynthetic sequestering of atmospheric carbon into the living and dead biomass of sphagnous cenosis was calculated to be 0.85 ton C/ha over one growing season. The mosses differ from higher plants not only in the proportion of photosynthesizing cells in the leaf and the number of chloroplasts in each photosynthesizing cell but in assimilation number and rate of potential photosynthesis, as well. However, no significant differences between peat mosses and higher plants were found in the highest values of electron transport rate in isolated thylakoids and energy efficiency of photosynthesis calculated from the induction curve of delayed chlorophyll fluorescence. In some representatives of higher plants and phylogenetically remote Sphagnum species, integrated photosynthetic carbon sequestering into the phytocenosis biomass per chlorophyll unit over the growing season was not species-specific.

AB In the Middle Eocene lignite bearing succession at Helmstedt, isopollen maps have been constructed from a thin, highly carbonaceous horizon in the interbed between two seams of the Wulfersdorf member. During mining progress this carbonaceous band could be traced in the mine high wall over an area of 2 km by 0.5 km and is considered to represent an isochronous horizon. 28 samples were collected and analyzed.
   On the basis of the isopollen maps it is possible, to distinguish between allochthonous and autochthonous elements. Ultimately, by comparison of the maps individual plant associations and environmental conditions may be recognized. In case of the carbonaceous horizon of the Wulfersdorf seam group a coastal swamp succession can be traced from a mangrove fringe through a brackish marsh and a freshwater marsh to a mire forest. The distribution of mangrove elements like Rhizophora, A vicennia and Nypa in this horizon clearly shows that the shoreline was to the northwest and advanced from there inland to the southeast. A fourth element, Psilodiporites iszkaszentgyoergyi, is restricted in distribution and closely associated with the other known mangrove types and therefore considered here to be a part of the mangrove fringe. Behind the mangrove zone, pollen of Restionaceae and Sparganiaceae as well as fern spores are more abundant than elsewhere in the Wulfersdorf seam section suggesting that a reed-like vegetation with fern and aquatic herbs developed here under rather wet conditions. A hammocky distribution of corresponding plants is indicated by the isopollen map of palms like Arecipites spp. and other elements. The main peat forming vegetation, however, was a mire forest dominated by Fagaceae alternating with a Betulaceae dominated forest including Myricaceae and Juglandaceae.

DT Article
ID WATER; METALS
AB Savage Fen is a wetlands complex at the base of north-facing bluffs in the Minnesota River Valley. The complex includes 27.8 hectares of calcareous fen that host rare calciphile plants whose populations are declining in Minnesota. Water and sediment compositions in the calcareous fen were studied to gain a better understanding of the hydrologic system that sustains the rare vegetation. Groundwater in the fen is a calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type with circumneutral pH values. The groundwater composition is the result of interactions among water, dissolved and gaseous carbon species, carbonates, and ion exchangers. Shallow groundwater is distinguished from deep groundwater by smaller concentrations of chloride, sulfate, magnesium, and sodium, and larger concentrations of calcium, bicarbonate, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonium. Magnesian calcite is the prevalent carbonate in unconsolidated sedimentary fill beneath the fen and is an important source and sink for dissolved calcium, magnesium, and inorganic carbon. Calcite concentrations just below the water table are small because aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of organic matter increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P(CO2)), decrease pH, and cause calcite to dissolve. Thick calcite accumulations just above the water table, in the root zone of calciphile plants, result from water table fluctuations and attendant changes in P(CO2). Groundwater beneath Savage Fen recharges in lakes and ponds south of the fen and upwells to the surface within the fen. Water at the water table is a mixture of upwelling groundwater and water near the surface that flows downslope from higher elevations in the fen. Changes in oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of shallow groundwater indicate that the proportion of upwelling groundwater in shallow groundwater decreases downgradient in the calcareous fen. Encroachment of reed grasses into the calcareous fen may reflect human-caused disturbances in the recharge area.

AB Climate change models predict changes in precipitation patterns over the next several decades for northern temperate regions. Resulting fluctuations of the water level may drastically affect the source-sink functions of peatlands. Here, we manipulated the water table level in an acidic, minerotrophic fen using drying and rewetting experiments to simulate summer drought and heavy rainfalls to estimate changes in peat decomposition and source-sink functions. We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) formation rates and exoenzymatic activities increased in the most active surface layer during the initial water table drawdown; however, extreme drying did not further increase these activities. Activity stimulated in deeper oxygenated peat layers did not substantially contribute to CO2 emissions. Additionally, no phenol oxidase activity was determined. Rewetting of peat after drying did not lead to a CO2 flush like in mineral soils. Water table manipulations yielded a higher availability of nitrate, ferric iron, and sulfate and prolonged the onset of methane formation. Sulfate was exported to a nearby stream. We concluded that the increasing frequency of extreme weather conditions like summer droughts and heavy rainfalls might not affect carbon storage but instead strengthen the sink function for nitrate and ferrous iron and the source function for sulfate in peatlands.

AB Peatland streams typically contain high methane concentrations and act as conduits for the release of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon analysis provides a unique tracer that can be used to identify the methane source, and quantify the time elapsed between carbon fixation and return to the atmosphere as CH4. Few studies - those that have focus largely on sites with bubble (ebullition) emissions - have investigated the C-14 age of methane in surface waters because of the difficulty in collecting sufficient CH4 for analysis. Here, we describe new sampling methods for the collection of CH4 samples from CH4-oversaturated peatland streams for radiocarbon analysis. We report the results of a suite of tests, including using methane C-14 standards and replicated field measurements, to verify the methods. The methods are not restricted to ebullition sites, and can be applied to peatland streams with lower methane concentrations. We report the C-14 age of methane extracted from surface water samples (4-13l) at two contrasting locations in a temperate raised peat bog. Results indicate substantial spatial variation with ages ranging from 400 (ditch in afforested peatland) to 3000years BP (bog perimeter stream). These contrasting ages suggest that methane in stream water can be derived from a wide range of peat depths. This new method provides a rapid (10-15min per sample) and convenient approach, which should make (CH4)-C-14 dating of surface water more accessible and lead to an increased understanding of carbon cycling within the soil-water-atmosphere system.

AB We consider the problem of pyrogenic degradation of peat soils. Studies conducted in Tomsk Oblast on the eutrophic Tagan mire. The mire is located in the ancient hollow runoff between the Ob and Tom rivers, on the second terrace above the floodplain of the Tom River. Studies were carried out on the dried and depleted area of the mire. The initial depth of the peat deposit reached 9.3 m, residual 1-1.4 m. The plot was exposed to fire five years ago. For the study three cuts of different capacity were laid. Soil that we have studied is attributed to pyrogenic modified peat soils. Fire destroyed only its surface horizons. Soils like this retain their fertility after the fire. They can be used in agriculture after simple agronomic or agromeliorative measures. The study of physical, chemical and morphological properties of the pyrogenic peat soils was conducted. In selected samples ash content, moisture content, acidity, content of N-NH4, N-NO3, K2O, P2O5, F2O3 were determined. It was revealed that the pyrogenic horizons have changed in the full range of properties (morphological structure, physical and chemical properties). After the pyrogenic impact changes of physical and chemical properties were observed. Ash content, content of N-NH4, N-NO3, K2O, P2O5, F2O3 increased. The most significant changes occur in the upper soil horizons. Ash content of the pyrogenic soil increased from 7.25 to 83.25 %. The acidity of the soil after the fires increased from 6.0 to 7.93 pH units. Soil moisture decreased and mechanical shrinkage has occurred. As a result, the reservoir temperature increased, the aeration profile decreased. Reducing conditions changed to oxidizing conditions. The biological activity of the soil increased. The process of ammonification and nitrification in the peat deposit increased. Therefore, the content of ammonium and nitrate nitrogen in the soil sections increased. The high values of iron oxide content in the upper soil layers (up to 292 mg /100 g dry soil) were caused by its concentrating in the fire. Phosphorus oxide in the upper horizons also has higher values up to 779.33 mg /100 g of dry soil. The high content of phosphorus and iron in the peat deposit of cuts is explained by the vivianite nature of the rocks. K2O content in these soils changed from 1.16 to 46.39 mg /100 g dry soil. The increase of fertile elements is an argument in favor of the agricultural use of the Tagan mire soil. But the mire is located in the suburban area of the city of Tomsk. The mire is a regulator of the water regime of watercourses; it contributes to the maintenance of a stable level of groundwater. To improve the environmental situation of the surrounding area it is suggested to recultivate the pyrogenic portion of Tagan mire and then use the plot of the mire for afforestation.

TI Modelling the habitat preference of two key Sphagnum species in a poor

AB Current peatland models generally treat vegetation as static, although plant community structure is known to alter as a response to environmental change. Because the vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning are tightly linked, realistic projections of peatland response to climate change require the inclusion of vegetation dynamics in ecosystem models. In peatlands, Sphagnum mosses are key engineers. Moss community composition primarily follows habitat moisture conditions. The known species habitat preference along the prevailing moisture gradient might not directly serve as a reliable predictor for future species compositions, as water table fluctuation is likely to increase. Hence, modelling the mechanisms that control the habitat preference of Sphagna is a good first step for modelling community dynamics in peatlands. In this study, we developed the Peatland Moss Simulator (PMS), which simulates the community dynamics of the peatland moss layer. PMS is a process-based model that employs a stochastic, individual-based approach for simulating competition within the peatland moss layer based on species differences in functional traits. At the shoot-level, growth and competition were driven by net photosynthesis, which was regulated by hydrological processes via the capitulum water content. The model was tested by predicting the habitat preferences of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum fallax - two key species representing dry (hummock) and wet (lawn) habitats in a poor fen peatland (Lakkasuo, Finland). PMS successfully captured the habitat preferences of the two Sphagnum species based on observed variations in trait properties. Our model simulation further showed that the validity of PMS depended on the interspecific differences in the capitulum water content being correctly specified. Neglecting the water content differences led to the failure of PMS to predict the habitat preferences of the species in stochastic simulations. Our work highlights the importance of the capitulum water content with respect to the dynamics and carbon functioning of Sphagnum communities in peatland ecosystems. Thus, studies of peatland responses to changing environmental conditions need to include capitulum water processes as a control on moss community dynamics. Our PMS model could be used as an elemental design for the future development of dynamic vegetation models for peatland ecosystems.

AB This study compares the CH4 fluxes from two arctic wetland sites of different annual temperatures during 2004 to 2006. The PEATLAND-VU model was used to simulate the emissions. The CH4 module of PEATLAND-VU is based on the Walter-Heimann model. The first site is located in northeast Siberia, Indigirka lowlands, Kytalyk reserve (70 degrees N, 147 degrees E) in a continuous permafrost region with mean annual temperatures of -14.3 degrees C. The other site is Stordalen mire in the eastern part of Lake Tornetrask (68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) ten kilometres east of Abisko, northern Sweden. It is located in a discontinuous permafrost region. Stordalen has a sub arctic climate with a mean annual temperature of -0.7 degrees C. Model input consisted of observed temperature, precipitation and snow cover data.
   In all cases, modelled CH4 emissions show a direct correlation between variations in water table and soil temperature variations. The differences in CH4 emissions between the two sites are caused by different climate, hydrology, soil physical properties, vegetation type and NPP.
   For Kytalyk the simulated CH4 fluxes show similar trends during the growing season, having average values for 2004 to 2006 between 1.29-2.09 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1). At Stordalen the simulated fluxes show a slightly lower average value for the same years (3.52 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1)) than the observed 4.7 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1). The effect of the longer growing season at Stordalen is simulated correctly.
   Our study shows that modelling of arctic CH4 fluxes is improved by adding a relatively simple hydrological model that simulates the water table position from generic weather data. Our results support the generalization in literature that CH4 fluxes in northern wetland are regulated more tightly by water table than temperature. Furthermore, parameter uncertainty at site level in wetland CH4 process models is an important factor in large scale modelling of CH4 fluxes.

AB The paper presents the degree of subsidence in stratigraphic transects and a change in soil morphology. The degree of subsidence was determined based on direct geodetic measurements taken in 1974 and 2012 and additionally with the use of empirical relationships of subsidence with the depth of drainage and peat properties. The histic horizon is built of peat thickness of 3 m on the Sosnowica and 0.64 m on the Uhnin. The value of subsidence of Histosol, measured by geodetic means, ranged from 9 to 33 cm, while that of Gleysol from 0 to 4 cm. The mean value of subsidence of the peatland in Sosnowica amounted to 24 cm over 38 years, which gives a degree of subsidence of 0.6 cm year(-1), i.e. a loss of peat mass amounting to 11.5% of the total resources. The situation is still worse in the case of the peatland in Uhnin, where mineralization and a fire of the peatland caused the peatland area to shrink by 36%. The loss of peat mass, including loss due to fire, accounted for 53% of the total resources, which corresponds to a degree of subsidence of 0.35 cm year(-1). In engineering practice, the degree of subsidence can only be determined according to Jurczuk's formula taking into account environmental factors and the passage of time.

AB Since the late 1960s, the occurrence of Schoenus nigricans in Irish blanket bogs has been attributed to inputs of salt spray to the blanket bogs, due to their proximity to the coast and the predominant westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean. To test this hypothesis we carried out an ecohydrological field study at a large blanket bog in the western part of Connemara, Ireland. We described peat profiles in two transects and sampled pore water from peat at different depths. The water samples were analysed and their macro-ionic composition was used to locate possible inputs of calcareous groundwater to the system. We found clear evidence for inflow of calcareous groundwater at various sites and depths. Inflow of rather base-rich groundwater was indicated by high values of electrical conductivity (EC), high contents of calcium and bicarbonate, and high pH of the pore water. The peat profiles contained macro-remains of reed (Phragmites australis), in most cases only in deeper layers of peat, but at one location throughout the profile. This is another indication that the blanket bog was a groundwater-fed fen for quite some time. We conclude that the occurrence of S. nigricans in the blanket bog studied could be well explained by the hypothesis that S. nigricans is a relic from former more base-rich conditions. Relatively high base saturation could have persisted due to the prevailing groundwater flow in the upper layers preventing decalcification or other loss of cations from the whole soil profile including the topsoil.

AB 1, The growth of Sphagnum fallax was studied in a glasshouse experiment. Capitulum diaspores of S. fallax were cultivated on five different types of bare peat core, representing a gradient of increasing disturbance. Increases in length and weight were measured. Three microclimates were simulated by protecting the bare peat with a shading mesh and a plastic cover in combination with two water levels.
   2, Significant differences in the growth of S. fallax were observed in relation to microclimate changes. Protection techniques such as shading mesh and perforated plastic film allowed a better development of the diaspores compared to bare peat. A plastic cover caused the best growth and compensated for a low water table level.
   3. Feat properties are critical when diaspores grow in direct contact with decomposed peat. The porosity, and especially its vertical pattern in the peat profile, proved to be an important factor. A particular combination of microclimate conditions at the surface of the bare pest, and physical properties of the upper. peat layers, may favour the growth of S. fallax diaspores even where there is a low water table.
   4. Restoration of Sphagnum species on cut-over bogs needs to consider both the microclimate conditions at the surface of the bare peat and the peat properties themselves. These factors are important for the diaspores, particularly in periods of climatic and hydrological stress. In such situations, commensalism with some vascular plants may be a useful trigger for Sphagnum growth.

AB [1] Eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange ( NEE) were taken at an ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Canada from 1 June 1998 to 31 May 2002. Temperatures during this period were above normal except for 2000 and precipitation was near normal in 1998 and 1999, above normal in 2000, and well below normal in 2001. Growing period maximum daytime uptake (-0.45 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) was similar in all years and nighttime maximum respiration was typically near 0.20 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), however, larger values were recorded during very dry conditions in the fourth year of study. Winter CO2 flux was considerably smaller than in summer, but persistent, resulting in significant accumulated losses (119-132 g CO2 m(-2) period(-1)). This loss was equivalent to between 30 and 70% of the net CO2 uptake during the growing season. During the first 3 years of study, the bog was an annual sink for CO2 (similar to-260 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). In the fourth year, with the dry summer, however, annual NEE was only -34 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), which is not significantly different from zero. We examined the performance of a peatland carbon simulator (PCARS) model against the tower measurements of NEE and derived ecosystem respiration ( ER) and photosynthesis (PSN). PCARS ER and PSN were highly correlated with tower-derived fluxes, but the model consistently overestimated both ER and PSN, with slightly poorer comparisons in the dry year. As a result of both component fluxes being overestimated, PCARS simulated the tower NEE reasonably well. Simulated decomposition and autotrophic respiration contributed about equal proportions to ER. Shrubs accounted for the greatest proportion of PSN (85%); moss PSN declined to near zero during the summer period due to surface drying.

AB Mercury (Hg) accumulation records spanning the last 16,000 years before present (yr BP, relative to AD 1950) were derived from a peat core collected from Dajiuhu mire, central China. The natural Hg concentration and accumulation rate (free from anthropogenic influence) were 135.5 +/- 53.9 ng g(-1) and 6.5 +/- 4.5 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The increase in Hg flux that started from a core depth of 96.5 cm (3358 cal yr BP) is independent of soil erosion and organic matter content. We attribute this to an increase in atmospheric Hg deposition derived from regional anthropogenic activities. Anthropogenic Hg accumulation rates (Hg-ARA) in the pre-industrial period peaked during the Ming and the early Qing dynasties (582-100 cal yr BP), with Hg-AR(A) of 9.9-24.6 and 10.7-24.4 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. In the industrial interval (post similar to 1850 AD), Hg-AR(A) increased progressively and reached 32.7 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) at the top of the core. Our results indicate the existence of regional atmospheric Hg pollution spanning the past similar to 3400 years, and place recent Hg enrichment in central China in a broader historical context.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from boreal wetlands show considerable seasonal variation, including small winter emissions. We addressed the seasonality of CH4-producing microbes by comparing archaeal communities and the rates and temperature response of CH4 production in a boreal fen at three key phases of growing season and in winter. Archaeal community analysis by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and cloning of 16S ribosomal DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA revealed slight community shifts with season. The main archaeal groups remained the same throughout the year and were Methanosarcinaceae, Rice cluster II and Methanomicrobiales-associated Fen cluster. These methanogens and the crenarchaeal groups 1.1c and 1.3 were detected from DNA and RNA, but the family Methanosaetaceae was detected only from RNA. Differences between DNA- and RNA-based results suggested higher stability of DNA-derived communities and better representation of the active CH4 producers in RNA. Methane production potential, measured as formation of CH4 in anoxic laboratory incubations, showed prominent seasonality. The potential was strikingly highest in winter, possibly due to accumulation of methanogenic substrates, and maximal CH4 production was observed at ca. 30 degrees C. Archaeal community size, determined by quantitative PCR, remained similar from winter to summer. Low production potential in late summer after a water level draw-down suggested diminished activity due to oxygen exposure. Our results indicated that archaeal community composition and size in the boreal fen varied only slightly despite the large fluctuations of methanogenic potential. Detection of mRNA of the methanogenic mcrA gene confirmed activity of methanogens in winter, accounting for previously reported winter CH4 emissions.

AB Northern peatlands provide important global and regional ecosystem services (carbon storage, water storage, and biodiversity). However, these ecosystems face increases in the severity, areal extent and frequency of climate-mediated (e.g. wildfire and drought) and land-use change (e.g. drainage, flooding and mining) disturbances that are placing the future security of these critical ecosystem services in doubt. Here, we provide the first detailed synthesis of autogenic hydrological feedbacks that operate within northern peatlands to regulate their response to changes in seasonal water deficit and varying disturbances. We review, synthesize and critique the current process-based understanding and qualitatively assess the relative strengths of these feedbacks for different peatland types within different climate regions. We suggest that understanding the role of hydrological feedbacks in regulating changes in precipitation and temperature are essential for understanding the resistance, resilience and vulnerability of northern peatlands to a changing climate. Finally, we propose that these hydrological feedbacks also represent the foundation of developing an ecohydrological understanding of coupled hydrological, biogeochemical and ecological feedbacks.

AB New field techniques were developed and tested to evaluate peat storativity and hydraulic conductivity in a Boreal fen. Enclosed drainage tests and pumping tests were successfully completed in the thawed peat above an impermeable frozen layer and then repeated when the peat was fully thawed. A loading test experiment constrained values of vertical hydraulic conductivity within an order of magnitude for the peat below a depth of 2 m. An inherent advantage of these tests is that volumes of undisturbed peat on the scale of cubic metres may be characterized. Storativity of the fen peat as determined by enclosed drainage tests ranged from about 1.0 at the peat surface to 0.35 at a water table depth of 0.15 m. Laboratory drainage tests of peat cores gave similar, but widely scattered results. Hydraulic conductivity near the surface was as high as 9.0 x 10(-3) ms(-1) determined with pumping tests and in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-5) ms(-1) below a depth of 2 m, estimated with the loading test. Slug tests gave similar results. Pumping tests, enclosed storativity tests and loading tests are practical large-scale field tests for determining peat properties.

AB Montane peatlands occupy only 0.1% of the Caucasus territory and are present at altitudes of 600-3400 m a.s.l. Unlike vegetation and stratigraphy, insects of the peatlands have been studied poorly. The aim of our study is to describe for the first time the fauna of water beetles of Sphagnum and Carex-Sphagnum peatlands in the North Caucasus, its zoogeographical and regional specifics, and factors determining species richness and species composition of water beetles in several peatlands. The fieldwork was performed in May, June, and September, 2018, in eight peatlands in North Ossetia (Tarskoe, Chifandzar, and two peatlands on the Kubus Mount and Kabardino-Balkaria (three small peatlands near Verkhnyaya Balkaria village and the "narzan" (with emissions of mineral groundwater) Ushtulu peatland). The material was collected in the in-mire water bodies and watercourses by sweeping with a Balfour-Brown aquatic net, collecting individuals with aquarium nets in shallow water bodies, and trampling of Sphagnum. We recorded 25 species of water beetles of six families: Gyrinidae (1), Haliplidae (1), Dytiscidae (13), Helophoridae (2), Hydrophilidae (7), and Hydraenidae (1). Among them, there are endemics, and subendemics of the Caucasus boreal montane species which are glacial relicts of the region. Development of the local fauna of water beetles in the North Caucasus peatlands has regional specifics and depends on altitudes, typological diversity of the peatland water bodies, and physical and chemical properties of water. We recommend establishing new Protected Areas in Russia: Sphagnum peatlands in Kabardino-Balkaria near the village Verkhnyaya Balkaria. For protection of montane Sphagnum peatlands as unique habitats, we recommend to include the boreal-montane species Hydroporus incognitus and Hydroporus nigellus in the Red Data Book of Kabardino-Balkaria and Hydroporus nigellus in the Red Data Book of North Ossetia.

AB The vegetation of the superparamo of the "Sierra Nevada de Merida" National Park, Venezuela, was analysed using phytosociological methods. Thirteen plant communities are described, each with its characteristic floristic and life form composition, structure, ecology and distribution. A new graphic presentation of the abundance and the percentage of life forms in each community is applied.
   The zonal communities, belonging to the Draba empetroides-Luzula racemosa-community-group are dominated by tussock-grasses or giant rosette plants and seem to be confined to Venezuela. The most common ones are the Espeletia schultzii-Aciachne acicularis-community (up to 4150 m) and the Coespeletia moritziana-Festuca tolucensis-community (4150-4500 m). The Festuca fragilis-Oritrophium paramense-community and the Coespeletia timotensis-community occur between 4500 and 4600 m.
   The azonal communities, referred to the Gentiana sedifolia-Carex amicta-community-group and the Aciachnetum pulvinatae, are dominated by cushion grasses, rosette plants or cushion plants and have a wide distribution along the Andes. The Aciachnetum pulvinatae is characteristic of former lakelets. The Carex bonplandii-Lache-milla sprucei-community (Marchantia-Epilobietalia) and the Wernerion-community (Wernerietalia) are characteristic vegetation types of mires, cushion bogs and meadows.
   Above 4600 up to the snow-level at 4850 m discrete communities are lacking; isolated individuals of Festuca fragilis, Poa pauciflora, Draba empetroides and Draba racemosa, among others, occur in protected places.
   The study revealed, that the diversity of the vegetation is related to an altitudinal gradient and the soil-humidity.

AB Anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis have been found to slow-down in water saturated peat soils with accumulation of metabolic end-products, i.e. dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4), due to a lack of solute and gas transport. So far it is not well understood how solute and gas transport may control this effect. We conducted a column experiment with homogenized ombrotrophic peat over a period of 300 days at 20 A degrees C. We specifically evaluated the effects of diffusive flux as control, downward advective water flux, intensified ebullition by conduit gas transport and diffusive oxygen supply on controlling anaerobic decomposition rates and carbon (C) turnover. To simulate advective flux, water and solutes were recirculated downward through the column after stripping of dissolved gases. We analyzed DIC and CH4 concentrations, production rates and fluxes, gas filled porosity, oxygen profiles (O-2) and microbial C biomass over time. DIC residence time thereby served as proxy to characterize transport. A slowdown of anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis evolved with the accumulation of the end-products DIC and CH4 and set in after 150 days. This slow-down was accompanied by a decrease in the distribution of microbial biomass C with depths. Anaerobic DIC and CH4 production rates were fastest close to the water table and sharply slowed with depth. Accumulation of DIC and CH4 in the homogeneous peat material throughout the column decreased decomposition constants from about 10(-5) near the surface to 10(-9) year(-1) deeper in the profile. Advective water transport extended the zone of active methanogenesis compared to a diffusive system; experimental enhancement of ebullition had little or no effect as well as strictly anoxic conditions. DIC residence time was negatively correlated to anaerobic respiration suggesting this parameter to be a predictor of anaerobic peat decomposition in peatlands. Overall, this study suggests that burial of peat and accumulation of metabolic end-products effectively slows decomposition and that this effect needs to be considered to explain peat accumulation and the response of peat mineralization rates to changes in environmental conditions.

AB Peatlands in Zoige Plateau contains more than half of peatland carbon stock in China. This part of carbon is losing with climate change through dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, both of which are vulnerable to the environmental changes, especially on the Zoige Plateau with a pace of twice the observed rate of global climate warming. This research aimed to understand how climate change including soil warming, rainfall reduction and water table change affect CO2 emissions and whether the trends of changes in CO2 emission are consistent with those of pore water DOC concentration. A mesocosm experiment was designed to investigate the CO2 emission and pore water DOC during the growing seasons of 2009-2010 under scenarios of passive soil warming, 20% rainfall reduction and changes to the water table levels. The results showed a positive relationship between CO2 emission and DOC concentration. For single factor effect, we found no significant relationship between water table and CO2 emission or DOC concentration. However, temperature at 5 cm depth was found to have positive linear relationship with CO2 emission and DOC concentration. The combined effect of soil warming and rainfall reduction increased CO2 emission by. 96.8%. It suggested that the drying and warming could stimulate potential emission of CO2. Extending this result to the entire peatland area in Zoige Plateau translates into 0.45 Tg CO2 emission per year over a growing season. These results suggested that the dryer and warmer Zoige Plateau will increase CO2 emission. We also found the contribution rate of DOC concentration to CO2 emission was increased by 12.1% in the surface layer and decreased by 13.8% in the subsurface layer with combined treatment of soil warming and rainfall reduction, which indicated that the warmer and dryer environmental conditions stimulate surface peat decomposition process.

AB This paper presents an empirical model of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) developed for a subarctic fen near Churchill, Manitoba. The model with observed data helps explain the interannual variability in growing season NEE. Five years of tower-flux data are used to test and examine the seasonal behaviour of the model simulations. Processes controlling the observed interannual variability of CO2 exchange at the fen are examined by exploring the sensitivity of the model to changes in air temperature, precipitation and leaf area index. Results indicate that the sensitivity of NEE to changing environmental controls is complex and varies interannually depending on the initial conditions of the wetland. Changes in air temperature and the timing of precipitation events have a strong influence on NEE, which is largely manifest in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). Climate change scenarios indicate that warmer air temperatures will increase carbon acquisition during wet years but may act to reduce wetland carbon storage in years that experience a large water deficit early in the growing season. Model simulations for this subarctic sedge fen indicate that carbon acquisition is greatest during wet and warm conditions. This suggests therefore that carbon accumulation was greatest at this subarctic fen during its early developmental stages when hydroclimatic conditions were relatively wet and warm at approximately 2500 years before present.

AB Organic sediments picked up randomly from seven small outcrops within the Ogwashi-Asaba Formation, southern Nigeria, are examined and evaluated by means of coal petrology and chemical and mineralogical analyses in order to determine the palaeoenvironmental conditions and the factors controlling their formation. Six samples proved to be low-rank coals C to B (lignite), one carbonaceous shale. The lignite samples display low ash yield, low telohuminite and high detrohuminite and liptinite contents; they contain small amounts of clastic minerals, mainly quartz and clays, which point to the topogenous character of the depositional palaeoenvironment. The palaeomires formed in a continental basin crossed by the mid-Tertiary palaeo-Niger River; the latter, as well as the tropical rainfall supplied the mires with water. The dense vegetation cover on the mire surface and the surroundings and/or the low relief energy of the broad area restricted the inorganic influx resulting in high-grade coal formation. As the outcrops are distributed over a distance of 60 km, the expected reserves of good quality lignite constitute a very promising exploration target. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micrometeorological measurements were made over a northern boreal fen near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. The measurement period extended from the start of snowmelt until the early fall, at which time senescence was widespread throughout the fen. Data analysis concentrated on identifying seasonal trends in energy, water, and carbon dioxide fluxes and linking them to observed surface cover changes. Albedos (solar and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)) showed large decreases over the melt period, reaching seasonal lows at the end of melt. Solar albedo increased in the summer in response to vegetation growth on the fen, while PAR albedo remained constant. Incoming and outgoing longwave flux seasonal trends were similar, so seasonal changes in net radiation were driven by the net solar flux. During the spring thaw, the melting of snow and ground ice was equal to about 28% of the daily total net radiation, while the soil heat flux accounted for about 5%. Bowen ratios at this time were above unity. Mean Bowen ratio decreased to 0.70 during the period between spring thaw and leaf-out. As the vascular vegetation cover developed, Bowen ratios decreased to seasonal lows of 0.10-0.20 near midsummer and then increased to above unity during senescence. The daily evaporative fraction (EF) was highest (greater than or equal to 0.80) during midsummer when the vascular vegetation was in full leaf and actively photosynthesizing, and EF decreased to a mean of 0.55 during senescence. Eddy correlation measurements of carbon dioxide flux showed the fen acting as a net sink for CO, only while the vascular vegetation was actively photosynthesizing with a daily mean flux of -0.81 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) (standard error = 0.16). Before leafing and during senescence the fen was a net source of CO2. Integrated over the study period of 124 days, the fen experienced a net loss of 30.4 g CO2 m(-2) to the atmosphere.

AB Developing objective tools for tracking progress of restored sites is of general concern. Here, we present an innovative approach based on principal response curves (PRC) and species classification according to their preferential habitats to monitor changes in community composition. Following large-scale restoration of a cut-over peatland, vegetation was surveyed biannually over 8 years. We evaluated whether the establishing plant communities fell within the range of natural variation. We used both general diversity curves and PRC applied on plant species grouped by preferred habitat to compare restored sites and unrestored sites to a reference ecosystem. After 8 years, diversity and richness differed between the sites, with Forest and Ruderal species more prominent in unrestored sites, and Peatland, Forest, and Wetland species dominant in restored sites. The PRC revealed that the restored site became rapidly dominated by typical peatland plants, the main drivers of temporal changes being Sphagnum rubellum, Pohlia nutans, and Mylia anomala. Some differences remained between the restored and the undisturbed species pools: the former had more herbaceous species associated with wetlands such as Calamagrostis canadensis and Typha latifolia and the latter had more forested species like Kalmia angustifolia throughout the study. PRC revealed to be an efficient tool identifying species driving changes at the community level after restoration. In our case study, examining PRC scores after classifying species according to their preferred habitat allowed to illustrate objectively how restoration promotes target species (associated to peatlands) and how lack of intervention benefits ruderal species.

AB The potential of high severity wildfires to increase global terrestrial carbon emissions and exacerbate future climatic warming is of international concern. Nowhere is this more prevalent than within high latitude regions where peatlands have, over millennia, accumulated legacy carbon stocks comparable to all human CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Drying increases rates of peat decomposition and associated atmospheric and aquatic carbon emissions. The degree to which severe wildfires enhance drying under future climates and induce instability in peatland ecological communities and carbon stocks is unknown. Here we show that high burn severities increased post-fire evapotranspiration by 410% within a feather moss peatland by burning through the protective capping layer that restricts evaporative drying in response to low severity burns. High burn severities projected under future climates will therefore leave peatlands that dominate dry sub-humid regions across the boreal, on the edge of their climatic envelopes, more vulnerable to intense post-fire drying, inducing high rates of carbon loss to the atmosphere that amplify the direct combustion emissions.

AB AimsNorthern peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (C) that can be very sensitive to ongoing global warming. Recently it has been shown that temperature-enhanced growth of vascular plants in these typically moss-dominated ecosystems may promote microbial peat decomposition by increased C input via root exudates. To what extent different plant functional types (PFT) and soil temperature interact in controlling root C input is still unclear. In this study we explored how root C input is related to the presence of ericoid shrubs (shrubs) and graminoid sedges (sedges) by means of a factorial plant clipping experiment (= PFT effect) in two peatlands located at different altitude (= temperature effect).MethodsBy selective clipping of shrub and sedge shoots in mixed vegetation at two Alpine peatland sites we interrupted the above- to belowground translocation of C, thus temporarily inhibiting root C release. Subsequent measurements of soil respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and stable isotope composition (C-13) of DOC in pore water were used as proxies to estimate the above- to belowground transfer of C by different PFT.ResultsWe found that soil respiration rates and DOC concentrations temporarily decreased within 24h after clipping, with the decrease in soil respiration being most pronounced at the 1.4 degrees C warmer peatland after clipping shrubs. The transient drop in DOC concentration coincided with a shift towards a heavier C isotope signature, indicating that the decrease was associated with inhibition of a light C source that we attribute to root exudates. Together these results imply that shrubs translocated more C into the peat than sedges, particularly at higher temperature.ConclusionsWe showed that plant functional type and temperature interact in controlling root C input under field conditions in peatlands. Our results provide a mechanistic evidence that shrubs may potentially promote the release of stored soil C through root-derived C input.

AB Carex acutiformis, C. rostrata and C. diandra occur as dominant species in different floating fens in the 'Vechtplassen' area in the Netherlands and have, in this order, a lower annual biomass production concurrent with the decreasing nutrient availability in the fens. The species allocated proportionally equal amounts of biomass to the leaf blades, but Carex diandra invested more in the leaf sheaths and in the roots than the other two species and also had the greatest root length proportional to leaf area. The leaf area ratio was greatest in Carex acutiformis, but C. diandra had the highest net assimilation rate and the highest relative growth rate. These characteristics are presumably connected with the vegetation structure of the fens which becomes, in the order mentioned, more open with increasing irradiance of the whole plant.
   The N concentration in the leaf blades increased in the species order mentioned above, which is, remarkably, in the order of decreasing N-availability in the fens. The percentage distribution of N, P and K over the different plant parts was different for the three species and was also different from the distribution of biomass.
   The efficiency of nitrogen use in relation to biomass production was highest in Carex acutiformis and lowest in C. diandra, but the efficiency of phosphorus use was lowest in the first species.
   The percentage reallocation of N and P from senescing leaves and the contribution of reallocated N and P to total plant N and P content was similar in the three species.
   In this study not only the development of the aboveground plant parts was followed, but also that of the belowground parts, by growing detached tillers in open tubes, placed in the peat soil at their original growth site, so that direct and accurate measurements could be made of belowground and aboveground individual plant parts and of nutrient allocation patterns of these plants.

AB The effect of burning Sphagnum moss and peat on phosphorus forms was studied with controlled combustion in the laboratory. Two fire treatments, a light fire (250 degrees C) and a severe fire (600 degrees C), were performed in a muffle furnace with 1-h residence time to simulate the effects of different forest fire conditions. The results showed that fire burning Sphagnum moss and peat soils resulted in losses of organic phosphorus (P-o), while inorganic phosphorus (P-l) concentrations increased. Burning significantly changed detailed phosphorus composition and availability, with severe fires destroying over 90% of organic phosphorus and increasing the availability of inorganic P by more than twofold. Our study suggest that, while decomposition processes in ombrotrophic bogs occur very slowly, rapid changes in the form and availability of phosphorus in vegetation and litter may occur as the result of forest fires on peat soils.

DT Article
AB The degree of aggregation of peat substrate and the size of structural elements can be used to distinguish between different stages of a peatland evolution and characterize relic features in the profile of modern peat soil. Carbon fractions separated from different aggregates are indicative of the age of peat accumulated in the period of active growth of the peatland and of the age of peat transformed during the peatland drying. On the basis of these data, annual rates of peat growth at different evolution stages can be determined, as well as the rates of organic carbon sequestration and the amount of peat forming from plant remains.

AB Small peat-forming ecosystems in arctic landscapes may play a significant role in the regional biogeochemistry of high-latitude systems, yet they are understudied compared to arctic uplands and other major peat-forming regions of the North. We present a new data set of 25 radiocarbon-dated permafrost peat cores sampled around eight low arctic lake sites in northern Manitoba (Canada) to examine the timing of peat initiation and controls on peat accumulation throughout the Holocene. We used macrofossils and charcoal to characterize changes in the plant community and fire, and we explored potential impacts of these local factors, as well as regional climatic change, on rates of C accumulation and C stocks. Peat initiation was variable across and within sites, suggesting the influence of local topography, but 56% of the cores initiated after 3000B.P. Most cores initiated and remained as drier bog hummock communities, with few vegetation transitions in this landscape. C accumulation was relatively slow and did not appear to be correlated with Holocene-scale climatic variability, but C stocks in this landscape were substantial (mean=45.4kgCm(-2)), potentially accounting for 13.2PgC in the Taiga Shield ecozone. To the extent that small peat-forming systems are underrepresented in peatland mapping, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks may be underestimated in arctic regions. Mean fire severity appeared to be negatively correlated with C accumulation rates. Initiation and accumulation of soil C may respond to both regional and local factors, and substantial lowland soil C stocks have the potential for biogeochemical impacts on adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

AB The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the largest peatland complex in North America. More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial government mandates that ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration be considered in land-use planning. Accomplishing this task requires identifying carbon indicators and assessing their responses to changing ecosystem processes, such as succession, permafrost thaw, and evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we synthesized information on peat carbon indicators and ecosystem process from the literature. Findings indicate that the long-term carbon accumulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, peat depth, and peatland age were similar (p > 0.10) between dry and wet peatland features. Furthermore, CO2 sequestration displayed the highest variability and ponds were net CO2 emitters. Recent carbon accumulation, CH4 emission, and ET were highest (p < 0.01) in wet features, with CH4 emission displaying wide variation. Increased active layer thickness (105 +/- 92 cm per 100 years) in permafrost was the most variable ecosystem process analyzed in this study, while variation in permafrost loss (53 +/- 23% per 100 years) was similar to that of carbon accumulation and ET rates. Processes creating wet and pond conditions may increase landscape-scale CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, weakening peatland carbon sinks. Dry conditions may reduce CH4 emissions but potentially increase peatland susceptibility to fire. Knowledge of these changes should be useful for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments for large landscapes. However, better understanding of variability in CO2 sequestration, CH4 emission, and permafrost dynamics is required to design such assessments for small landscapes.

AB Studies conducted across northern Europe and North America have shown increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic systems in recent decades. While there is little consensus as to the exact mechanisms for the increases in DOC, hypotheses converge on such climate change factors as warming, increased precipitation variability, and changes in atmospheric deposition. In this study, we tested the effects of warming on peat porewater composition by actively warming a peatland with infrared lamps mounted 1.24 m above the peat surface for 3 years. Mean growing season peat temperatures in the warmed plots (n = 5) were 1.9 +/- A 0.4 A degrees C warmer than the control plots at 5 cm depth (t statistic = 5.03, p = 0.007). Mean porewater DOC concentrations measured throughout the growing season were 15 % higher in the warmed plots (73.4 +/- A 3.2 mg L-1) than in the control plots (63.7 +/- A 2.1 mg L-1) at 25 cm (t = 4.69, p < 0.001). Furthermore, DOC from the warmed plots decayed nearly twice as fast as control plot DOC in laboratory incubations, and exhibited lower aromaticity than control plot porewater (reduction in SUVA(254) in heated plots compared with control plots). Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations tracked DOC patterns as expected, but the amount of dissolved N per unit C decreased with warming. Previous work has shown that warming increased net primary production at this site, and together with measured increases in the activities of chitinases and glucosidases we suggest that the increased DOC concentrations observed with warming were derived in part from microbial-plant interactions in the rhizosphere. We also detected more nitrogen containing compounds with higher double bond equivalents (DBE) unique to the warmed plots, within the pool of biomolecules able to deprotonate (16 % of all compounds identified using ultrahigh resolution ion electrospray mass spectrometry); we suggest these compounds could be the products of increased plant, microbial, and enzyme activity occurring with warming. With continued warming in peatlands, an increase in relatively labile DOC concentrations could contribute to dissolved exports of DOC in runoff, and would likely contribute to the pool of efficient electron donors (and acceptors) in the production of CO2 and CH4 in terrestrial and aquatic environments.

AB Relatively horizontal and smooth rock surfaces bordering lakes 65-150 m a.s.l. in the relatively mountainous Bergen area are described. The surfaces, 1-4 km(2) in size and up to 1.5 km wide are developed in strongly foliated metamorphic Proterozoic and Paleozoic bedrock ranging in composition from granitic to gabbroic. The detailed topography of the bog-covered rock surfaces has been mapped by various methods: map surveys, probing and levelling, profiling with seismic refraction and ground penetrating radar (GPR) as well as direct levelling of the rock platforms around the lakes.
   The formation of the rock surfaces is compared to the recent formation of an up to 20 m wide rock platform along one of the lakes. Alternating air temperature inversions in the lake basin and heavy precipitation during milder periods (NAO) are thought to be responsible for frequent freeze/thaw fluctuations as well as an oscillating lake level facilitating frost weathering. The rock surfaces are thought to have formed during Weich-selian interstadials by frost weathering (cryoplanation) along the shores of former lakes and rivers. implications for the formation of the 30 km wide Norwegian strandflat in similar rocks just north of this area are discussed.

AB A comparative study of forest clear-cut logging effects on daily growing season (May to October) net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of adjacent peatlands was conducted in two neighbouring forest upland-peatland complexes over 4 years (2005 to 2008) on the Boreal Plains (BP) of Alberta, Canada. Higher vapour pressure deficit at the harvested-upland (H-U) peatland, reflecting increased turbulent mixing after adjacent upland forest removal (2007 and 2008), resulted in increased peatland evapotranspiration rates that contributed to a seasonal decline in soil moisture (volumetric moisture content) influencing NEE. Overall, a significant change in mid-season NEE occurred at the H-U peatland 1 year post-harvesting, greater than NEE changes at the neighbouring intact-upland peatland. However, 2 years post-harvesting, mid-season NEE returned to within range of pre-harvesting variability (-0.54 to 1.34 g CO2-Cm-2 day(-1)). Results of this study demonstrate that BP peatland NEE is largely regulated by site-specific water availability, which, in turn, may be influenced in the short term by shifting microclimate and soil moisture patterns because of clear-cut logging. As such, predicting long-term carbon storage function of BP peatlands will require careful consideration of changing hydroclimatic conditions because of rapid expansion of BP deforestation, given that these ecosystems already exist in a state of hydrologic risk in this moisture deficit eco-region.

AB The relevance of the discussed issue is caused by insufficient knowledge of the stratigraphy and dynamics of peatland of the Western Siberia tundra zone and the impact of permafrost conditions and climate.
   The main aim of the research is the detailed study of stratigraphic and reconstruction of the dynamics of plant communities, water regimes and geocryological conditions of Central Yamal khasyrey.
   The methods used in the research: detailed (1...3,5 cm) study of the macro fossils composition and physic-chemical properties of peat, radiocarbon dating (6 dates) peat deposit; reconstruction of phytoceanoses and water regimes by traditional paleoecological methods, reconstruction of paleogeocryological conditions according to paleophytocoenoses successions and peat secondary diagenesis; comparative analysis of the obtained data with the data of reconstructions of regional climate and functional state of mires to other zones and regions.
   The results. For the first time the authors have obtained the detailed stratigraphy of peat deposits, data on peat density and its organic substance. By the example of the khasyrey in the Lake Sokhonto area of Central Yamal the authors determined the impact of paleocryological conditions on increase of peat decomposition degree and density. They carried out the detailed reconstruction of khasyrey dynamics for the 1300-year period of its formation. Seven large stages and 15 stages with 6 substages of khasyrey formation of interdecadal and century scale were revealed. Water regimes and cryogenic conditions of these stages are in agreement with similar reconstructions data of mires of Western Siberia forest zone and Holarctic cryolithozone regional climate. The authors differentiated 2 periods in which khasyrey surface eras wet: 952...843; 273 cal. yr. BP...2001 yr. The khasyrey surface was drained maximally during 4 periods: 1099...1065 and 1037...984; 719-652; 542...434 cal. yr. BP. The short-term formation of low permafrost mound during periods of 1099...1065; 1008...984 and 719...652 cal. yr. BP is of high probability. Formation of polygonal mire took place during 542...434 cal. yr. BP. Since 434 cal. yr. BP the depth of seasonal thawing increased, and since 330 cal. yr. BP the ice veins started melting, formation of mire with raised-centre polygons was caused by thermokarst and erosion. In 136...91 cal. yr. BP the depth of seasonal thawing decreased. Drainage of a khasyrey surface in a consequence of waters dumping of the khasyrey lake during the wet warm periods took place between 7153 and 1099, 869 and 843 cal. yr. BP; ca. 2003 and 2008 yrs. Thus, climate changes in the Western Siberia tundra were the main cause of pulsating nature of khasyreis in contrast to the more southern areas. Climate influence was direct, through the hydrothermal regime, and indirect, through cryogenic processes in peat deposit and the water table regime of the lake. Optimal conditions for palsa and polygonal mire formation were created with increasing continental climate and summer temperatures during periods of dry cooling.

AB Peatlands are among the largest long-term soil carbon stores, but their degradation can lead to significant carbon losses. This study considers the carbon budget of peat-covered sites after restoration, following degradation by past wildfires. The study measured the carbon budget of eight sites: four restored-revegetated sites, two unrestored bare soil control sites, and two intact vegetated controls over two years (2006-2008). The study considered the following flux pathways: dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2); primary productivity; net ecosystem respiration, and methane (CH4). The study shows that unrestored, bare peat sites can have significant carbon losses as high as 522 +/- 3 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. Most sites showed improved carbon budgets (decreased source and/or increased sink of carbon) after restoration; this improvement was mainly in the form of a reduction in the size of the net carbon source, but for one restored site the measured carbon budget after four years of restoration was greater than observed for vegetated controls. The carbon sequestration benefit of peatland restoration would range between 122 and 833 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peat bog deposits provide a very important record of past environmental conditions, preserving biotic and abiotic processes that occurred in the vicinity of the bog. In this study, we examined three peat bog profiles from Kietrz, located in the micro-region of the Glubczycki Plateau, southern Poland.
   The objective of this study was to determine the type of peat occurring in this area, through examination of its mineral composition, and evaluation of the total carbon and total sulphur content. In addition, we measured peat reaction (pH) and identified floral and faunal components occurring within the peat deposits.
   The peat comprises primarily of fragments of fossilized plant and mollusk remains, as well as minerals (calcium sulphates, calcium carbonates, and pyrites). Additionally, an assemblage of iron oxides/ hydroxides, K-feldspar, apatite, zircon, and quartz grains was identified. A neutral and/or light alkalinity was recorded for the peat deposits, but an increase in acidity (pH) with increasing depth through each peat profile was also recorded. We observed a positive correlation between the pH and chemical composition of deposits, where a significant presence of calcite is associated with higher reaction (higher pH), whilst a lower pH is characteristic for sediments where carbonates are rare. The recognized species of mollusks are typical of shallow, fresh-water stagnant reservoirs with a high fluctuation of water level.

AB Peatlands are widely distributed throughout northeast China and form a large carbon (C) pool. The main types include plain wetlands and alpine peatlands. Compared to the former, the historical development and C dynamics of the alpine peatlands are still not well understood. In this study, a total of nine peat cores from the Great Hinggan, Changbai and Fenghuang Mountains were collected and dated by Pb-210 and Cs-137 techniques. All samples were analysed for organic matter content through loss on ignition (LOI) and three core samples from Motianling peatland were further analysed for total organic carbon (TOC) by elemental analysis. A linear model between LOI and TOC was established as TOC = 0.405 x LOI + 0.968 (R (2) = 0.7828, P < 0.0001) which is recommended for estimating organic C content and assessing C accumulation in the peatlands of northeast China. This conversion equation could lead to a 17.8 % overestimate of RERCA compared to elemental C determination, but it is preferable to using a conversion coefficient of 0.5, which could result in a 36.3 % overestimate than elemental analysis. The recent rate of C accumulation (RERCA) in the alpine peatlands is estimated between 128.85 and 203.73 g C m(-2) year(-1) and the average C storage per unit area is calculated as 31 +/- A 9 kg C m(-2) over the past 200 years. These are significant additions to the plain wetlands and this knowledge is helpful in forming a complete picture of C sequestration in wetlands of this region. Within-site difference for average RERCA reflects the need for a multi-core study of C accumulation in peatlands and between-site comparison of RERCA shows that the average RERCA increases towards the higher latitude. This pattern is mainly controlled by the peatland types. Results here will be useful to evaluate the C sequestration potential in peatlands and improve our understanding the response of alpine peatland ecosystems to projected climate change.

AB The use of drained peatlands as dairy grasslands leads to long-term organic matter losses, CO2 emissions and soil subsidence. It also yields grass with increased N and P contents compared to grass grown on mineral soils due to peat mineralisation, which often leads to greater farm surpluses of these elements. Growing Typha latifolia as a forage crop on rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) could reduce these issues. Therefore, the effects of harvest date and frequency on yield and nutritional value were studied in three experiments during the first growing season after establishment of two different T latifolia plantations. T latifolia produced 40-68 shoots m' and maximum dry matter (DM) yields of 9.81-10.89 Mg ha(-1). Harvesting before flowering resulted in the highest nutritional value per kg DM, of 563-575 g in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM), 120-128 g crude protein (CP), 287-300 g crude fibre (CF) and 1.5 g P. Surprisingly, harvesting at intervals of three or six weeks resulted in similar cumulative DM yields (p= 0.190). Also, average nutritional values per kg DM, especially of biomass harvested at 3-week intervals, remained similar to a May yield of 466-591 g IVDOM, 103-134 g CP and 286-303 g CF. Growing T latifolia fodder for inclusion in grass-based diets could reduce the environmental impacts of dairy farming on peat.

AB We tested the hypothesis that interactions in litter mixtures (expressed as the difference between observed and expected decomposition rates) are greater when the component species differ more in their initial litter chemistry. Thereto, we collected freshly senesced leaf litter from a wide range of species from an old field and woodland vegetation, and a fen ecosystem in The Netherlands. Litterbags with either mono-specific litter (20 and 15 species), or litter mixtures (50 and 42 species pairs) of randomly drawn combinations of two representatives from different plant functional types were incubated for 20, 35 and 54 weeks in a purpose-built decomposition bed (woodland/old field) or in the field (fen). Species showed a wide range of decomposition rates. For the woodland/old field species, initial litter C and P concentrations were significantly correlated with litter decomposition rate. For the fen species, litter phenolics concentration was correlated with decomposition rate. If the Sphagnum species were left out of the analyses, initial litter P and phenolics concentration both showed a significant relationship, albeit only with the remaining mass after 1 year. Differences between observed and expected decomposition were often considerable in individual litter mixtures. Regression analysis showed that such differences were not related to the differences in litter chemistry of the component species. Furthermore, litter mixtures containing species with very different initial litter chemistry did not show stronger interaction when tested against litter mixtures containing chemically similar litter types. From these observations we conclude that the difference in initial single litter chemistry parameters of the component is not a useful concept to explain interactions in litter mixtures.

AB Over half of the world's peat originated from Sphagnum, representing 10-15% of the terrestrial carbon stock. However, information regarding the release and exudation of organic carbon by living Sphagnum plants into the surface peat is scarce. In this study, we examined the contribution of recent Sphagnum subnitens (Russ. and Warnst.) photosynthate carbon to the peatland dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. This was done using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase experimental approach during the growing season. Despite the importance of Sphagnum in long-term carbon accumulation, results showed that the Sphagnum community rapidly contributes recently synthesized carbon to the peatland DOC pool. We estimate that by 4 h up to 4% of the total DOC in peat leachate was derived from (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling at ambient CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, a huge 64% of the C-13 initially assimilated by photosynthesis was retained in Sphagnum subnitens for 23 days after labelling, consistent with the role of Sphagnum in peatland carbon accumulation. The majority of C-13 loss as respired CO2 came within the few days post (CO2)-C-13 labelling, suggesting that it was derived from plant respiration of photosynthates.

They are also subject to rapid climatic shifts and, subsequently, new disturbance processes - snow loss-driven mortality and the emergence of fire in historically non-fire-exposed areas. Here, we compare and contrast Southern and Northern Hemisphere coastal temperate rainforests of the Americas, two of the largest examples of the biome, via synthesis of current literature, future climate expectations and new downscaling of a global fire model. In terms of snow loss, a rapid decline in winter snow is leading to mass mortality of certain conifer species in the Northern Hemisphere rainforests. High-elevation Southern Hemisphere forests, which are beginning to see similar declines in snow, may be vulnerable in the future, especially bogs and high-water content soils. Southern Hemisphere forests are seeing the invasion of fire as an ecological force at mid-to-high latitudes, a shift not yet observed in the north but which may become more prominent with ongoing climate change. We suggest that research should focus on the flammability of seral vegetation and bogs under future climate scenarios in both regions. By comparing these two drivers of change across similar gradients in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, this work points to the potential for emerging change in unexpected places in both regions. There is a clear benefit to conceptualising the coastal temperate rainforests of the Americas as two examples of the biome which can inform the other, as change is proceeding in similar directions but at different rates in each region.

AB Methane fluxes were measured on vegetated surfaces ( 2003) and pools ( 2004) of three peatlands (LG1-LG2-LG3) located 30, 100, and 200 km along a transect from the James Bay coast, in the La Grande Riviere watershed, James Bay lowland, Quebec, Canada. Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent the biotypes characteristic of each peatland, from hummocks with a water table 35 cm below the surface to pools 100 cm deep. Average CH4 fluxes for the biotypes on vegetated surfaces sampled during summer 2003 ranged from 3.5 to 197 mg m(-2) d(-1), while summer 2004 average floating chamber pool fluxes ranged between 6.2 and 3165 mg CH4 m(2)(-) d(-1). Seasonal average daily CH4 fluxes on vegetated surface were strongly correlated with average water table depth, greater fluxes occurring where the water table was close to the surface, and with vegetation cover, particularly the aboveground biomass of sedges. Within the summer, increasing CH4 fluxes from vegetated surfaces were correlated with rising peat temperature. Pool fluxes from the LG1 and LG2 peatlands decreased with increasing pool depth, but not at LG3. Estimated growing season CH4 emissions for the three peatlands were of 44 +/- 21 ( standard error), 21 +/- 9.4 and 52 +/- 17 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) for the LG1, LG2, and LG3 peatlands, respectively. Estimated annual release of CH4 is 3.8 g m(-2) with the winter contributing to 13% of the overall emission, based on wintertime measurements at LG2.

AB 1 We measured species density, biomass and shoot density for both bryophytes and vascular plants in 90 small plots in 18 calcareous fens. In addition, we recorded leaf area index and litter mass of vascular plants. Our goals were: (a) to compare the relationship between biomass and species density for the two taxonomic groups, (b) to test whether biomass and species density of bryophytes and vascular plants are related to their shoot density, and (c) to assess the degree to which biomass, shoot and species density of bryophytes are correlated with characteristics of the vascular plant layer.
   2 For bryophytes there was a positive linear relationship between biomass and species density. Vascular plant species density was not related to biomass. Furthermore, bryophyte biomass and species density were linearly and positively related to bryophyte shoot density. For vascular plants, only biomass but not species density was related to shoot density.
   3 We concluded that a bryophyte favourability gradient existed along which biomass and shoot and species density increased. This gradient was attributed to positive interactions within dense bryophyte stands, high clonal fragmentation, absence of competitive hierarchies and to the limited ability of larger bryophyte species to replace small species along this favourability gradient.
   4 Since species density for vascular plants varied independently from biomass and shoot density, there was no such favourability gradient as for bryophytes. Large size variation, predominantly negative interactions between species, and clonal integration of species (e.g. tussock-forming grasses and sedges) may be responsible for the different behaviour of the two taxonomic groups.
   5 Bryophyte favourability decreased with increasing vascular plant biomass. Concerning tight availability, we found highest bryophyte favourability at intermediate levels where the combination of radiation and moisture seems to be optimal for bryophytes. No relationship was found between bryophyte favourability and vascular plant shoot density and litter mass.
   6 The negative relationship between bryophyte favourability and vascular plant biomass is important for bryophyte conservation. Stands of low vascular plant production are those with the potential for highest species richness, and should therefore receive conservation priority.

AB Surface and atmospheric controls on latent heat flux (Q(E)) and energy partitioning were assessed during three growing seasons at the Mer Bleue peat bog. The surface consisted of a sparse canopy (maximum leaf area index similar to 1.3) of low, mostly evergreen shrubs over moss-covered hummocks and hollows. Available energy was partitioned mostly to Q(E) (Bowen ratio often less than 0.5) throughout the growing seasons over an extensive range of water table fluctuation (as much as 50 cm). Q(E) was often at or below the equilibrium rate due to surface (low moss water content, strong vascular stomatal control) and/or atmospheric (low vapour pressure deficit (D-a)) factors. Turbulent energy fluxes varied with net radiation and the magnitude of the fluctuations were affected by D-a and moss water content. It is suggested that a change in source partitioning for Q(E) led to a change in Q(E) - D-a dynamics. Early in the growing season the moss was wet and the vascular canopy was replacing leaves, thus QE increased as D-a increased because moss, which reacts passively to D-a contributed strongly to Q(E). Later in the growing season as water table declined and the evaporation load reduced moss and fibric peat water contents, moss contributed less strongly to Q(E) and vascular contribution became more important. Also, stomatal control became more influential in reducing bulk surface conductance for water vapour and Q(E) in response to increasing D-a. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the effects of different restoration treatments on the development of fen meadow communities: (1) depth of topsoil removal, with shallow (circa 20 cm) and deep (circa 40 cm) soil removal applied, (2) transfer of seed-containing hay, and (3) access of large animals. We carried out a full factorial experiment with all combinations of these factors and monitored it for 4 years. We studied the effect of seed availability in the soil seed bank on species abundance in the vegetation and compared it to the effect of species introduction by hay. We observed large differences in species composition between different treatments after 4 years. The combination of hay transfer, deep soil removal, and exclusion of large animals resulted in a community with highest similarity to the target vegetation. We found that the transfer of seeds with hay had a larger effect on species abundance than the soil seed bank. Hay transfer appeared to have important consequences on vegetation development because it speeded up the establishment of the target vegetation.

AB The densities, diets and habitat preferences of the soil macrofaunal species on sub-Antarctic Marion Island (47-degrees-S, 38-degrees-E) are described. Their role in N cycling on the island is assessed, using a mire-grassland community as an example. Primary production on the island is high and this leads to a substantial annual requirement of nutrients by the vegetation. This requirement must almost wholly be met by mineralization of nutrient reserves in the organic matter. Rates of peat nitrogen mineralization mediated by microorganisms alone are much too low to account for rates of N uptake by the vegetation. Although soil macroinvertebrates, and bacteria represent a very small fraction of the total N pool, their interaction accounts for most of the peat N mineralization, as indicated by the amounts of inorganic N released into solution in microcosms. Extrapolation of the microcosm results shows that the soil macrofauna (mainly earthworms) stimulate the release of enough N from the mire-grassland peat to account for maximum N mineralization rates calculated from temporal changes in peat inorganic N levels and plant uptake during the most active part of the growing season. Considering that large numbers of meso- and microinvertebrates occur and must also contribute to nutrient mineralization, the soil faunal component is clearly of crucial importance to nutrient cycling on Marion Island. This is probably true of all sub-Antarctic islands.

AB Northern peatlands are significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon, and it has been predicted that warmer temperatures and lower water tables resulting from climate change will convert these ecosystems into sources for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, these predictions do not consider the potential for hydrologically induced ecological succession or the spatial variability of carbon accumulation rates between different microforms in peatlands. To address these issues, the vegetation community was described, and the rates of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (R-tot) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange were determined along poor fen microtopographic gradients at a control site and at a site which experienced a water table drawdown of similar to 20 cm 8 years prior to the study (drained). Sampling plots within these sites were classified as microforms of hummocks, lawns, or hollows. The coverage of Sphagnum moss declined on drained hummocks, drained lawns were invaded by sedges, and hollows shifted from open water plots at the control site to Sphagnum-dominated plots with sparse vascular plant cover at the drained site. As a result, Rtot was significantly greater at the drained site at all microforms while maximum rates of GEP declined at drained hummocks and were enhanced at drained lawns and hollows compared to similar control microforms. These results suggest that predictions about the response of northern peatland carbon exchange to climate change must consider the interaction between ecology and hydrology and the differential responses of microforms related to their initial ecohydrological conditions.

AB Knowledge of the ecology of pre-adult stages of an organism at its species' range margins is a prerequisite for conserving species, especially for understanding its responses to future climate changes. Largely sedentary premature life stages require specific living conditions within a relatively small area. Such conditions are created by vegetation structure heterogeneity and a microclimate gradient, generated by varying microtopography. We investigated the microhabitat selection patterns of egg-laying females and overwintering caterpillars of peatland butterfly Coenonympha tullia relative to vegetation composition, water quantity and microclimatic conditions across microtopographic zones of transition mire at the species' southern range margin. We showed that (1) small-scale variability in mire microtopography determines oviposition site selection and larval presence; (2) microhabitats of pre-adult stages were largely confined to the intermediate microtopographic zone of the transition mire (flats); (3) egg-laying females and overwintered larvae preferred microsites with high coverage of main hostplants (Trichophorum alpinum, Carex lasiocarpa, C. limosa, C. panicea), and those with more humid and cooler summertime conditions than on hummocks; (4) females and larvae avoided shallow hollows permanently filled with water. The vegetation structure of flats enables the females to select spots with sufficient humidity for egg development, and allows the larvae to change their location according to suitable thermal and moisture conditions. We also discuss poor prospects for species in view of impacts of future climate changes on mire ecosystems.

AB Raised bogs and municipal waste landfills harbor large populations of methanogens within their domed deposits of anoxic organic matter. Although the methane emissions from these sites have been estimated by various methods, limited data exist on the activity of the methanogens at depth. We therefore analyzed the stable isotopic signature of the pore waters in two raised hogs from northern Minnesota to identify depth intervals in the peat profile where methanogenic metabolism occurs. Methanogenesis enriched the deuterium (H-2) content of the deep peat pore waters by as much as +11 parts per thousand (Vienna Standard Mean Sea Water), which compares to a much greater enrichment factor of +70 parts per thousand in leachate from New York City's Fresh Kills landfill. The bog pore waters were isotopically dated by tritium (H-3) to be about 35 years old at 1.5 m depth, whereas the landfill leachate was estimated as similar to 17 years old from Darcy flow calculations. According to an isotopic mass balance the observed deuterium enrichment indicates that about 1.2 g of CH4 m(-3) d(-1) were produced within the deeper peat, compared to about 2.8 g CH4 m(-3) d(-1) in the landfill. The values for methane production in the bog peat are substantially higher than the flux rates measured at the surface of the bogs or at the landfill, indicating that deeper methane production may be much higher than was previously assumed.

TI The effects of livestock grazing on the bog turtle [Glyptemys (=
   Clemmys) muhlenbergii]
SO HERPETOLOGICA

DT Article
DE bog turtle; cattle; grazing; invasive flora; threatened species
ID VEGETATION; CATTLE
AB The bog turtle Glyptemys (= Clemmys) muhlenbergii is an inhabitant of ground-water-fed sedge meadows in the northeastern and southeastern United States. Observations of bog turtle habitats throughout the species' range demonstrate that livestock grazing has been an important factor in staving off successional processes and abating large-scale invasions by tall-growing, competitively dominant plants - many of which are exotic in origin. The demise of small-scale dairy farming over the past three decades has led to the pastoral abandonment of the majority of bog turtle habitats in the Northeast. As a consequence, habitats are being degraded by the growth of invasive flora, changes in hydrology, and loss of turtle microhabitats created by livestock. In this study we compared the number of bog turtle captures, bog turtle demographic parameters, bog turtle densities, and vegetation at sites that are currently grazed (n = 12) and at sites in which grazing had recently ceased (n = 12). This analysis demonstrated that grazed sites contained greater numbers of turtles, greater turtle density, and greater frequency of occurrence for juvenile turtles. Grazed sites also contained greater cover of low-growing herbaceous vegetation and lower heights of tall-growing exotic and/or invasive vegetation than the formerly grazed sites. We hypothesize that nutrient enrichment from manure and agricultural run-off has promoted the establishment and growth of invasive plant species at many of the sites, but livestock grazing has kept these plants in check. When livestock are removed, invasive species proliferate, and the hummocky microtopography maintained by the livestock traffic is often reduced to a mat of vegetation. This investigation showed that efforts to preserve viable populations of bog turtles may depend on the preservation of low-intensity, pasture-based dairy and beef farming.

AB One of the consequences of ongoing development of the all sands reserve in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada (56 degrees 39' N, 111 degrees 13' W) is an increase in emissions of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S), with an attendant increases in regional atmospheric N and S deposition. Regional land cover across northeastern 4 Iberia is a mixture of Boreal Mixedwood, Boreal Highlands, and Subarctic areas. Pealands occupy between 22 and 66% of these natural regions. and the land cover of bogs varies between 6.7% in the Mixedwood Region to 46% in the Subarctic Region. Ombrotrophic bog ecosystems may be especially Sensitive in atmospheric deposition of N and S. Across 10 ombrotrophic bog sites in the AOSR over four years (2005 2008), we found no evidence of elevated deposition of NH4+-H, NO3 -N, total inorganic nitrogen (TIN,- NH4--N plus NO; -N). or SO42--S, with values measured using ion exchange resin collectors averaging 0.61 +/- 04. 0.20 +/- 0.01, 0.81 +/- 0.04, and 1,14 +/- 0.06 kg respectively.

In the Canadian System of Soil Classification, the Organic order represents those soils that have developed from materials that are comprised primarily of plant tissue remains and includes both wetland Organic soils and upland Organic soils. This review focuses on the first group; the latter group is discussed in Fox and Tarnocai (2011). Wetland Organic soils can be subdivided into three great groups: Fibrisol, Mesisol, and Humisol, reflecting the degree of decomposition of organic material and the vertical arrangement of different organic horizons and other horizons. Wetland Organic soils are present in all regions of Canada and are commonly referred to as (unfrozen) peatland soils. Unfrozen peatlands with Organic soils cover approximately 75 5568 km(2) (8.4%) of the land area of Canada. The two primary processes of formation of wetland Organic soils are paludification and terrestrialization. The major taxonomic issues identified for the wetland Organic soils concerns the lack of taxonomic protocols for limnic materials within the soil control section. This is an issue for those soil profiles in which the middle tier is dominated by, if not entirely composed of, deposited limnic materials. Further work is required to determine if these issues should be expressed at the great group or subgroup level of classification. Our understanding of the effects of management practices such as cultivation, tree removal, drainage, and peat extraction on soil properties needs to be translated into models of soil development.

AB Carbon (C) dynamics in northern peatlands are an important factor in the global C balance under climate change scenarios. They are microbially driven and influenced by the chemical composition of organic matter. Peatlands in the Rocky Mountains are usually formed on mineral sediments or developed with interbedded mineral lenses, which have been found to affect soil properties such as volumetric water content, pH, TOC and TN. Our objective was to investigate whethet the presence and relative depth of mineral horizons (i.e., stratified mineral horizons) affect microbial community structure and C composition, and in turn influence C mineralization. Three organic soil profile types were selected in the Sibbald research wetland of southwestern Alberta: peat over silty mineral over calcareous sediment (PMC), peat over silty mineral over peat (PMP), and sedge peat over moss peat profiles (PP). Peat samples were subjected to C composition and microbial community abundance and structure measurement and then incubated to test potential C mineralization. The main differences were detected in subsurface peat. In subsurface peat above mineral sediments (PMC, PMP) versus at equivalent depth in PP, the presence of a mineral horizon caused different C mineralization (mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil) among soil types (PP > PMC and PMP). In addition, specific C mineralization (mg C-CO2 kg(-1) SOC) decreased with depth in subsurface peat in PP, but not in PMP, as greater volumetric water content (theta v) above the mineral horizon created anaerobic conditions in PMP. Microbial community structures also differed between PMP and PP due to different theta v in peat below mineral sediments. Recalcitrant C: labile C, bacteria: fungi, and microbial physiological stress were greatest in the subsurface peat above mineral sediments. Depth had an even greater effect: both C mineralization and microbial abundance decreased significantly with depth. Moreover, microbial community structure mainly grouped according to relative depth. Overall, our findings indicated that stratified mineral horizons affected C mineralization, microbial community structure, and peat chemistry in subsurface peat. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Questions Can free-roaming Konik horses digest and subsequently disperse seeds of plant species growing in a temperate fen environment? Which species have the potential to be dispersed internally (endozoochory), and do they share common plant and seed traits? How could potential dispersal via endozoochory impact upon grazing management and the natural recolonization of wetland vegetation at a landscape scale? Location Wicken Fen NNR, Cambridge, UK. Methods Twelve dung samples were collected for one calendar year (Jun 2009May 2010) from a free-roaming herd of Konik horses grazing vegetation at Wicken Fen NNR. Germinable seed content of the dung was determined by means of a seedling emergence study. Species presence and estimated cover/abundance were recorded for the grazed (background) vegetation in spring and summer 2009. Results Almost one-third of all species present in the background vegetation were also identified in the dung samples. There was an equal split between graminoids and forbs, but substantially more graminoid germinable seeds. Species were dispersed year-round, with the number of species peaking in Sep and again in Dec. Of the 13 traits measured, there were significant differences between dung and background vegetation for six traits. Mean values for seed release heights (minimum and maximum) and dispersule weight were significantly lower in species found in the dung, whilst dung species had significantly greater numbers of seeds per shoot, inferred Ellenberg nitrogen values and seed bank persistence. Conclusion Year-round free-roaming grazing has the potential to make a considerable contribution to the long-range dispersal of species growing in temperate fen habitats, and is likely to complement alternative dispersal strategies. However, germination and establishment of species post-dispersal fate will be governed by a wide range of environmental conditions.

AB Background and aims Start and end of the growing season determine important ecosystem processes, but their drivers may differ above-and belowground, between autumn and spring, and between ecosystems.
   Here, we compare above-and belowground spring and autumn phenology, and their abiotic drivers (temperature, water level, and soil moisture) in four temperate ecosystems (beech forest, alder carr, phragmites reed, and sedge reed).
   Methods Root growth was measured in-situ with minirhizotrons and compared with aboveground phenology assessed with dendrometer data and NDVI.
   Results Synchrony of above- and belowground phenology depended on ecosystem. Onset of root growth was later than shoot growth in all three peatlands (12-33 days), but similar in the beech forest. The growing season ended earlier belowground in the two forested ecosystems (beech forest: 27 days, understory of the alder carr: 55 days), but did not differ in the phragmites reed. Generally, root production was correlated with soil temperature (especially in spring) and water level in the peatlands, while abiotic factors were less correlated with leaf activity or root production in either spring or autumn in the beech forest.
   Conclusions Root production on organic soils was ten times higher compared to the zonal broadleaf deciduous forest on mineral soils, highlighting the importance of peatlands. Belowground phenology cannot be projected from aboveground phenology and measuring root phenology is crucial to understand temporal dynamics of production and carbon fluxes.

AB Part of the missing sink in the global CO2 budget has been attributed to the positive effects Of CO2 fertilization and N deposition on carbon sequestration in Northern Hemisphere terrestrial ecosystems. The genus Sphagnum is one of the most important groups of plant species sequestrating carbon in temperate and northern bog ecosystems, because of the low decomposability of the dead material it produces. The effects of raised CO2 and increased atmospheric N deposition on growth of Sphagnum and other plants were studied in bogs at four sites across Western Europe. Contrary to expectations, elevated CO2 did not significantly affect Sphagnum biomass growth. Increased N deposition reduced Sphagnum mass growth, because it increased the cover of vascular plants and the tall moss Polytrichum strictum. Such changes in plant species composition may decrease carbon sequestration in Sphagnum-dominated bog ecosystems.

AB It has been predicted that Europe will experience a rise in temperature of 2.2-5.3 A degrees C within this century. This increase in temperature may lead to vegetation change along altitudinal gradients. To test whether vegetation composition has already changed in the recent decade due to current warming (and other concomitant environmental changes), we recorded plant species composition in 1995 and 2005/2006 in Swiss pre-alpine fen meadows (800-1,400 m a.s.l.). Despite no obvious changes in the management of these fens, overall, plant species richness (cumulative number of plant species at five plots per site) significantly increased over this period. This was mainly due to an increase in the number of thermophilous, rich-soil-indicator and shade-indicator species, which corresponded to increased community productivity and shading within the vegetation layer. In contrast, fen specialists significantly declined in species numbers. The strongest species shifts occurred at the lowest sites, which overall had a higher colonization rate by new species than did sites at higher altitudes. Vegetation change along the altitudinal gradient was also affected by different types of land management: early-flowering species and species with low habitat specificity had high colonization rates in grazed fens, especially at low altitudes.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems contain large amounts of carbon (C) and have the potential to significantly increase atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Peatlands are particularly important for C storage, although little is known about the effects of anthropogenic activities on C balance in these ecosystems. Sheep-grazing and rotational burning are widely practised on blanket peat moorlands in the United Kingdom. The effects of these activities on C sequestration in peat has been investigated with a long-term randomized block experiment with treatments: (a) grazed 1 unburnt; (b) grazed 1 burnt every ten years; (c) ungrazed 1 unburnt. C accumulation under these treatments was compared by identifying a chronologically synchronous horizon within the peat common to all treatment plots. This fixed point was defined by the 'take-off' in concentration of spheroidal carbonaceous particles and was supported by the record of charcoal fragments. There was no significant difference in recent C accumulation rates between lightly grazed and ungrazed plots. In contrast, after 30 years there was significantly less C stored in the blanket peat in plots which had been burned every ten years. The results indicate that light sheep-grazing at this site did not affect rates of C accumulation in blanket peat, but decadal burning of moorland reduced C sequestration.

AB Peatlands play an important role in global climate change through sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Climatedriven changes in the structure of fungal communities in boreal peatlands that favor saprotrophic fungi can substantially impact carbon dynamics and nutrient cycling in these crucial ecosystems. In a mesocosm study using a full factorial design, 100 intact peat monoliths, complete with living Sphagnum and above-ground vascular vegetation, were subjected to three climate change variables (increased temperature, reduced water table, and elevated CO2 concentrations). Peat litterbags were placed in mesocosms, and fungal communities in litterbags were monitored over 12 months to assess the impacts of climate change variables on peat-inhabiting fungi. Changes in fungal richness, diversity, and community composition were assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). While general fungal richness reduced under warming conditions, Ascomycota exhibited higher diversity under increased temperature treatments over the course of the experiment. Both increased temperature and lowered water table position drove shifts in fungal community composition with a strong positive effect on endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi (including one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tentatively identified as Barrenia panicia) and different groups of saprotrophs identified as Mortierella, Galerina, and Mycena. These shifts were observed during a predicted degradative succession in the decomposer community as different carbon substrates became available. Since fungi play a central role in peatland communities, increased abundances of saprotrophic fungi under warming conditions, at the expense of reduced fungal richness overall, may increase decomposition rates under future climate scenarios and could potentially aggravate the impacts of climate change.

AB Currently, more than 10,000 ha of fens have been rewetted to re-establish their function as nutrient sinks in NE Germany. However, field investigations reveal that porewater concentrations of P, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ammonium in rewetted fens are orders of magnitude larger than under pristine conditions. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the reasons behind enhanced P, organic carbon (OC) and ammonium mobilisation due to rewetting by means of a long-term incubation experiment. Highly, moderately and slightly decomposed peat of a drained fen (polder Zarnekow) was incubated under waterlogged conditions. A time course of concentrations of P, DOC, ammonium, sulphate and other dissolved substances was investigated by means of permanently installed dialysis samplers during 54 weeks of incubation. Simultaneously, the concentrations of these dissolved substances were investigated after rewetting of the field site. Before, and at the end of the incubation study, the amounts of bicarbonate-dithionite (BD) and NaOH soluble P and OC of incubated peat samples were determined by a sequential extraction procedure. The highest mobilisation of P, OC and ammonium occurred in the highly decomposed peat. Final concentrations of P, DOC and ammonium reached about 143 mu M, 46 and 1.9 mM, respectively. The initial sulphate concentrations in the rewetting experiment, as well as in the field investigations, were extremely high and ranged between 3 and 13 mM; however, a complete consumption of sulphate was only observed in highly decomposed peat. In conclusion, the reasons for enhanced P, OC and ammonium mobilisation are increased amounts of redox sensitive substances and enhanced availability of decomposable organic matter in the upper highly decomposed peat horizon. These results should be considered in future rewetting management strategies.

AB Monitoring is an essential step to assess vegetation trajectories post-restoration and ultimately evaluate success. In this paper, we compare two monitoring methods, the line-point intercept (LPI) and the permanent plot (PP) methods, for evaluating plant recovery of a restored cut-over peatland (8.5 ha), following a "moss layer transfer technique". We used the LPI method to estimate covers (from frequency measures) for each plant species using a systematic grid of approximately 5,700 points (every 3 m x 5 m). In parallel, 43 PP (3 m x 8 m) were established and used to evaluate plant covers. The post-restoration recovery of vegetation was assessed against a reference ecosystem encompassing the variation in species cover from natural undisturbed peatlands in the same region. For all plant groups considered, the LPI consistently showed higher cover estimates than the PP method. Discrepancy between the two methods was particularly evident for the Ericaceae group. A complementary sampling method, the line-intercept (LI), showed strong correlations with the visual estimations of Ericaceae covers (akin to PP), suggesting an overestimation from the LPI method. Most life form groups of the restored peatlands are developing a structure similar to the regional reference ecosystem 8 years post-restoration with the herb group being still most dissimilar. Indeed, when analyzing the temporal evolution of the different key peatland plant components, several are within the range of regional abundance values or moving positively towards range of cover abundance of the reference system such as Sphagnum cover, a key peat-accumulating plant group.

AB In order to understand the carbon fate of alpine peatlands under climate change, this study aimed to measure carbon accumulation in recent decades and that during the Holocene at seven representative peat sites on the Zoige Plateau using empirical peat core data (C-14 and C-137(s)) and modeling approaches. The observed apparent carbon accumulation rate over the past 50 years was 75 (35-123) g C m(-2) yr(-1), nearly four times that of 19 (7-30) g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the whole Holocene. With decomposition history included in consideration by using modeling approaches, the average expected peat carbon accumulation rate was still nearly 1.6 times that of the modeled net carbon uptake rate of peats accumulated over the whole Holocene, though exceptions were found for Denahequ and Hongyuan peat cores with extremely low water table levels. The newly accumulated peat carbon of the Zoige Plateau amounted to 0.4 Tg C yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g) during recent decades. Overall, the effect of climate warming on recent C accumulation of peatlands on the Zoige Plateau is dependent on their water conditions. The peat C storage on the alpine Plateau is threatened by human activities (drainage) and continuous climate change with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation which cause dryness of peatlands.

AB Palsa peats are unique northern ecosystems formed under an arctic climate and characterized by a high biodiversity and sensitive ecology. The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires.
   We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two palsa mires of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during the formation of the mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (delta C-13) with depth, due to preferential release of C-12 during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of recalcitrant organic substances during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in C-13.
   The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from aerobic mineralisation to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was C-14 dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving.

AB Comprehensive stratigraphic analyses of a standard peat profile laid on a large oligotrophic bog in the interfluve of Kas and Sym rivers, left tributaries of the Yenisei River, allowed reconstruction of local vegetation change and hydrological regime over a period of seven thousand years. The established three stages in vegetation succession in a local bog correspond to different degree of humidification. The development of bog ecosystem is found to be scarcely affected by regional climate. The process and rate of peat accumulation varied in different periods of the Holocene. The average rate of peat accumulation in the profile was 0.88 mm/year.

AB The object of research is syncryogenic Holocene strata on the coast of the Onemen Bay, 2 km from the town of Anadyr. In July 2017, the outcrop of the first marine terrace uncovered by strong storms was examined. The stratigraphy of the outcrop was represented mainly by sandy loam (5-7 m thick) covered by peat (1-1.5 m) and underlain by sand. Numerous ice wedges were opened in the upper part of this outcrop. Along with that another outcropping of transect of a lake-marsh basin represented by a peat bog of 2-2.5 m thick underlain by sandy loam was also investigated. Ice wedges occur below the polygonal trenches. The present-day narrow ice wedges were found in the upper part of the peat bog. Two representative fragments of both the above outcrops were thoroughly examined. Radiocarbon dating had shown that accumulation of peat on surface of the first marine terrace started in early Holocene (about 8 ka BP). Accumulation of peatland within the lake-marsh basin was also dated to the beginning of the Holocene (about 9 ka BP). In the middle of the Holocene, it was most likely interrupted as a result of thermokarst processes and bogging of the surface. Formation of peatlands in Chukotka during the Holocene is known to be accompanied by active growth of the ice wedges inside them, so the age of the wedges studied by us was estimated as the beginning of the Holocene. The analysis of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the Holocene and the modern ice wedges had allowed establishing mainly the atmospheric type of moisture feeding of the wedges (due to melted snow) and lack of noticeable isotope fractionation during the ice formation. It has been found that delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in the Holocene ice wedges were lower than in the modern wedges and snow by an average 2-3 and 7-12 parts per thousand, respectively. Paleotemperature reconstructions performed on the basis of isotope-oxygen data showed that the air temperature of the coldest winter month in the first half of the Holocene in the Onemen Bay area was lower than the present-day ones by an average 2-3 degrees C, which is in a good agreement with the trend of rising winter temperatures throughout the Chukotka Peninsula, as well as in other areas of Eastern Siberia and Alaska.

AB Loss of peatland vegetation is a global problem with negative consequences for the quality of catchment drainage waters. Vegetation can be lost through a combination of human and natural processes, leading to areas of exposed bare peat frequently accompanied by loss of surface moisture due to drainage or gullying. Waters draining such degraded peatlands are likely to have increased levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other nutrients, which can adversely impact the global climate, drinking water supplies and freshwater ecology. Consequently peatland revegetation efforts have become widespread.
   This paper presents results from a four-year study conducted to monitor the water quality impacts of a bare peat revegetation approach, which used landscape scale application of lime and fertiliser to encourage a grass nurse crop. This study considers an area of severely degraded blanket peat in the UK uplands, with large areas of bare peat prior to revegetation and provides the largest field dataset to date on the effects of this method on catchment run-off waters. Despite concerns that liming could increase DOC concentrations, the revegetation method is not shown to have this effect over the time period, and interestingly results in short term periods of suppression. The mechanism for this novel and unexpected finding merits further investigation and results in reduced DOC concentration, by up to 14 mg/l or 50% of control values, combined with periods of reduced colour carbon ratios. The data show that other nutrients were largely unaffected although rates of phosphate (PO43-) export were above recommended levels in the first year of application, suggesting initial phosphorus (P) application rates may require adjustment. Further investigation is required to consider the longer term effects of this restoration method as the vegetation matures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most previous studies on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands have focused on the boreal, subarctic, and tropical regions. Little is known about CH4 emissions from the alpine peatlands that are widely distributed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. To assess the magnitudes of daily and seasonal variations in CH4 flux in this area, and to identify the influential environmental factors, an eddy covariance (EC) tower with a LI-7700 open-path CH4 analyzer was established on Hongyuan Peatland. Total annual CH4 emission was 46.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2014, with emissions in the non-growing season accounting for 25% of the annual total. From May to September 2014, diurnal variation in CH4 emissions was observed, with CH4 fluxes varying between 0.15 and 0.25 mu molm(-2) s(-1). In contrast, during all other periods of 2014, no diurnal variation was observed, and CH4 flux varied below 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A clear seasonal pattern in CH4 exchange with small surges in CH4 emission appeared in soil thawing and freezing seasons. Wavelet analysis was applied to the continuous CH4 flux time series to explore temporal variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange during the growing season. On daily timescales, changes in CH4 flux are in phase with changes in air temperature, and influenced by friction velocity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). On weekly-to-monthly timescales, soil temperature can explain most of the variation in CH4 exchange. Though CH4 fluxes had no apparent correlation with water table level, fluxes were significantly (R-2 = 0.86) correlated with soil temperature measured at -25 cm depth, close to the water table level throughout the growing season, suggesting a synergistic effect of water table level and soil temperature on methane emission. This study highlights the need for continuous eddy covariance measurements and time series analysis approaches to adequately describe temporal variability in ecosystem CH4 exchange.

AB The evolution of peat deposits of the Vydrino bog (southern Baikal region) and concentration of elements in them are discussed. The bog peat massif more than 4 m in thickness formed mostly during the Holocene. The beginning of peat formation dates back to the late Allerod (13.1 ka). At present, the Vydrino bog is a biogeocoenosis of the high-moor type with a transitional peat deposit. We have established that the bog nonuniformly accumulated chemical elements during its formation. Concentration of Pb, Sn, Cd, Zn, and Sb in recent vegetation and in the upper layer of the peat bog is mainly due to forest fires and anthropogenic air pollution. The anomalous enrichment of peat with Zn and Cu in the Early Holocene (12.1-8.8 ka) horizons proceeded through the periodic inflow of thermal groundwater into the bottom part of the peat deposit. Authigenic Zn and Cu sulfides formed on the inner membrane of the cell wall of sphagnum moss. Geochemical modeling has shown that Zn and Cu sulfides can form abiotically.

AB Northern peatlands store 455 Pg of carbon-a third of the entire global carbon store. Carbon accumulates because phenolic inhibitors slow the rate of decomposition to below that of photosynthetic production. The disproportionate importance of phenolics in peatlands is related to the unique properties of waterlogged peat soils suppressing the activity of phenol oxidase; one of the few enzymes capable of breaking these inhibitors down (a role often referred to as the "enzymic latch"). This permits accumulation of phenolic compounds that are potent inhibitors of hydrolase enzymes-major agents in the breakdown of organic matter. In our study we investigate the importance of the molecular weight of phenolics on levels of inhibition of microbial decomposition in peat. We found the higher the molecular weight, of a phenolic compound, the greater its inhibitory effect on the breakdown of organic matter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Overland flow is an important component of peatland hydrology. Hydrological models of peatlands are being developed that require estimates of flow velocity and its controls. However, surprisingly little is known about overland flow velocities in peatlands. Some peatlands have also been drained using open ditches, and these need to be incorporated into flow models. This paper presents field data on the velocity of overland flow and drain flow in upland peatlands. The relationships between flow velocity, vegetation cover, slope, and water depth are explored. Sphagnum provided a significantly greater effective hydraulic roughness to overland flow than peatland grasses. In all cases, a significant break in process occurred for flows with water depths of around 1 cm so that there were two components of the roughness curve. This is consistent with partial submergence theory for very shallow flows where resistance increases with depth as the soil surface first becomes fully submerged. While each surface cover type should be considered separately, the results also suggest that a first-order estimate of Darcy-Weisbach roughness and mean velocity can be based on a single parameter for each surface cover. This paper presents an empirical overland flow velocity forecasting model that can be applied to peatlands. The model combines the partially submerged component for flows with water depths below 1 cm with the fully submerged component for flows with depths up to 5 cm, which are representative of the depths of flows that occur across peatlands.

AB In view of the sensitivity ofLiparis loeseliito changes in habitat conditions, we carried out a study with the aim to monitor population numbers, identify the individual features of theLiparis loeseliipopulation, analyse habitat conditions, identify threats and propose conservation measures to preserve the species. The investigations were conducted in seven unmanaged objects located in three Natura 2000 areas in eastern Poland. The results of this study provide a new insight intoLiparis loeseliiecology. The analysed populations inhabited some habitat types: extremely poor fen, transitional mire, rich fen, calcareous fen, spring-fed fen. The content of nutrients was similar in all the habitats. A CCA analysis revealed that the total carbon content, pH, and redox potential of the substrate determine differences between the habitats analysed. Juvenile individuals represented a maximum of 12% of the analysed populations and were the least abundant group of these plants. The flowering was primarily influenced by hydrological conditions. Based on the long-term observations reported in this article, it can be assumed that the species stands a chance of surviving at the localities analysed, provided that the habitat conditions do not change dramatically.

AB A rare, stand-replacing fire in northern Minnesota, USA provided the opportunity to compare the effects of wildfire and timber harvesting in two peatland forest communities, nutrient-poor black spruce (Picea mariana) bogs (BSB) and nutrient-rich tamarack (Larix laricina) swamps (RTS). We found the response between the two communities and their corresponding vegetation to be highly sensitive to different types and severity of disturbance, ranging from modest shifts in ground layer vascular plants and bryophyte species abundance, to wholesale plant community transformation resulting from the removal of the upper peat surface. Fire had a positive influence on black spruce regeneration within BSB sites, particularly areas experiencing lower levels of fire severity, with seedling densities significantly higher than harvest and control areas. Our results also suggest that ecosystem recovery will be rapid after low severity fire in these areas, given that localized areas of peat combustion created suitable microsites for black spruce seedling establishment ensuring this species will remain a component of the post-fire communities. In contrast, tamarack regeneration was only documented in harvested RTS sites. For BSB, there was spatial heterogeneity in peat consumption as a result of fire behavior interacting with varying moisture conditions throughout peat hummocks and hollows. Light to moderate burning created suitable black spruce seedbeds by reducing cover of Sphagnum moss and the dominant ericaceous shrub Rhododendron groenlandicum, and increasing the cover of pioneering mosses, such as Polytrichum strictum. In RTS sites, fire typically consumed the entire upper peat surface, resulting in homogenization of community composition and retrogression towards marsh-like conditions dominated by cattails (Typha spp.). These findings underscore the importance of accounting for post-fire microsite heterogeneity when developing silvicultural systems for emulating natural disturbance processes in conifer forests with a naturally accumulated surface peat layer. In addition, the state shifts observed in areas experiencing high severity fire suggest that increases in fire frequency and severity may create significant challenges to maintaining forested conditions in these areas, particularly in RTS.

AB Symbiotic relationships between N-2-fixing prokaryotes and their autotrophic hosts are essential in nitrogen (N)-limited ecosystems, yet the importance of this association in pristine boreal peatlands, which store 25 % of the world's soil (C), has been overlooked. External inputs of N to bogs are predominantly atmospheric, and given that regions of boreal Canada anchor some of the lowest rates found globally (1 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), biomass production is thought to be limited primarily by N. Despite historically low N deposition, we show that boreal bogs have accumulated approximately 12-25 times more N than can be explained by atmospheric inputs. Here we demonstrate high rates of biological N-2-fixation in prokaryotes associated with Sphagnum mosses that can fully account for the missing input of N needed to sustain high rates of C sequestration. Additionally, N amendment experiments in the field did not increase Sphagnum production, indicating that mosses are not limited by N. Lastly, by examining the composition and abundance of N-2-fixing prokaryotes by quantifying gene expression of 16S rRNA and nitrogenase-encoding nifH, we show that rates of N-2-fixation are driven by the substantial contribution from methanotrophs, and not from cyanobacteria. We conclude biological N-2-fixation drives high sequestration of C in pristine peatlands, and may play an important role in moderating fluxes of methane, one of the most important greenhouse gases produced in peatlands. Understanding the mechanistic controls on biological N-2-fixation is crucial for assessing the fate of peatland carbon stocks under scenarios of climate change and enhanced anthropogenic N deposition.

AB Based on the results of the National Survey of Peat Resources (1983-1985) and the investigation results on the peatlands of China, the storage and density of the organic carbon in the peatlands of China were estimated. The total organic carbon storage (OCS) of the peatlands in China, including bare peatlands and buried peatlands, are 1.503 x 10(9) t, unevenly distributed over 30 provincial level administrative units and 16 climatic zones. Peatland organic carbon storage (POCS) in Sichuan (6.45 x 10(8) t) and Yunnan provinces (2.91 x 10(8) t) is the highest, accounting for 62.29% of the total POCS. Humid zone of plateau has the highest POCS of 7.14 x 10(8) t, especially in the Zoig Plateau, where the POCS is 6.30 x 10(8) t, accounting for 41.92% of the total POCS of China. The organic carbon density (OCD) of the peatlands in China mostly ranges from 80 kg/m(3) to 140 kg/m(3), and the range of the maximum is 270-360 kg/m(3), and the minimum is less than 80 kg/m(3). Divided by the Yanshan Mountain, Taihang Mountains and Hengduan Mountains, the peatland oganic carbon density (POCD) is lower on the northwestern side than that on the southeastern side. Jiangxi Province has the highest POCD due to the ancient buried peatlands. The OCD of the bare peatlands is mostly in the range of 60-150 kg/m(3), and that of the buried peatlands is more than 100 kg/m(3). In the bare peatlands, the OCD generally increases from the surface layer to the below surface layer, and then decreases with the depth. Although the peatlands area in China is small, the OCS per unit area is far higher than the other soil types, so peatlands protection can effectively mitigate climate change.

AB Bogs and fens cover 6% and 21%, respectively, of the 140,329 km(2) Oil Sands Administrative Area in northern Alberta. Development of the oil sands has led to increasing atmospheric N deposition, with values as high as 17 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1); regional background deposition is <2 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1). Bogs, being ombrotrophic, may be especially susceptible to increasing N deposition. To examine responses to N deposition, over five years, we experimentally applied N (as NH4NO3) to a bog near Mariana Lake, Alberta, unaffected by oil sands activities, at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1), plus controls (no water or N addition). Increasing N addition: (1) stimulated N-2 fixation at deposition <3.1 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1), and progressively inhibited N-2 fixation as N deposition increased above this level; (2) had no effect on Sphagnum fuscum net primary production (NPP) in years 1, 2, and 4, but inhibited S. fuscum NPP in years 3 and 5; (3) stimulated dominant shrub and Picea mariana NPP; (4) led to increased root biomass and production; (5) changed Sphagnum species relative abundance (decrease in S. fuscum, increase in S. magellanicum, no effect on S. angustifolium); (6) led to increasing abundance of Rhododendron groenlandicum and Andromeda polifolia, and to vascular plants in general; (7) led to increasing shrub leaf N concentrations in Andromeda polifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Vaccinium oxycoccos, V. vitis-idaea, and Picea mariana; (8) stimulated cellulose decomposition, with no effect on S. fuscum peat or mixed vascular plant litter decomposition; (9) had no effect on net N mineralization rates or on porewater NH4+-N, NO3--N, or DON concentrations; and (10) had minimal effects on peat microbial community composition. Increasing experimental N addition led to a switch from new N being taken up primarily by Sphagnum to being taken up primarily by shrubs. As shrub growth and cover increase, Sphagnum abundance and NPP decrease. Because inhibition of N-2 fixation by increasing N deposition plays a key role in bog structural and functional responses, we recommend a N deposition critical load of 3 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) for northern Alberta bogs.

AB Sphagnum magellanicum has been viewed as being a predominantly circumpolar species in the northern hemisphere, but it occurs in the southern hemisphere and was originally described from the southern parts of Chile. It is an ecologically important species in mire ecosystems and has been extensively used as a model to study processes of growth, carbon sequestration and peat decomposition. Molecular and experimental studies have, however, revealed genetic structure within S. magellanicum, and morphological differences associated with these genetic groups. Here we describe Sphagnum divinum in Sphagnum subgenus Sphagnum (Sphagnaceae, Bryophyta) as a new species, based on molecular and morphological evidence. Sphagnum medium is reinstated as a distinct species and is epitypified. Consequently, a new species concept of S. magellanicum is presented including an epitypification. Important morphological characters to separate these three species in the field and under the microscope are presented. Ecology and distribution differ among the species; S. divinium has a wide habitat range including mire margin, forested peatlands and moist heaths, and a circumpolar distribution around the northern hemisphere. Sphagnum medium seems to be more restricted to ombrotrophic mire expanse habitats and shows an amphi-Atlantic distribution in the northern hemisphere. Sphagnum magellanicum has a very broad ecological niche in peatlands and is found in most mire habitats in Tierra del Fuego on the southern tip of South America.

AB Most of the carbon accumulated into peatlands is derived from Sphagnum mosses. During peatland development, the relative share of vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses in the plant community changes, which impacts ecosystem functions. Little is known on the successional development of functional plant traits or functional diversity in peatlands, although this could be a key for understanding the mechanisms behind peatland resistance to climate change. Here we aim to assess how functionality of successive plant communities change along the autogenic peatland development and the associated environmental gradients, namely peat thickness and pH, and to determine whether trait trade-offs during peatland succession are analogous between vascular plant and moss communities.
   We collected plant community and trait data on successional peatland gradients from post-glacial rebound areas in coastal Finland, Sweden and Russia, altogether from 47 peatlands. This allowed us to analyse the changes in community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity (diversity of traits) during peatland development.
   Our results show comparative trait trade-offs from acquisitive species to conservative species in both vascular plant and Sphagnum moss communities during peatland development. However, mosses had higher resistance to environmental change than vascular plant communities. This was seen in the larger proportion of intraspecific trait variation than species turnover in moss traits, while the proportions were opposite for vascular plants. Similarly, the functional diversity of Sphagnum communities increased during the peatland development, while the opposite occurred for vascular plants. Most of the measured traits showed a phylogenetic signal. More so, the species common to old successional stages, namely Ericacae and Sphagna from subgroup Acutifolia were detected as most similar to their phylogenetic neighbours.
   Synthesis. During peatland development, vegetation succession leads to the dominance of conservative plant species accustomed to high stress. At the same time, the autogenic succession and ecological engineering of Sphagna leads to higher functional diversity and intraspecific variability, which together indicate higher resistance towards environmental perturbations.

AB In the UK, large areas of peatland were drained for forestry in the second half of the 20th century. Ground surface subsidence and diminishing depth (thickness) of the peat layer can indicate compaction of the peat and/or carbon loss, but there are few long-term datasets from afforested UK peatlands. Here we present an unprecedented 50-year time series of surface subsidence from Bad a'Cheo Forest (Caithness, Scotland). This site was initially surveyed for ground level and peat depth in 1966, prior to drainage and plantation, with repeat surveys roughly 20 and 30 years after drainage. We re-surveyed the site 50 years after initial drainage, producing a unique long-term time series to assess change since these historical studies. Significant subsidence has taken place since drainage, with an average reduction of 56.8 cm (or 13 %) in the depth of peat under forest stands. Subsidence of the peat surface was rapid in the initial phase after drainage and planting but has progressively slowed, with relatively little change between the surveys of 1996 and 2016. These results imply carbon loss but do not demonstrate it directly, as compaction of the peat is also probable. The subsidence data demonstrate that drainage followed by afforestation led to a considerable reduction in thickness of the peat layer and show how this evolved through time.

AB Climate warming has inevitable impacts on the vegetation and hydrological dynamics of high-latitude permafrost peatlands. These impacts in turn determine the role of these peatlands in the global biogeochemical cycle. Here, we used six active layer peat cores from four permafrost peatlands in Northeast European Russia and Finnish Lapland to investigate permafrost peatland dynamics over the last millennium. Testate amoeba and plant macrofossils were used as proxies for hydrological and vegetation changes. Our results show that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), Russian sites experienced short-term permafrost thawing and this induced alternating dry-wet habitat changes eventually followed by desiccation. During the Little Ice Age (LIA) both sites generally supported dry hummock habitats, at least partly driven by permafrost aggradation. However, proxy data suggest that occasionally, MCA habitat conditions were drier than during the LIA, implying that evapotranspiration may create important additionaleco-hydrological feedback mechanisms under warm conditions. All sites showed a tendency towards dry conditions as inferred from both proxies starting either from ca. 100 years ago or in the past few decades after slight permafrost thawing, suggesting that recent warming has stimulated surface desiccation rather than deeper permafrost thawing. This study shows links between two important controls over hydrology and vegetation changes in high-latitude peatlands: direct temperature-induced surface layer response and deeper permafrost layer-related dynamics. These data provide important backgrounds for predictions of Arctic permafrost peatlands and related feedback mechanisms. Our results highlight the importance of increased evapotranspiration and thus provide an additional perspective to understanding of peatland-climate feedback mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In Central Europe, most bogs have a history of drainage and many of them are currently being restored. Success of restoration as well as greenhouse gas exchange of these bogs is influenced by environmental stress factors as drought and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We determined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of sites in the strongly decomposed center and less decomposed edge of the Pietzmoor bog in NW Germany in 2004. Also, we examined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of mesocosms from the center and edge before, during, and following a drainage experiment as well as carbon dioxide release from disturbed unfertilized and nitrogen fertilized surface peat. In the field, methane fluxes ranged from 0 to 3.8 mg m(-2) h(-1) and were highest from hollows. Field nitrous oxide fluxes ranged from 0 to 574 mu gm(-2) h(-1) and were elevated at the edge. A large Eriophorum vaginatum tussock showed decreasing nitrous oxide release as the season progressed. Drainage of mesocosms decreased methane release to 0, even during rewetting. There was a tendency for a decrease of nitrous oxide release during drainage and for an increase in nitrous oxide release during rewetting. Nitrogen fertilization did not increase decomposition of surface peat. Our examinations suggest a competition between vascular vegetation and denitrifiers for excess nitrogen. We also provide evidence that the von Post humification index can be used to explain nitrous oxide release from bogs, if the role of vascular vegetation is also considered. An assessment of the greenhouse gas release from nitrogen saturated restoring bogs needs to take into account elevated release from fresh Sphagnum peat as well as from sedges growing on decomposed peat. Given the high atmospheric nitrogen deposition, restoration will not be able to achieve an oligotrophic ecosystem in the short term.

AB Recent research suggested that iron oxidation may protect carbon from drought-accelerated decomposition in wetlands by promoting the sorption of lignin derivatives and decreasing phenolic oxidase activities. Here we examined whether this mechanism exists in organic-rich peatlands, which store over 30% of the world's soil carbon, by simulating drought and flooded conditions in peat soil with and without the addition of reduced iron. Our results suggest that iron does not protect carbon from decomposition in organic-rich peatlands, and in fact iron may exacerbate carbon decomposition via precipitation of phenolic compounds, which otherwise have been shown to inhibit microbial activity. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analyses of different types of peat soil from Minnesota to Peru showed evidence of iron-sulfide minerals (pyrite), indicating that some portion of the reduced iron in peatlands is effectively immobilized and therefore does not interact with the carbon cycle.

AB Palaeoecological investigations have been carried out at Wood Fen including pollen and macrofossil analysis. The vegetational history is related to other Fenland sites and is dated by radiocarbon. The base of the vegetational record is dominated by Quercus, Tilia, Corylus/Myrica, Taxus and Ulmus pollen, envisaged as components of the pre-fen woodland. A rise in the water table resulted in the accumulation of peat which has been correlated with the deposition of a marine/brackish clay ('fen clay') in the west of the basin dated at between 4150 BP and 3800 BP. A rise in the acidophilous flora occurred at 3615 BP represented by a change from monocotyledonous to Sphagnum peat and subsequent colonisation by Pinus. Loss-on-ignition data suggests that the colonization by pine was interrupted by a brief flooding episode and subsequently terminated by a major rise in the regional water level with an inferred date of between 3300 BP and 3000 BP, based on comparison with other sites. The high water table probably prevented development to raised bog although an acidophilous flora persisted until a return to eutrophic alder carr at the top of the profile.

AB The UK hosts 15-19% of global upland ombrotrophic (rain fed) peatlands that are estimated to store 3.2 billion tonnes of carbon and represent a critical upland habitat with regard to bio-diversity and ecosystem services provision. Net production is dependent on an imbalance between growth of peat-forming Sphagnum mosses and microbial decomposition by microorganisms that are limited by cold, acidic, and anaerobic conditions. In the Southern Pennines, land-use change, drainage, and over 200 years of anthropogenic N and heavy metal deposition have contributed to severe peatland degradation manifested as a loss of vegetation leaving bare peat susceptible to erosion and deep gullying. A restoration programme designed to regain peat hydrology, stability and functionality has involved re-vegetation through nurse grass, dwarf shrub and Sphagnum re-introduction. Our aim was to characterise bacterial and fungal communities, via high-throughput rRNA gene sequencing, in the surface acrotelm/mesotelm of degraded bare peat, long-term stable vegetated peat, and natural and managed restorations. Compared to long-term vegetated areas the bare peat microbiome had significantly higher levels of oligotrophic marker phyla (Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, TM6) and lower Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, together with much higher ligninolytic Basidiomycota. Fewer distinct microbial sequences and significantly fewer cultivable microbes were detected in bare peat compared to other areas. Microbial community structure was linked to restoration activity and correlated with soil edaphic variables (e.g. moisture and heavy metals). Although rapid community changes were evident following restoration activity, restored bare peat did not approach a similar microbial community structure to non-eroded areas even after 25 years, which may be related to the stabilisation of historic deposited heavy metals pollution in long-term stable areas. These primary findings are discussed in relation to bare peat oligotrophy, re-vegetation recalcitrance, rhizosphere-microbe-soil interactions, C, N and P cycling, trajectory of restoration, and ecosystem service implications for peatland restoration.

AB [1] We measured CO2 and CH4 exchange from the center of a Sphagnum-dominated permafrost collapse, through an aquatic moat, and into a recently burned black spruce forest on the Tanana River floodplain in interior Alaska. In the anomalously dry growing season of 2004, both the collapse and the surrounding burned area were net sinks for CO2, with a mean daytime net ecosystem exchange of - 1.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), while the moat was a CH4 source with a mean flux of 0.013 mu mol CH4 m(-2) s(-1). Regression analyses identified temperature as the dominant factor affecting intragrowing season variation in CO2 exchange and soil moisture as the primary control influencing CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions during the wettest portion of the growing season were four times higher than during the driest periods. If temperatures continue to warm, peatland vegetation will likely expand with permafrost degradation, resulting in greater carbon accumulation and methane emissions for the landscape as a whole.

TI Assessing benzene and toluene adsorption with peat depth: Implications
   on their fate and transport
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Peat; Dissolved-hydrocarbon; Adsorption; Competition; BTEX; Retardation
AB After a hydrocarbon spill in a peatland, dissolution of water-soluble compounds including benzene and toluene introduces a dissolved-phase plume to the peatland groundwater system, while the adsorption of these solutes onto the peat matrix restrains their distribution velocity. The adsorption of benzene and toluene and its dependency on peat depth, thus degree of decomposition, are investigated. The batch adsorption experiments revealed that benzene and toluene adsorption isotherms in peat are linear, with adsorption coefficients ranging from 16.2 to 48.7 L/kg and 31.6-8.7 L/kg, respectively. In a vertical peat profile benzene adsorption decreased with depth, while toluene adsorption increased. Considering toluene adsorption onto cellulose is significantly less than toluene adsorption onto humic substance, the increase in toluene adsorption was attributed to decreasing cellulose and increasing humic substances with depth. Negligible competition for adsorption was observed between benzene and toluene at the measured concentrations. The retardation factors of benzene and toluene ranged respectively from 3.5 to 10.7 and from 5.4 to 17.7, both increasing with depth. Higher retardation in deeper peat coupled with lower hydraulic conductivity will lead to a weaker solute velocity in deeper peat, thus preferential migration of these dissolved-phase contaminants in shallow layers. The results can help predict the behavior of dissolved hydrocarbons in peatlands after a hydrocarbon spill. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Using hydraulic conductivity and micropetrography to assess water flow
   through peat-containing wetlands
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE peat; hydraulic conductivity; porosity; micropetrography
AB This study focuses on research designed to assess water flow through peat-containing wetlands using hydraulic conductivity (HC) and micropetrography. These goals were accomplished by examining a series of cores taken in a transect through a peat-containing wetland located at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, and comparing these results with similar measurements from a selected suite of samples from a sample bank of highly characterized peats from other localities. The hydraulic conductivity of all samples was measured using ASTM method D4511-00. In addition, all samples were processed into oriented thin sections to determine porosity and other micropetrographic parameters. The results of this study demonstrate that differences in composition of peat layers found with depth in a peatland can affect water flow through the peatland. In general, the highest hydraulic conductivities tended to be found where the peat layers were high in fiber (fibric to hemic) and light in color (e.g., Nymphaea-dominated aquatic peats). For all core samples, a strong positive correlation was seen between hydraulic conductivity and percentages of macropores (pores >50 mum). The equation found in this study to produce the best prediction of hydraulic conductivity from macropore percentage was y = 0.0002x - 0.0027, where y = hydraulic conductivity (cm/s) and x = percentage of macropores. This study further suggests that the percentages of macropores in peats could be a very useful tool in developing models to predict both direction and speed of water transport through in situ, multi-layered peatlands; whereas either total porosity or macroporosity could be equally useful as predictors of hydraulic conductivity in: (a) the upper 25 cm of peatlands, (b) in shallow constructed wetlands where peats are not greatly compacted by burial, or (c) in peat-based artificial filtering systems. Some applications of these relationships might include predicting flow of ground water in engineered wetlands used for acid mine drainage, predicting past or present flow through more deeply buried peat deposits, or predicting flow of water or gases through lignites or other low rank coal beds.

AB We explored past critical transitions in a peatland located in N Poland using a densely dated ( x 44 C-14 dates and x26 Pb-210), high-resolution multi-proxy profile. A 6500-year record was supported by a very robust age-depth model. Changes in land use, climate and carbon sequestration in northern Poland were investigated using a range of biotic proxies. We determined critical transitions in the development of the mire which were dependent upon extrinsic drivers. The trophic status of the mire shifted several times during the last 6.5 millennia. The pattern of changes suggests that it was very sensitive to different changes in the peatland basin. We identified several factors which may have driven transitions between the bog and fen state as a response to catchment hydrology changes largely driven by human impact which overlapped with periods of climate change. We determined the vegetation threshold in relation to microcharcoal which could be related to fire intensity. Based upon microcharcoal and pollen analyses, the local plant community threshold for fire intensity was estimated to be ca 7500 microcharcoal particles/cm(2)/year. We discovered that this level was also an important tipping point for the divergence between plants positively (e.g. human indicators and Carpinus betulus) or negatively related (e.g. Quercus) related to fires. This local threshold was related to ecological changes related to the emergence and fall of subsequent human communities. The first pollen grains indicating human activities in the deposits are dated to ca. 6000 cal. BP. The strongest signal comes from the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Pre-Roman Period and the Roman Period. These past societies exploited natural resources and deforested the landscape while actively using fire. We inferred a distinct human influence since ca. 5000 cal. BP (the Neolithic) until the Early Middle Ages with strong evidence during the Bronze Age and Roman Period which demonstrates the high importance of the area until the transition from the tribe period to the Polish state. The peatland possibly recorded several climatic shifts, however the climate change signals were modified by human impacts which actively changed the environmental conditions. 2019 The Authors.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated large carbon (C) stocks since the last deglaciation and during past millennia they have acted as important atmospheric C sinks. However, it is still poorly understood how northern peatlands in general and Arctic permafrost peatlands in particular will respond to future climate change. In this study, we present C accumulation reconstructions derived from 14 peat cores from four permafrost peatlands in northeast European Russia and Finnish Lapland. The main focus is on warm climate phases. We used regression analyses to test the importance of different environmental variables such as summer temperature, hydrology, and vegetation as drivers for nonautogenic C accumulation. We used modeling approaches to simulate potential decomposition patterns. The data show that our study sites have been persistent mid- to late-Holocene C sinks with an average accumulation rate of 10.80-32.40g C m(-2) year(-1). The warmer climate phase during the Holocene Thermal Maximum stimulated faster apparent C accumulation rates while the Medieval Climate Anomaly did not. Moreover, during the Little Ice Age, apparent C accumulation rates were controlled more by other factors than by cold climate per se. Although we could not identify any significant environmental factor that drove C accumulation, our data show that recent warming has increased C accumulation in some permafrost peatland sites. However, the synchronous slight decrease of C accumulation in other sites may be an alternative response of these peatlands to warming in the future. This would lead to a decrease in the C sequestration ability of permafrost peatlands overall.

AB The capability of peatland ecosystems to regulate evapotranspiration (ET) following wildfire is a key control on the resilience of their globally important carbon stocks under future climatic conditions. Evaporation dominates post-fire ET, with canopy and sub-canopy removal restricting transpiration and increasing evaporation potential. Therefore, in order to project the hydrology and associated stability of peatlands to a diverse range of post-fire weather conditions and future climates the regulation of evaporation must be accurately parameterised in peatland ecohydrological models. To achieve this, we measure the surface resistance (r(s)) to evaporation over the growing season one year post-fire within four zones of a boreal peatland that burned to differing depths, relating r(s) to near surface soil tensions. We show that the magnitude and temporal variability in r(s) varies with burn severity. At the peatland scale, r(s) and near-surface tension correlates non-linearly. However, at the point scale no relationship was evident between temporal variations in r(s) and near-surface tension across all burn severities; in part due to the limited fluctuation in near-surface tensions and the precision of r(s) measurements. Where automated measurements enabled averaging of errors, the relationship between near-surface tension and r(s) switched between periods of strong and weak correlation within a burned peat hummock. This relationship, when strong, deviated from that obtained under steady state laboratory conditions; increases in r(s) were more sensitive to fluctuations in near-surface tension under dynamic field conditions. Calculating soil vapour densities directly from near-surface tensions is shown to require calibration between peat types and provides little if any benefit beyond the derivation of empirical relationships between r(s) and measured soil tension. Thus, we demonstrate important spatiotemporal fluctuations in post-fire r(s) that will be key to regulating post-fire peatland hydrology, but highlight the complex challenges in effectively parameterising this important underlying control of near-surface tensions within hydrological simulations.

AB Peatlands store a significant amount of terrestrial organic carbon in plant biomass and soils. The Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) project is a warming and elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) experiment designed to test how the carbon sequestration and storage capacity of peatland ecosystems will respond to climate change. Here, we report changes in the vascular plant community that have occurred during the first five years of SPRUCE. We tracked species composition, diversity, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in chambers warmed at a wide range of temperatures (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75, +9 degrees C), and two CO2 levels (similar to 400 [ambient] and 900 parts per million). We observed an increase in aboveground vascular plant biomass accumulation, due primarily to an increase in shrub abundance. Overall species diversity decreased substantially, likely due in part to shading by increases in shrub density. The main driver of change in the vascular plant community was temperature, with minimal effects of CO2 evident. These results indicate an overall increase in ANPP with warming, but highlight the importance of interactions between direct (warming) and indirect (competition) effects in determining how boreal peatlands will respond to climate change.

DE Groundwater level; pipe drainage; soil respiration
AB Reed canary grass (RCG) can be a suitable energy crop on abandoned agricultural peatland as it can be harvested for more than 10 years without re-establishment, and nutrient recycling to rhizomes lowers the fertilizer demand. A field near Mala in Sweden was restored by improving drainage and sowing RCG in 2010. In the first growing season, CO2 emissions from the soil were lower and groundwater level and soil water content higher for the RCG field than for a nearby unrestored field. Possible reasons were peat compaction by agricultural machinery in the restored field and higher transpiration and respiration from vegetation in the unrestored field. In the second growing season, the groundwater level was raised in some restored plots and CO2 emissions and RCG growth were found to be unaffected by this practice.

AB A range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been identified, and regularities of their vertical distribution in the peatland of hummock-hollow complexes in the southern tundra - forest tundra and northern tundra - southern tundra ecotones of the European Arctic zone have been determined. Benzo[ghi]perylene, naphthalene, pyrene, fluorene, phenanthrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene are displayed most in the peatlands under study. Regarding the peatland profile the vertical polyarene distribution is similar - in 150-175 cm permafrost layers (site 1) and 50(70)-210(250) cm layers (site 2), and on the border between the active layer and permafrost 35-50(60) cm (site 1) and 30(42) - 50 cm (site 2) a significant increase of HCO-accumulated PAHs weight fraction is observed. PAHs content maximums in tundra peatland horizons are associated both with 4-, 5- and 6-nuclear structures at both sites under the analysis, and with a larger amount of 2- and 3-nuclear polyarenes in the peatlands on the northern tundra-southern tundra ecotone. Aeration-exposed seasonally thawing peatland layers are subject to continuous formation of primarily light 2- and 3-nuclear PAHs of natural origin resulting from microbiological decomposition of plant residues, which are subsequently involved in equilibrium cycles of chemical and biochemical transformation, with their total capacity remaining almost unchanged and constituting ?200-500 ng/g. Owing to low productivity of plant communities and absence of tree vegetation in the seasonally thawed layer, accumulation of the sum of 4-, 5- and 6-nuclear PAHs weakens significantly. One can detect dependencies between individual PAHs and the botanic composition of peat through higher weight fraction of 4-, 5- and 6-nuclear polyarenes being lignin transformation products generated more as the share of tree vegetation grows. The PAHs composition is a paleoclimatic marker reflecting adequately both changing paleovegetation stages and the degree of peat decomposition.

AB A three-dimensional model, based on numerous vertical and horizontal C-14 datings and GIS simulation from a concentrically domed mire in southern Finland, demonstrates considerable variation in actual (net) rate of carbon accumulation (ARCA) through time. Lateral growth between 9000 and 3000 yr ago accounts for only 25% of the total carbon sequestration, whereas bog formation after ombrotrophication is responsible for the remaining 75%. On the other hand, the most rapid increase in landscape CH4 fur occurred between 4500 and 3000 yr ago, the period of the fastest horizontal growth. In addition to autecological factors, a climatic shift towards cooler and wetter conditions is a plausible mechanism for maintaining accelerated carbon accumulation.

AB A number of samples from a deep peat bog in Tierra del Fuego were analyzed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in order to extract parameters that might be used to interpret the peat chemistry in terms of vegetation change, anaerobic and aerobic decomposition, and fire incidence. The choice of parameters was based on factor analysis of 177 pyrolysis products, quantified for 13 samples, separated into extract and residue, as well as the total samples. Factor analysis of extracts, residues and total samples yielded similar classifications in terms of vegetation and decomposition. Pyrolysis products and ratios that most clearly differentiated samples were used to interpret the depth profile. Although interpretation was not always straightforward, indications of parameters to describe vegetation shifts, aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, and fire largely coincided. These parameters will be used in a forthcoming study for a more complete interpretation of the peat profile. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The content and chemical composition of organic oil-soluble constituents (lipids) of the snow cover, peat and water of the Bakchar bog, which is the typical bog for southern taiga (the northeastern spurs of the Great Vasyugan Mire) were explored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As shown, the composition of lipids in waters is exposed to seasonal fluctuations and formed due to compounds generated in a peat deposit and falling with atmospheric precipitation, and also to components of plants. Lipid content is linked to level dynamics of waters, the quantity of fallen atmospheric precipitation, and air temperature. The amount of lipidic components in waters is maximum in the beginning of spring; their composition is almost identical to peat compounds. When water is diluted with melting snow, lipid content is reduced. Herewith, the fraction of the main groups of lipids: n-alkanes, and n-aldehydes, and also cyclic mono- and sesquiterpenoids present in plants of the early growing season in the snow is increased. An increase in air temperature and a low amount of atmospheric precipitation lead to an increased fraction of lipids produced by water plants and compounds that are a part of conifer resin (dehydroabietic acid and its derivatives) in water. When the amount of rain precipitation is increased, the diversity of composition and lipid content are reduced in water; C-25 and C-27 n-alkanes, and also carboxylic acids are prevailing in this case. A reduction of the amount of atmospheric precipitation at the end of summer is accompanied by an increase in the content of triterpenoids, steroids, long-chain esters of carboxylic acid, and tocopherol in water. Furthermore, betulin and its derivatives typical for birch, and also saturated oil hopane derivatives fallen to water resulting from carrying out technical works appear at the survey plot. A month later, in September, human activity products are removed from the waters; the content of biological triterpenoids, and among them, alpha- and beta-amyrin derivatives enriched with red bilberry and cranberry is drastically increased.

AB Spring phenophases such as the beginning of leaf unfolding, measured in the Irish gardens of the International Phenological Garden (IPG) network, indicate an earlier spring occurrence hence a longer growing season. However, these measurements are limited to selected species of trees at a few point locations in the southern half of the country. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology, based on satellite remote sensing, to measure the vegetation start of season (SOS) across the whole island of Ireland on an annual basis, complementary to existing ground-based methods.
   The SOS metric was extracted for each year in a 7-year time series of 10-day composited, 1.2 km reduced resolution MERIS Global Vegetation Index (MGVI) data from 2003 to 2009, based on curve fitting, using the time series analysis software, TIMESAT. Spatio-temporal variability in the SOS was detected across the island on an annual basis and highlighted in a series of anomaly images showing variation from the 7-year mean SOS. The 2006 SOS was late across the island while there were strong geographical gradients to the SOS anomalies in 2009 when it occurred later in the south and earlier in the north. There was a mix of early and late anomaly values throughout the country in the other years.
   Qualitatively, the spatial patterns in the timing of the SOS were related to the distribution of landcover types as indicated by the CORINE Land Cover map (CLC). Three statistically separable groups of CLC classes were derived from differences in the SOS, namely agricultural and forest land cover types, peat bogs, and natural and semi-natural vegetation types. These groups demonstrated that vegetation in cultivated areas like pastures has a significantly earlier SOS than in areas of unmanaged vegetation such as peat bogs. An initial climate analysis indicated that an anomalously cold winter and spring in 2005/2006 delayed the 2006 SOS countrywide; while a cold winter followed by a mild spring in 2009 caused considerable spatial variability in the 2009 SOS across the country, ranging from later SOS in the south to early SOS in the north.
   This study has demonstrated the utility of 10-day MGVI composites for derivation of an SOS metric which can be used as an indicator of spatial variability in vegetation seasonality and has highlighted how SOS varies according to landcover type. The availability of longer time series in the future will allow more focused studies on the sensitivity of the SOS metric to changes in climate as well as short term weather events.

AB Questions Which environmental variables are most important in determining plant species composition in subarctic springs? Do observed patterns differ between typical wetland and general matrix-derived species? Location Helocrenic (seepage) springs, Northern Norway. Methods We sampled 49 helocrenic spring sites, measuring environmental variables (water temperature, water pH, electrical conductivity, discharge volume, geographic position) and recording all species present. We performed a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA) to determine the relative importance of water quality, spatial, and climatic variables for patterns in species composition and to compare the differences in these patterns between wetland and matrix-derived species. Results We found that climatic and water quality variables were almost equally important in determining species composition in subarctic springs, with climatic variables explaining 26.62% of variation in species composition and water quality variables explaining 26.14%. Spatial variables explained the least variation (21.53%). When looking at the variables individually, altitude (10.93%) and mean summer temperature (9.25%) explained the most variation. The trend was the same for matrix-derived species and wetland species, with climatic variables explaining the most variation (matrix-derived: 27.26%; wetland: 24.42%), followed by water quality (matrix-derived: 26.40%; wetland: 24.13%) and spatial variables (matrix-derived: 24.87%; wetland: 16.27%). The main difference between matrix-derived species and typical wetland species was that the spatial variables explained less variation for wetland species. Conclusions The close relationship of species composition (total vegetation as well as separated into wetland and matrix-derived species) with climatic and water quality conditions indicates a sensitivity of subarctic springs to future climate change. In combination with altitude, which was found to be the most important individual variable, it is likely that the future distribution of spring species tracking climate change will be limited by the occurrence of suitable spring habitats, especially at high altitudes.

AB Transpiration of a central European endemic tree species, Pinus rotundata Link, growing on a wooded peat bog in the TA (TM) eboA Basin, Czech Republic, was studied in 1999-2000. Transpiration was measured by sap flow techniques (heat field deformation method) on individual trees and scaled up to stand level. The radial patterns of sap flow density showed narrow peaks in the outer part of the xylem, sapwood accounted for 47-60% of the xylem radius and 72-84% of the xylem basal area. Adult trees tolerated well both short-term flooding during the growing season and drawdown of the water table to a depth of 60 cm below ground level. The maximum and mean daily transpiration rates were 3.0 and 1.8 mm per day, and were thus similar to published data for Scots pine. The seasonal total transpiration (25 April-20 October 2000, 180 days) amounted to 322 mm, or 62% of the potential evapotranspiration over this period. This canopy transpiration was compensated by 319 mm of precipitation. The difference between the accumulated precipitation and the accumulated transpiration (derived from seasonal sap flow measurements) closely mimicked the seasonal course of the water table.

AB Landscape- and community-level CO2 measurements were made at a subarctic sedge fen near Churchill Manitoba during the 1997 growing season. Climatic conditions were warmer and drier than the 30-y normal. Landscape-scale micrometeorological measurements indicated that the wetland gained 49 g CO2 m(-2) during the growing season. Chamber-scale measurements from the main vegetation community types showed that small hummocks (Carex spp. sites) dominated the CO2 exchange, yielding an effective sealing factor of 70%. Scaled parameters of two algorithms describing photosynthesis and respiration for each community type show strong similarity to those derived at the landscape level. Scaling photosynthesis, respiration, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange from the community to landscape-level over the season is within the maximum probable error of each methodological approach and helps substantiate the 1997 CO2 budget. We explore the equilibrium response of net ecosystem CO2 exchange of this fen to climatic change by examining the feedback of water table position on vegetation distribution and nitrogen availability. Based on the effective scaling factors computed for each community type, we hypothesize that a small decrease in mean water table position could nearly triple the net uptake of CO2 at this wetland.

AB The surface pattern of vegetation influences the composition and humification of peat laid down during the development of a bog, producing a subsurface hydrological structure that is expected to affect both the rate and pattern of water flow. Subsurface peat structures are routinely derived from the inspection of peat cores. However, logistical limits on the number of cores that can be collected means that the horizontal extent of these structures must be inferred. We consider whether subsurface patterns in peat physical properties can be mapped in detail over large areas with ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and complex conductivity by comparing geophysical measurements with peat core data along a 36 m transect through different microhabitats at Caribou Bog, Maine. The geophysical methods show promise. Peat horizons produced radar reflections because of changes in the volumetric moisture content. Although these reflections could not be directly correlated with the peat core data, they were related to the depth-averaged peat properties which varied markedly between the microhabitats. Well-decomposed peat below a hollow was characterized by a discontinuous sequence of chaotic wavy reflections, while distinct layering of the peat below an area of hummocks coincided with a pattern of parallel planar reflections. The complex conductivity survey showed spatial variation in the real and imaginary conductivities which resulted from changes in the pore water conductivity; peat structures may also have influenced the spatial pattern in the complex conductivity. The GPR and complex conductivity surveys enabled the developmental history of the different microhabitats along the studied transect to be inferred.

AB Questions: Does succession of rewetted species-poor fen grasslands display similar trends when different water levels, sites and regions are compared? Will restoration targets as peat growth and waterfowl diversity be reached?
   Location: Valley fen of the river Peene (NE-Germany) and the Hansag fen (Lake Neusiedler See, NW-Hungary).
   Methods: Analysis of permanent plot data and vegetation maps over a period of up to seven years of rewetting. The general relations between newly adjusted water levels and changes in dominance of helophytic key species during early succession are analysed considering four rewetting intensities (water level classes) and eight vegetation types (Phalaris arundinacea type, Carex type, Glyceria maxima type, Phragmites australis type, Typha type, aquatic vegetation type, open water type and miscellaneous type).
   Results: The initial period of balancing the site conditions and vegetation is characterised by specific vegetation types and related horizontal vegetation structures. Most vegetation types displayed similar trends within the same water level class when different sites and regions were compared. A significant spread of potentially peat forming vegetation with dominance of Carex spp. or Phragmites as desired goal of restoration was predominantly restricted to long-term shallow inundated sites (water level median in winter: 0-30 cm above surface). Open water patches as bird habitats persisted mainly at permanent inundated sites (water level median in winter > 60 cm above surface).
   Conclusions: Site hydrology appeared as a main force of secondary succession. Thus the rewetting intensity and restoration targets have to be balanced adequately.

AB Cutover peatlands are often rapidly colonised by pioneer plant species, which have the potential to affect key ecosystem processes such as carbon (C) turnover. The aim of this study was to investigate how plant cover and litter type affect fungal community structure and litter decomposition in a cutover peatland. Intact cores containing Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium, Calluna vulgaris and bare soil were removed and a mesh bag with litter from only one of each of these species or fragments of the moss Sphagnum auriculatum was added to each core in a factorial design. The presence or absence of live plants, regardless of the species, had no effect on mass loss, C, nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) concentrations of the litter following 12 months of incubation. However, there was a very strong effect of litter type on mass loss and concentrations of C, N and P between most combinations of litter. Similarly. plant species did not affect fungal community structure but litter type had a strong effect, with significant differences between most pairs of litter types. The data suggest that labile C inputs via rhizodeposition from a range of plant functional types that have colonised cutover bogs for 10-15 years have little direct effect on nutrient turnover from plant litter and in shaping litter fungal community structure. In contrast, the chemistry of the litter they produce has much stronger and varied effects on decomposition and fungal community composition. Thus it appears that there is distinct niche differentiation between the fungal communities involved in turnover of litter versus rhizodeposits in the early phases of plant succession on regenerating cutover peatlands.

AB The field- and bottom-layer vegetation changed substantially when Salix spp. and Alnus incana were planted, fertilized and irrigated on a Sphagnum peat bog. Of the original peat-bog species, only Eriophorum vaginatum was favoured. Only 20 of the original 39 peat-bog species remained after five years. New species like Chamaenerion angustifolium, Epilobium adenocaulon and E. palustre invaded the bog and became dominant. 20 new species were recorded in the field layer. The change was very rapid and after five years no stabilization could be observed. There was a correlation between the nutritional status of the peat and the composition of vegetation and also between the amount of fertilizers given and the composition of vegetation.

AB Carbon (C) modeling and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in peatlands are dependent on the distribution and productivity of vegetation in a system with a high degree of spatial variability, often linked to the position of the water table. We tested the hypothesis that at a fine-scale (tens of metres) water table position exerts a strong control on species abundance, plant biomass, particularly photosynthetically active tissues, leaf area index (LAI), and areal foliar N and chlorophyll at Mer Bleue, a cool temperate peatland in eastern Canada. Total aboveground biomass ranged from 147 to 1011 g center dot m(-2), with shrubs contributing between 42% and 72% of the total in the transects. We found significant (P < 0.05) positive relationships between foliar and total vascular plant biomass and mean water table position, and significant decreases in the shrub foliar:woody biomass ratio and moss biomass with a lower water table. However, there was no significant relationship between water table position and photosynthetically active tissues (vascular plant leaves and moss capitulum), ranging from 114 to 672 g center dot m(-2)) and the areal mass of N in these tissues, ranging from 1.5 to 6.7 g center dot m(-2). Multivariate analyses of vegetation and environmental data showed that species distribution could be explained by both water table and chemistry gradients and that unimodal rather than linear responses best described the species and water table relationships. LAI ranged from 0.1 to over 3 and was correlated with both water table position and with vascular foliar biomass. Percent cover of shrubs was correlated with foliar biomass and LAI. Our results suggest that the less labour-intensive estimates of percent cover can be used to predict the vascular plant foliar biomass and LAI measurements. The lack of relationship between photosynthetically active tissues, tissue N concentrations, and water table may also explain the surprising lack of spatial variability in peak growing season eddy flux net ecosystem CO2 exchange in three different areas of the peatland.

Most studies indicate that enhanced temperature and microbial activities result in a rise of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a consequence of higher peat decomposition. Few of them, however, have investigated the impact of in situ experimental warming on DOC response.
   We studied the response of DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), phenol oxidase, and fluorescein diacetate activities (FDA) to a 3-year in situ experimental warming using open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland.
   No significant warming of soil was recorded, implying that the simultaneous decrease in DOC and DON and the rise in FDA at the depths of 25 and 40 cm were not caused by the direct effect of OTCs on water temperature, but might instead have been mediated by plant root exudates. The water chemistry suggests that DOC production was compensated by in situ mineralization. We hypothesize that an increased hydrolysis of organic matter (OM) was counterbalanced by the mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and that microorganisms preferentially used labile compounds originating from increased root exudates.
   This trade-off between production of DOC through hydrolysis and consumption in the process of mineralization shows (1) the limitation of using only DOC as an indicator of the sensitivity of peat decomposition to climate warming and (2) the need to improve our understanding of the indirect impact of root exudates.

AB Peat mosses (Sphagnum) largely govern carbon sequestration in Northern Hemisphere peatlands. We investigated functional traits related to growth and decomposition in Sphagnum species. We tested the importance of environment and phylogeny in driving species traits and investigated trade-offs among them. We selected 15 globally important Sphagnum species, representing four sections (subgenera) and a range of peatland habitats. We measured rates of photosynthesis and decomposition in standard laboratory conditions as measures of innate growth and decay potential, and related this to realized growth, production, and decomposition in their natural habitats. In general, we found support for a trade-off between measures of growth and decomposition. However, the relationships are not strong, with r ranging between 0.24 and 0.45 for different measures of growth versus decomposition. Using photosynthetic rate to predict decomposition in standard conditions yielded R-2 = 0.20. Habitat and section (phylogeny) affected the traits and the trade-offs. In a wet year, species from sections Cuspidata and Sphagnum had the highest production, but in a dry year, differences among species, sections, and habitats evened out. Cuspidata species in general produced easily decomposable litter, but their decay in the field was hampered, probably due to near-surface anoxia in their wet habitats. In a principal components analysis, PCA, photosynthetic capacity, production, and laboratory decomposition acted in the same direction. The species were imperfectly clustered according to vegetation type and phylogeny, so that some species clustered with others in the same section, whereas others clustered more clearly with others from similar vegetation types. Our study includes a wider range of species and habitats than previous trait analyses in Sphagnum and shows that while the previously described growth-decay trade-off exists, it is far from perfect. We therefore suggest that our species-specific trait measures offer opportunities for improvements of peatland ecosystem models. Innate qualities measured in laboratory conditions translate differently to field responses. Most dramatically, fast-growing species could only realize their potential in a wet year. The same species decompose fast in laboratory, but their decomposition was more retarded in the field than that of other species. These relationships are crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of peatland communities.

AB Northern peatlands have been a persistent natural carbon sink since the Last Glacial Maximum. The continued growth and expansion of these carbon-rich ecosystems could offset a large portion of anthropogenic carbon emissions before the end of the present interglacial period. Here we used an impeded drainage model and gridded data on the depth to bedrock and the fraction of histosol-type soils to evaluate the limits to the growth of northern peatland carbon stocks. Our results show that the potential carbon stock in northern peatlands could reach a total of 875 +/- 125 PgC before the end of the present interglacial, which could, as a result, remove 330 +/- 200 PgC of carbon from the atmosphere. We argue that northern peatlands, together with the oceans, will potentially play an important role in reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the next 5000 years.

AB Soil temperature is a major factor affecting organic matter decomposition and thus, global warming may accelerate decomposition processes. However, it remains unclear whether the effects will be similar in climatically different regions. The effects of soil temperatures of 5, 10 and 15 degrees C on the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles were assessed in a 1-year (360 days) growth chamber experiment. Intact peat cores from two climatically different peatland sites (southern and northern Finland) were used as the incubation environments. Needles were incubated in litter bags beneath the living moss layer, and mass loss and nitrogen (N) concentration were determined at 60-day intervals. The rate of mass loss from the needles over time was clearly lower in the 5 degrees C treatment than at the higher temperatures. Mass loss was strongly related to the accumulated soil temperature sum. In temperatures higher than 5 degrees C, mass losses were higher in the northern peat. Also, the limit value of decomposition (asymptotic maximum mass loss) was slightly higher in the northern peat (92%), than in the southern peat (87%). The N concentration increased up to a mass loss of 50-60%, whereupon it decreased, while the amount of N (as a percentage of the original amount) remained unchanged until a mass loss of 50-60%, whereupon it decreased linearly. It seems that increasing soil temperatures may result in slightly higher rates of needle litter mass loss and consequent N release in northern peat than in southern peat. The faster decomposition in higher temperatures in the northern peat, together with the slightly higher maximum mass loss value, imply that with climatic warming, susceptibility of boreal peatlands for becoming sources of carbon to the atmosphere may increase towards north.

AB The current paradigm in peatland ecology is that the organic matter inputs from plant photosynthesis (e.g. moss litter) exceed that of decomposition, tipping the metabolic balance in favour of carbon (C) storage. Here, we investigated an alternative hypothesis, whereby exudates released by microalgae can actually accelerate C losses from the surface waters of northern peatlands by stimulating dissolved organic C (DOC) decomposition in a warmer environment expected with climate change. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the biodegradability of fen DOC in a factorial design with and without algal DOC in both ambient (15 degrees C) and elevated (20 degrees C) water temperatures during a laboratory bioassay. When DOC sources were evaluated separately, decomposition rates were higher in treatments with algal DOC only than with fen DOC only, indicating that the quality of the organic matter influenced degradability. A mixture of substrates (1/2 algal DOC + 1/2 fen DOC) exceeded the expected level of biodegradation (i.e. the average of the individual substrate responses) by as much as 10%, and the magnitude of this effect increased to more than 15% with warming. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), a proxy for aromatic content, was also significantly higher (i.e. more humic) in the mixture treatment than expected from SUVA(254) values in single substrate treatments. Accelerated decomposition in the presence of algal DOC was coupled with an increase in bacterial biomass, demonstrating that enhanced metabolism was associated with a more abundant microbial community. These results present an alternative energy pathway for heterotrophic consumers to breakdown organic matter in northern peatlands. Since decomposition in northern peatlands is often limited by the availability of labile organic matter, this mechanism could become increasingly important as a pathway for decomposition in the surface waters of northern peatlands where algae are expected to be more abundant in conditions associated with ongoing climate change.

AB Loss and degradation of wetlands is now one of the most important environmental issues on a global scale. Previous research based on analyses of cartographic materials allow for quantification of changes in wetland area in recent centuries. The results of lithological research of peat cores, reported in this publication, have established that the processes of anthropogenic loss of wetlands can be much older and in the Klodnica valley were initiated in the first millennium BC. As a result of increased mineral sedimentation accompanying soil erosion some peatlands have been fossilized whilst the area of others has been reduced. In total, the surface area of peat-forming wetlands in the bottom of the Klodnica valley decreased by over 60% between the time of the Lusatian Culture settlement and the Middle Ages. Post-peatland habitats are recently used for agricultural or colonized by non-peat forming vegetation. These processes have played a more important role in the degradation of peatland ecosystems than the direct human impact in historic times. Changes in hydrographic networks, land drainage and regulation of water levels in rivers and canals in the last century have contributed to further reducing the wetland areas by almost 50% compared to the 1880s. These processes, however, have mainly affected ephemeral non-peat forming wetlands.

AB A small peatland catchment in eastern Finland was monitored for runoff and export of dissolved organic carbon. To exemplify the response of a peatland under years of different meteorological conditions, data from one very dry and one wet growing season are presented. Runoff was 194 and 387 mm, and DOC export was 4.2 and 11.3 gC m(-2) in the dry and wet year respectively. Analysis of the hydrographs showed that in both years most runoff and DOC export was generated during peak flow events, with low baseflow in the intermediate periods. Runoff response to rain events was strongest under a high water table in the spring and autumn, with a summer runoff minimum. The effect of drought on runoff occurred only after mid June when the effects of snowmelt had dissipated. Snowmelt therefore dominated DOC export in the dry year (61%) but contributed much less (29%) in the wet year. The relationship between runoff and the water table was highly similar in both years. Any variation that was observed herein was potentially related to a superficial subsidence of the peat surface under drier summer conditions and to raised spring water levels, causing restricted drainage due to flooding. The observed variation of DOC concentrations in both years generally had a limited impact on DOC export. During peak runoff events, concentrations dropped proportionally to the magnitude Of the events. This decrease in available DOC is argued to be caused by a dominance of leaching over supply and production and by the specific hydraulic characteristics of the peatland surface. DOC concentrations were some 25% higher under drought conditions. These elevated concentrations were dispelled by spring snowmelt of the next year, demonstrating that a winter snowpack in boreal regions may be instrumental in limiting the longer term hydrological and biochemical effects of a drought.

AB Peatlands store substantial amounts of carbon and are vulnerable to climate change. We present a modified version of the Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) land surface model for simulating the hydrology, surface energy, and CO2 fluxes of peatlands on daily to annual timescales. The model includes a separate soil tile in each 0.5 degrees grid cell, defined from a global peatland map and identified with peat-specific soil hydraulic properties. Runoff from non-peat vegetation within a grid cell containing a fraction of peat is routed to this peat soil tile, which maintains shallow water tables. The water table position separates oxic from anoxic decomposition. The model was evaluated against eddy-covariance (EC) observations from 30 northern peatland sites, with the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) being optimized at each site. Regarding short-term day-to-day variations, the model performance was good for gross primary production (GPP) (r(2) = 0.76; Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency, MEF = 0.76) and ecosystem respiration (ER, r(2) = 0.78, MEF = 0.75), with lesser accuracy for latent heat fluxes (LE, r(2) = 0.42, MEF = 0.14) and and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE, r(2) = 0.38, MEF = 0.26). Seasonal variations in GPP, ER, NEE, and energy fluxes on monthly scales showed moderate to high r(2) values (0.57-0.86). For spatial across-site gradients of annual mean GPP, ER, NEE, and LE, r(2) values of 0.93, 0.89, 0.27, and 0.71 were achieved, respectively. Water table (WT) variation was not well predicted (r(2) < 0.1), likely due to the uncertain water input to the peat from surrounding areas. However, the poor performance of WT simulation did not greatly affect predictions of ER and NEE. We found a significant relationship between optimized V-cmax and latitude (temperature), which better reflects the spatial gradients of annual NEE than using an average V-cmax value.

AB Peatlands, which are dominant features of the Canadian landscape, cover approximately 1.13 6 million km(2), or 12% of the land area. Most of the peatlands (97%) occur in the Boreal Weiland Region (64%) and Subarctic Wetland Region (33%). Because of the large area they cover and their high organic carbon content, these peatlands contain approximately 147 Gt soil carbon, which is about 56% of the organic carbon stored in all Canadian soils.
   A model for estimating peatland sensitivity to climate warming was used to determine both the sensitivity ratings of various peatland areas and the associated organic carbon masses. Calculations show that approximately 60% of the total area of Canadian peatlands and 51% of the organic carbon mass in all Canadian peatlands is expected to be severely to extremely severely affected by climate change.
   The increase in average annual air temperature of 3-5 degrees C over land and 5-7 degrees C over the oceans predicted for northern Canada by the end of this century would result in the degradation of frozen peatlands in the Subarctic and northern Boreal wetland regions and severe drying in the southern Boreal Weiland Region. In addition, flooding of coastal peatlands is expected because of the predicted rise in sea levels. As a result of these changes, a large part of the carbon in the peatlands expected to be severely and extremely severely affected by climate change could be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which will further increase climate warming.

TI METHANE TRANSPORT AND OXIDATION IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE OF A SPHAGNUM

SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
LA English
DT Article
AB Efflux rates and oxidation rates of methane (CH4) were measured in a northern Sphagnum bog, Thoreau's Bog in Concord, Massachusetts, by using a gradient methodology which does not change in situ conditions. A remote-sampling technique was devised to obtain undisturbed CH4 profiles as a function of depth in the peat; effective diffusion coefficients in peat were estimated both physically and by using propane as a tracer. By combining these techniques we estimated the average late summer CH4 flux from deep, anaerobic methanogenic sediments to the unsaturated zone to be 3.5 x 10(-11) mol cm(-2) s(-1) (+/- 1.0 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) s(-1)), while the CH4 flux from this unsaturated zone to the atmosphere was 3.7 x 10(-12) mol cm(-2) s(-1) ( 5.0 x 10-12 mol cm (-2) s(-1)). Therefore a large fraction of the CH4 flux was consumed before it reached the atmosphere. Most CH4 consumption, presumably by oxidation, occurred between the water table, located 12 to 15 cm below the bog surface, and about 6 cm below the bog surface. In this region, CH4 concentrations and oxidation rates were unevenly distributed, probably following patterns of upward transport of CH4 by bubbles via fissures and tubes in the saturated zone. Between the surface of the bog and 6-cm depth, CH4 concentrations were more uniformly distributed, most likely because of greater horizontal mixing in this depth range. Analysis of CH4 distributions in unsaturated peat is a straightforward and practical technique to measure both net CH4 efflux and CH4 oxidation with minimal disturbance to the peat structure and gas exchange conditions.

AB Contemporary measurements of carbon (C) accumulation rates in peatlands around the world often show the C sink to be stronger on average than at times in the past. Alteration of global nutrient cycles could be contributing to elevated carbon accumulation in the present day. Here we examine the effect of volcanic inputs of nutrients on peatland C accumulation in Moanatuatua Bog, New Zealand, by examining a high-resolution Late Holocene C accumulation record during which powerful volcanic eruptions occurred, depositing two visible rhyolitic tephra layers (Taupo, 232 +/- 10 CE; Kaharoa, 1314 +/- 12 CE). Carbon accumulation rates since c. 50 CE, well before any human presence, increased from a background rate of 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1) up to 110 g C m(-2) yr(-1) following the deposition of the Taupo Tephra, and 84 g C m(-2) yr(-1) following the deposition of the Kaharoa Tephra. Smaller but nevertheless marked increases in C accumulation additionally occurred in association with the deposition of three andesitic-dacitic cryptotephras (each <= similar to 1 mm thick) of the Tufa Trig Formation between the Taupo and Kaharoa events. These five periods of elevated C uptake, especially those associated with the relatively thick Taupo and Kaharoa tephras, were accompanied by shifts in nutrient stoichiometry, indicating that there was greater availability of phosphorus (P) relative to nitrogen (N) and C during the period of high C uptake. Such P was almost certainly derived from volcanic sources, with P being present in the volcanic glass at Moanatuatua, and many of the eruptions described being associated with the local deposition of the P rich mineral apatite. We found peatland C accumulation to be tightly coupled to N and P accumulation, suggesting nutrient inputs exert a strong control on rates of peat accumulation. Nutrient stoichiometry indicated a strong ability to recover P within the ecosystem, with C:P ratios being higher than most other peatlands in the literature. We conclude that nutrient inputs, deriving from volcanic eruptions, have been very important for C accumulation rates in the past. Therefore, the elevated nutrient inputs occurring in the present day could offer a more plausible explanation, as opposed to a climatic component, for observed high contemporary C accumulation in New Zealand peatlands.

AB Drying and rewetting to a variable extent influence the C gas exchange between peat soils and the atmosphere. We incubated a decomposed and compacted fen peat and investigated in two experiments 1) the vertical distribution of CO2 and CH4 production rates and their response to drying and 2) the effects of temperature, drying intensity and duration on CO2 production rates and on CH4 production recovery after rewetting. Surface peat down to 5 cm contributed up to 67% (CO2) and above 80% (CH4) of the depth-aggregated (50 cm) production. As CO2 production sharply decreased with depth water table fluctuations in deeper peat layers are thus not expected to cause a substantial increase in soil respiration in this site. Compared to anaerobic water saturated conditions drying increased peat CO2 production by a factor between 1.4 and 2.1. Regarding the effects of the studied factors, warmer conditions increased and prolonged drying duration decreased CO2 production whereas the soil moisture level had little influence. No significant interactions among factors were found. Short dry events under warmer conditions are likely to result in greatest peaks of CO2 production rates. Upon rewetting, CH4 production was monitored over time and the recovery was standardized to pre-drying levels to compare the treatment effects. Methane production increased non-linearly over time and all factors (temperature, drying intensity and duration) influenced the pattern of post-drying CH4 production. Peat undergoing more intense and longer drying events required a longer lag time before substantial CH4 production occurred and warmer conditions appeared to speed up the process.

AB Macrofossil analysis of the peat and topographic surveys of two palsa fields (Fields 3 and 4) within a permafrost peatland located in subarctic Quebec was conducted to trace the factors that contributed to their differential development. The two palsa fields are visibly different in terms of their geomorphology, ecology, and hydrology. According to our results, the evolution of the two fields was largely synchronous in terms of the respective trophic conditions. Moreover, the climate certainly played a significant role in the evolution of this ecosystem. For example, the cooling of the Neoglacial period would have favored the ombrotrophication of both sites, whereas the Little Ice Age conditions would have contributed to palsa formation. Despite the synchronous changes within the two fields, significant differences were also noted. These include the rate of peat accumulation, the number of species found in the peat monoliths, and the presence or absence of forest cover during the ombrotrophic phase. The topography of the underlying substrate would also have influenced the hydrological conditions. For example, a light slope toward the northwest engendered a faster trophic impoverishment in Field 4. In addition, streaming water in Field 3 favored the preservation of wet and rich conditions that triggered the following changes: more diverse vegetation, the significant accumulation of peat, and the formation of higher palsas.

AB Moss-dominated peat bogs store approximately 30% of global soil carbon. A climate induced-shift from current moss-dominated conditions to tree-dominated states is expected to strongly affect their functioning and carbon sequestration capacity. Consequently, unravelling the mechanisms that may explain successful tree seedling establishment in these ecosystems is highly relevant. To assess the role of drought on early tree seedling establishment and the relative importance of plant traits in tree seedling survival, we conducted a factorial glasshouse experiment with seven conifer species. Our results show that drought inhibits moss growth, thereby increasing survival of tree seedlings. Survival success was higher in Pinus than in Picea species, ranking Pinus banksiana>Pinus sylvestris>Pinus nigra>Picea mariana>Picea glauca, Picea sitchensis>Picea rubens. We found that those species most successful under dry and wet conditions combined a fast shoot growth with high seed mass. We conclude that plant traits contribute to explaining successful early tree seedling establishment in bogs.

AB Peatland vulnerability to wildfire disturbance has been shown to vary as a function of hummock and hollow microforms and vadose zone hydrology, with low-lying hollow microforms most susceptible to deep combustion of peat. To better understand how this microform induced pattern of burning alters vadose water storage, pore-water pressure, and water table relationships, we examined a paired burned and unburned peatland in the boreal plain region of north central Alberta. Water table response to rain events increased significantly after wildfire, resulting in a more variable unsaturated zone thickness that was more responsive to smaller rain events. Water storage losses in the vadose zone occurred primarily at depths greater than 15 cm. Large peat surface water loss occurred in hummock microforms in the early spring due to the presence of unsaturated frozen peat at depth, likely a result of a vapour gradient from the unfrozen peat into the frozen peat underneath. During this period, the loss of water storage in the vadose zone satisfied up to 25% of daily evaporative demand, compared to only 3-5% during ice-free periods. A similar but less severe drying was observed late in summer, with burned hummocks the most vulnerable with high pore-water pressures. The enhanced surface drying observed is a precursor to high pore-water pressure conditions that inhibit Sphagnum regeneration. Our observations point to a paradox where the hummocks, being most resistant to combustion, are themselves most prone to high pore-water pressures following wildfire. The harsher hummock environment may contribute to the observed delay in post-fire Sphagnum regeneration in hummocks compared to hollows. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We developed the McGill Wetland Model (MWM) based on the general structure of the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model. Three major changes were made to PCARS: (1) the light use efficiency model of photosynthesis was replaced with a biogeochemical description of photosynthesis; (2) the description of autotrophic respiration was changed to be consistent with the formulation of photosynthesis; and (3) the cohort, multilayer soil respiration model was changed to a simple one box peat decomposition model divided into an oxic and anoxic zones by an effective water table, and a one-year residence time litter pool. MWM was then evaluated by comparing its output to the estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) from 8 years of continuous measurements at the Mer Bleue peatland, a raised ombrotrophic bog located in southern Ontario, Canada (index of agreement [dimensionless]: NEP = 0.80, GPP = 0.97, ER = 0.97; systematic RMSE [gCm(-2) d(-1)]: NEP = 0.12, GPP = 0.07, ER = 0.14; unsystematic RMSE: NEP = 0.15, GPP = 0.27, ER = 0.23). Simulated moss NPP approximates what would be expected for a bog peatland, but shrub NPP appears to be underestimated. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the model output did not change greatly due to variations in water table because of offsetting responses in production and respiration, but that even a modest temperature increase could lead to converting the bog from a sink to a source of CO2. General weaknesses and further developments of MWM are discussed.

AB Changes in the relative availability of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium can be associated with changes in the species composition of wetland vegetation, but responsible mechanisms are not always clear. This study examines how the relative supply of N and P influences the composition of mixtures of four herbaceous wetland species (Carex flava, Centaurea angustifolia, Lycopus europaeus and Selinum carvifolia). Mixtures were grown in sand fertilised with nutrient solutions containing N and P in varying proportions (N:P mass ratios of 1.7-135) and total amounts ('overall supply', geometric mean of N and P supply). The total above-ground biomass of the mixtures after 11 weeks of growth depended mainly on overall nutrient supply, but also on the N:P supply ratio; it was maximal at a N:P supply ratio of 15 with high overall nutrient supply, 45 with intermediate, and 135 with low nutrient supply. The relative contributions of the four species to total above-ground biomass as well as the root weight ratio differed significantly among nutrient treatments. Treatment effects mostly remained significant when biomass was used as co-variate to account for differences in productivity. With increasing N:P supply ratio, the contribution of C. flava increased, while the contribution of L. europaeus and the root weight ratio tended to decrease. These differences were unrelated to interspecific differences in biomass N and P concentrations since L. europaeus had lower concentrations of both N and P than C. flava. Differences in the rates of N and P uptake were apparently most important in this short-term experiment and probably due to differences in biomass allocation to roots. The results also show that the effects of N:P supply ratios should always be investigated at several levels of overall nutrient supply since the two factors interact with each other.

AB Because peat is elastic, the daily to seasonal swelling and shrinking of the peat surface not only affects water storage but also alters peatland hydraulics and the biogeochemical and thermal properties of peat. Due to different botanical origins and degrees of decomposition, we hypothesized that different peatland microforms (ridges and lawns) display a large variation in peat deformation and compressibility. Here we examined the spatial variation of peat surface movement, peat strength, and volumetric water content at a low lawn (LL), upper lawn (UL), and ridge (R) along a 5 m transect in a peatland in Quebec, Canada. The average seasonal amplitude in peat surface level was 9, 6, and 2 cm at the LL, UL, and R sites, respectively. The surface layers in each of these sites were fairly rigid with the largest changes in peat thickness occurring between 20 and 60 cm depth in the peat profile. Compressibility varied among microforms but was not correlated to other properties within the layer in individual soil layers. However, when average profile compressibility was considered, it was significantly correlated to peat depth, von Post humification, distance to hollow, and peat strength. The total water storage by dilation below the water table was about the same as the water deficit (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) for LL, while the storage deficit for UL and especially R was lower. Including changes in entrapped gas content over the season reduced estimates of changes in water storage at all sites. Because microform type and position were significant predictors of hydrophysical properties, we argue that this suggests that peatland microtopography is self-reinforcing through ecohydrological feedbacks. Including the variability in these properties in peatland ecohydrological models will be key for predicting the response of peatland ecosystems to disturbance.

AB Chamber method is commonly used to measure the CO2 exchange from plant communities. Due to low time resolution, actual measurements reflect only momentary CO2 exchange rates. Therefore, a common way to derive seasonal or annual estimates is to establish models describing the response of CO2 exchange to environmental variables, and then to reconstruct the CO2 exchange over the desired time period. There are several alternative ways to obtain the CO2 balance for the entire mire: models can be parameterized by individual sample plots, plant communities or the entire site. Similarly, the CO2 balance can be reconstructed by plots, plant communities or the entire site. We tested how the choice of the modelling and reconstruction approach influences the CO2 exchange estimates for the entire mire and for individual sample plots and plant communities. We measured the CO2 exchange in a spatially heterogeneous sedge-dominated northern aapa mire for two growing seasons. We observed high spatial variation in CO2 balance between the plant communities. We noticed that when the CO2 balances of individual sample plots or plant communities are of interest, using a model appropriate for the entire site may result in biased estimates. In worst case the different modelling approaches may turn the CO2 balance of an individual sample plot from positive to negative. Further, while using the whole ecosystem approach in modelling, the superior ability of chamber method in acknowledging spatial variation is lost. While the modelled growing season CO2 balance of the mire ranged from 232 to 625 g CO2 m(-2) depending on the chosen modelling and reconstruction approach, the average estimates still remained within the uncertainty range of one another. Acknowledgement of the spatial variation in plant community level makes the areal estimate more robust to varying weather conditions. Further, the reliability of estimates is improved by explicit formulation of the choices behind the modelling and reconstruction units reflecting the study objectives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sphagnum expansion to alkaline fens has accelerated during the last decades in Europe, leading to changes in diversity, habitat distributions and carbon storage. The causes are still not clearly understood and involve an interplay between climate change, hydrology, nutrient supply and Sphagnum physiology. We conducted a 4-year field experiment in eight fens in Central European highlands and assessed survival and establishment of individual apical shoot fragments of S.flexuosum, S. warnstorfii and S. squarrosum transplanted along the microtopographical gradient. In a laboratory experiment, we tested combined effects of desiccation and high calcium bicarbonate concentration on Sphagnum survival. We found that in unflooded positions, living shoots of Sphagnum and brown mosses lowered [Ca2+] and pH in their capillary water, in contrast to dead fragments; yet without differences between species. Survival and expansion of Sphagnum fragments, which did not die of acute calcium toxicity during first weeks/months, was negatively affected by dry weather and alkaline water chemistry, reflecting Sphagnum intolerance to desiccation and to combined high [Ca2+] and pH. Shoot fragments expanded to patches only when precipitation was high. Interestingly, non-toxic concentration of calcium bicarbonate reduced desiccation damage in Sphagnum, probably through protection of membranes or other cell components. This mechanism would facilitate Sphagnum survival in elevated, frequently desiccated microhabitats of calcareous fens such as brown-moss hummocks. However, since water-retaining capacity of few Sphagnum shoots is insufficient to change water chemistry in its surroundings, surface acidification may occur only once the environment (e.g. sufficient humidity) enabled expansion to larger mats. Then, the retained rainwater together with hardly decomposable Sphagnum litter would separate mire surface from groundwater, speeding up successional shift towards poor fens. Sphagnum expansion to alkaline fens is therefore more likely in humid regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the concentration of nitrogen (N) and delta N-15 in vegetation and peat in the Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada. Compared with other ecosystems, N concentration in bog plant foliage is low (generally < 1.2%), with more N stored belowground than in foliar tissues. The natural abundance of N-15 varies by plant functional type, indicating different strategies for nutrient acquisition. delta N-15 values of evergreen shrubs and trees are lower (similar to-5 to similar to-9 parts per thousand) than sedges and herbs (similar to+1 to similar to-1 parts per thousand), likely the result of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, which retain N-15 in fungal biomass, with preferential transfer of N-14 to the host plant. Results suggest that N in Sphagnum moss capitula is derived from uptake of N from decomposing peat and litter, with delta N-15 values of -8 to 2 parts per thousand, rather than from N-2 fixation. Soil delta N-15 varies with depth, related to degree of decomposition and dominant plant species litter. Foliar N plays a critical role in influencing the rate of photosynthesis and CO2 exchange. Despite paucity of available inorganic N in the system, most bog plants (that is, evergreen shrubs) have adapted with conservative growth strategies. Owing to slow decomposition, N is stored in this system tightly bound with organic matter, with C:N ratios in deep peat ranging from 33:1 to 23:1 and small fluxes into, out of and within the system. An increase in N availability, through atmospheric N deposition or water table lowering, could jeopardize the C sink function of bogs by stimulating microbial decomposition of organic matter. In the long term, an increase in N cycling would shift plant community composition from Sphagnum and evergreen dominated to deciduous species, fundamentally altering bog ecosystem function.

AB Decomposition of fresh litter of Caret diandra, originating from a base-rich fen, and Sphagnum fallax, originating from a base-poor fen, was investigated in field experiments with litter bags and laboratory experiments with aerobic incubators. The Carex litter decomposed significantly faster than the Sphagnum litter in all experiments. Further, both litter types decomposed faster in the base-rich than in the base-poor fen. The addition of a small amount of homogenized S. fallax capitulums to litter of both types in the laboratory experiments significantly slowed down the rate of weight loss. The addition of homogenized C. diandra leaves did not influence the decay rate. These results suggest that the slow litter decomposition in Sphagnum-dominated mires is due to the chemical composition of the litter itself and the antibiotic effect of a substance leaching from living Sphagnum cells. Literature on the biochemistry of Sphagnales suggests that 'Sphagnum acid', a phenolic compound found in all Sphagna tested, is responsible for these differences.

TI The role of palynology in paleoecological analyses of Tertiary coals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Pollen, spores, and other plant microfossils are important constituents of Tertiary coals, both as petrographic components (the maceral sporinite) and as distinctive indicators of the nature of the depositional environment in which the coal-forming Feat accumulated. Palynological analyses, which have been conducted on Tertiary coals since the 1930's, play an increasingly important role in modem paleoecological analyses of coals.
   Among the most important factors controlling the petrographic composition and facies characteristics of coal deposits are the types and relative abundances of plants that composed the peat. At present, wetland environments in which peat accumulates (mires) range from marshes and bogs to forested swamps; each is inhabited by distinctive plant communities. These plant communities are associated with varied conditions of climate, water depth, chemistry, and nutrient supply, and the floras can be indicative of these conditions. In the Tertiary Period, plant communities of mires were also highly diverse and specialized (especially as compared with those of the Carboniferous). The dominant species in some Paleocene mire floras were gymnosperms, but continuing a trend begun in Late Cretaceous time, angiosperms became increasingly prominent through the Tertiary. The diverse angiosperm-dominated mire floras produced coals that vary significantly in facies and hence in quality. Such contrasts are evident in contemporaneous coals from different paleolatitudes, as well as among coals of different ages within the Tertiary, as exemplified by selected deposits in the western United States. The palynofloras of these coals reflect the floristic composition of the plant communities of the ancient mires.

AB In response to peatland degradation by human activities worldwide, restoration through gully blocking is now being implemented in an attempt to return valuable ecological and hydrological services to degraded systems. Re-establishing these services requires an understanding of how systems have formed and evolved in order to establish conditions that assist with physical and ecological recovery. However, management of peatlands and swamps continues without prior investigation into the environmental history of these ecosystems. This study investigates stratigraphy, sediment ages and peat forming potential within three Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone in the Blue Mountains, NSW. These swamps are listed as Endangered Ecological Communities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cwlth) and the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW). High discontinuity in sediment structure, peat forming potential and timeframes of swamp initiation were observed across the three swamps. This localised variation reflects the complex geomorphic processes acting within and between these systems. Such data provides scientists and managers with key indicators to assess timeframes over which infilling, vegetation establishment and peat formation occurs. These tools can guide prioritisation, conservation and financial expenditure for the management and rehabilitation of temperate peat swamps.

AB When evaluating the success or failure of ecological restoration projects, practitioners need to verify success within the first few years of the monitoring process to apply corrective measures if necessary or to reclaim environmental down payment where required. This could be achieved with ecological indicators, if they can be easily and routinely measured and are representative of the complexity of the restored ecosystems. We used peatlands restored after horticultural peat extraction in eastern Canada to test a methodological approach that predicts restoration success early after restoration implementation. The goal of restoration of these extracted peatlands is to re-establish a moss carpet typically dominated by Sphagnum mosses, the main peat-accumulating plant group in these northern ecosystems. Vegetation in a total of 152 plots in 41 peatlands restored after peat extraction activities and distributed across a span of 600 km was monitored every 2 years since the third year after restoration. The plots were clustered in three restoration outcome categories: Sphagnum-dominated, bare peat-dominated and Polytrichum-dominated, according to their characteristic vegetation composition at the time of the latest survey for each plot (4-11 years since restoration). Second, vegetation composition in the same plots from the earliest survey, 3 years since restoration, and key environmental and management variables such as summer temperature, effectiveness of ditch blockage, season of restoration works and delay in P fertilization were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain the combination of parameters that best discriminated between the restoration outcome categories. LDA correctly classified 71% of the plots of a calibration database (for which 75% of the sectors were used) and 75% of a validation database (for which 25% of the sectors were used) into the three categories. The obtained LDA models can be used to allocate new plots to one of the restoration outcome categories by providing a series of linear equations (classification functions) that are computed from the combination of ecological indicators. One additional and recently restored peatland was used to illustrate application of these equations of the LDA model to predict future restoration outcome and subsequently adapt management strategies. Such a LDA model provides an unequivocal (i.e., one new plot assigned to one and only one restoration outcome category) prediction of success based on multiple but simple, easily recognizable indicators and spares managers the complex task of interpreting many individual predictors for establishing a clear diagnosis.

AB Dark, coniferous hemiboreal forests in the south of West Siberia are located in the Holocene forest-steppe ecotone, where natural environmental conditions have been quite dynamic. This dynamic environment resulted in the contrasting evolution of regional soil cover and the development of unique soil profiles with the second humus horizon. The second humus horizon is assumed to be a relic from the dark-humus soil formation stage in the mid-Holocene. This article draws conclusions about changes in regional environmental conditions by analysing data from a geochemically interrelated coevolutionary soil series, obtained by using a combination of conventional soil studies, phytolith analyses, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating of phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) and humic acids. The results showed that, in general, phytocenoses changed from mire-meadow vegetation towards forest vegetation via the meadow stage. However, these stages had different durations, depending on the soil catenary position. The topographical divergence of soil phytolith profiles reflects the relief effect on the development of specific soil type combinations, accounting for the major elements of the regional mid-Holocene soil cover. The leading elementary soil-forming processes were humus accumulation and hydrogenic accumulation of calcium carbonates. In the hilltop site of Endocalcic Stagnic Albic Luvisols, the evolutionary changes were shown by the shift from the meadow phytocenosis (Calcic Stagnic Chernozem) to the forest phytocenosis. In the midslope site, the environment was more humid from the start, favouring a phytocenosis with features of the meadow-mire type. The shift from the meadow-mire environment (with Spodic Chernic Gleysols) to the forest type environment with leading profile-forming processes, acid hydrolysis and lessivage, was gradual, occurring via the meadow stage with Calcic Stagnic Chernozem. In the toeslope site (Calcic Stagnic Greyzemic Epidystric Umbrisols), the meadow-mire stage (with Spodic Chernic Gleysols) was succeeded by the forest stage of soil formation. The AMS-dating of PhytOC estimated that the dark-humus stage of soil formation began 6.5-5.7 years calBC. Despite the observed slight translocation of phytoliths down soil profiles and phytolith solubilisation, phytolith analysis can be used to reconstruct shifts in the soil formation environment for surface Holocene palaeosols.

AB Understanding the biogeochemistry of metal-contaminated peatlands is important for predicting the impact of mining and industrial activities on peatlands and downstream surface waters and for predicting recovery of previously impacted sites. The objective of this work was to characterize the factors controlling spatial and temporal variability in surface peat (015 cm) and pore water chemistry of 18 regionally representative peatlands in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The pollution gradient is clearly evident as Cu and Ni concentrations in surface peat are elevated close to the main Copper Cliff smelter. Surface peat also differs greatly in acidity (pH) and organic matter content among sites, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in pore water are positively correlated with peat carbon content. In addition, sites having surface peat that is more decomposed also have pore water DOC that is more humified. Pore water chemistry varies seasonally; samples taken in late summer and fall were characterized by higher SO4, and lower pH and higher concentrations of base cations and metals such as Ni, Co, and Mn compared with those in late spring that had higher DOC, higher pH, and higher concentrations of metals such as Cu and Fe. Despite the large spatial and temporal variability in pore water chemistry, soil-solution partitioning (Kd) of some metals (Ni, Co, and Mn) can be explained by pH alone. Modeling soil-solution partitioning for these metals and Cu, Al, and Fe is significantly improved with the addition of SO4; dissolved organic matter quality and quantity and/or the delta O-18 signature of the pore water in regression models indicating several factors other than acidity has an influence on pore water chemistry.

ID RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS; GROWN PLANTS
AB The rare earth elements (REEs) of the two major vegetation of the Ozegahara peatland, peat moss (Sphagnum sp.) and peat grass (Carex sp.), were determined. The overall variation of the chondrite-normalized REE patterns was almost identical to that of soil-grown plants except for cerium. Peat moss and peat grass showed no cerium anomaly, while all the soil-grown plants we have surveyed showed negative cerium anomaly. The E-H and pH condition to produce the cerium anomaly was discussed and the peatland was found to be too low in E-H or in pH to the appearance of the cerium anomaly. The E-H-pH condition of the peat water in the Ozegahara peatland seems to be determined largely by FeOOH-Fe2+ system.

AB Terrestrializing lowland fens may be temporarily exposed to elevated surface water salinity, which may have serious consequences for nature conservation. We investigated the response of five fresh water fen plant species to elevated salinity.
   In a controlled greenhouse experiment, these species were exposed to salt concentrations up to 3000 mg Cl- 1(-1).
   Total biomass of the five species together was significantly reduced for salinity levels from 200 mg Cl- 1(-1). Four individual species showed leaf death and relative growth rate reduction, with effects at 1000 mg Cl- 1(-1) for Succisa pratensis, Thelypteris palustris and Viola palustris, and 3000 mg Cl- 1(-1) for Myosotis scozpioides. Comarum palustre showed no significant (.05 level) sensitivity.
   Biomass distribution was investigated as well. Root-shoot ratio of four species was affected by salinity, which in at least two cases seemed to be related to leaf death. Differences in specific leaf area as a result of salinity were only observed for C palustre. Dry matter content increased in four species as a result of salinity.
   Salinity tolerance did not correspond to the environmental distributions of the species, nor could species traits be related to tolerance.
   Surface water salinity may affect vegetation development in terrestrializing fens at low concentrations. A reduction of plant growth would cause reduced fitness of some species and may lead to reduced root mat growth. Exposure to higher concentrations could eventually lead to a decrease of species richness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we examine the variations in rare earth elements (REE) from the Lower Kittanning coal bed of eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, USA, in an attempt to understand the factors that control mineral matter deposition and modification in coal, and to evaluate possible REE mixed exposure hazards facing underground mine workers. The results of this study suggest that the Lower Kittanning coal mineral matter is derived primarily from a clastic source similar to that of the shale overburden. While highly charged cations like silicon, aluminum, and titanium remained relatively immobile within the coal mineral matter, iron (primarily as pyrite) was added from nonclastic sources, either during deposition of the coal mire vegetation or subsequent to burial. Other mobile cations (e.g., alkali and alkaline earth elements) appear to have been added to and/or leached from the originally deposited clastic mineral matter. Most of the sulfur in the Lower Kittanning coal bed is bound as FeS2 in the mineral matter, but a majority of samples contain a small excess of S that is most likely organically bound.
   In general, the total rare earth element content (TREE) in coal ash is greater than that in the shale overburden. If the primary source of mineral matter is the same as that for the overlying shale, then REE must have been enriched in the coal mineral matter subsequent to deposition. The total rare earth element content of Lower Kittanning coals correlates strongly with Si concentration ([TREE] approximate to 0.0024 [Si]), which provides a threshold for evaluating possible mixed exposure health effects. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns reveal a shale-like light rare earth element (LREE) enrichment for the coal, similar to that of the shale overburden, again suggesting a primarily elastic REE source. However, when normalized to the shale overburden, most of the coal ash samples display a small but distinct heavy rare earth element (HREE) enrichment. We surmise that the HREE were added and/or preferentially retained during epigenesis, possibly associated with groundwater flow through the coal unit, but not necessarily in close association with the addition of iron. At least some of the "excess" HREE could be organically bound within the Lower Kittanning coal. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 30% of the world's soil carbon. This carbon sequestration is due to slow decomposition, as illustrated by ancient wooden artefacts and 'bog bodies' preserved over millennia. Such artefacts suggest that carbon could be captured externally and stored long term in peat. However, whether such carbon would remain stable following lowered water tables is not known. Here, we show that adding woody litter results in preservation of the exogenous carbon, as well as protection of soil carbon within the host ecosystem from severe drought, as a result of leached polyphenolics. These compounds not only inhibit microbial extracellular and intracellular metabolism but also deprive microbial growth of iron and substrates such as carbon and nitrogen. Our results suggest that this technique harnesses natural ecosystem resilience mechanisms and may have implications for new carbon-farming approaches.

AB The demand for small-sized trees, logging residues, stumps, and lateral roots for energy production has increased during recent decades and therefore whole-tree harvesting (WTH) has become a more common harvesting method in forests. However, this may cause a more pronounced delay in the recovery of forest vegetation than conventional stem-only harvesting (SOH), especially in sensitive peatlands, and thus increase soil erosion. The effects of WTH have not been investigated on peatlands before this study. Recovery of understorey vegetation of drained peatland forests after two different tree harvesting methods, stem-only harvesting and whole-tree harvesting, was investigated in Eastern Finland at eight silviculturally managed peatland forests largely comprising Scots pine, Pima sylvesiris, and Norway spruce, Picea abies. In SOH, trunks only were removed from the sites whereas in WTH, tree trunks, branches, and stumps were removed. In each site, understorey vegetation (tree seedlings, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, herbs, and bryophytes) was inventoried on both mounded and unprepared soil (surfaces) on 220 permanent sample plots one and five years after harvesting. WTH had more pronounced effects on vegetation than SOH. Five to six years after the treatments, the occurrence of dwarf shrubs was lower in WTH than in SOH, whereas the cover of graminoids increased from both SOH and WTH. Soil preparation affected negatively on the recovery of peat and forest bryophytes, but positively on the recovery of some graminoid and herb species. Peat properties, e.g., pH and water table level, were found to regulate the recovery. WTH caused a longer delay on the recovery of understorey vegetation than SOH, especially if soil had been prepared. Thus, WTH cannot be recommended in drained peatland forests.

AB We monitored CO2 and CH4 fluxes using eddy covariance from 19 May to 27 September 2011 in a poor fen located in northern Michigan. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) quantify the flux of CH4 from a sub-boreal peatland, and (2) determine which abiotic and biotic factors were the most correlated to the flux of CH4 over the measurement period. Net daily CH4 fluxes increased from 70 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) to 220 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) from mid May to mid July. After July, CH4 losses steadily declined to approximately 50 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in late September. During the study period, the peatland lost 17.4 gCH(4) m(-2). Both abiotic and biotic variables were correlated with CH4 fluxes. When the different variables were analyzed together, the preferred model included mean daily soil temperature at 20 cm, daily net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the interaction between mean daily soil temperature at 20 cm and NEE (R-2 = 0.47, p value < 0.001). The interaction was important because the relationship between daily NEE and mean daily soil temperature with CH4 flux changed when NEE was negative (CO2 uptake from the atmosphere) or positive (CO2 losses to the atmosphere). On days when daily NEE was negative, 25% of the CH4 flux could be explained by correlations with NEE, however on days when daily NEE was positive, there was no correlation between daily NEE and the CH4 flux. In contrast, daily mean soil temperature at 20 cm was poorly correlated to changes in CH4 when NEE was negative (17%), but the correlation increased to 34% when NEE was positive. The interaction between daily NEE and mean daily soil temperature at 20 cm indicates shifting environmental controls on the CH4 flux throughout the growing season.

AB Northern Koryakia belongs to two different vegetation zones: Beringian forest-tundra zone and East-Siberian larch forest subzone of the Eurasian boreal (taiga) zone. The territory of Northern Koryakia was subdivided into 3 geobotanical provinces and 14 districts. Most peculiar, the Siberian dwarf-pine (Pinus pumila) elfin woods occupy zonal mesic habitats of plains, plateaus and gentle mountain slopes. They form a zonal vegetation type of Beringian creeping woodland. Polar birch (Betula middendorffii) shrubs (up to 1.5 m tall) and dwarf-alder (Alnus fruticosa) thickets form another important vegetation type associated with Pinus pumila open woodlands. These two vegetation types form a distinctive subalpine vegetation belt at lower elevations (up to 150-300 m). The alpine vegetation belt (up to 400-450 m) is characterized by a complex of dwarf-shrub and lichen-rich tundra communities that occur under conditions of a heat deficit and very short growing season. Azonal habitats, such as wide river valleys, are occupied by flood-plain forests (Chosenia arbutifolia, Populus suaveolens, Salix udensis, and S. schwerinii). In the floodplains of rivers and streams, shrubby willow thickets are widespread, predominated by Salix pulchra, S. alaxensis, S. krylovii and S. hastata. Several vegetation types, mainly coastal dwarf-shrub tundra, mires, salt marshes, mesic and hygric meadows, and isolated Betula ermanii groves are distributed on azonal sites. In waterlogged habitats of lowlands and depressions, sedge-moss mires, Sphagnum-rich oligotrophic bogs with 40-60 cm-thick peat layers, hillocky mires, and polygonal mires develop. Tussocky sedge-cottongrass mires developing in the intermountain depressions are characteristic to the Anadyr-Penzhina lowland. Typical components of them are Carex lugens, Eriohorum vaginatum, Betula exilis and other hyparctic dwarf-shrubs. In the western part of the Penzhina River Basin, larch (Larix cajanderi) open woodlands form the northern forest limit. In addition, there are groves of Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla) in the river valleys.

AB Warming and human activities have caused peatland degradation and water table drawdown, which greatly influence the physicochemical characteristics of soil at different depths. How water table drawdown affects soil physicochemical characteristics is not well understood for the Tibetan Plateau, especially the Zoige peatlands. This study measured variations in C/N ratio, ash content, delta C-13, and humification index (HI) as a function of water table drawdown and depth by sampling 100-cm soil columns from three sites with different water tables in the Zoige peatlands. C/N ratio decreased while ash content and HI increased with water table drawdown, suggesting greater decomposition of soil organic matter at sites with a lower water table. The response of soil physicochemical characteristics to water table drawdown varied with depth: in the layer above the water table, C/N ratio did not vary, ash content decreased and HI increased; in the layer below the water table, C/N ratio and HI decreased, while ash content increased. The physicochemical characteristics above the water table were influenced mainly by new carbon input, while the characteristics below the water table were influenced mainly by decomposition. The depth profile of C/N ratio, ash content and HI aligned well with peat formation and decomposition and may be indicators of peat degradation. delta C-13 did not vary with water table drawdown, depth, or decomposition process. These insights into the variation of soil physicochemical characteristics with depths and water table may help elucidate the processes behind peatland degradation.

AB Removal of the vascular vegetation (Eriophorum vaginatum) at two sites in a Swedish boreal peatland decreased the seasonal CH4 flux by 55 to 85%, while the daily CH4 flux at a Canadian boreal peatland with Carer rostrata removed decreased by over 30%. Dissolved CH4 pore water concentrations in the rooting zone were 1.2 to 2.5 times greater than the storage at similar sites where vegetation was removed by clipping, suggesting that the removal of vascular vegetation decreased CH4 production. Moreover, nighttime CH4 flux enhancement was coincident with the diurnal peak in dissolved CH4 pore water concentration. A positive correlation between mean daily net ecosystem production and mean daily CH4 flux (r(2) = 0.655, n = 8) at lawn sites with sedge vegetation suggests that sites with greater CO2 fixation had a higher CH4 flux, likely through enhanced methanogenesis and transport. The degree of vascular vegetation CH4 flux enhancement, however, changed throughout the growing season and was correlated to the position of the water table. Under low water table conditions the presence of vascular plant cover has a lesser effect in enhancing CH4 emissions, indicating that CH4 and net ecosystem exchange coupling is limited to vascular plants and only to sites that remain wet with the water table near the surface.

AB The inception of the Sphagnum (peat moss) genome project marks the first plant-based sequencing project aimed specifically at carbon cycling genomics in a plant system relevant to ecological and evolutionary genomics. Sphagnum provides considerable intra-and interspecific variation at the nucleotide level, and in physiology, morphology, net production, decomposition and carbon accumulation (peat formation). Because of the large number of peat moss species, their diversity in mating systems, and clear patterns of niche differentiation, Sphagnum provides an exceptionally valuable complement to Physcomitrella patens and Ceratodon purpureus as moss models for genomic research. Here we review the organismal biology of Sphagnum including phylogeny, life cycle, mating systems, ecology and niche differentiation. We include the current state of Sphagnum genomic resources, in vitro methods and germplasm. A use-case is provided to address questions concerning epigenetics and reproduction.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine vegetational variation and vegetation-environment relationships, and to define trophic classes in wooded peatlands. One hundred and twenty-nine plots in wooded peat-lands from the Northern Clay Section, northeastern Ontario, Canada, were analyzed with multivariate techniques. Detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA) ordination was employed to portray vegetational variation and to identify clusters of plots. The first axis of the ordination was significantly correlated with the number of species present, groundwater pH and calcium, depth of the surface layer of fibric peat, loss on ignition, N, Ca, Mg, and site index. The first axis of the ordination was segmented into 'trophic classes' - ombrotrophic, extreme poor, transitional poor, intermediate, transitional rich and rich. Divisions between these classes were chosen to complement the divisions between vegetation types identified by two-way indicator species analyses (TWINSPAN). A key to the vegetation types and trophic classes based upon indicator species is provided.

AB Past studies of the climatic influence on tree growth at peat bogs in northern latitudes have shown weak correlation between annual tree-ring widths and climatic parameters during the growing season. At Hanvedsmossen, a raised pear bog in south central Sweden, tree-ring width chronologies from one drained and one undrained growth site, as well as one dry site outside the bog, were compared to meteorological records. Low temperatures, which means less evaporation, as well as high precipitation appear to be inhibiting pine growth at the undisturbed bog site as the trees are sensitive to changes in the local water table. Drainage causes an instant increase in annual tree growth for approximately 10 years. If drainage is maintained, the response to climate of the pines resembles that of pines growing on mineral soils. The variance in annual tree-ring growth explained by temperature/precipitation or both was low for the entire lengths of all chronologies, but high for some analysed subperiods; the significant months changed with time. The reason for this seems to be that pines at Hanvedsmossen are growing in a region where precipitation and temperature are less limiting to tree growth than at higher and lower latitudes.

AB To harvest Sphagnum on a cyclic basis and rapidly accumulate biomass, active water management is necessary. The goal of this study is to determine the hydrological conditions that will maximise CO2 uptake in Sphagnum farming basins following the moss-layer transfer technique. Plot CO2 uptake doubled from the first growing season to the second, but growth was not uniform across the site. Results indicate that the seasonal oscillations in water table (WT) position were more important than actual WT position for estimating Sphagnum ground cover and CO2 uptake when the seasonal WT is shallow (< -25 cm). Plots with higher productivity had a WT range (seasonal maximum - minimum) less than 15 cm, a WT position which did not fluctuate more than +/- 7.5 cm, and a low WT standard deviation. Each basin was a CO2 source during the second growing season, and seasonal modelled NEE ranged from 107.1 to 266.8 g CO2 m(-2). Decomposition from the straw mulch accounted for over half of seasonal respiration, and the site is expected to become a CO2 sink as the straw mulch decomposes and moss cover increases. This study highlights the importance of maintaining stable moisture conditions to increase Sphagnum growth and CO2 sink functions.

AB Academician A. L. Yanshin, who paid much attention to studies and use of mineral products of agrochemical purpose, appreciated the works on bog phosphates started in the early 1980s. He treated them and other mineral accumulations in peats as a serious basis for improving the structure of soils and increasing the fertility of Siberian lands.
   In recent years, high contents of bog phosphates, bog carbonates (alm), and sapropel have been found in lowland peat deposits in Siberia, which is the largest peat territory of the world.
   Prediction studies including analysis of the composition of peats, their substrate, underground waters feeding peat deposits, and other characteristics provided insignt into the geochemical processes of bog lithogenesis and the character and sequence of peat mineral formation.
   Assessment-prospecting and exploration works have been carried out in the revealed promising areas and some objects. The assessed and predicted resources of bog phosphates, aim, and sapropel indicate that West Siberia is rich in organic mineral products, which might compensate for a deficiency of phosphorus and calcium in Siberian soils and improve their structure. The lines for judicious usage of resources are suggested.

Fire is a contagious process, and given weather conducive to burning, wildfires may be naturally limited by the connectivity of fuels and the connectivity of landscapes such as peatlands. Boreal peatlands fragment landscapes when wet and connect them when dry. The aim of this paper is to construct a framework by which the hydrological dynamics of boreal peatlands can be incorporated into standard wildfire likelihood models, in this case the Canadian Burn-P3 model. We computed hydrologically dynamic vegetation cover for peatlands (37% of the study area) on a real landscape in the Canadian boreal plain, corresponding to varying water table levels representing wet, moderate, and severely dry fuel moisture and hydrological conditions. Despite constant atmospheric drivers of fire spread (air temperature, humidity, and wind speed) between drought scenarios, fire activity increased 6-fold in moderate drought relative to a low drought baseline; severe (1 in 40 years) drought scenarios drove fires into previously fire-restrictive environments. Fire size increased 5-fold during moderate drought conditions and a further 20-25% during severe drought. Future climate change is projected to lead to an increase in the incidence of severe drought in boreal forests, leading to increases in burned area due to increasing fire frequency and size where peatlands are most abundant. Future climate change in regions where peatlands have historically acted as important barriers to fire spread may amplify ongoing increases in fire activity already observed in Western North American forests.

AB At the ecosystem scale, peatlands can be extremely resilient to perturbations. Yet, they are very sensitive to local disturbances, especially mechanical perturbations (e.g. trampling). The effects of these disturbances on vegetation, and potential effects on hydrochemical conditions along the peat surface, however, are largely unknown.
   We used three research tracks (paths researchers use to access their study sites) differing in time of abandonment to investigate the impact of local disturbance (trampling) on the vegetation and its short-term (<= 2 year) recovery in a flagship research blanket peatland. Additionally, we examined the effects of local disturbance on fluvial runoff events and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in runoff water.
   Local disturbance heavily impacted peat vegetation, resulting in large areas of scarred and churned peat. Recovery of vascular plants along abandoned tracks was slow, but a functional Sphagnum layer re-established after just one year.
   The absence of vegetation elicited an increase in the number of runoff events along the tracks, by which POC runoff from the tracks increased. POC concentrations were highest in the surface water from the recently abandoned track, while they were low in the runoff water from the track abandoned longest and the undisturbed control track. We attribute this to the relatively fast recovery of the Sphagnum vegetation. DOC concentrations did not differ significantly either spatially or temporally in surface runoff or soil solution waters. While at an ecosystem scale local disturbances may be negligible in terms of carbon loss, our data points to the need for further research on the potential long-term effects of local disturbance on the vegetation, and significant effects on local scale carbon fluxes. Moreover, the effects of disturbances could be long-lasting and their role on ecosystem processes should not be underestimated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The role of mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) in the mobilization of Cs-137 was estimated on the basis of data on the biokinetic fractionation of the organic matter of soddy-podzolic sandy-loam and peat bog soils and on the coefficients of the soil-to-plant transfer of radiocesium under field conditions. The peat bog soils were richer than the soddy-podzolic soils in the total organic carbon (by 7.9-23.8 times), the potentially mineralizable carbon (by 2.4-6.5 times), and the carbon of the microbial biomass (by 2.9-4.6 times). The agricultural use of the soddy-podzolic and peat bog soils led to a decrease in the SOM mineralization capacity by 1.1-1.8 and 1.4-2.0 times, respectively. Simultaneously, the portions of the easily, moderately, and difficultly mineralizable fraction of the SOM active pool changed. The coefficients of the Cs-137 transfer from the peat bog soils to plants were 3.3-17.6 times higher than those for the soddy-podzolic soils. The content of Cs-137 in plants grown on the peat bog soils was 2-65 times higher than that in the mobile (salt-extractable) soil pool by the beginning of the growing season. Strong positive linear correlations were found between the coefficients of the soil-to-plant transfer of Cs-137 and the total content of the SOM, the content of the microbial biomass, the content of the potentially mineralizable carbon, and the intensity of its mineralization. It was concluded that the decisive factors controlling the intensity of the Cs-137 transfer from mineral and organic soils into plants are the SOM content and its mineralization potential. The mineralization of the SOM is accompanied by the release of both Cs-137 and mineral nitrogen; the latter facilitates the transfer of radiocesium into plants.

AB Peatland soils store substantial amounts of organic matter (OM). During peat formation, easily decomposable OM is preferentially lost and more recalcitrant moieties accumulate. In a peat profile, OM quality thus scales with depth. Drainage and ongoing climate change poses the risk of rapid OM loss when formerly anoxic peat layers oxidize. During peat decomposition, deeper, more recalcitrant peat is exposed to the oxygen-rich surface, which may influence the decomposition rate. We show that the soil respiration rate of a disturbed temperate peatland is strongly controlled by the peat's quality and especially its polysaccharides content. The polysaccharide content of soil profiles in a wider range of peatland sites with differing degrees of disturbance was inferred by means of solid-state C-13 NMR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The data confirmed a strong decline in polysaccharide content with depth and a poor OM quality of surface peat in soils drained decades ago. We combined the evidence from respiration and spectroscopic measurements to deduce the sensitivity of peatland carbon loss with respect to OM quality by scaling measured quality to a 142-years record of peatland subsidence and carbon loss at one of the sites. According to the functional relationship between quality and respiration, the measured average annual carbon loss rate of 2.5 t C ha(-1) at that site was 20 t C ha(-1) at the onset of peatland drainage and dropped to less than 1 t C ha(-1) in recent times.

AB The increasing importance of the conservation value of managed grasslands has led to many studies exploring edaphic determinants of grassland biodiversity. Most studies, however, come either from very large areas, where biogeographical factors such as dispersal limitation may play a role, or from small, but ecologically rather uniform, regions. In addition, few studies further distinguish between plant specialists and generalists in the interpretation of the observed patterns. Here we studied species richness in semi-natural, managed grasslands in the StraA3/4ovsk, vrchy Mountains in the West Carpathians, Slovakia, where there is a matrix of different bedrocks (crystalline, sandstone, claystone, limestone) on a steep altitudinal gradient. In 89 vegetation plots we sampled the species composition of vascular plants and bryophytes and measured soil chemistry, slope angle, heat index, altitude and soil depth. We further applied Ellenberg indicator values and classified species into community specialists or generalists based on the analysis of a large phytosociological database. Using cluster analysis, we delimited five vegetation types that clearly differed in response to soil characteristics. Species richness varied between 19 and 64 species per 16 m(2). The main compositional gradient correlated with measured soil pH and calcium, but species richness was not significantly correlated with these factors. Soil available phosphorus was not associated with species composition as has been found elsewhere, but it did correlate negatively with species richness and the richness of specialists. Overall, species richness was largely driven by the number of specialists in the plot and particular vegetation types differed conspicuously in their number. We further found significant effects of iron, potassium and sodium on species richness, species composition and the representation of specialists and generalists. Our results provide new insights into the determinants of diversity in managed grasslands as well as to the theoretical species pool concept, explaining species richness variation along a pH gradient.

AB Although estimates of the annual methane (CH4) flux from agriculturally managed peatlands exist, knowledge of controls over the variation of CH4 at different time-scales is limited due to the lack of high temporal-resolution data. Here we present CH4 fluxes measured from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique at an abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada. The goals of the study were to identify the controls on the seasonal variations in CH4 flux and to quantify the annual CH4 flux. The seasonal variation in daily CH4 flux was not strong in the two study years, however a few periods of pronounced emissions occurred in the late growing season. The daily average CH4 flux was small relative to other studies, ranging from -4.1 to 9.9 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 2014-15 and from -7.1 to 12.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 2015-16. Stepwise multiple regression was used to investigate controls on CH4 flux and this analysis found shifting controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season. During the early growing season CH4 flux was closely related to carbon dioxide fixation rates, suggesting substrate availability was the main control. The peak growing season CH4 flux was principally controlled by the CH4 oxidation in 2014, where the CH4 flux decreased and increased with soil temperature at 50 cm and soil water content at 10 cm, but a contrasting temperature-CH4 relation was found in 2015. The late growing season CH4 flux was found to be regulated by the variation in water table level and air temperature in 2014. The annual CH4 emission was near zero in both study years (0.36 +/- 0.30 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 0.13 +/- 0.38 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16), but fell within the range of CH4 emissions reported for agriculturally managed peatlands elsewhere.

AB The results of eco-geochemical survey of hummocky bogs of the Kola Peninsula at the southern border of their area showed that the climate changes in the recent 60-80 years and the impact of aerotechnogenic pollution did not affect the area of hummocky bog complexes and the depth of the thawing peat layer of conventionally reference and impact high-moor bogs. In the zone affected by the emissions from the Severonikel smelter (Monchegorsk), the content of Ni and Cu in the peat high-moor soils (Cryic Ombric Fibric Histosols) is 60-90 times higher than the level of accumulation of the same metals in the peat of conventionally reference bogs. The S, Cd, Cr, and Pb contents in the compared bog massifs did not differ significantly. In the frozen horizon of the impact bogs, the Ni and Cu content was significantly greater (2 times) than their content in the same layer of the conventionally background bogs, which indicates a vertical migration of pollutants down the peat profile and a deeper technogenic transformation of cryogenic massifs due to the effects of atmospheric emissions from the plant. The profile distribution of pollutants (Ni, Cu, Pb, S, Cr, and Cd) in the peat layer of the impact and conventionally background bogs has its own specific features.

AB In 65 samples, we got values (unusually replicable and consistent for this type of work) of concentration, C-14/C-13 (AMS) age, and delta C-13 for: peat, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), peat fractions, and dissolved CO2 and CH4 at 50-cm intervals down to 700 cm in Ellergower Moss, a rainwater-dependent raised (domed) bog in southwest Scotland. (1) We attribute the consistency of the results to Ellergower Moss being unusually homogeneous, with unusually low hydraulic conductivity, and containing only a few gas spaces; and to the sampling methods including 18-month equilibration of in situ samplers. (2) The dissolved gas concentration depth profiles are convex and very similar to each other, though CO2 is 5-10 times more concentrated than CH4, while the profile of DOC is concave. (3) The age profile of peat is near linearly proportional to depth; that for DOC is about 500-1000 yr younger than the peat at the same depth; the dissolved gases are 500-4300 years younger than the peat. The age of the operational peat fractions humic acid and humin is similar to that of whole peat. (4) The delta C-13 profile for deep peat is almost constant; delta C-13-CO2 is More enriched than the peat (delta C-13-CO2 35%. more); delta C-13-CH4 is the same amount more depleted. Nearer the surface both dissolved gases become steadily more depleted, delta C-13 is about 20%. less at the surface. (5) A simulation shows that mass flow can account for the concentration and age profiles of DOC, but for the gases diffusion and an additional source near the surface are needed as well, and diffusion accounts for over 99% of the dissolved gas movements. (6) The same processes must operate in other peatlands but the results for Ellergower should not be extrapolated uncritically to them. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HISTORY; SOILS
AB An experimental approach has been used to establish whether medieval ironworking activity could be identified in peat bogs using mineral magnetic measurements. The research project comprised three elements. First, magnetic susceptibility and remanence properties were obtained for materials from an experimental iron smelt, in a furnace of medieval design, and from material collected during the excavation of the medieval bloomery at Llwyn Du in Coed y Brenin, Snowdonia. Materials sampled and measured included charcoal, aerial dust, roasted bog ore and furnace dust. A second experiment determined whether small amounts of aerial dust released from the furnace could be detected in accumulating peat samples. This was achieved by sprinkling small quantities of dust on to a constructed 'peat core' that had no detectable magnetic signature prior to the addition of the dust. The application rates used were within the range expected to fall on a peat bog located close to a medieval furnace. Thirdly, mineral magnetic measurements were made on a peat core collected close to the Llwyn Du bloomery. The results confirm that toasted bog ore, aerial dust released from and dust accumulating in the furnace after a smelt. are magnetically detectable. The aerial dust and roasted bog ore produced enhanced susceptibility and remanence signatures in the constructed 'peat core' experiments. Peaks in IRM(0.88T) and HIRM were measured in the Llwyn Do peat monolith and appear to correlate with a time when the medieval bloomery was operational. The results presented here suggest that it is possible to identify evidence of past ironworking in peat bogs using mineral magnetic measurements and that the signatures remain well preserved in the peat record even after burial for several hundred years.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for understanding global methane (CH4) and greenhouse gas budgets. We evaluated the CH4 emissions from a cool temperate bog in northern Japan and their responses to environmental drivers based on four years of quasi-continuous measurements with the eddy covariance method. The bog acted as a 13 to 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1) CH4 source. High annual CH4 emissions outweighed the annual carbon dioxide (CO2) sink strength (-223 to -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), except in one year, resulting in a net greenhouse gas source at the annual timescale, although greater uncertainties in the annual CO2 budget (14%) than the CH4 budget (5%) caused uncertainties in the greenhouse gas budget. The seasonal variations in the CH4 fluxes were well explained by soil temperatures in the deep layers and the leaf area index of vascular plants. Pressure-driven CH4 emissions were measured at synoptic timescales, indicating high contributions of ebullition emissions. The episodic CH4 emissions during two typhoon events accounted for 5.1% of the annual fluxes in 2018. Nighttime CH4 emissions were greater than daytime emissions during the early growing season, possibly due to the hydrodynamic transport associated with soil temperature instability at night. The annual CH4 emissions were high when the dissolved oxygen concentration at 10 cm was low and the annual CO2 sink was great, suggesting the importance of anaerobic conditions and substrate availability, which facilitate CH4 production and restrict CH4 oxidation. The climate conditions in the study years were within the normal range; thus, further long-term measurements covering a wide range of climatic conditions will be required.

AB Our study was carried out on three peat bogs that since the 1960s have been subjected to different degrees of anthropopression. The main objective of the research was assessment of heavy metal accumulation potential in peat bogs and in leaves of species growing on these peat bogs, namely Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), birch (Betula pendula Roth), and wild rosemary (Ledum palustre L.). The concentrations of lead and cadmium in peat of Bagno Bruch (the Upper Silesian Industrial Region) exceeded the permissible levels for soils of protected natural areas. Heavy metal concentrations in plants growing in all analyzed sites show no toxic levels. Among the examined species, birch showed the highest ability to accumulate cadmium and zinc.

AB Widespread changes in arctic and boreal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values captured by satellite platforms indicate that northern ecosystems are experiencing rapid ecological change in response to climate warming. Increasing temperatures and altered hydrology are driving shifts in ecosystem biophysical properties that, observed by satellites, manifest as long-term changes in regional NDVI. In an effort to examine the underlying ecological drivers of these changes, we used field-scale remote sensing of NDVI to track peatland vegetation in experiments that manipulated hydrology, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. In addition to NDVI, we measured percent cover by species and leaf area index (LAI). We monitored two peatland types broadly representative of the boreal region. One site was a rich fen located near Fairbanks, Alaska, at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX), and the second site was a nutrient-poor bog located in Northern Minnesota within the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. We found that NDVI decreased with long-term reductions in soil moisture at the APEX site, coincident with a decrease in photosynthetic leaf area and the relative abundance of sedges. We observed increasing NDVI with elevated temperature at the SPRUCE site, associated with an increase in the relative abundance of shrubs and a decrease in forb cover. Warming treatments at the SPRUCE site also led to increases in the LAI of the shrub layer. We found no strong effects of elevated CO2 on community composition. Our findings support recent studies suggesting that changes in NDVI observed from satellite platforms may be the result of changes in community composition and ecosystem structure in response to climate warming.

AB Eighty-one cutaway peat production fields with a total area of about 9000 ha exist and were studied in Estonia in 2005-2015. Only a very small number of the fields (seven) have been restored-either afforested or used for growing berries. The re-vegetation of Estonian cutaway peat production fields is mainly the result of natural processes, which are generally very slow due to an unfavourable water regime or a too thin remaining peat layer. The fields are mostly covered by cotton grass and birches. Often sparse vegetation covers 15-20% of a peat field, but some fields have turned into heaths or grasslands with plant coverage up to 60%. However, due to changes in environmental (mainly hydrological) conditions and peat characteristics (mainly peat type), these areas can also be new niches for several species. A number of moss species new to or rare in Estonia, e.g. Pohlia elongata, Ephemerum serratum, Campylopus introflexus and Bryum oblongum, were recorded.

AB Despite the great potential of peat bogs as climatic archives, to date only few studies have focused on the climatic controls on cellulose isotopic composition in modern bog plants. This study attempts to calibrate plant-climate relationships by sampling a set of modern plant species (both vascular plants and mosses) and bog surface waters along an altitude transect in Switzerland. Isotopic analyses of water samples show that the delta(18)O-values of surface bog waters follow the trend of precipitation despite significant scatter in the data set. Detailed sampling of surface waters within one bog shows that delta(18)O-values vary widely and are closely related to the micro-topography of the bog surface. More enriched O-18/O-16 ratios in water samples collected from small raised hummocks than the ones collected from hollows are documented in both horizontal and vertical profiles. A delta(18)O-deltaD plot indicates that the process leading to the isotopic enrichment of the uppermost surface waters is evaporation, greater above Sphagnum covered hummocks than above open pools. To investigate the implications of such high variability of source water for plant alpha-cellulose delta(18)O-values, a detailed study of both surface water and alpha-cellulose delta(18)O-values within one site is conducted. The large delta(18)O variability observed in surface waters is found to be considerably smoothed in a-cellulose (by a factor of 5-10 depending on the plant species). This indicates that the water used by plant photosynthetic processes reflects the isotopic composition of the average annual precipitation. This points to a source water level for plants of a few decimeters where the variations are smaller than at the air-water interface. The response of the alpha-cellulose delta(18)O to the environmental gradient along the altitude transect varies considerably from species to species. For most of the species studied, the delta(18)O-values decrease with altitude, following the trends of delta(18)O-values in precipitation and in surface water samples. Some species, the cotton sedge Eriophorum vaginatum and the moss Sphagnum capillifolium, show statistically significant delta(18)O relationships to an altitude of -1.8 parts per thousand /km and -2.9 parts per thousand /km respectively. However, some other plant species, Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium uliginosum, Andromeda poliflora, Carex pauciflora, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Sphagnum magellanicum, do not, or only partially, reflect changes in climatic parameters associated with an altitude increase. Furthermore, changes in relative humidity, which are not correlated with altitude, are found to explain a large part of the variability in delta(18)O-values for the sedge Carex pauciflora and the moss Sphagnum cuspidatum. Therefore, this study confirms the importance of species-specific studies when interpreting O-18/O-16 ratios of macrofossils along a fossil peat sequence as a record of past climate changes. Our study allows to extend the mechanistic model that isotopically links source water and cellulose to the physiological specificities of sedges and mosses. A comparison of the modeled and calculated net biological fractionation factors for Eriophorum vaginatum and Sphagnum capillifolium reveals that these two species appear to have a more homogeneous leaf reservoir than trees.

AB The national reserve of Lavours marshes and mires was among the sites studied in the regional research program PETRA (2003-2005). There, the macrofossils of a 9 m thick peat column was described by Jenny Schulz for a post-doc research work directed by Arlette Laplace-Dolonde. Here, we aimed to publish this work and to present our interpretation of Jenny's profil. The main results are : (1) the occurrence of 6 m of Phragmites-peat representing around 6 000 years where Phragmites australis, Thelipteris palustris, Carex spp. and Cladium mariscus represent most of the organic matter; (2) this long lasting community replacement by a Juncus spp.-stand with Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani at 1.2 m deep and around 2 500-2 000 BP; (3) this first Juncus-stand change to a Carex spp. community which lived room for a second Juncus spp.-stand with Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani at the top of the peat. We consider the reed community as a natural peat producing vegetation in a steady state equilibrium in opposition to the Juncus-stands, constrained by human induced actions like mowing or grazing and rapidly changing to a Carex paniculata-stand when the human constrain stops.

AB To investigate the effect that restoration has on the microbiome of wetland soils, we used 16S amplicon sequencing to characterize the soil prokaryotic communities of retired cranberry farms that were restored to approximate the peat wetlands they once were. For comparison, we also surveyed the soil communities of active cranberry farms, retired cranberry farms and natural peat wetlands that were never farmed. Our results show that the prokaryotic communities of active cranberry farms are distinct from those of natural peat wetlands. Moreover, 4 years after restoration, the prokaryotic community structure of restored cranberry farms had shifted, resulting in a community more similar to natural peat wetlands than to active farms. Meanwhile, the prokaryotic communities of retired cranberry farms remained similar to those of active farms. The observed differences in community structure across site types corresponded with significant differences in inferred capacity for denitrification, methanotrophy and methanogenesis, and community composition was also correlated with previously published patterns of denitrification and carbon sequestration measured from the same soil samples. Taken together, these results suggest that ecological restoration efforts have the potential to restore ecosystem functions of soils and that they do so by `rewilding' the communities of resident soil microbes.

AB Unique peatland properties, such as their ability to preserve intact ancient human remains (bog bodies) and to store globally significant quantities of atmospheric CO2, can be attributed to their low rates of enzymic decomposition. Peatland soils are normally devoid of molecular oxygen in all, but the uppermost layer, and thus enzymes such as phenol oxidase, which require molecular oxygen for their activity, are rarely active. Interestingly, even the activities of enzymes such as hydrolases that have no oxygen requirement, are also extremely limited in peatlands. Here, we show that those low hydrolase activities can be indirectly attributed to oxygen constraints on phenol oxidase. On addition of oxygen, phenol oxidase activity increased 7-fold, P<0.05, a response that allowed phenolic depletion in the peatland soil. Phenolic materials are highly inhibitory to enzymes and their lower abundance allowed higher hydrolase activities (beta-glucosidase 26%, P<0.05, phosphatase 18%, P<0.05, sulphatase 47%, P<0.01, xylosidase 16%, P<0.05 and chitinase 22%, P<0.05). Thus, oxygen constraints upon phenol oxidase activity promote conditions that inhibit decomposition. This mechanism has important implications for preservation of archaeological organic materials, sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and potentially in the preservation of food and treatment of water pollution.

AB The article assesses the pyrogenic load and the environmental consequences of the 2016 fire within the northeastern part of the Great Vasyugan mire. To assess the pyrogenic load in 2016-2018 monitoring of atmospheric deposition of Cu and Pb, Zn, Cd within the post-pyrogenic area and beyond was organized, the content of heavy metals in mire waters, river waters, in peat and plants was determined. Analysis of the data showed that the composition of atmospheric deposition in post-pyrogenic areas significantly increases the amount of Zn is 2 times, Pb is 14 times, Cu is 4 times, Cd is up to 9 times, and the territory associated with the pollution of Zn and Pb as a result of the 2016 fire covers an area of 8 km, which is consistent with a wind rose. Studies have shown that in the upper layer (0-5 cm) peat a significant increase in the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb is observed 3-6 times relative to the background site 100 m from the boundary. The zone of extreme pollution with heavy metals is limited mainly by the zone of intense burning of the surface, however, a significant (2-fold) increase in the concentration of Zn, Cd, and Pb, with the exception of Cu, is also observed outside it, mainly due to the migration of elements with waters. The content of heavy metals also significantly increases in post-pyrogenic areas in Sphagnum fuscum and Pinus sylvestris. In bog and river waters, a significant excess of background concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb was also found to be a factor of 2-10. Noteworthy are the more often higher concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb in the pore waters of the area of the pyrogenic load class 2 during the growing season which is characterised by partial burn up of the surface within 40-60% and an extreme increase in the content (up to 25 times relative to the background) at the end of the season in the area of the first class of pyrogenic load with complete burn up of the surface.

AB 1 Above-ground biomass was measured at bog hummock, bog hollow and poor-fen sites in Mer Bleue, a large, raised ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Ont., Canada. The average above-ground biomass was 587 g m(-2) in the bog, composed mainly of shrubs and Sphagnum capitula. In the poor fen, the average biomass was 317 g m(2), comprising mainly sedges and herbs and Sphagnum capitula. Vascular plant above-ground biomass was greater where the water table was lower, with a similar but weaker relationship for Sphagnum capitula and vascular leaf biomass. 2 Below-ground biomass averaged 2400 g m(2) at the bog hummock site, of which 300 g m(2) was fine roots (<2 mm diameter), compared with 1400 g m 2 in hollows (fine roots 450 g m(2)) and 1200 g m(2) at the poor-fen site. 3 Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) Of CO2 was measured in chambers and used to derive ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis. Under high light flux (PAR of 1500 mu mol m(2) s(1)), NEE ranged across sites from 0.08 to 0.22 mg m(2) s(1) (a positive value indicates ecosystem uptake) in the spring and summer, but fell to -0.01 to -0.13 mg m(-2) s(1) (i.e. a release of CO2) during a late-summer dry period. 4 There was a general agreement between a combination of literature estimates of photosynthetic capacity for shrubs and mosses and measured biomass and summertime CO2 uptake determined by the eddy covariance technique within a bog footprint (0.40 and 0.35-0.40 mg m(2) s(1), respectively). 5 Gross photosynthesis was estimated to be about 530 g m(2) year(1), total respiration 460 g m(-2) year(1), and export of DOC, DIC and CH4 10 g m(2) year(1), leaving an annual C sequestration rate of 60 g m(-2) year(1). Root production and decomposition are important parts of the C budget of the bog. Root C production was estimated to be 161-176 g m(2) year(1), resulting in fractional turnover rates of 0.2 and 1 year(1) for total and fine roots, respectively.

AB Soil moisture is one of the key parameters controlling biogeochemical processes in peat and other organic soils. To understand and accurately model soil moisture dynamics and peatland hydrological functioning in general, knowledge about soil hydraulic properties is crucial. As peat differs in several aspects from mineral soils, the applicability of standard hydraulic functions (e.g. van Genuchten-Mualem model) developed for mineral soils to peat soil moisture dynamics might be questionable. In this study, the hydraulic properties of five types of peat and other organic soils from different German peatlands have been investigated by laboratory evaporation experiments. Soil hydraulic parameters of the commonly-applied van Genuchten-Mualem model and the bimodal model by Durner (1994) were inversely estimated using HYDRUS-1D and global optimization. The objective function included measured pressure heads and cumulative evaporation. The performance of eight model set-ups differing in the degree of complexity and the choice of fitting parameters were evaluated. Depending on the model set-up, botanical origin and degree of peat decomposition, the quality of the model results differed strongly. We show that fitted 'tortuosity' parameters tau of the van Genuchten-Mualem model can deviate very much from the default value of 0.5 that is frequently applied to mineral soils. Results indicate a rather small decrease of the hydraulic conductivity with increasing suction compared to mineral soils. Optimizing tau did therefore strongly reduce the model error at dry conditions when high pressure head gradients occurred. As strongly negative pressure heads in the investigated peatlands rarely occur, we also reduced the range of pressure heads in the inversion to a 'wet range' from 0 to 200 cm. For the 'wet range' model performance was highly dependent on the inclusion of macropores. Here, fitting only the macropore fraction of the bimodal model as immediately drainable additional pore space seems to be a practical approach to account for the macropore effect, as the fitting of the full bimodal model led to only marginal further improvement of model performance. This keeps the number of parameters low and thus provides a model that is more easily managed in pedotransfer function development and practical applications like large scale simulations. Our findings point out first options to improve the performance of the frequently-used simple single-domain models when they are applied to organic soils. We suggest further performance evaluation of these models during wetting periods when they are known to fail to describe preferential and non-equilibrium flow phenomena. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Terrestrial and aquatic ecological productivity are often nutrient limited in subarctic permafrost environments. High latitude regions are experiencing significant climatic change, including rapid warming and changing precipitation patterns, which may result in changes in nutrient dynamics within terrestrial and aquatic systems and hydrochemical transport between them. The objective of this research was to characterize changes in runoff quantity and quality within, and between peatlands and ponds throughout the snow-free summer season. Two ponds and their catchments were monitored over the snow-free season to measure changes in hydrologic storage, and to determine how water chemistry changed with the evolution of the frost table depth. Thresholds in hydrologic storage combined with frost table position (which inhibited infiltration and storage) produced nonlinear responses for runoff generation through highly conductive shallow peat layers while deeper, less conductive layers retarded flow. Greater inputs were required to exceed hydrologic storage (fill and spill) as a deepening frost table increased the hydrologically active portion of the soil, leading to seasonal variability in runoff pathways between peatlands and ponds. Runoff contributions to ponds were an integral component of the snow-free water balance during the study period, contributing up to 60% of all snow-free inputs. Groundwater chemistry (and pond chemistry following runoff events when ponds were connected with peatlands) reflected the different depths of peat and mineral soil accessed throughout the season. This work has improved scientific understanding of the combined controls of hydrologic inputs and ground frost on runoff and nutrient transport between peatlands and ponds, and sheds insight into how nutrient dynamics in cold regions may evolve under a changing climate.

AB The elemental composition and spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids isolated from different sampling media (topsoil, ground and surface water) of a natural fen area (high portion of organic soils) were examined to reveal the effects of land use history. These effects need to be known if dissolved humic substances are to be a major factor in identifying the impact of present and future changes in land use. Dissolved fulvic acids (topsoil, groundwater) from highly degraded peatlands (due to a long-term agricultural use) exhibit lower C/N ratios, higher absorption in the UV spectra, and higher absorption at 1,620 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectra compared with fulvic acids from relatively intact peatlands. These properties illustrate that long-term agricultural use with high inputs results in increased aromatic structures and a further humification of dissolved fulvic acids due to very strong peat decomposition compared with relatively intact peatlands. Synchronous fluorescence spectra also indicate the higher level of aromatic structures within fulvic acids isolated from sites with long-term agricultural use (high peat decomposition) compared with a land use history resulting in a lower peat decomposition. The different sources of fulvic acids in surface water (precipitation, runoff, interflow, groundwater) are the main reason for these effects not being detected in fulvic acids isolated from surface water. Short-term changes in land use characterized by a transition from crop farming to an unimproved grassland were found not to affect the spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids. A humification index deduced from the synchronous fluorescence spectra is proposed. We have strong evidence that dissolved humic substances indicate changes in the environmental conditions (both anthropogenic and natural) of wetlands with a high proportion of organic soils.

AB Afforestation is one of the most popular after-use options of cut-away peatlands in Scandinavia since it has both economic and aesthetic values and therefore the interest concerning the carbon stock often focuses on tree stands. Consequently, ground vegetation is readily disregarded in the present calculations of the climatic impact of afforestation. However, at the early stages of afforestation vigorous ground vegetation may have a major role in carbon sequestration. The biomass and C stock of ground vegetation and young tree seedlings were examined on an ash-fertilized and afforested cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different mixtures and quantities of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Betula pubescens Ehrh. seeds were sown on randomized halves of split plots while the other halves were left unsown. The plant biomass was harvested four growing seasons after the treatments. The live above-ground biomass of ground vegetation on a cut-away peatland was up to two times that of tree seedlings. Furthermore, the below-ground biomass of ground vegetation and tree seedlings was equal to the above-ground biomass, or even greater. In particular, the biomass of mosses multiplied on ash-based fertilized areas compared to the Forest PK-fertilized areas. Our study proved that at the early stages of afforestation ground vegetation was even more important in biomass production and C stock than tree seedlings. Consequently, our results suggest that ground vegetation biomass should also be considered when the climatic impact of afforestation of cut-away peatlands is being calculated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many degraded ecosystems are subject to restoration attempts, providing new opportunities to unravel the processes of ecological community assembly. Restoration of previously drained northern peatlands, primarily to promote peat and carbon accumulation, has created hundreds of thousands of new open water pools. We assessed the potential benefits of this wetland restoration for aquatic biodiversity, and how communities reassemble, by comparing pool ecosystems in regions of the UK Pennines on intact (never drained) versus restored (blocked drainage-ditches) peatland. We also evaluated the conceptual idea that comparing reference ecosystems in terms of their compositional similarity to null assemblages (and thus the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic assembly) can guide evaluations of restoration success better than analyses of community composition or diversity. Community composition data highlighted some differences in the macro invertebrate composition of restored pools compared to undisturbed peatland pools, which could be used to suggest that alternative end-points to restoration were influenced by stochastic processes. However, widely used diversity metrics indicated no differences between undisturbed and restored pools. Novel evaluations of restoration using null models confirmed the similarity of deterministic assembly processes from the national species pool across all pools. Stochastic elements were important drivers of between-pool differences at the regional-scale but the scale of these effects was also similar across most of the pools studied. The amalgamation of assembly theory into ecosystem restoration monitoring allows us to conclude with more certainty that restoration has been successful from an ecological perspective in these systems. Evaluation of these UK findings compared to those from peatlands across Europe and North America further suggests that restoring peatland pools delivers significant benefits for aquatic fauna by providing extensive new habitat that is largely equivalent to natural pools. More generally, we suggest that assembly theory could provide new benchmarks for planning and evaluating ecological restoration success. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands in the mid-Atlantic outer coastal plain region contain obligate hydrophyte species which were harvested and replaced by facultative tree species. The Great Dismal Swamp was drained from the colonial era until 1974, when water levels were partially restored. In September 2013, further restoration consisting of two large weirs followed extensive peat-burning fires. This study evaluated depth-to-water-table and vegetation structure both prior to and following weir operation. Wells were installed and depth-to-water-table was recorded continuously from 201.3 to 2015 within six of the 16 forested stands where vegetation species dominance was quantified for tree, shrub, herb, and vine strata. Following weir installation in 2013, water tables rose an average of 28.08 cm in 2014 and 32.69 cm in 2016, during the June-July peak of the growing season. Most water levels were too low to meet the federal regulatory indicator of wetland hydrology or the seasonally flooded, saturated hydrologic regime typical of peatlands. After restoration, species dominance and frequency, as well as metrics based on hydrophyte dominance and floristic quality in study plots, were unchanged. Ordinations detected no directional shift in plant community composition among pre- and post-weir periods. Although insufficient time may have passed for shifts in plant communities, additional increases in water level above those reported here appear necessary to restore a pre-disturbance hydrologic regime and plant community structure. However, above some threshold water level, planted trees will exhibit increased mortality and limit reestablishment.

AB As part of a study investigating the carbon balance of a blanket bog, we made an assessment of the spatial variation of radiocarbon concentrations in the surface layers of a small area of peatland in the north of England. The peat depth at which bomb-C-14 content was the highest varied considerably between cores sampled from across the site. At several sampling locations, C-14 levels >100% Modern were confined to the surface 8 cm, whereas bomb C-14 was evident at 1 site, located only meters away, to a depth of at least 12-16 cm. Using the layer where C-14 levels first exceeded 100% Modern as a chronological reference layer, we estimated the carbon accumulation rate over the last 50 yr for the surface peat at each site (range similar to 20 to similar to 125 g C m(2) yr(-1)). Our results show that although carbon accumulation over the last 50 yr was similar across the site, variation in the depth to which bomb C-14 was evident implied considerable variation in the vertical peat growth rate.

It was demonstrated that typically the maximum concentration of microorganisms is found in the soil layer. In contrast to the semihydromorphic soils on the margins of a bog, where the microbial population drops off sharply with depth, in the hydromorphic peat soils, microorganisms are evenly distributed over the entire profile. The total microbial biomass in peat bogs amounts to tonnes per hectare when estimates are extrapolated to the entire thickness of the peat.

AB Wildfire is the largest disturbance affecting boreal peatlands, however, little is known about the controls on post-fire peatland vegetation recovery. While small-scale variation in burn severity can reduce post-fire moss water availability, high water table (WT) positions following wildfire are also critical to enable the re-establishment of keystone peatland mosses (i.e. Sphagnum). Thus, post-fire moss water availability is also likely a function of landscape-scale controls on peatland WT dynamics, specifically, connectivity to groundwater flow systems (i.e. hydrogeological setting). For this reason, we assessed the interacting controls of hydrogeological setting and burn severity on post-fire moss water availability in three burned, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in Alberta's Boreal Plains. At all sites, variation in burn severity resulted in a dichotomy between post-fire surface covers that: (1) exhibited low water availability, regardless of WT position, and had minimal (<5%) moss re-establishment (i.e. lightly burned feather mosses and severely burned Sphagnum fuscum) or (2) exhibited high water availability, depending on WT position, and had substantial (>50%) moss re-establishment (i.e. lightly burned S. fuscum and where depth of burn was >0.05 m). Notably, hydrogeological setting influenced the spatial coverage of these post-fire surface covers by influencing pre-fire WTs and stand characteristics (e.g., shading). Because feather moss cover is controlled by tree shading, lightly burned feather mosses were ubiquitous (>25%) in drier peatlands (deeper pre-fire WTs) that were densely treed and had little connection to large groundwater flow systems. Moreover, hydrogeological setting also controlled post-fire WT positions, thereby affecting moss re-establishment in post-fire surface covers that were dependent on WT position (e.g., lightly burned S.fuscum). Accordingly, higher recolonization rates were observed in a peatland located in a groundwater flow through system that had a shallow post-fire WT. Therefore, we argue that hydrogeological setting influences post-fire recovery in two ways: (1) by influencing vegetation structure prior to wildfire, thereby controlling the coverage of post-fire surface covers and (2) by influencing post-fire WT positions. These results suggest that post-fire moss recovery in peatlands isolated from groundwater flow systems may be particularly susceptible to droughts and future climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB A radiocarbon dated pollen and macrofossil record from Lang Lochs Mire, Shetland, is presented. Late-glacial minerogenic and early Holocene gyttja sediments underlie mid and late Holocene peat. These indicate that the area was free from ice sometime before 13 000 BP and there is evidence for a typical Devensian Late-glacial climatic sequence as recorded elsewhere in Scotland.
   Until c. 10 500 BP an open vegetation with abundant mosses amongst dwarf shrubs and herbs characterized the surrounding area. At c. 10 500 BP gyttja deposition started, aquatic plants became abundant in the loch and Betula woodland developed around the loch. From c. 9700 BP to c. 7700 BP Corylus was also important. During this time Alnus, Quercus and Ulmus pollen values rose but remained compatible with a long distance source for the pollen.
   At c. 7700 BP gyttja deposition ceased at the sample site and a poor fen developed. Around this, heathland and blanket peat vegetation started to develop from c. 7000 BP. By c. 6000 BP the area was largely treeless and after c. 5000 BP blanket peat spread and eventually dominated all but the steepest slopes.
   Pollen profile changes after c. 4500 BP can be attributed to either the spread of blanket peat or the effects of Neolithic peoples. The changes coincide with the arrival of Neolithic people elsewhere in Shetland. The first clear indication of Neolithic activity is dated to c. 3000 BP and coincides with increased activity in agriculturally more favourable areas of Shetland.
   Records of phytogeographically significant species are discussed and the value of combined macrofossil and pollen investigations is illustrated. The combined approach has helped to distinguish site and regional components of the pollen rain, the vegetational development of both the site and the surrounding area and has given a more accurate record of the occurrence of a number of taxa than could be achieved by pollen analysis alone.

AB Nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient in many peatland ecosystems. Enhanced N deposition, a major component of global climate change, affects ecosystem carbon (C) balance and alters soil C storage by changing plant and soil properties. However, the effects of enhanced N deposition on peatland ecosystems are poorly understood. We conducted a two-year N additions field experiment in a peatland dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum in the Da Xing'an Mountains, Northeast China. Four levels of N treatments were applied: (1) CK (no N added), (2) N1 (6 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), (3) N2 (12 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), and (4) N3 (24 gN m(-2) yr(-1)). Plant and soil material was harvested at the end of the Second growing season. N additions increased litter N and phosphorus (P) content, as well as S-glucosidase, invertase, and acid-phosphatase activity, but decreased litter C:N and C:P ratios. Litter carbon content remained unchanged. N additions increased available NH4+-N and NO3--N as well as total Gram-positive (Gram+), Gram-negative (Gram-), and total bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in shallow soil (0-15 cm depth). An increase in these PLFAs was accompanied by a decrease in soil labile organic C (microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon), and appeared to accelerate decomposition and reduce the stability of the soil C pool. Invertase and urease activity in shallow soils and acid-phosphatase activity in deep soils (15-30 cm depth) was inhibited by N additions. Together, these findings suggest that an increase in N deposition in peatlands could accelerate litter decomposition and the loss of labile C, as well as alter microbial biomass and function.

AB The accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the plants of tundra peatlands on the coast of the Barents Sea (Nenets autonomous okrug) has been studied. Two- and three-ringed polyarenes are prevalent in the plants on the coast of the Barents Sea with their share in the total PAH content varying from 81 to 97%. The highest total content of polyarenes is observed in Sphagnum lindbergii Shimp., Carex aquatilis Wahlenb., and Eriophorum russeolum Fr. The plants growing in tundra and forest-tundra have identical qualitative and quantitative PAH compositions allowing for extrapolation of our data to other peatlands in the reference areas. A tight correlation between the PAH compositions of the upper peat layers and the dominant plants in the botanical composition of peat is observed. The correlation coefficients decrease with depth, which is associated with the increasing degree of peat decomposition. No accumulation peaks of heavy PAHs are observed in the active and permafrost layers of the peat in the waterlogged hollows and peat mounds of the northern tundra peatlands, which determines a decrease in the total mass fraction of polyarenes in these peatlands by an order of magnitude in comparison with the forest-tundra peatlands. Presumably, this is related to a slowed down decomposition of lignin under tundra conditions.

AB The effects of wood-ash fertilisation on tree stands, soil characteristics and ground vegetation were studied on a drained pine mire in Finland (64degrees51'N, 26degrees04'E, 62 m a.s.l.). The original site type was a treeless, mesotrophic Sphagnum papillosum fen. The site was drained in 1933 and the wood-a h fertilisation experiment was started in 1947. The treatments were: (i) unfertilised, (ii) wood-ash 8 t ha(-1), and (iii) wood-ash 16 t ha(-1).
   Drainage and ash application had radical and long-lasting consequences on the biological activity on the site and the vegetation compartments studied. The understorey vegetation had been profoundly, affected by the ash with almost complete transformation of the species and other life forms. Even 50 years after the ash treatment the changes in vegetation/site type and the tree stand were clearly visible. On the unfertilised plot, the biomass of ground vegetation consisted mostly of mosses and dwarf shrubs, but on the ash-treated plots it consisted mostly of herbs and grasses typical of upland forests.
   Ash treatment had promoted stem volume growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) substantially and for a long time. The total wood production on the ash plots during 1947-1994 was 13 and 17 times over that of the control plot. Unfertilised pine trees suffered from P and K deficiency throughout the study period. The concentrations of some plant nutrients (P, K) decreased during the past years on Ash8. No nutrient shortage afflicting the tree stand was observed on Ash16 during the study period.
   Ash application has also led to increased concentration of nutrients in the peat. A sizeable proportion of the mineral nutrients applied were still in the 0-20 cm peat layer. On the ash-treated plots the amount of soil nitrogen (0-20 cm) was 18 and 29 times and the amount of soil phosphorus 9 and 13 times over the amount bound by the tree stand and the ground vegetation (Ash8 and Ash16, respectively). The stock of potassium was generally small in the surface peat-only 60-90% of the amount of potassium bound in the tree stand and the ground vegetation.
   It was concluded that wood-ash had powerfully influenced the biological processes in surface peat. The decomposition of cellulose was significantly accelerated by both ash treatments. Ash fertilisation also increased the emissions Of CO2. The intensified decomposition rate in the litter, vegetation and peat explained to a large extent the accelerated growth of the Scotspine stands studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs are nutrient-poor systems and important carbon (C) sinks yet there remains a dearth of information on the belowground stoichiometry of C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), important determinants of substrate quality for microorganisms, in these systems. In this study, we quantified the C, N, P, and K concentrations of both hummock peat and dissolved matter as well as microbial extracellular enzyme activity from 0 to 10 cm depth in the long-term NPK fertilization plots at Mer Bleue bog. Greater N-loading resulted in significantly reduced C:N and greater C:P and C:K (p < 0.05) while the addition of NPK resulted in significantly lower C:P and C:K (p < 0.05) and lower C:N relative to N-only treatments but the difference in C:N was not significant (p > 0.05). Hydrolase enzyme activity followed resource allocation models with significantly suppressed N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and phosphatase activity (p < 0.05) and enhanced beta-d-glucosidase activity with greater N- and P-availability. The concentration of inhibitory phenolics was significantly greater with N-loading (p < 0.05), due in part to shifts in surface vegetation, while phenol oxidase activity was significantly suppressed by N (p < 0.05) with results suggesting greater suppression by NH4 (+) than NO3 (-). Taken together, these results suggest that higher levels of nutrients impact both microbial substrate quality as well as the activity of microbial enzymes that are key to the decomposition process that may ultimately decrease carbon sequestration in bogs.

AB The dominant inorganic anions and cations, and dissolved organic carbon have been measured in the pore waters expressed from peat cores taken from two Sphagnum bogs in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland:  Etang de la Gruyere (EGr) consists of > 6 m of peat representing more than 12,000 yr of peat formation while at La Tourbiere de Genevez (TGe) approximately 1.5 m of peat have accumulated over the past 5,000 yr.
   The pore-water analyses of the core taken at EGr show that the first 100 cm of the core are influenced only by atmospheric inputs.  The pH of the pore waters is constant (3.9 +/- 0.1) with depth.  Relative to the average composition of rainwater in this area, Na+ is enriched throughout the pore-water profile, K+ is neither enriched nor depleted, Mg2+ is significantly depleted in the deeper pore waters and Ca2+ strongly depleted throughout the profile.  The dominant process affecting the cations in these waters is ion exchange, with the peats behaving like a simple cation exchanger with ion preference decreasing in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > H+ > K+ much-greater-than Na+.
   In contrast, at TGe the pH increases from pH approximately 4 at the surface to pH 5 at 80 cm.  The Cl- and K+ concentrations are up to 10 times higher than rainwater values because of mixing of the bog pore water with nearby groundwaters.  The Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations increase with depth to concentrations up to 10 times higher than rainwater values, mainly because of the increasing importance of mineral dissolution within the profile.

AB We reviewed the studies on the impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from drained peatlands with the aim to identify the best practices for mitigation of detrimental water quality impacts. We concluded that so far there are no such practices that would effectively mitigate all harmful consequences of forest harvestings concurrently. Controlling water levels by executing drainage operations immediately after harvesting may decrease the exports of easily soluble and redox-sensitive elements, but the very intensive drainage necessary to lower water levels in highly decomposed peats, as those that typify peats at the clear-felling phase, would result in large exports of sediments and mineral nitrogen. Establishing a wetland buffer area between a forest harvested peatland and the receiving water course may decrease sediment and inorganic nutrient exports, but restored wetland buffers, in particular, may act as a source of DOC and dissolved organic nutrients to receiving water courses. Whole-tree harvesting might decrease nutrient exports in blanket peat areas, but its practical application is hindered by nutritional and forest harvest technology related aspects. We propose that future studies should focus on assessing the impacts of partial harvestings, which so far have received very limited attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The prairie sharp-tailed grouse Tympanuchus phasianellus campestris occurs throughout the north central region of North America. It is of management concern because it has decreased in the southeast portion of its range over the past three decades, including marked declines in Minnesota and the Great Lakes region, USA. Although there is general knowledge about the habitat requirements for this species, no quantitative lek site or landscape information has been documented. We quantified landscape composition around active and inactive sharp-tailed grouse lek sites and random points in brush landscapes in northeast Minnesota at multiple scales (200-3,000 m radii circles). Our objective was to compare landscape composition among these sites. We also developed a model to predict the probability of grouse lek site occurrence in the study area. Landscape composition around active and inactive lek sites differed from each other primarily at the 500 m and 1,000 m radii scales. Inactive sites had higher proportions of upland forest and brush cover types and active sites had a higher percentage of native grass than inactive sites. No differences were found in landscape composition between site types at the 200 m radius scale and only one landscape variable (number of cover types) was different at the 3,000 m radius scale. We found non-random distributions of this grouse species at four different scales. Random brush land sites differed from both active and inactive sites having higher percentages of forest and brush cover. In contrast, lek sites had more bare ground, emergent aquatic vegetation, bog brush and roads than the random points. A regression model for the grouse at the 3,000 m scale was used to predict the probability of grouse occurrence in the landscape. The model resulted in a spatial map with about 8% of the area having a probability of grouse occurrence of >80%. This information can be used to locate new lek sites and to guide management activities for this species.

AB Humic substances form most of the organic components of soil, peat and natural waters, and their structure and properties differ very much depending on their source. The aims of this study are to characterize humic acids (HAs) from raised bog peat, to evaluate the homogeneity of peat HAs within peat profiles, and to study peat humification impact on properties of HAs. A major impact on the structure of peat HAs have lignin-free raised bog biota (dominantly represented by bryophytes of different origin). On diagenesis scale, peat HAs have an intermediate position between the living organic matter and coal organic matter, and their structure is formed in a process in which more labile structures (carbohydrates, amino acids, etc.) are destroyed, while thermodynamically more stable aromatic and polyaromatic structures emerge as a result of abiotic synthesis. However, in comparison with soil, aquatic and other HAs, aromaticity of peat HAs is much lower. Comparatively, the raised bog peat HAs are at the beginning of the transformation process of living organic matter. Concentrations of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups change depending on the peat age and decomposition degree from where HAs have been isolated, and carboxylic acidity of peat HAs increases with peat depth and humification degree.

AB Biogeochemical processes in peatland environments, such as carbon sequestration and decomposition, are affected by variation in water supply. Across the boreal forest biome, climate change threatens to either alter rates of annual precipitation or skew the timing and ratio of rainfall and snowfall events. To simulate moisture variability during the ice-free season, cylindrical mesocosms (diameter 1.5 m) were installed in a southern boreal patterned fen in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to enable manipulations of antecedent snow conditions. The objectives of the study were to assess the utility of in situ mesocosms for peatland ecohydrology research and to test for effects of snow manipulations on fen plant communities. After spring thaw, initial water depths were greatest and dates of surface water disappearance were latest in the snow addition mesocosms, followed by the control and snow removal mesocosms. In contrast, maximum frost levels and frost disappearance dates in the snow addition mesocosms were intermediate to those of the control and snow removal mesocosms. Densification of snow during snow manipulation events is suggested to account for this confounding outcome. Of the nine plant taxa identified in the harvests of aboveground biomass from all mesocosms, buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata) biomass was most strongly related to variation in surface water conditions. Climate conditions that favour persistence of either herbaceous- or graminoid-dominated communities will likely affect the carbon storage function of southern boreal fens.

AB Peatlands are known as N2O sinks or low N2O sources due to nitrogen (N) limitation. However, climate warming and N deposition can modulate this limitation, and little is known about the combinative effects of them on N2O emission from boreal peatlands. In this study, experimental warming and N fertilization treatments were conducted at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to previous studies on permafrost peatland and alpine meadows, the effect of warming treatment on N2O flux was not detectable during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. The N fertilization treatment significantly increased the N2O flux by 1.61 nmol m(-2) S-1 due to increased N availability. Noticeably, warming reduced the effect of N fertilization treatment on N2O flux with high significance in the middle growing season of 2015. This can be attributed to low N availability caused by stimulated vegetation growth in the warming treatment. In addition, the results showed that total nitrogen was the main control on N2O emission under N fertilization, while dissolved organic carbon was the main driver under the combined treatment of warming and N fertilization. Due to elevated N2O emissions under N deposition/fertilization, the contribution of N2O to global warming and ozone depletion should not be ignored. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION
AB Under current scenarios of increasing greenhouse gases, the expected increases in global temperatures have the potential to affect, in many areas, the peatlands that now cover 14 % of the soil area of Canada. A model for estimating peatland sensitivity to climate warming was developed using published information on the current state of climate, vegetation, and permafrost together with the changes expected with a doubling of CO2. Calculations based on this sensitivity model and data for the areal extent and carbon content of organic soils in Canada, show that approximately 60 % of the area of Canadian peatlands is expected to be severely to extremely severely affected by climate warming. These peatlands, which are deemed most sensitive to climate warming, also contain 53 % of the 154 Gt of carbon found in organic soils.

AB Nitrogen (N) is a scarce nutrient commonly limiting primary productivity. Microbial decomposition of complex carbon (C) into small organic molecules (e.g., free amino acids) has been suggested to supplement biologically fixed N in northern peatlands. We evaluated the microbial (fungal, bacterial, and archaeal) genetic potential for organic N depolymerization in peatlands at Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota. We used guided gene assembly to examine the abundance and diversity of protease genes and further compared them to those of N fixation (nifH) genes in shotgun metagenomic data collected across depths and in two distinct peatland environments (bogs and fens). Microbial protease genes greatly outnumbered nifH genes, with the most abundant genes (archaeal M1 and bacterial trypsin [S01]) each containing more sequences than all sequences attributed to nifH. Bacterial protease gene assemblies were diverse and abundant across depth profiles, indicating a role for bacteria in releasing free amino acids from peptides through depolymerization of older organic material and contrasting with the paradigm of fungal dominance in depolymerization in forest soils. Although protease gene assemblies for fungi were much less abundant overall than those for bacteria, fungi were prevalent in surface samples and therefore may be vital in degrading large soil polymers from fresh plant inputs during the early stage of depolymerization. In total, we demonstrate that depolymerization enzymes from a diverse suite of microorganisms, including understudied bacterial and archaeal lineages, are prevalent within northern peatlands and likely to influence C and N cycling.
   IMPORTANCE Nitrogen (N) is a common limitation on primary productivity, and its source remains unresolved in northern peatlands that are vulnerable to environmental change. Decomposition of complex organic matter into free amino acids has been proposed as an important N source, but the genetic potential of microorganisms mediating this process has not been examined. Such information can inform possible responses of northern peatlands to environmental change. We show high genetic potential for microbial production of free amino acids across a range of microbial guilds in northern peatlands. In particular, the abundance and diversity of bacterial genes encoding proteolytic activity suggest a predominant role for bacteria in regulating productivity and contrasts with a paradigm of fungal dominance of organic N decomposition. Our results expand our current understanding of coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles in northern peatlands and indicate that understudied bacterial and archaeal lineages may be central in this ecosystem's response to environmental change.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) is a large temperate swamp in Virginia/North Carolina, USA with peat soils historically resistant to microbial decomposition. However, this peatland has been subject to similar to 200 years of disturbance during which extensive drainage, fire suppression, and widespread logging have increased decomposition and dramatically decreased the distribution of Atlantic white cedar (AWC). The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of long-term drainage and AWC loss on the carbon chemistry of GDS peats. Peat cores were collected from three drained GDS vegetation communities (pocosin, AWC, and red maple-black gum) and compared to cores collected from an intact, undrained AWC peatland at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (AR) in North Carolina. The AR peats had higher lignin content in the deeper peat intervals, and lignin content and percent organic carbon were largely invariant with depth compared to the GDS peats. The concentrations of syringyl group phenols were greater in the surface layers of GDS peats, likely reflecting the selective removal of AWC and transition from gymnosperms to angiosperms. Acid to aldehyde ratios for vanillyl and syringyl group phenols indicated that the GDS peats were more decomposed, particularly at depth, and that this occurred under aerobic conditions. Moreover, solid-state C-13 NMR confirmed a coincident loss of carbohydrates and increase in recalcitrant by-products of carbohydrate degradation with depth. These data indicate that long-term drainage has accelerated the decomposition of peat at the GDS, reducing the capacity and stability of the carbon sink.

AB Smoldering wildfire in peatlands contributes significantly to global carbon emissions and regional haze events. Smoldering fire in peatlands is one of the largest and most persistent fire phenomena on Earth. Here we assess the underlying mechanism of rain in suppressing the smoldering peat fire in the shallow soil layer up to 15 cm deep through laboratory experiments. We show that the minimum rainfall intensity to extinguish the peat fire is roughly 4 mm/h, so that the persistent light rain cannot suppress such smoldering wildfire. The required rain duration, Delta t (min), for extinguishing smoldering peat fire decreases with the rainfall intensities, I (mm/h), as log(10)Delta t=- 1.15log(10)I+ 3.3, and ismuch longer than that for extinguishing flamingwildfire. We also identify that the required rainfall depth for extinguishing peat fire gradually decreases with the rainfall intensity and approaches a minimum value of 13 mmunder violent rain. As rainfall intensity increases, the carbon emission flux frompeat fire decreases. Therefore, we conclude that the short-termviolent rain ismost effective for suppressing the persistent smoldering peat fire. This research helps evaluate the impact of weather on the development of peat fire and improve the prediction of carbon emissions frompeat fire with the use of regional weathermodels.

AB Peatlands are widely developed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but little is known about carbon budgets for these alpine peatland ecosystems. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure ecosystem respiration in the Hongyuan peatland, which is located in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Annual ecosystem respiration measurements showed a typical seasonal pattern, with the peak appearing in June. The highest respiration was 10.43 mu mol CO2/m(2)/s, and the lowest was 0.20 mu mol CO2/m(2)/s. The annual average ecosystem respiration was 2.06 mu mol CO2/m(2)/s. The total annual respiration was 599.98 g C/m(2), and respiration during the growing season (from May to September) accounted for 78 % of the annual sum. Nonlinear regression revealed that ecosystem respiration has a significant exponential correlation with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (R-2 = 0.98). The Q(10) value was 3.90, which is far higher than the average Q(10) value of terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystem respiration had an apparent diurnal variation pattern in growing season, with peaks and valleys appearing at approximately 14:00 and 10:00, respectively, which could be explainedby soil temperature and soil water content variation at 10-cm depth.

AB The results of the complex study of a Holocene peat bog in the southern part of Ketoi Island, which is proposed to serve as a reference section for the Central Kuriles, are discussed. The peat bog's stratigraphy is based on botanic, palynological, and diatom data, 16 radiocarbon age determinations, and the composition of the volcanic ashes. The peat accumulation initiated approximately 6500 years ago. The successive changes of the island's vegetation are traced through the Middle-Late Holocene with defining of the phases of its development and dating the paleolandscape transformations related to the climatic oscillations and volcanic eruptions.

AB Climate change is expected to alter the hydrology and vascular plant communities in peatland ecosystems. These changes may have as yet unexplored impacts on peat mercury (Hg) concentrations and net methylmercury (MeHg) production. In this study, peat was collected from PEATcosm, an outdoor, controlled mesocosm experiment where peatland water table regimes and vascular plant functional groups were manipulated over several years to simulate potential climate change effects. Potential Hg(II) methylation and MeHg demethylation rate constants were assessed using enriched stable isotope incubations at the end of the study in 2015, and ambient peal total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentration depth profiles were tracked annually from 2011 to 2014. Peat THg and MeHg concentrations and the proportion of THg methylated (%MeHg) increased significantly within the zone of water table fluctuation when water tables were lowered, but potential Hg(II) methylation rate constants were similar regardless of water table treatment. When sedges dominate over ericaceous shrubs, MeHg concentrations and %MeHg became significantly elevated within the sedge rooting zone. Increased desorption of Hg(II) and MeHg from the solid phase peat into pore water occurred with a lowered water table and predominant sedge cover, likely due to greater aerobic peat decomposition. Deeper, more variable water tables and a transition to sedge-dominated communities coincided with increased MeHg accumulation within the zone of water table fluctuation. Sustained high water tables promoted the net downward migration of Hg(II) and MeHg. The simultaneous decrease in Hg(II) and MeHg concentrations in the near-surface peat and accumulation deeper in the peat profile, combined with the trends in Hg(II) and MeHg partitioning to mobile pore waters, suggest that changes to peatland hydrology and vascular plant functional groups redistribute peat Hg(II) and MeHg via vertical hydrochemical transport mechanisms.

AB The current case study presents results of the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiling at one of the Saadjarve drumlin field interstitial troughs, the Rahivere bog, eastern Estonia. The study was conducted in order to identify the bog morphology, and the thickness and geometry of the peat body. The method was also used to describe the applicability of GPR in the evaluation of the peat deposit reserve as the Rahivere bog belongs among the officially registered peat reserves. Fourteen GPR profiles, similar to 100 m apart and oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the depression, covering the bog and its surrounding areas, were acquired. In order to verify the radar image interpretation as well as to evaluate the velocity of electromagnetic waves in peat, a common source configuration was utilized and thirteen boreholes were drilled on the GPR profiles. A mean value of 0.036 m ns(-1) corresponding to relative dielectric permittivity of 69.7 was used for the time-depth conversion. Radar images reveal major reflection from the peat-soil interface up to a depth of about 4 m, whereas drillings showed a maximum thickness of 4.5 m of peat. Minor reflections appear from the upper peat and mineral soil. According to the borehole data, undecomposed peat is underlain by decomposed one, but identifying them by GPR is complicated. Mineral soil consists of glaciolimnic silty sand in the peripheral areas of the trough, overlain by limnic clay in the central part. The calculated peat volumes (1 200 000 m(3)) were found to exceed the earlier estimation (979 000 m(3)) that was based solely on drilling data. Ground-penetrating radar, as a method that allows mapping horizontal continuity of the sub-peat interface in a non-destructive way, was found to provide detailed information for evaluating peat depth and extent.

AB In a field study, we examined the relationship between vegetation, abiotic factors and the CO2 exchange dynamics of a cut-away peatland 20 years after production had ended. The main objective was to determine the effect of rewetting on the CO2 exchange dynamics, measured separately in Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and intertussocks (almost non-vegetated surfaces) using closed-chamber techniques, one growing season before and three growing seasons after the rewetting treatment. Rewetting lowered total respiration (R-TOT) and increased gross photosynthesis (P-G), which resulted in a higher incorporation of CO2 into the system. The seasonal CO2 balance for the almost continuously submerged section of the rewetted site became positive 2 years after rewetting (9.1 g CO2-C m(-2)), and it was still higher in the 3rd year (64.5 g CO2-C m(-2)), i.e. the system accumulated carbon. In the driest section of the rewetted site the seasonal balance increased strongly, but the balance was still negative during the 3 years following rewetting with losses from the system of 44.1, 26.1, 38.3 g CO2-C m(-2) in 1995, 1996 and 1997 respectively. At the control site seasonal balance during 1995-1997 varied between ecosystem C losses of 41.8 and 95.3 in an area with high Eriophorum cover and between 52.1 and 109.9 g CO2-C m(-2) with lower cover. Simulation of a cut-away peatland with dense Eriophorum vegetation (Eriophorum cover 70%) showed that if the water level (WT) is low, the seasonal CO2 balance of the ecosystem can reach the compensation point of no net C change (P-G = R-TOT) only if weather conditions are favourable, but with a high WT the seasonal CO2 balance would be positive even under varying weather conditions. It can be concluded that with dense Eriophorum vegetation a restored cut-away peatland acts as a functional mire and becomes a sink for atmospheric CO2.

AB Monitoring high latitude wetlands is required to understand feedbacks between terrestrial carbon pools and climate change. Hydrological variability is a key factor driving biogeochemical processes in these ecosystems and effective assessment tools are critical for accurate characterization of surface hydrology, soil moisture, and water table fluctuations. Operational satellite platforms provide opportunities to systematically monitor hydrological variability in high latitude wetlands. The objective of this research application was to integrate high temporal frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and high spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) observations to assess hydroperiod at a mire in northern Sweden. Geostatistical and polarimetric (PLR) techniques were applied to determine spatial structure of the wetland and imagery at respective scales (0.5 m to 25 m). Variogram, spatial regression, and decomposition approaches characterized the sensitivity of the two platforms (SAR and LiDAR) to wetland hydrogeomorphology, scattering mechanisms, and data interrelationships. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART), based on random forest, fused multi-mode (fine-beam single, dual, quad pol) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and LiDAR-derived elevation to effectively map hydroperiod attributes at the Swedish mire across an aggregated warm season (May-September, 2006-2010). Image derived estimates of water and peat moisture were sensitive (R-2 = 0.86) to field measurements of water table depth (cm). Peat areas that are underlain by permafrost were observed as areas with fluctuating soil moisture and water table changes.

AB Climate warming is resulting in increases in the frequency and intensity of summer droughts in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region (Ontario, Canada), raising concerns for the fate of C stores. We hypothesized that deeper peat historically existing beneath the water table would produce significant CO2 efflux during summer droughts. To test this hypothesis, we collected saturated peat cores, partitioned them into depth intervals, incubated the peat under conditions that resulted in peat drying, and monitored daily CO2 production together with potential drivers of CO2 production, including peat quality, microbial biomass, and microbial extracellular enzyme activity. Peat CO2 production (mu mol CO2 min(-1) g(-1) dry soil) was highest in the top 30 cm of the peat profile, with the highest production at intermediate volumetric water content (VWC). Peat substrates fuelling CO2 production had quotients of C to N of <20 and were characterized by more labile forms of C. Microbial biomass C (mg C g(-1) dry soil) and most microbial extracellular enzymes (nmol g(-1) h(-1)) were also highest in the top 30 cm of the peat profile. Activities of microbial extracellular enzymes shifted in their contribution to CO2 production as the peat dried, with hydrolases positively related to CO2 under dry conditions (5-35%) and negatively under wet conditions (65 and 85%), with phenol oxidase showing the opposite pattern. Currently, the relatively poor quality (i.e., high C/N) of peat in catotelm limits rapid release of CO2 with water table declines. However, this substantial C store may be vulnerable to decomposition if constraints on quality are alleviated.

AB Rewetting of drained fens with NO3- enriched water from agricultural watersheds has been proposed as a valid strategy to reduce NO3- load of water courses although their role as dissolved nitrogen (DN) sinks remain unclear because the export of reduced nitrogen forms (NH4+, DON) may exceed NO3- removal. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the importance of temperature, nitrogen load and the degree of peat decomposition on the role of rewetted fens as DN sinks. Different peat substrates of one degraded drained fen in NE Germany were incubated under stagnant water conditions. Two degrees of peat decomposition (Highly decomposed: HD; Moderately decomposed: MD), two nitrogen loads (Low nitrogen, LN, 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); High nitrogen, HN, 140 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and two incubation temperatures (20 degrees C and 5 degrees C) were examined. Moreover, net N mineralisation and N microbial immobilisation were also estimated to gain useful insights on the role of the considered factors over processes involved on DN turnover. Under all scenarios considered in this study, fen rewetting was shown to be a valid strategy to recover the function of fens as DN sinks, although large variability on the retention efficiency was observed (similar to 15-75%). N load increased NO3- (LN: 7.9 +/- 1.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1); HN: 19.3 +/- 3.1 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and DN (LN: 5.1 +/- 0.8 mg N m(-2) d(-1); HN: 16.5 +/- 2.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) removal, even though the depletion of the added NO3- by organic matter decomposition took place only at the peat surface. Peat decomposition strongly influenced DN turnover due to differences in the size of the mobile organic carbon (C) (HD: 132 +/- 7 mg c g(-1) dry matter (DM); MD: 68 +/- 2 mg C g(-1) DM) and N (HD: 9.3 +/- 0.5 mg N g(-1) DM; MD: 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg N g(-1) DM) pools. As a result, NO3- removal, net N mineralisation, N microbial immobilisation and NH4+ export were higher for highly decomposed peat. In addition, a higher incubation temperature increased NO removal rates (20 degrees C: 18.6 +/- 3.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1); 5 degrees C: 8.5 +/- 1.7 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Moreover, DN removal was much higher at 20 degrees C (20 degrees C: 14.9 +/- 2.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1); 5 degrees C: 6.7 +/- 1.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1)), but lower than NO3- removal rates underpinning the importance of N mineralisation. The results from our study should be considered prior to restore degraded fens. Removing the highly decomposed peat layer, which has been proposed as a method to reduce nutrient release in rewetted fens, can hamper the N removal potential to some extent, especially at high N loading rates.

AB Changes in vegetation and environment at Askham Bog, a small valley mire near York, UK, have been followed over a period of 13 years by resurveying sites recorded in 1978 and by studying permanent quadrats. The site has a concentrically zoned series of vegetation types, with base-rich for vegetation around the margins and acidophilous, species-poor vegetation on acid peat in the centre. It has become more acid during this period: average peat pH has declined by 0.5 units, and the least acid peats by more. The composition of the tree flora has changed extensively, with birch declining in favour of oak, alder and ash. Alder regenerates episodically at the site, and there has been a major recruitment event since 1978.
   Permanent quadrats showed that the ground flora has undergone rapid change; numerous species have declined in base-rich vegetation zones, but only the moss Sphagnum fimbriatum in the acid vegetation zone. Few species increased in abundance, but the nitrophilous Urtica dioica was one. Mapping the distribution of Sphagnum spp. showed that S. squarrosum as well as S. fimbriatum had become less abundant, and even the more acid-tolerant S. palustre had declined where the grass Molinia caerulea had expanded.
   Experiments involving adding nitrogen and cutting M. caerulea suggested that vigorous Sphagnum was inhibited by low levels of N addition (1.2 g N m2 year1), considerably below those now entering the site as atmospheric deposition. Where Sphagnum was growing poorly and Molinia was abundant, adding N had no effect but cutting Molinia in summer was beneficial. These data are discussed in relation to atmospheric inputs of S and N. It appears that heavy N deposition may be responsible for rapid vegetation change at the site. The implications for conservation of such sites are worrying.

AB Early peat surveys demonstrated the potential to detect Holocene climatic changes in southern Sweden through analysis of the degree of decomposition of Sphagnum peat and motivated systematic collection of peat-strati graphic information during subsequent geological mappings in central and northern Sweden. The resulting (published and unpublished) data was compiled and reanalysed, taking into account unpublished radiocarbon data and developments in radiocarbon calibration and pollen-stratigraphic dating. Data from 61 carefully selected sites indicate a peat initiation maximum centred in the north 9500-8000 cal. BP and interpreted to primarily reflect climatic change. The cause for a secondary maximum 6000-5500 cal. BP centred further south is less clear. Peat deposition data show a continuous increase in the period 10 500-2000 cal. BP, with almost constant values during recent millennia, indicating that peatlands in the region acted as a long-term Holocene carbon sink and increasingly so until c. 2000 years ago. Sphagnum peat decomposition data display a long-term trend towards wetter conditions after 5000 cal. BP interpreted to primarily reflect progressively stronger westerly airflow and an accompanying increase in precipitation. These data also show that wet shifts occurred more frequently across the region around 3300, 2500-2100 and 1300 cal. BP. The timing of peak frequencies of wet shifts is similar to that of supposedly climate-related wet shifts identified in southern Sweden. Variability in frequency of wet shifts is most strongly pronounced in the south-west, with an apparent periodicity of 800-1000 years believed to reflect regular changes in westerly airflow during the mid and late Holocene.

AB Carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) records from vascular plant dominated peatlands have been used as a palaeoclimate proxy, but a better empirical understanding of fractionation processes in these ecosystems is required. Here, we test the potential of delta C-13 analysis of ombrotrophic restiad peatlands in New Zealand, dominated by the wire rush (Empodisma spp.), to provide a methodology for developing palaeoclimatic records. We took surface plant samples alongside measurements of water table depth and (micro) climate over spatial (six sites spanning > 10 degrees latitude) and temporal (monthly measurements over 1 year) gradients and analysed the relationships between cellulose delta C-13 values and environmental parameters. We found strong, significant negative correlations between delta C-13 and temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and growing degree days above 0 degrees C. No significant relationships were observed between delta C-13 and precipitation, relative humidity, soil moisture or water table depth, suggesting no growing season water limitation and a decoupling of the expected link between delta C-13 in vascular plants and hydrological variables. delta C-13 of Empodisma spp. roots may therefore provide a valuable temperature proxy in a climatically sensitive region, but further physiological and sub-fossil calibration studies are required to fully understand the observed signal.

AB Premise of research.Abundant peat mosses and epibiotic microbiota, common in widespread modern peatlands, constitute complex biotic systems recognized to provide globally significant ecosystem services: organic carbon sequestration, methane oxidation, and nitrogen fixation. Because recent fossil and molecular diversification evidence indicates that peat mosses are >450 Myr old, they may be among Earth's earliest land plants. The biogeochemical effects of early vegetation, which may have occupied remote islands and experienced nutritional stress and episodes of high UV radiation, are poorly understood. To gain insight into taxonomic composition, biogeochemical function, and resilience of archaic peat moss microbiomes, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of a similarly stressed modern peat moss.
   Methodology.Sphagnum fimbriatum was sampled from Chilean sub-Antarctic Navarino Island, which is remote from nutrient pollution and subject to high UV beneath the southern ozone hole. 16S, 18S, 23S, and 28S ribosomal RNA sequences filtered from contigs assembled from long-read Roche 454 and deep short-read Illumina sequences were employed to infer prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiome composition at generic and higher levels for comparison to peat moss microbiota reported for other locales.
   Pivotal results.Comparison of bacterial diversityincluding >75 genera represented by 100 sequence reads and >250 genera represented by 10 readsto diversity reported from previous peatland studies indicated the operation of recognized peatland functions (carbon sequestration, methane oxidation, and nitrogen fixation), signifying stress resilience. Eukaryotic features included >45 protist genera, some of pivotal evolutionary significance; distinctive fungal associations; and ancient lineages of microscopic invertebrate animals, including springtails known to foster moss reproduction.
   Conclusions.Metagenomic approaches provide a new, expanding window into early terrestrial vegetation and its biogeochemical effects, indicating that complex peat moss systems resilient to stressful environmental conditions likely occurred in deep time and persist to the present.

AB Long chain n-alkanes preserved in peat deposits have been widely used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental and paleoecological changes. However, our knowledge of how the leaf wax molecular and isotopic compositions of peat sequences might respond to changes in plant communities is limited. This study investigates the n-alkane molecular, carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of plant species collected from the Dajiuhu peatland, central China. The results show that forb and graminoid plants growing in peatlands have a relatively higher carbon preference index of long-chain n-alkanes than shrubs, ferns and aquatic plants. The delta C-13 values of individual n-alkanes generally decrease with increasing chain lengths, and different plant groups have similar delta C-13 values of C-31 and C-33 n-alkanes. An exception is Sphagnum, which has more negative delta C-13 values of C-23 and C-25 than those of its longer chain length homologues. Relative to peat pore water delta D values in different seasons and different peat depths, the Dajiuhu plants normally exhibit relatively large hydrogen isotope fractionations, and the fractionations gradually increase from graminoid to forb to shrub. Taken together, these results highlight the influence of different kinds of vegetation on the collective molecular and isotopic ratios of n-alkanes in peat deposits. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrogen additions as NH4NO3 corresponding to 0 (N0), 1 (N1), 3 (N3) and 10 (N10) g N m(-2) yr(-1) were made to Sphagnum magellanicum cores at two-week intervals in situ at four sites across Europe, i.e. Lakkasuo (Finland), Mannikjarve (Estonia), Moidach More (UK) and Cote de Braveix (France). The same treatments were applied in a glasshouse experiment in Neuchatel (Switzerland) in which the water table depth was artificially maintained at 7, 17 and 37 cm below the moss surface. In the held, N assimilation in excess of values in wet deposition occurred in the absence of growth, but varied widely between sites, being absent in Lakkasuo (moss N:P ratio 68) and greatest in Moidach More (N:P 21). In the glasshouse, growth was reduced by lowering the water table without any apparent effect on N assimilation. Total N content of the moss in field sites increased as the mean depth of water table increased indicating growth limitation leading to increased N concentrations which could reduce the capacity for N retention. Greater contents of NH4+ in the underlying peat at 30 cm depth, both in response to NH4NO3 addition and in the unamended cores confirmed poor retention of inorganic N by the moss at Lakkasuo. Nitrate contents in the profiles at Lakkasuo, Moidach More, and Cote de Braveix were extremely low, even in the N10 treatment, but in Mannikjarve, where the mean depth of water table was greatest and retention absent, appreciable amounts of NO3- were detected in all cores. It is concluded that peatland drainage would reduce the capture of inorganic N in atmospheric deposition by Sphagnum mosses.

AB Peatlands play outsized roles in the global carbon cycle. Despite occupying a rather small fraction of the terrestrial biosphere (similar to 3%), these ecosystems account for roughly one third of the global soil carbon pool. This carbon is largely comprised of undecomposed deposits of plant material (peat) that may be meters thick. The fate of this deep carbon stockpile with ongoing and future climate change is thus of great interest and has large potential to induce positive feedback to climate warming. Recent in situ warming of an ombrotrophic peatland indicated that the deep peat microbial communities and decomposition rates were resistant to elevated temperatures. In this experiment, we sought to understand how nutrient and pH limitations may interact with temperature to limit microbial activity and community composition. Anaerobic microcosms of peat collected from 1.5 to 2 meters in depth were incubated at 6 degrees C and 15 degrees C with elevated pH, nitrogen (NH4Cl), and/or phosphorus (KH2PO4) in a full factorial design. The production of CO2 and CH4 was significantly greater in microcosms incubated at 15 degrees C, although the structure of the microbial community did not differ between the two temperatures. Increasing the pH from similar to 3.5 to similar to 5.5 altered microbial community structure, however increases in CH4 production were non-significant. Contrary to expectations, N and P additions did not increase CO2 and CH4 production, indicating that nutrient availability was not a primary constraint in microbial decomposition of deep peat. Our findings indicate that temperature is a key factor limiting the decomposition of deep peat, however other factors such as the availability of O-2 or alternative electron donors and high concentrations of phenolic compounds, may also exert constraints. Continued experimental peat warming studies will be necessary to assess if the deep peat carbon bank is susceptible to increased temperatures over the longer time scales.

AB Adsorption and desorption of coal to methane are substantially related to coal facies, referring to the production potential of a coalbed methane (CBM) well. Based on analyses of the stratified channel samples from coal seams No. 2, No. 4 and No. 9 in the Xiqu Drainage Area, Gujiao CBM Block, North China, the relationship between coal facies and adsorption -desorption behaviors was first proposed and discussed. Using the coal facies diagrams suggested by previous investigators, four types of coal facies were distinguished in the coal seams, including the upper delta plain wet forest swamp (I), the lower delta plain fen (II), the lower delta plain marsh (III) and the back barrier low moor (IV). The upper delta plain wet forest swamp occurred dominantly, developing at the bottom and top of all the coal seams. Both the ash yield and groundwater index (GWI) tend to increase from coal facies I to IV, whereas the volatile compounds, fixed carbon, organic sulfur, total sulfur, micropore volume and specific surface area, tissue preservation index (TPI) and vegetation index (VI) decreased, which indicates changes in the vegetation types, water supplements and disturbance, acid -base properties and redox conditions in the paleomires. Paleomire evolution accompanied the rise and drop of the sea level, with a transgression or regression process that could be represented by the coal facies sequence. Coal seams No. 2, No. 4 and No. 9 were discriminated into two, three and two evolving stages, respectively, and these stages were characterized by complete cycles, except stage 4-I from the lower delta plain marsh. Mudstone partings in the coal seams deposited during the highest sea level. Collectively, paleomire environments, especially the variation of vegetation types and mire water condition, result in adsorption and desorption divergences among different coal facies. Arborescent plants decrease from coal facies Ito IV as the hydrodynamic intensity increases, leading to corresponding changes in botanical tissue preservation, mediumoxidizability, mineral content and, ultimately, adsorption and desorption behaviors. In view of the gas content and desorption capacity of the coal layers in the same coal seam, the layers from the upper delta plain wet forest swamp may have the best potential for CBM drainage, followed by those from the lower delta plain fen and marsh, while those from the back barrier low moor may have the worst potential.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands have persisted as massive carbon sinks over millennia, even during past periods of climate change. The commonly accepted theory of abiotic controls (mainly anoxia and low temperature) over carbon decomposition cannot fully explain how vast low-latitude shrub/tree dominated (wooded) peatlands consistently accrete peat under warm and seasonally unsaturated conditions. Here we show, by comparing the composition and ecological traits of microbes between Sphagnum- and shrub-dominated peatlands, that slow-growing microbes decisively dominate the studied shrub-dominated peatlands, concomitant with plant-induced increases in highly recalcitrant carbon and phenolics. The slow-growing microbes metabolize organic matter thirty times slower than the fast-growing microbes that dominate our Sphagnum-dominated site. We suggest that the high-phenolic shrub/tree induced shifts in microbial composition may compensate for positive effects of temperature and/or drought on metabolism over time in peatlands. This biotic self-sustaining process that modulates abiotic controls on carbon cycling may improve projections of long-term, climate-carbon feedbacks in peatlands. A dominance of slow-growing microbes reduces carbon loss in peatlands with predominantly woody vegetation and may help with peatland preservation under climate change, according to a comparison of microbial communities from different types of peatlands.

AB We studied carbon dynamics on various surface parts of a highly patterned fen, typical in northern Finland, to examine the importance of different microsites to the areal carbon fluxes. The studies were carried out in June-September 1995 on a mesotrophic flark fen (an aapa mire) in Kaamanen (69degrees08'N, 27degrees 17'E). Wet flarks, moist lawns and dry strings accounted for 60%, 10% and 30% of the surface area, respectively. A static chamber technique was applied to measure the CH, exchange, the instantaneous net ecosystem exchange (NEE, transparent chamber) and the ecosystem respiration (R(tot), opaque chamber) in several microsites. The static chamber results were compared with those obtained by the eddy covariance technique. The mean daytime areal net ecosystem CO(2) exchange rate measurement in conditions where photosynthesis was light saturated (PAR> 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) varied during the measurement period from -59 mg CO(2)-C m(-2)h(-1) (release) to 250 (uptake). The mean CH(4) emission during the measuring period was 78 mg CH(4)-C m(-2) d(-1) on the flarks., 68 mg on the lawn and 6.0 mg on the strings. The strings without shrubs (mainly Betula nana) were in general net sources of CO(2), even during the middle of the growing season, whereas the lawns, flarks and also strings growing B. nana showed a daytime net uptake of CO(2). A really integrated chamber results showed lower CO, and higher CH, fluxes than predicted from the eddy covariance measurements.

AB Analysis of the Palaeocene Souris Lignite (northern Williston Basin) using coal petrology and palynology reveals the existence of seven different mire types forming six cycles of varying thickness and composition. The order of mire types within the individual cycles allows an idealized mire type succession to be defined. The principle factor driving the idealized mire type succession is decreasing water depth within the peat-forming environment (terrestrialization), which leads to an increase in species diversity and a change in floral character from ferns--> angiosperms--> gymnosperms. Increases in water depth are the primary agent responsible for the termination of individual cycles in the ancestral Souris mire. Changes in nutrient status of the mire may also promote major changes in the floral assemblage, contributing to cycle termination. Comparison of densinite:ulminite ratios for the central part of the Souris seam shows an overall decrease in the degree of humification south-westward, indicating increased subsidence towards the Williston Basin centre, where seam partings are more common. Fern-rich mire types dominate throughout most of the sampled part of the Souris seam and such mires have been interpreted as representing transitional stages in both modern and Tertiary peat-forming environments. Previous analysis of other parts of the Souris seam has revealed areas dominated by Taxodium forest mires, representing more stable environments. The co-existence of transitional and stable environments suggests that the ancestral Souris mire may have been deposited during the onset of the closing stages of Palaeocene peat formation in the northern part of the Williston Basin.

AB The significance of mires (peat-accumulating wetlands) is increasingly being recognised internationally because of their susceptibility to climate change and their biodiversity values. Mires are best known in the Northern Hemisphere, but numerous examples occur in the South. The objectives of this study were to characterise physicochemical conditions in a representative mire in New Zealand, and to draw comparisons with similar environments elsewhere. We measured a suite of physical, chemical and nutrient variables over two full annual cycles in mire pools in a subalpine area. Seasonal variation in and temporal coherence of several chemical variables were inconsistent among pools, and this is explained by variation in water source and pool size. For most variables, temporal variability was at least as high as spatial variability. In comparison with peat-based wetlands in northern Europe, these New Zealand sites tended to have higher pH at given concentrations of Ca. Data from mire pools in other regions, including Tasmania and other parts of New Zealand, shared the same characteristics. Inter-Hemi spheric differences in rainfall chemistry may partly account for the pH differences, but low levels of organic acids (measured as DOC) appear more likely to be responsible. The mechanisms leading to low DOC are uncertain, but could include the effects of high rainfall, and vegetation differences. All pools were confirmed as ultra-oligotrophic in winter, though summer peaks in productivity exceeded thresholds for mesotrophic conditions. As in the Northern Hemisphere, nutrient patterns were independent of the Ca/pH gradient. Despite significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity of these mire pools, their average water chemistry also differs from that typical in rivers and lakes in New Zealand. Given that mire pools are already known to support higher proportions of endemism in benthic diatoms compared to other freshwater habitats in New Zealand, we suggest they may constitute an unusual environment type on which more detailed aquatic biological studies are warranted.

ID FORESTS
AB Pollen analysis of a small peat bog at Cerna Hora, Czech Republic, shows late- Holocene human impact on the vegetation. The palynological results are compared with historical documentation. Macrofossil analysis and changing pollen concentrations provide evidence that human impact on the regional vegetation determined changes in the hydrological conditions of the bog, and in the peat accumulation rate. From approximately 2100 BP (start of peat growth) to approximately 1400 BP no human impact has been identified from the pollen record and the decomposition of the peat deposit indicates moderately moist conditions within the catchment. Subsequent changes corresponded with two phases of inferred human impact on the vegetation. From approximately 1400 BP (seventh to eighth centuries ad) and especially after 900 BP (eleventh to twelfth centuries ad), human impact (deforestation) became evident and the less decomposed peat was formed under locally wet conditions.

AB Aims The association of organic matter with iron (Fe-OM associations) is recognized as an important stabilization mechanism for soil organic matter. Our objective was to assess the factors regulating stabilization of soil organic matter by iron in various plant-dominated peatlands, and the role of laccase in the formation of Fe-OM associations. Methods We investigated Fe-bound OC content and related physicochemical and biochemical parameters in four plots with different successional vegetation, and a set of simulations was conducted to investigate the association of Fe and peat-derived dissolved organic carbon catalysed by laccase. Results Our results indicate Fe-bound OC content varies regularly with the succession gradients, and a significant positive relationship between laccase activities and Fe-bound OC content was found (R = 0.77, P < 0.05). Although laccase degradation of recalcitrant polyphenolics is related with the CO2 release from peat soils (R = 0.697; P < 0.05), the simulation results confirmed laccase can significantly promote the formation of Fe-OM association. Conclusions We propose that laccase plays a unique multifunctional role in the peatland carbon cycle. That is, while laccase degrades refractory organic matter such as lignin, it may enhance carbon sequestration by promoting the formation of Fe-OM association, which is particularly effective in acidic peat environments containing abundant iron and laccase-producing fungi.

AB The climatic controls on present-day peat formation are examined in order to develop a uniformitarian tool for refining paleoclimate studies, and to create a retrodictive model for the coals of the geologic record. A peat database has been compiled for the world and the resulting patterns are compared with aspects of precipitation and temperature drawn from a gridded data set. Precipitation continuity through the annual cycle is important for biologic productivity in the terrestrial realm. It is expressed in terms of the number of months with average precipitation above 40 mm. Temperature is limiting at higher latitudes where the potential growing season may be defined by the number of months with mean temperature exceeding 10-degrees-C. A map predicting the growing season has been constructed from these rainfall and temperature statistics which compares very well with actual vegetation persistence through the year as measured directly from satellite instruments. However, biologic production will not result in peat accumulation unless groundwater levels are maintained through the growing season. Our peat prediction map therefore shows the percentage of time that precipitation occurs during the potential growing season. Present-day peat accumulations are well predicted by this map.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) was measured via the eddy covariance technique at a shrub bog peatland in southeastern Ontario for 5 years. For most of the study period the temperature was above normal. Precipitation was variable, but, in 2 years, late summer dry periods resulted in an extended period of deep drawdown of the water table (WT). Growing-season (May-September) daily ET varied considerably; maximum ET rates were 4 to 5 rum day(-1). Winter ET rates were an order of magnitude smaller than in summer, yet the total winter ET loss was important, accounting for 23 to 30% of the annual ET water loss. Annual precipitation exceeded annual ET by 1.55 to 1.94 times.
   During the growing season, daily ET was closely related to daily potential evaporation (PET); however, the slope of this relationship was statistically different in some years. In contrast, ET and WT were only weakly related in most years. When ET was sorted into 5 cm WT classes there was no difference in mean ET across most WT classes; only the two deepest WT classes had significantly smaller mean ET. The ratio ET/PET followed the same pattern. We present a conceptual model of ET that relates WT, soil hydraulic properties and moss and vascular plant processes.

AB Rewetted extracted peatlands are sensitive ecosystems and they can act as greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks or sources due to changes in hydrology, vegetation, and weather conditions. However, studies on GHG emissions from extracted peatlands after rewetting are limited. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission fluxes were determined using the opaque closed chamber method along water level gradients from littoral zones to the open water body of constructed shallow lakes with different vegetation zones in a nutrient-rich rewetted extracted peatland in Sweden. Vegetation communities and their position relative to water level, together with short-term water level fluctuations, such as inundation events and seasonal droughts, and temperature had a significant impact on CH4 emissions fluxes. During "normal" and "dry" conditions and high soil temperatures, CH4 emissions were highest from Carex spp.-Typha latifolia L. communities. During inundation events with water levels > 30 cm, sites with flooded Graminoids-Scirpus spp.-Carex spp. emitted most CH4. Methane emissions from the water body of the constructed shallow lakes were low during all water level conditions and over the temperature ranges observed. Nitrous oxide emissions contributed little to the emission fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere, and they were only detectable from the sites with Graminoids. In terms of management, the construction of shallow lakes showed great potential for lowering GHG emission fluxes from nutrient rich peatlands after peat extraction, even though the vegetated shore emitted some N2O and CH4.

AB Compared to other temporary aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how inundation frequency and duration (i.e. hydrologic regime) influences the structure of aquatic communities in northern peatlands. In this study, we examined patterns in nutrient availability and aquatic community structure during a natural flooding event in an Alaskan fen where water-table position had been manipulated in three large-scale experimental plots during previous years to simulate both drought (lowered water-table treatment) and flooding (raised water-table treatment) conditions relative to a control without manipulation. Although the natural flood disrupted the long-term experimental manipulation, it provided an opportunity to evaluate how variation in past hydrologic regime influences nutrient dynamics and aquatic food web structure during periods of inundation in a northern boreal peatland. Despite similar water depth among experimental plots during the time of sampling (i.e. water was above the peat surface in all plots), water-column nutrient concentrations were significantly greater in the drought treatment (where water table had been lowered during the previous growing season) compared to the raised water-table treatment and the control. Algal production increased with enhanced nutrient availability across all water-table treatments and was most elevated following the rewetting of dry sediments in the drought treatment. Consumer biomass (heterotrophic bacteria and macroinvertebrates) increased with algal production and was significantly greater in the drought treatment compared to the raised water-table treatment and the control. Consumer biomass decreased into the second year of constant inundation as algal production was constrained by reduced nutrient availability. Stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) showed that elevated levels of periphyton (i.e. the intact biofilm) associated with enhanced nutrient availability promoted energy transfer to higher trophic levels (grazers and predators) rather than living or dead mosses or vascular plant material. Consumption of algal material by grazers altered the size and composition of the algal community. The algal community shifted from coccoid (edible) to filamentous (inedible) growth forms with increased grazer abundance in the drought treatment, possibly owing to selective grazing. Conversely, there was a similar proportion of edible and inedible taxa in the control and raised treatments where grazers were lower in abundance. Our results show that the legacy effects of drought can regulate aquatic community structure in northern peatlands. Within a predictive context, our findings suggest that conditions of more variable hydrology expected with climate change (i.e. increased frequency of drought) occurring across northern latitudes will promote energy flow to higher trophic levels by releasing nutrient constraints on microalgae during periods of inundation.

AB High-resolution plant macrofossil records were examined alongside pollen, micro- and macro-charcoal, and testate amoeba data to elucidate the dynamics of two permafrost peatlands in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaskan Arctic. The vegetation dynamics of these two peatlands were driven by autogenic processes reflecting the development trajectory of the peatlands towards ombrotrophic status, and allogenic climate change. We observe an increase in shrub pollen and macrofossils (e.g. Ericaceae, Betula nana) during two Late Holocene warm episodes and in recent decades. Pollen data suggest that regional forest cover also responded to temperature increase since ca. 1950 CE. An increase of Picea pollen (up to 13%) in the upper part of peat profile is probably associated with long distance pollen transport from populations of Picea mariana and Picea glauca located at the southern foothills of the Brooks Range. Relatively small amount of micro- and macrocharcoal in the two profiles indicates little fire activity around the sampling sites over the last ca. 2000 years, which is in agreement with regional findings. The lack of surface and groundwater influence under prolonged warmer/drier condition can allow Sphagnum to expand in Arctic peatlands. Cold climatic conditions might have been detrimental to Sphagnum populations, that were replaced by Carex spp. and other vascular plants owing to wetter conditions in the peatland.

AB Anthropogenic drainage of peatlands releases additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and dissolved carbon (C) and nutrients to downstream ecosystems. Rewetting drained peatlands offers a possibility to reduce nitrogen (N) and C losses. In this study, we investigate the impact of drainage and rewetting on the cycling of dissolved C and N as well as on dissolved gases, over a period of 1 year and a period of 4 months. We chose four sites within one Atlantic bog complex: a near-natural site, two drained grasslands with different mean groundwater levels and a former peat cutting area rewetted 10 years ago.
   Our results clearly indicate that long-term drainage has increased the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium, nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compared to the near-natural site. DON and ammonium contributed the most to the total dissolved nitrogen. Nitrate concentrations below the mean groundwater table were negligible. The concentrations of DOC and N species increased with drainage depth. In the deeply-drained grassland, with a mean annual water table of 45 cm below surface, DOC concentrations were twice as high as in the partially rewetted grassland with a mean annual water table of 28 cm below surface. The deeply drained grassland had some of the highestever observed DOC concentrations of 195.8 +/- 77.3 mg L-1 with maximum values of > 400 mg L-1. In general, dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the drained sites was enriched in aromatic moieties and showed a higher degradation status (lower DOC to DON ratio) compared to the near-natural site. At the drained sites, the C to N ratios of the uppermost peat layer were the same as of DOM in the peat profile. This suggests that the uppermost degraded peat layer is the main source of DOM. Nearly constant DOM quality through the profile furthermore indicated that DOM moving downwards through the drained sites remained largely biogeochemically unchanged. Unlike DOM concentration, DOM quality and dissolved N species distribution were similar in the two grasslands and thus unaffected by the drainage depth.
   Methane production during the winter months at the drained sites was limited to the subsoil, which was quasi-permanently water saturated. The recovery of the water table in the winter months led to the production of nitrous oxide around mean water table depth at the drained sites.
   The rewetted and the near-natural site had comparable DOM quantity and quality (DOC to DON ratio and aromaticity). 10 years after rewetting quasi-pristine biogeochemical conditions have been re-established under continuously water logged conditions in the former peat cut area. Only the elevated dissolved methane and ammonium concentrations reflected the former disturbance by drainage and peat extraction. Rewetting via polder technique seems to be an appropriate way to revitalize peatlands on longer timescales and to improve the water quality of downstream water bodies.

Water-table depths were quantified by the analysis of testate amoeba assemblages, and a regional transfer function was used to infer past water-table depths. During the last 2000 years, testate amoeba assemblages have been relatively stable, with a dominance of Difflugia pulex and Difflugia pristis type, and an increase in Assulina muscorum and other Euglyphida at the top of each section. Multivariate analyses show that water-table depth remained the main environmental variable explaining assemblages along the TiA12 core, but reconstructions were not significant for the two other cores. In line with the low variability in assemblages, water tables were relatively stable during the last 2000 years. Slightly wetter conditions were found between similar to 1400 and 900 cal. BP and a pronounced recent dry shift was reconstructed in all of the three peat profiles. Considering the regional climatic context, this recent shift may have been forced by a decrease in precipitation and warmer conditions linked to an increase in the importance of the SWWB. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the influence of higher UV-B radiation resulting from the local degradation of the ozone layer since the late 1970s, which may have had an additional effect on the relative presence of A. muscorum in the southern Patagonian region.

AB Peat-accumulating active raised bog (ARB) constitutes an Annex I priority habitat under the European Unions Habitats Directive (HD). Ecological monitoring of Irish special area of conservation (SAC) sites from the mid-1990s up to 2013 has shown that the network experienced ARB losses of 37% (730 ha) since the HD came into law. Obligations to restore ARB coverage, while conserving existing priority habitat, require a scientifically-defensible methodology to underpin long-term management. GIS-based investigative tools provided a basis for linking ecological and hydrological field data with high resolution topographic data. Application of semi-empirical hydrological metrics, reflecting climate, topographic conditions and surface/near surface hydrological processes, to uncut (high) bog indicated ARB typically develops on uncut peatlands with slopes of between 0.2% and 0.6%, depending on effective rainfall; in more localised focused-flow flushes ARB may occur on slopes exceeding 1%. Locating topographically suitable high bog areas, currently lacking ARB, permitted identification of degraded raised bog (DRB), i.e. zones capable of regenerating to ARB. Across the SAC network modelling suggested DRB coverage is 1555 ha, although not all may be restorable by tried-and-tested restoration technologies. Hydrological modelling has permitted identification of areas where restoration efforts may be focused for maximum benefit. On the other hand the approach has also highlighted the inability of restoration measures on high bog alone to meet the current shortfall in ARB and the requirement to consider additional approaches to restoration.

AB The vertical distribution of Pb-210 is commonly used to date peat deposits accumulated over the last 100-150 years. However, several studies have questioned this method because of an apparent post-depositional mobility of Pb-210 within somepeat profiles. In this study, we introduce the Initial Penetration-Constant Rate of Supply (IP-CRS) model for calculating ages derived from Pb-210 profiles that are altered by an initial migration of the radio-nuclide. This new, two-phased, model describes the distribution of atmospheric-derived Pb-210 (Pb-210(xs)) in peat taking into account both incorporation of Pb-210 into the accumulating peat matrix as well as an initial flushing of Pb-210 through the uppermost peat layers. The validity of the IP-CRS model is tested in four anomalous Pb-210 peat records that showed some deviations from the typical exponential decay profile not explained by variations in peat accumulation rates. Unlike the most commonly used Pb-210-dating model (Constant Rate of Supply (CRS)), the IP-CRS model estimates peat accumulation rates consistent with typical growth rates for peatlands from the same areas. Confidence in the IP-CRS chronology is also provided by the good agreement with independent chronological markers (i.e. Am-241 and Cs-137). Our results showed that the IP-CRS can provide chronologies from peat records where Pb-210 mobility is evident, being a valuable tool for studies reconstructing past environmental changes using peat archives during the Anthropocene.

AB Peatland vegetation is dominant among azonal vegetation types within the central zone of Lake Baikal eastern coast. In order to classify the phytosociological diversity of peatland vegetation, the supervised k-means clustering method was applied. According to the main concept of the method, the unidentified dataset from this study was subjected to the classification among identified units (a priorigroups) from the north-eastern area of Lake Baikal. The unidentified dataset is composed of 55 releves, which were collected in the central zone of the Lake Baikal eastern coast. The identifieda priorigroups comprise 12 associations distinguished according to the Braun-Blanquet approach. Those associations are based on classification of 138 releves, which were taken in the course of studies of the north-eastern part of Lake Baikal, such as Svyatoi Nos Peninsula and Barguzinskiy mountain range. As a result, we obtained the assignment of unidentified releves among thosea priorigroups. The supervised k-means clustering performed well in assignment of unidentified releves toa priorigroups and proved to be a useful tool for the classification and syntaxonomical positioning of unidentified peatland vegetation. The peatland vegetation was classified into classes:Oxycocco-SphagneteaandScheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae.

AB Ecological restoration has great potential for reversing anthropogenic degradation, as it aims at the simultaneous recovery of several ecosystem functions and services. However, it can be challenging to evaluate multiple restoration targets based on a high number of indicators, and this calls for a multifunctionality approach. Multifunctionality is an integrated measure of the relative supply of multiple ecosystem functions or services. As temporal aspects are of key importance for ecosystem recovery, we analyzed multifunctionality against time since restoration. We used rewetted peatlands in a mountainous region in Central Germany as a study case. Restored peatlands are expected to become multifunctional, while their recovery is rather slow. We investigated to what extent rewetted peatlands recover, and how time since restoration controls the simultaneous development of multiple ecosystem properties. We studied restored peatlands with respect to plant diversity, water table, peat decomposition, water holding capacity, and nutrient level using a chronosequence of 0-18 yr after restoration. We analyzed the development of individual properties and of a combined index. We further compared the recovery of restored sites at different ages to an intact reference peatland and to a theoretical optimum value, defined as the mean of the eleven most desirable values observed. Eleven out of 13 peatland properties and the combined index significantly evolved with time since restoration. Nevertheless, we could not observe a consistent trend of multiple properties if aiming at highest levels of functioning, whereas there was progress with time if low or intermediate functioning is targeted. Our results show that not all functions of restored peatlands can recover to the most desirable extent within 18 yr. However, the average functionality and some individual properties achieved levels comparable to the reference site, highlighting that improvement is possible. While the integrated assessment informs about the degree of ecosystem recovery, an additional analysis of individual properties helps understanding ecosystem-specific dynamics, which are needed for making decisions on potential future management.

AB Drainage is a globally common disturbance in forested peatlands that impacts peat soils, forest communities, and associated ecosystem functions, calling for informed hydrologic restoration strategies. The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in other degraded forested peatlands more broadly.

AB Peat moorlands are important habitats in the boreal region, where they store approximately 30% of the global soil carbon (C). Prescribed burning on peat is a very contentious management strategy, widely linked with loss of carbon. Here, we quantify the effects of prescribed burning for lightly managed boreal moorlands and show that the impacts on peat and C accumulation rates are not as bad as is widely thought. We used stratigraphical techniques within a unique replicated ecological experiment with known burn frequencies to quantify peat and C accumulation rates (0, 1, 3 and 6 managed burns since around 1923). Accumulation rates were typical of moorlands elsewhere, and were reduced significantly only in the 6-burn treatment. However, impacts intensified gradually with burn frequency; each additional burn reduced the accumulation rates by 4.9 g m(-2) yr(-1) (peat) and 1.9 g C cm(-2) yr(-1), but did not prevent accumulation. Species diversity and the abundance of peat-forming species also increased with burn frequency. Our data challenge widely held perceptions that a move to O burning is essential for peat growth, and show that appropriate prescribed burning can both mitigate wildfire risk in a warmer world and produce relatively fast peat growth and sustained C sequestration.

AB The Bois-des-Bel Sphagnum peatland (Riviere du Loup, QC) was restored in 1999 after 20 years of abandonment. Restoration work included not only the blockage of drainage ditches, but also the reintroduction of plant material including Sphagnum remains. Following restoration, the physicochemical and microbial characteristics (biomass, activity and composition) of the peat were analysed. The goal was to investigate the functional status of the restored ecosystem. The high N:P (> 20) and N:K (> 15) ratios indicated possible K and P deficiencies in the restored and the cutover sites, which is mainly associated with the intense leaching and the high degree of decomposition of the peat in these sites. The concentrations of NH4+, P and K in the top layer of the restored site were closer to those of the natural site, which indicated a possible effect of restoration on the physicochemistry of the restored site. Microbial biomass values derived from the FE technique followed a gradient natural > restored > cutover through the profile, which was not the case with the SIR technique. Values from SIR varied overall between 0.19 and 4.88 mg C g(-1) and were significantly higher in the natural site. The natural peatland site had significantly (P < 0.05) greater cumulative C-CO2 production (surface aerobic: 4.5-8.7 mu g C-CO2 g(-1) h(-1)). The poor organic matter quality was the main explanation for the low respiration rates of the surface layer in the restored and the cutover site. All CO2 respiration data were plotted against time and the resulting curves were successfully fitted to a global kinetic model. Methane production was detected at low but measurable rates in the natural and the restored samples, but not in the cutover peat. Overall, the results confirmed the existence of a lag between the positive response of vegetation to restoration and that of the microbial compartment. This study also pointed out that some physicochemical dysfunctions remained even after three growing seasons following restoration in the subsurface horizons studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CO2 exchange of a natural flark fen was studied in open-field conditions during 2003-2005. The experimental site was located in SodankylA in northern Finland (67 degrees 22'N, 26 degrees 38'E, 179 m a.s.l.). Altogether 30 study plots, each 120 cm x 120 cm in size, were randomly distributed between three treatments (n=10): ambient control, UV-A control and UV-B treatment. The UV-B-treated plots were exposed to elevated UV-B radiation level for three growing seasons. The instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and dark respiration (R-TOT) were measured during the growing season using a closed chamber method. The wintertime CO2 emissions were estimated using a gradient technique by analyzing the CO2 concentration in the snow pack. In addition to the instantaneous CO2 exchange, the seasonal CO2 balances during the growing seasons were modeled using environmental data measured at the site. In general, the instantaneous NEE at light saturation was slightly higher in the UV-B treatment compared with the ambient control, but the gross photosynthesis was unaffected by the exposure. The R-TOT was significantly lower under elevated UV-B in the third study year. The modeled seasonal (June-September) CO2 balance varied between the years depending on the ground water level and temperature conditions. During the driest year, the seasonal CO2 balance was negative (net release of CO2) in the ambient control and the UV-B treatment was CO2 neutral. During the third year, the seasonal CO2 uptake was 43 +/- 36 g CO2-C m(-2) in the ambient control and 79 +/- 45 g CO2-C m(-2) in the UV-B treatment. The results suggest that the long-term exposure to high UV-B radiation levels may slightly increase the CO2 accumulation to fens resulting from a decrease in microbial activity in peat. However, it is unlikely that the predicted development of the level of UV-B radiation would significantly affect the CO2 balance of fen ecosystems in future.

AB Vertical peat profiles can only be used as archives of past changes in pollution levels if atmogenic elements are immobile after their burial. For mobile elements, similar pore-water concentrations can be expected at different peat depths. Concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Cd were determined in surface bog water and bog pore water 40 cm below surface in two Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs in the Czech Republic. Velke jerabi jezero (VJJ) is an upland bog located in an industrial area, Cervene blato (CB) is a lowland bog located in a rural area. Metal concentrations were monitored seasonally over 3 years (2002-2005) at both sites. Higher concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr and Cd and lower concentrations of Mn, Fe and Co were found at the less polluted CB compared to VJJ. No clear-cut seasonality was observed in metal concentrations in bog waters, despite seasonal differences in industrial emission rates of pollutants (more coal burning in winter than in summer). This contrasts with an earlier observation of distinct seasonality in sulfate concentration and isotope composition in these stagnating bog waters. Peat substrate 40 cm below current bog surface represented pre-industrial low-pollution environment, yet pore waters at such depths contained the same metal concentrations as surface waters. The only exception was Pb, whose concentration in water solutes increased with increasing depth. Lack of vertical stratification in pore-water contents of Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co indicated vertical mobility of these metals. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Canada; Holocene; Hudson Bay Lowlands; methane; peatlands; testate

AB Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane, yet the roles of source region and paleoclimate in explaining the variability in Holocene atmospheric methane concentrations remain poorly constrained. The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is one of the world's largest continuous peatland regions and a significant source of methane. We present here, using a novel proxy-based approach, Holocene methane fluxes for the HBL. Paleo-methane fluxes were quantified based on water table depth (WTD), inferred from testate amoeba assemblages in nine peat records. WTDs were reconstructed using a North American transfer function and were used to estimate paleo-methane flux through a linear regression model of contemporary growing season methane fluxes and WTDs from 88 sites across the region. Following HBL peatland initiation in the Middle Holocene, total methane flux is closely related to the increasing area of land emerging from below sea level, controlled by rapid rates of glacial isostatic adjustment. In the Late Holocene, rates of uplift slowed, but methane fluxes remained high due to lower evapotranspiration in a wetter and cooler climate. We estimate that 4.8 +/- 1.6 Pg C has been released from HBL peatlands to the atmosphere as CH4 over the last 8,000 years, with an average annual methane emission of 1.1 Tg CH4 yr(-1) in the Late Holocene. The values estimated here are broadly consistent with those calculated from other independent methods, on modern and Holocene timescales, demonstrating that testate amoeba records provide an effective approach for scaling local processes to regional paleo-methane emissions.

AB During the last decades, increasing exports of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron were observed from peat catchments in North America and Europe with potential consequences for water quality of streamwater and carbon storages of soils. As mobilisation and transport processes of DOC and iron in peat catchments are only partly understood, the purpose of this study was to elucidate these processes in an intensively monitored and studied system. Specifically, it was hypothesised that dissimilatory iron reduction in riparian peatland soils mobilises DOC initially adsorbed to iron minerals. During stormflow conditions, both DOC and iron will be transported into the stream network. Ferrous iron may be reoxidised at redox interfaces on its way to the stream, and subsequently, ferric iron could be transported together with DOC as complexes. To test these hypotheses, generalised additive models (GAMs) were applied to 14 years of weekly time series of discharge and concentrations of selected solutes measured in a German headwater stream called Lehstenbach. This stream drains a 4.19-km(2) forested mountain catchment; one third of which is covered by riparian peatland soils. We interpreted results of different types of GAM in the way that (a) iron reduction drove the mobilisation of DOC from peatland soils and that (b) both iron and DOC were transported as complexes after their joint mobilisation to and within the steam. It was speculated that low nitrate availability in the uppermost wetland soil layer, particularly during the growing season, promoted iron reduction and thus the mobilisation of DOC. However, the influence of nitrate on the DOC mobilisation remains relatively uncertain. This influence could be further investigated using methods similar to the GAM analysis conducted here for other catchments with long-term data as well as detailed measurements of the relevant species in riparian wetland soils and the adjacent stream network.

AB Controls on the fate of similar to 277 Pg of soil organic carbon (C) stored in permafrost peatland soils remain poorly understood despite the potential for a significant positive feedback to climate change. Our objective was to quantify the temperature, moisture, organic matter, and microbial controls on soil organic carbon (SOC) losses following permafrost thaw in peat soils across Alaska. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from peat samples collected at active layer and permafrost depths when incubated aerobically and anaerobically at -5, -0.5, +4, and +20 degrees C. Temperature had a strong, positive effect on C emissions; global warming potential (GWP) was >3x larger at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. Anaerobic conditions significantly reduced CO2 emissions and GWP by 47% at 20 degrees C but did not have a significant effect at -0.5 degrees C. Net anaerobic CH4 production over 30 days was 7.1 +/- 2.8 mu g CH4-C gC(-1) at 20 degrees C. Cumulative CO2 emissions were related to organic matter chemistry and best predicted by the relative abundance of polysaccharides and proteins (R-2 = 0.81) in SOC. Carbon emissions (CO2-C + CH4-C) from the active layer depth peat ranged from 77% larger to not significantly different than permafrost depths and varied depending on the peat type and peat decomposition stage rather than thermal state. Potential SOC losses with warming depend not only on the magnitude of temperature increase and hydrology but also organic matter quality, permafrost history, and vegetation dynamics, which will ultimately determine net radiative forcing due to permafrost thaw.

AB A forest-bog landscape is developed in an area of moderate to low topography in northeastern China. Bogs are widespread along U- and V-shaped valleys (200-2000 m wide) and in depressions: Due to the cold climate, it was initially thought that chemical weathering would be slight in the area. However, a study of the geochemistry of surface water showed that, although most elements occur in relatively low concentrations compared to average contents in world river water, a number of mobile elements are dispersed over long distances. Marked Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and SO42- anomalies, and relatively weak Ni, Co, Be, Pb and F anomalies form in stream water in the vicinity of known mineralization. Concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, and Mn in suspensates show no marked variations between background and anomalous streams whereas Ag exhibits a marked increase in suspensates near the mineralization. The pH of stream water near the mineralization is considerably lower than the 5 to 6.5 values recorded for background water. It can be concluded that water plays an important role in transporting elements chemically and stream water is a useful medium to sample in follow-up geochemical surveys for base and precious metals (Ag) in this landscape.

AB Many of the world's northern peatlands are underlain by rapidly thawing permafrost. Because plant production in these peatlands is often nitrogen (N)-limited, a release of N stored in permafrost may stimulate net primary production or change species composition if it is plant-available. In this study, we aimed to quantify plant-available N in thawing permafrost soils of subarctic peatlands. We compared plant-available N-pools and -fluxes in near-surface permafrost (010cm below the thawfront) to those taken from a current rooting zone layer (515cm depth) across five representative peatlands in subarctic Sweden. A range of complementary methods was used: extractions of inorganic and organic N, inorganic and organic N-release measurements at 0.5 and 11 degrees C (over 120days, relevant to different thaw-development scenarios) and a bioassay with Poa alpina test plants. All extraction methods, across all peatlands, consistently showed up to seven times more plant-available N in near-surface permafrost soil compared to the current rooting zone layer. These results were supported by the bioassay experiment, with an eightfold larger plant N-uptake from permafrost soil than from other N-sources such as current rooting zone soil or fresh litter substrates. Moreover, net mineralization rates were much higher in permafrost soils compared to soils from the current rooting zone layer (273mgNm-2 and 1348mgNm-2 per growing season for near-surface permafrost at 0.5 degrees C and 11 degrees C respectively, compared to -30mgNm-2 for current rooting zone soil at 11 degrees C). Hence, our results demonstrate that near-surface permafrost soil of subarctic peatlands can release a biologically relevant amount of plant available nitrogen, both directly upon thawing as well as over the course of a growing season through continued microbial mineralization of organically bound N. Given the nitrogen-limited nature of northern peatlands, this release may have impacts on both plant productivity and species composition.

DT Article
ID SITE
AB A site-productivity model for Norway spruce on fen peat in central Ireland was derived by stepwise regression of measured soil data on yield class (the expected maximum mean annual volume increment for the crop, expressed in cubic metres per annum per hectare). Soil C/N ratio, soil air space and hydrogen ion concentration explained 73% of the observed variation in yield class. The results indicated that the yield class of Norway spruce on fen was correlated with the physical properties of the peat and that, assuming adequate inputs of P and K, this species will be most productive on poorly decomposed, well-drained fen which exhibits a botanical composition indicative of relatively poor nutrition at the time of peat formation.

AB Knowledge on soil microbial respiration (SMR) rates and thus soil-related CO2 losses from Arctic soils is vital because of the crucial importance of this ecosystem within the global carbon (C) cycle and climate system. Here, we measured SMR from various habitats during the growing season in Russian subarctic tundra by applying two different approaches: C-14 partitioning approach and root trenching. The variable habitats encompassed peat and mineral soils, bare and vegetated surfaces and included both dry and moist ones. The field experiment was complemented by laboratory studies to measure bioavailability of soil carbon and identify sources of CO2. Differences in bioavailability of soils, measured in the laboratory as basal soil respiration rates, were generally greater than inter-site differences in SMR rates measured in situ, suggesting secondary constraints at field conditions, such as soil C content. There was a tendency towards lower SMR in vegetated peat plateaus compared to upland mineral tundra (on average 137 vs. 185 g CO2 m(-2) growing season(-1), respectively), but no significant differences were found. Surprisingly, the bare surfaces (peat circles) with 3500-year-old C at the surface exhibited about the largest SMR among all sites as shown by both methods. This was related to the general development of peat plateaus in the region, and uplifting of deeper peat with high C content to the surface during the genesis of peat circles. This observation is particularly relevant for decomposition of deeper peat in vegetated peat plateaus, where soil material similar to the bare surfaces can be found. The data indicate that the large stocks of C stored in permafrost peatlands are principally available for decomposition despite old age.

AB Year-round flooding provides a common land management practice to reestablish the natural carbon dioxide (CO2) sink function of drained peatlands. Here we present eddy covariance measurements of net CO2 exchange from a temperate fen during three consecutive growing seasons (May-October) that span a period of conversion from moderately rewetting to flooding. When we started our measurements in 2009, the hydrological conditions were representative for the preceding 20years with a mean growing season water level (MWGL) of 0cm but considerably lower water levels in summer. Flooding began in 2010 with an MWGL of 36cm above the surface. The fen was a net CO2 sink throughout all growing seasons (2009: -333.312.3, 2010: -294.18.4, 2011: -352.45.1g C m(-2)), but magnitudes of canopy photosynthesis (CP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) differed distinctively. Rates of CP and Reco were high before flooding, dropped by 46% and 61%, respectively, in 2010, but increased again during the beginning of growing season 2011 until the water level started to rise further due to strong rainfalls during June and July. We assume that flooding decreases not only the CO2 release due to inhibited Reco under anaerobic conditions but also CO2 sequestration rates are constricted due to decreased CP. We conclude that rewetting might act as a disturbance for a plant community that has adapted to drier conditions after decades of drainage. However, if the recent species are still abundant, a rise in CP and autotrophic Reco can be expected after plants have developed plastic response strategies to wetter conditions.

AB In most high-latitude wetlands, carbon accumulation as peat represents a balance between plant net primary productivity and heterotrophic decomposition. We hypothesized that this assessment of ecosystem metabolism is incomplete as it does not include information on energy inputs from microalgae, which form complex biofilms with heterotrophic micro-organisms on the peat surface. To investigate the potential for algae (and associated exudates) to support heterotrophic metabolism under ambient and elevated nutrient levels, we conducted a factorial enrichment of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and carbon (glucose) in mesocosms with and without the presence of algae (using light-transparent and dark treatments, respectively) in an Alaskan fen. We measured respiration rates and changes in bacterial biomass to characterize the response of heterotrophic bacteria to our experimental treatments. During incubation assays, algae released up to 38% of their net productivity as exudates and there was a positive relationship between algal production and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon inside mesocosms. Elevated algal productivity in the presence of nutrient enrichment stimulated heterotrophic bacterial respiration and biomass. These responses did not occur with nutrient enrichment in the dark (without algae). The response of bacteria to algae was similar in magnitude to bacterial responses to glucose enrichment.Synthesis. We conclude that bacteria in this boreal fen were primarily limited by labile carbon, and this constraint was alleviated in the presence of elevated algal production. Consequently, algae may facilitate hotspots of microbial activity in northern peatlands, especially in conditions of greater nutrient availability associated with more variable hydrology expected for this region with ongoing climate change.

AB Streams and rivers constitute a dense network with a large interface to the surrounding landscape and are thus highly susceptible to anthropogenic pressures related to land-use activities in adjacent riparian and upland areas. In the present study, we investigated the influence of catchment characteristics on potential propagule and species recruitment from sediment in lowland stream ecosystems. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) catchment characteristics affect species recruitment from stream sediment in both stream and riparian habitats and (2) recruitment of species associated with undisturbed fen-meadow habitats is higher in places with natural vegetation in the riparian zones. A large number of wetland species emerged from the stream sediment and sediment recruitment and therefore can act as an important dispersal corridor for common species in stream ecosystems. The recruited propagules were dominated by terrestrial species, but amphibious and aquatic species also appeared, particularly in the artificial stream channels. These included among others species within the genera Ranunculus sp., Callitriche sp. and Potamogeton sp. The large between-site differences in land-use characteristics in the riparian zones of the studied stream reaches, both locally and along upstream reaches, were not reflected in species recruitment from the stream sediments. Thus, most recruited species were common and widely distributed, and they were dominated by species with ruderal and competitive life history strategies, whereas only few species associated with fen-meadow vegetation were recruited. From these findings, we infer not only that hydrochorous dispersal of species can be a potential efficient dispersal vector in agricultural landscapes but also that limitations can exist as to which species can be recruited. We suggest that further studies are performed to elucidate this issue further. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Field measurements and incubation techniques were used to determine the dynamics of acetate formation, iron reduction, and methanogenesis in surficial peat of an Alaskan bog. Acetate concentrations were similar to100 muM early in the season and decreased to similar to20 muM in July when the water table decreased. Acetate levels increased rapidly to similar to1000 muM when the water table rose to the surface in August. Acetate production in anaerobic slurries occurred at rates of 2.8-420 nmol carbon mL(-1) day(-1), which was 7-120 times more rapid than CH4 production. Experiments utilizing C-14-acetate confirmed that methanogenesis was not acetoclastic although acetate was converted very slowly to CO2. Peat incubated anaerobically for 4.5 months at 24degreesC never produced methane from acetate, suggesting that anaerobic acetate accumulation would have occurred all season if the water table had remained high. CO2 production was the most rapid process measured in laboratory incubations (up to 750 nmol mL(-1) day(-1)) and appeared to be due primarily to fermentation. Acetate was the primary organic terminal product of anaerobic decomposition in the bog, and acetate was ultimately oxidized to CO2 via aerobic respiration and to a much lesser extent anaerobically by Fe reduction.

AB Copper (Cu) is essential for all organisms but is commonly deficient in organic soils or found locally in excess. Natural and anthropogenic inputs of Cu were examined using 32 peat cores from bogs in Europe, North America, New Zealand, Greenland, and Antarctica. The natural abundance of Cu in ombrotrophic (rainwater-fed) peat was studied using (1) samples from pre-industrial periods (representing background values), (2) bromine (Br) concentrations and the background Cu/Br ratio, and (3) cores from remote locations. Etang de la Gruere in Switzerland provides a record of 15 000 yr of peat accumulation. The lowest Cu concentrations (1.0 +/- 0.20 mgkg(-1)) are found in 18 peat layers dating from ca. 6000 to 9000 cal yr BP, when atmospheric deposition of soil-derived dust was at a minimum. Similar background values occur in peat bogs from other regions. Recent peat layers from bogs in developed areas reveal much greater concentrations. Using the Cu/Br ratio, "excess" Cu in peat profiles can be calculated and attributed either to anthropogenic inputs in recent peats or natural inputs from mineral-water interactions in deeper layers. Peat cores from remote regions of northern Alberta show little or no evidence of anthropogenic Cu.

AB Modeling hydrological processes in certain peats requires a detailed understanding of short-term changes in soil volume and it's influence on the system's hydraulic properties. A study of cutover sites abandoned for 7-years (H92) and 2-years (H97), and an undisturbed section of the Lac Saint-Jean (LSJ) cutover bog was conducted to characterize peat volume changes and its associated hydrological behaviour. Shrinkage and compression accounted for 96-97% of seasonal volume change. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) varied linearly with peat compression; a I cm decrease in peat thickness causing a 5.2 cm d(-1) decrease in K-S at H92, and a 1.4 cm d(-1) decrease in K-S at H97. A 2-6% seasonal decrease in saturated volumetric moisture content (theta(S)) at the cutover sites was partly due to soil compression, although the development of CH4 bubbles possibly affected moisture content. In the unsaturated zone moisture retentivity (theta-Psi) was seasonally transient due to the shifting soil structure. The greater volumetric response to a change in water storage of the more porous and less decomposed peat at H97 indicates a long-term decreasing trend in peat compressibility due to irreversible losses in pore volume. Deterioration of high water storage and low water retention properties at H92 suggests that cutover sites abandoned for longer periods will become increasingly hostile to Sphagnum recolonization despite the blockage of drainage ditches.

AB Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. How phenol oxidase activity in peatlands will respond to increased aeration induced by water-table drawdown or droughts if global warming continues remains unclear. We investigated the short-term effects of drought induced acidification on phenol oxidase activities of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in central China. The results indicated a significant acidification induced by drought, with a decline in the average pH value from 5.67 +/- A 0.08 under waterlogging to 4.84 +/- A 0.08 in droughted peat. In addition, drought-treated peat had a lower average value of phenol oxidase activities compared to the waterlogging-treated peat (mean values of 0.1404 +/- A 0.0305 and 0.2623 +/- A 0.0324 mu mol diqc min(-1) g(-1), respectively). The decreased phenol oxidase activities were mainly attributed to the acidification induced by drought. However, the declines in phenol oxidase activity did not lead to the reduction of the degradation in the deeper peat. Under drought conditions, a considerable part of the adsorbed phenolics, consisting primarily of high molecular-weight organic substances with phenolic groups, were further degraded into smaller-sized or lower molecular weight hydrophilic fractions in the vicinity of the water table. Our results highlight the important role of the water table position in peat decomposition processes. Even with lower activities of phenol oxidase, the decomposition processes were able to effectively keep on going as long as there was sufficient supply of water, oxygen and nutrients.

AB Oxidation of sulphides leads to the dissolution of metals, which are transported with water and accumulate at geochemical barriers. Such barriers can form in peat bogs. This paper gives an introduction into the long-term processes in Oostriku peat bog where high accumulations of heavy metals are observed. Peat and water samples are analysed for Fe, As and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) using different methods. A concept is based on the observations. Metals are leached by sulphide oxidation in the carbonate rocks upstream of the peat. The water feeds the peat from below. The metals are sorbed and precipitated in the peat. The sulphide oxidation is simulated to examine the origin and metal speciation in the water. The simulated solution is compared with the groundwater entering the peat. The results showed a fair agreement for the major constituents. There were considerable differences for species with low concentrations.

AB Questions: What are the long-term effects of climate change on the plant species composition and carbon sequestration in peat bogs?
   Methods: We developed a bog ecosystem model that includes vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics. Two groups of vascular plant species and three groups of Sphagnum species compete with each other for light and nitrogen. The model was tested by comparing the outcome with long-term historic vegetation changes in peat cores from Denmark and England. A climate scenario was used to analyse the future effects of atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation.
   Results: The main changes in the species composition since 1766 were simulated by the model. Simulations for a future warmer, and slightly wetter, climate with doubling CO2 concentration suggest that little will change in species composition, due to the contrasting effects of increasing temperatures ( favouring vascular plants) and CO2 ( favouring Sphagnum). Further analysis of the effects of temperature showed that simulated carbon sequestration is negatively related to vascular plant expansion. Model results show that increasing temperatures may still increase carbon accumulation at cool, low N deposition sites, but decrease carbon accumulation at high N deposition sites.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the effects of temperature, precipitation, N-deposition and atmospheric CO2 are not straightforward, but interactions between these components of global change exist. These interactions are the result of changes in vegetation composition. When analysing long-term effects of global change, vegetation changes should be taken into account and predictions should not be based on temperature increase alone.

AB Peat deposits of area up to 50 m(2) and thickness of 10-50 cm on fell summits at 370-622 m a.s.l. in northern Finland have been mapped, analysed and dared. These summit 'peat cakes' are most frequent in northwestern Inari Lapland, in a relatively continental climate and close to the Arctic Ocean. It seems that the most important local factor for their development are irregularities in microtopography, which collect drift snow and shelter plants from destructive winds. Most sites are dominated by Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum. Accumulation of peat started after the Atlantic period c. 4000 C-14 years BP, when the climate became more humid. The mean annual growth of seven investigated deposits ranged from 0.11 to 0.44 mm yr(-1). Plant macro-remains at Kuovdaoaivi provide evidence of gradual vegetation development from an Empetrum-dominated community to a more diverse one: macro-remain concentration and the number of species rise gradually to the top of the deposit. At present, summit peats are being eroded by deflation, enhanced by needle ice and reindeer overgrazing. It seems that these peat deposits represent embryonic blanket mires at the continental limit of high-latitude blanket mire distribution.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs in southern Patagonia have been examined with regard to paleoclimatic and geochemical research questions but knowledge about organic matter decomposition in these bogs is limited. Therefore, we examined peat humification with depth by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) measurements of solid peat, C/N ratio, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope measurements in three bog sites. Peat decomposition generally increased with depth but distinct small scale variation occurred, reflecting fluctuations in factors controlling decomposition. C/N ratios varied mostly between 40 and 120 and were significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.55, p < 0.01) with FTIR-derived humification indices. The degree of decomposition was lowest at a site presently dominated by Sphagnum mosses. The peat was most strongly decomposed at the driest site, where currently peat-forming vegetation produced less refractory organic material, possibly due to fertilizing effects of high sea spray deposition. Decomposition of peat was also advanced near ash layers, suggesting a stimulation of decomposition by ash deposition. Values of delta C-13 were 26.5 +/- 2 parts per thousand in the peat and partly related to decomposition indices, while delta N-15 in the peat varied around zero and did not consistently relate to any decomposition index. Concentrations of DOM partly related to C/N ratios, partly to FTIR derived indices. They were not conclusively linked to the decomposition degree of the peat. DOM was enriched in C-13 and in N-15 relative to the solid phase probably due to multiple microbial modifications and recycling of N in these N-poor environments. In summary, the depth profiles of C/N ratios, delta C-13 values, and FTIR spectra seemed to reflect changes in environmental conditions affecting decomposition, such as bog wetness, but were dominated by site specific factors, and are further influenced by ash deposition and possibly by sea spray input.

AB The natural radionuclide Pb-210 is commonly used to establish accurate and precise chronologies for the recent (past 100-150 years) layers of peat deposits. The most widely used Pb-210-dating model, Constant Rate of Supply (CRS), was applied using data from three peat cores from Chao de Lamoso, an ombrotrophic mire in Galicia (NW Spain). On the basis of the CRS-chronologies, maximum Pb concentrations and enrichment factors (EFs) occurred in the 1960s and late 1970s, consistent with the historical use of Pb. However, maximum Pb fluxes were dated in the 1940s and the late 1960s, 10 to 20 years earlier. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that, although the Pb-210 distribution was mainly (74%) controlled by radioactive decay, about 20% of the Pb-210 flux variability was associated with atmospheric metal pollution, suggesting an extra Pb-210 supply source and thus invalidating the main assumption of the CRS model. When the CRS-ages were recalculated after correcting for the extra input from the Pb-210 inventory of the uppermost peat layers of each core, Pb flux variations were consistent with the historical atmospheric Pb deposition. Our results not only show the robustness of the CRS model to establish accurate chronologies of recent peat deposits but also provide evidence that there are confounding factors that might influence the calculation of reliable peat accumulation rates (and thus also element accumulation rates/fluxes). This study emphasizes the need to verify the hypotheses of Pb-210-dating models and the usefulness of a full geochemical interpretation of peat bog records. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper documents a 7800-year proxy record from the Shenjiadian peatland on the Sanjiang Plain in Northeast China. High-resolution plant macrofossil and colorimetric humification methods were used to reconstruct the vegetation and hydrologic history from a 193 cm-long sedimentary profile. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was applied to transform the raw plant macrofossil data into latent indices of peatland water level. The vegetation community transited from an Equisetum fluviatile community to a Carex lasiocarpa community at approximately 3800 cal yr BP and was followed by a Carex-shrub community at approximately 480 cal yr BP. Based on the plant macrofossil DCA axis 1 scores and humification values, we distinguished four hydrologic periods: a wet period from 7800 cal yr BP to 4500 cal yr BP, dry periods up to 1600 cal yr BP, drier periods until 300 cal yr BP, and the driest period from 300 cal yr BP until the present. Through a comparison with other climate records, we suggest that the East Asian summer monsoon (EAM) was the main driving force for vegetation and water level changes to the Shenjiadian peatland through its impacts on precipitation.

AB The vertical distributions of three heavy metals: Hg, Pb and Cd were determined in 3 cores sampled from two ombrotrophic bogs in the west of Ireland, one at Knockroe Co. Mayo, and the second at Letterfrack National Park, Co. Galway. Core chronologies were established using (210)Pb dating techniques and were checked with fallout radionuclides from weapons testing. Variations were found in metal concentrations and cumulative inventories of each of the metals within each site and between the two sites. Maximum accumulation rates of the anthropogenically derived elements Hg, Pb, and Cd, were found in peat sediments dated between 1950 and 1970s at both sites.
   Pb and Hg accumulation rates are slightly lower than those found in similar studies from remote sites in Europe. Hg accumulation rates are fairly similar to those found in peatlands in America. Unlike the Pb and Hg concentration profiles, the Cd concentration profiles at the Letterfrack site were dominated by a surface enrichment, thought to be due to biological cycling of Cd in the peat. However Cd accumulation rates calculated at the Knockroe site are lower than those observed in Eastern Europe. Local meteorological conditions at the sites chosen for this study may account for the lower concentrations profiles observed when compared with some of the European studies. The similarity between the timing of the increase in metal accumulation rates in peat bogs in Northern America and this study could indicate that long range transportation of trace metals from Northern America may be occurring. Lead accumulations in the surface peat sediments (1993-1996) were between 1.5-3.0 mg m(-2) yr(-1) and 4-5 mg m(-2) yr(-1) at Knockroe and Letterfrack, respectively. Mercury accumulation rates for the same period at Knockroe were found to be between 6-11 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), and between 19-24 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) at Letterfrack. A greater variation in surface Cd accumulation rates was observed at both sites, with surface layer accumulation rates varying from 25 to 50 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) at Knockroe and between 166 and 405 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) at Letterfrack. Higher metal concentrations were found at the Letterfrack site, which are most likely due to local sources and the history of the site. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The aims of this study are to investigate historical PAH deposition through the analysis of PAHs in bulk peat cores and reveal the different distribution of PAHs in Sphagnum and Ledum peat from peat cores.
   Materials and methods Peat cores from Jingjiang peatland are collected, and Sphagnum peat samples are manually separated from bulk peat. The remaining bulk peat samples are defined as "Ledum peat." Cs-137 is used to date the peat cores. PAH contents as well as physicochemical property of Sphagnum and Ledum peat are determined.
   Results and discussion The PAH deposition rates measured in the bulk peat cores range from 3.5 to 12.8 ng cm(-2)year(-1), which are different in both absolute values and trends from those of nearby sediment cores. Concentrations of PAHs in Sphagnum and Ledum at the surface are similar, indicating the accumulation ability by adsorption and uptake between two species of plants are similar. However, at depths of 5-30cm, concentrations of PAHs in Sphagnum peat are higher than those in Ledum peat, which can be attributed to their different PAH accumulation abilities or to different PAH degradation rates. An increase in PAHs/TOC ratios with depth in Sphagnum peat indicates that PAHs are resistant to degradation in Sphagnum peat. While a significant positive correlation between C/N and PAHs in Ledum peat suggests that PAHs may be degraded during peat decomposition in Ledum peat.
   Conclusions This study finds a difference in PAH concentrations between Sphagnum and Ledum peat. The results suggest that peat quality rather than microbials results in a difference in both PAH accumulation and degradation in peat cores.

AB The major and trace element compositions of stratified frozen peatlands in the forest-tundra of Northeastern European Russia were determined for the first time. The upper level of trace element accumulation was confined to the active (seasonally thawed) layer owing to airborne contamination over a long time span and related to the bioaccumulation of Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, and other heavy metals (HMs) by plants and humus materials. The character of element accumulation and migration in the active layer is controlled by the stability of HM humates. Under high-acidity conditions, HMs are highly mobile and migrate to the lower boundary of the active layer, which is indicated by an increase in the fraction of water-soluble forms of a number of elements. Analysis with a scanning electron microscope revealed the presence of spherical and semispherical particles up to 1 m in size containing Pb, Zn, Cr, and Ni in the upper peat levels, which indicates an anthropogenic source of their input owing to long-distance and local transport of air masses. The central level of element accumulation was confined to peat layers in the permafrost zone (60-120 cm), where enrichment in As and Cd relative to the mean contents in the Earth's crust (and approximate permissible concentrations, APC, for soils) and accumulation of Fe, Al, S, and siderophile elements were observed. The source rocks of the peatlands are loams enriched in Cd, Zn, and As. The statistical analysis of relations of the contents of major and trace elements in the stratified peat horizons with the composition of peat-forming materials showed a significant contribution of the biogenic accumulation of elements.

AB Northern wetlands make up a substantial terrestrial carbon sink and are often dominated by decay-resistant Sphagnum mosses. Recent studies have shown that planctomycetes appear to be involved in degradation of Sphagnum-derived debris. Novel trimethylornithine (TMO) lipids have recently been characterized as abundant lipids in various Sphagnum wetland planctomycete isolates, but their occurrence in the environment has not yet been confirmed. We applied a combined intact polar lipid (IPL) and molecular analysis of peat cores collected from two northern wetlands (Sax Mosse [Sweden] and Obukhovskoye [Russia]) in order to investigate the preferred niche and abundance of TMO-producing planctomycetes. TMOs were present throughout the profiles of Sphagnum bogs, but their concentration peaked at the oxic/anoxic interface, which coincided with a maximum abundance of planctomycete-specific 16S rRNA gene sequences. The sequences detected at the oxic/anoxic interface were affiliated with the Isosphaera group, while sequences present in the anoxic peat layers were related to an uncultured planctomycete group. Pyrosequencing-based analysis identified Planctomycetes as the major bacterial group at the oxic/anoxic interface at the Obukhovskoye peat (54% of total 16S rRNA gene sequence reads), followed by Acidobacteria (19% reads), while in the Sax Mosse peat, Acidobacteria were dominant (46%), and Planctomycetes contributed to 6% of the total reads. The detection of abundant TMO lipids in planctomycetes isolated from peat bogs and the lack of TMO production by cultures of acidobacteria suggest that planctomycetes are the producers of TMOs in peat bogs. The higher accumulation of TMOs at the oxic/anoxic interface and the change in the planctomycete community with depth suggest that these IPLs could be synthesized as a response to changing redox conditions at the oxic/anoxic interface.

AB Isoprene emission from Sphagnum species naturally growing at different positions above the water table were measured in a subarctic peatland and at monoliths from a temperate bog. Our objectives were to investigate (1) whether emission rates were species and/or moisture dependent, and (2) whether short-term temperature history had an influence on emission capacity. We expected greater emission capacities in moist than dry growing conditions, and from species adapted to wet habitats. We also expected that higher emission capacities would be found in response to elevated temperatures. Average peak growing season isoprene emission capacities (standardized to 20 degrees C and PAR 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at the subarctic site were 106 and 74 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) from a S. balticum wet lawn and a S. balticum dry hummock/palsa, respectively. Emission capacities correlated strongly with gross primary productivity (GPP) and the average air temperature of the 48 hours prior to measurement (T-48), but the effect of T-48 seemed to be partly masked by the influence of GPP when moisture was not limiting. The laboratory experiments suggested that a typical hummock species, S. rubellum had higher capacity for isoprene emission than a typical lawn species S. magellanicum. Instantaneous emission rates increased with temperature, but no effect of temperature history was discernible. Sphagnum mosses are known to emit substantial amounts of isoprene, but in this study we also showed significant inter-species differences in emission capacity. The results imply that climate change induced alterations of peatland hydrology may change the total ecosystem isoprene source strength, as individual species adapt to new growth conditions or as a consequence of species succession.

AB We combine a synoptic data set on organic carbon (C) concentrations in similar to 1000 Norwegian lakes with detailed information on catchment properties derived from digital maps of elevation, climate, vegetation density, and land use. The resulting regression model explains 83% of the variance in total organic C from eight predictor variables: mean air temperature, area specific runoff, terrain slope, vegetation density, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, water residence time, and catchment area fractions of bogs and arable land. Vegetation density, expressed as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was by far the strongest predictor, while area fraction of bogs in the catchment also gave a strong positive effect on organic C concentrations and export fluxes. The unbiased sampling of lakes relative to whole population of catchments in the region and the general robustness of the model, as witnessed by imputation and resampling tests, allowed confident prediction of organic C concentrations and export fluxes for all 20,000 catchments of the Norwegian mainland. The method used in this study can, with some modifications, be extended to larger geographical regions and holds promise for predicting organic C fluxes under changed climatic conditions.

AB Background Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP)-forested peatlands are widespread ecosystems in boreal North America in which peat accumulation, known as the paludification process, has been shown to induce forest growth decline. The continuously evolving environmental conditions (e.g., water table rise, increasing peat thickness) in paludified forests may require tree growth mechanism adjustments over time. In this study, we investigate tree ecophysiological mechanisms along a paludification gradient in a boreal forested peatland of eastern Canada by combining peat-based and tree-ring analyses. Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes in tree rings are used to document changes in carbon assimilation rates, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency. In addition, paleohydrological analyses are performed to evaluate the dynamical ecophysiological adjustments of black spruce trees to site-specific water table variations. Results Increasing peat accumulation considerably impacts forest growth, but no significant differences in tree water use efficiency (iWUE) are found between the study sites. Tree-ring isotopic analysis indicates no iWUE decrease over the last 100 years, but rather an important increase at each site up to the 1980s, before iWUE stabilized. Surprisingly, inferred basal area increments do not reflect such trends. Therefore, iWUE variations do not reflect tree ecophysiological adjustments required by changes in growing conditions. Local water table variations induce no changes in ecophysiological mechanisms, but a synchronous shift in iWUE is observed at all sites in the mid-1980s. Conclusions Our study shows that paludification induces black spruce growth decline without altering tree water use efficiency in boreal forested peatlands. These findings highlight that failing to account for paludification-related carbon use and allocation could result in the overestimation of aboveground biomass production in paludified sites. Further research on carbon allocation strategies is of utmost importance to understand the carbon sink capacity of these widespread ecosystems in the context of climate change, and to make appropriate forest management decisions in the boreal biome.

AB Wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. They emit CH4 because decomposition of soil organic matter in waterlogged anoxic conditions produces CH4, in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2). Production of CH4 and how much of it escapes to the atmosphere depend on a multitude of environmental drivers. Models simulating the processes leading to CH4 emissions are thus needed for upscaling observations to estimate present CH4 emissions and for producing scenarios of future atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Aiming at a CH4 model that can be added to models describing peatland carbon cycling, we composed a model called HIMMELI that describes CH4 build-up in and emissions from peatland soils. It is not a full peatland carbon cycle model but it requires the rate of anoxic soil respiration as input. Driven by soil temperature, leaf area index (LAI) of aerenchymatous peat-land vegetation, and water table depth (WTD), it simulates the concentrations and transport of CH4, CO2, and oxygen (O-2) in a layered one-dimensional peat column. Here, we present the HIMMELI model structure and results of tests on the model sensitivity to the input data and to the description of the peat column (peat depth and layer thickness), and demonstrate that HIMMELI outputs realistic fluxes by comparing modeled and measured fluxes at two peatland sites. As HIMMELI describes only the CH4-related processes, not the full carbon cycle, our analysis revealed mechanisms and dependencies that may remain hidden when testing CH4 models connected to complete peatland carbon models, which is usually the case. Our results indicated that (1) the model is flexible and robust and thus suitable for different environments; (2) the simulated CH4 emissions largely depend on the prescribed rate of anoxic respiration; (3) the sensitivity of the total CH4 emission to other input variables is mainly mediated via the concentrations of dissolved gases, in particular, the O-2 concentrations that affect the CH4 production and oxidation rates; (4) with given input respiration, the peat column description does not significantly affect the simulated CH4 emissions in this model version.

AB Near-annual pollen records for the last 100years were obtained from a 65-cm peat monolith from a raised peat bog in the Central Forest State Natural Biosphere Reserve (southern part of the Valdai Hills, European Russia) and compared with the available long-term meteorological observations. An age-depth model for the peat monolith was constructed by Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating. Cross-correlation and the Granger causality analysis indicated a broad range of statistically significant correlations between the pollen accumulation rate (PAR) of the main forest-forming trees and shrubs (Picea, Pinus, Betula, Tilia, Quercus, Ulmus, Alnus, and Corylus) and the air temperature and precipitation during the previous 3years. Results showed that high air temperatures during the growing season (May-September) in the year prior to the flowering led to an increase in pollen productivity of the main tree species. The statistically significant correlation between the PAR of trees and shrubs and winter precipitation of the current and previous years could reflect the influence of winter precipitation on soil water availability and as a result on tree growth and functioning in the spring.

AB The effects of increased tropospheric ozone (O-3) pollution levels on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands, and their underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, We exposed peatland mesocosms from a temperate wet heath dominated by the sedge Schoenus nigricans and Sphagnum papillosum to four O-3 treatments in open-top chambers for 2.5 years, to investigate the O-3 impacts on CH4 emissions and the processes that underpin these responses. Summer CH4 emissions, were significantly reduced, by 27% over the experiment, due to summer daytime (8 h day(-1)) O-3 exposure to non-filtered air (NFA) plus 35 ppb O-3, but were not significantly affected by year-round, 24h day(-1), exposure to NFA plus 10 ppb or NFA plus 25 ppb O-3. There was no evidence that the reduced CH4 emissions in response to elevated summer O-3 exposure were caused by reduced plant-derived carbon availability below-ground, because we found no significant effect of high summer O-3 exposure on root biomass, pore water dissolved organic carbon concentrations or the contribution of recent photosynthate to CH4 emissions. Our CH4 production potential and CH4 oxidation potential measurements in the different O-3 treatments could also not explain the observed CH4 emission responses to O-3. However, pore water ammonium concentrations at 20 cm depth were consistently reduced during the experiment by elevated summer O-3 exposure, and strong positive correlations were observed between CH4 emission and pore water ammonium concentration at three peat depths over the 2.5-year study. Our results therefore imply that elevated regional O-3 exposures in summer, but not the small increases in northern hemisphere annual mean background O-3 concentrations predicted over this century, may lead to reduced CH4 emissions from temperate peatlands as a consequence of reductions in soil inorganic nitrogen affecting methanogenic and/or methanotrophic activity.

AB Inland salt meadows are particularly valuable ecosystems, because they support a variety of salt-adapted species (halophytes). They can be found throughout Europe; including the peatlands of the glacial lowlands in northeast Germany. These German ecosystems have been seriously damaged through drainage. To assess and ultimately limit the damages, temporal monitoring of soil salinity is essential, which can be conducted by geoelectrical techniques that measure the soil electrical conductivity. However, there is limited knowledge on how to interpret electrical conductivity surveys of peaty salt meadows. In this study, temporal and spatial monitoring of dissolved salts was conducted in saline peatland soils using different geoelectrical techniques at different scales (1D: conductivity probe, 2D: conductivity cross-sections). Cores and soil samples were taken to validate the geoelectrical surveys. Although the influence of peat on bulk conductivity is large, the seasonal dynamics of dissolved salts within the soil profile could be monitored by repeated geoelectrical measurements. A close correlation is observed between conductivity (similar to salinity) at different depths and temperature, precipitation and corresponding groundwater level. The conductivity distribution between top- and subsoil during the growing season reflected the leaching of dissolved salts by precipitation and the capillary rise of dissolved salts by increasing temperature (similar to evaporation). Groundwater levels below 0.38 cm resulted in very low conductivities in the topsoil, which is presumably due to limited soil moisture and thus precipitation of salts. Therefore, to prevent the disappearance of dissolved salts from the rooting zone, which are essential for the halophytes, groundwater levels should be adjusted to maintain depths of between 20 and 35 cm. Lower groundwater levels will lead to the loss of dissolved salts from the rooting zone and higher levels to increasing dilution with fresh rainwater. The easy-to-handle conductivity probe is an appropriate tool for salinity monitoring. Using this probe with regressions adjusted for sandy and organic substrates (peat and organic gyttja) additional influences on bulk conductivity (e.g. cation exchange capacity, water content) can be compensated for and the correlation between salinity and electrical conductivity is high.

AB Bubbles can contribute a significant fraction of methane emissions from wetlands; however the range of reported fractions is very large and accurate characterization of this pathway has proven difficult. Here we show that continuous automated flux chambers combined with an integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) instrument allow us to quantify both CH4 ebullition rate and magnitude. For a temperate poor fen in 2009, ebullition rate varied on hourly to seasonal time scales. A diel pattern in ebullition was identified with peak release occurring between 20:00 and 06:00 local time, though steady fluxes (i.e., those with a linear increase in chamber headspace CH4 concentration) did not exhibit diel variability. Seasonal mean ebullition rates peaked at 843.5 +/- 384.2 events m(-2) d(-1) during the summer, with a mean magnitude of 0.19 mg CH4 released in each event. Citation: Goodrich, J. P., R. K. Varner, S.

AB Bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) is a key process in anaerobic respiration in wetlands and may have considerable impacts on methane emissions. A method to determine sulfate production and consumption in situ is lacking to date. We applied a single-well, injection-withdrawal tracer test for the in situ determination of potential sulfate turnover in a northern temperate peatland. Piezometers; were installed in three peat depth levels (20, 30, and 50 cm) during summer 2004, and three series of injection-withdrawal cycles were carried out over a period of several days. Turnover rates of sulfate, calculated from first-order-reaction constant k (-0.097 to 0.053 h(-1)) and pore-water sulfate concentrations (approx. 10 mu mol L-1), ranged from -1.3 to -9.0 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) for reduction and from +07 to +25.4 nmol cm(-2) d(-1) for production, which occurred after infiltration of water following a heavy rainstorm. Analysis of stable isotopes in peat-water sulfate revealed slightly increasing delta S-34 values and decreasing sulfate concentrations indicating the presence of BSR. The calculated low sulfur-fractionation factors of < 2 parts per thousand are in line with high sulfate-reduction rates during BSR. Routine application will require technical optimization, but the method seems a promising addition to common ex situ techniques, as the investigated soil is not structurally altered. The method can furthermore be applied at low expense even in remote locations.

AB In this study the trace and major elements and the character of their accumulation in peat, with a particular emphasis on peat properties and the impact of local and regional pollution sources on the character of element accumulation in the ombrotrophic bogs in Latvia, have been analysed. The values of the element concentrations in peat taken from 44 bogs in Latvia reflect the local processes of element concentrations in the peat mass indicating accumulation of trace elements, apparently of anthropogenic origin (Pb, Cd, Co, Ni and others), in the upper layers of the peat profiles. In addition they indicate accumulation of several elements (for example, As, Cr, and others) in deeper layers of bog, possibly due to the feeding pattern, depending on the saturation of the groundwater. The trace element sorption capacity onto peat is influenced by the peat properties and depends on the concentration of oxygen containing functional groups in peat and is growing with an increasing degree of decomposition and humic/fulvic acid ratio of the peat humic matter. Peat seems to be largely unsaturated in respect to metal ions, but the peat sorption capacity can be correlated with the presence of nitrogen containing ligands and humic/fulvic acid ratio.

AB Background and Aims Similarities between the floras of geographically comparable regions of New Zealand (NZ) and the southern Andes (SA) have interested biologists for over 150 years. The present work selects vegetation types that are physiognomically similar between the two regions, compares their floristic composition, assesses the environmental factors that characterize these matching vegetation types, and determines whether phylogenetic groups of ancestral versus modern origin are represented in different proportions in their floras, in the context of their biogeographic history.
   Methods Floristic relationships based on 369 genera of ten vegetation types present in both regions were investigated with correspondence analysis (CA) and ascending hierarchical clustering (AHC). The resulting ordination and classification were related to the environmental characteristics of the different vegetation types. The proportions of different phylogenetic groups between the regions (NZ, SA) were also compared, and between forest and non-forest communities.
   Key Results Floristic similarities between NZ and SA tend to increase from forest to non-forest vegetation, and are highest in coastal vegetation and bog. The floras of NZ and SA also differ in their phylogenetic origin, NZ being characterized by an 'excess' of genera of basal origin, especially in forests.
   Conclusions The relatively low similarities between forests of SA and NZ are related to the former being largely of in situ South American and Gondwanan origin, whereas the latter have been mostly reconstituted though transoceanic dispersal of propagules since the Oligocene. The greater similarities among non-forest plant communities of the two regions result from varied dispersal routes, including relatively recent transoceanic dispersal for coastal vegetation, possible dispersal via a still-vegetated Antarctica especially for bog plants, and independent immigration from Northern Hemisphere sources for many genera of alpine vegetation and grassland.

AB Wood ash (3.1, 3.3 or 6.6 tonnes dry weight ha(-1)) was used to fertilize two drained and forested peatland sites in southern Sweden. The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest floor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007-1 October 2008. No significant (p>0.05) changes in forest floor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha(-1), while the CH4 fluxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha(-1). The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0-0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p<0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p<0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the first 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was significantly larger (p<0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.52 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not significantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p<0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Drained peatlands aremajor sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet the effects of land management and hydrological extremes have been little-studied at spatial scales relevant to agricultural enterprises. We measured fluxes of CO2 using the eddy covariance (EC) technique at two adjacent dairy farms on a drained peatland in Aotearoa New Zealand with remaining peat depths 5.5-8 m. One site (SD) had shallow surface drains and mean water table depth (WTD) -657 mm, while the other site (BD) had deep field border drains and mean WTD -838 mm. Net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) was similar at the two sites when the soils were moist but diverged during late-summer drying, with site BD having 4.56 t C ha(-1) greater CO2 emission than site SD over the four-month dry period. Soil drying reduced gross primary production (GPP) at both sites, while ecosystem respiration (ER) was reduced at site SD but not at site BD. The low dry season respiration rates at site SD contributed to near-zero annual NEP, while higher respiration rates at site BD led to annual CO2 loss of -4.95 +/- 0.59 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Accounting for other imports and exports of carbon, annual net ecosystem carbon balances were -2.23 and -8.47 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) at sites SD and BD, respectively. It is likely that the contrasting dry season respiration rates resulted from differences in soil physical properties affecting soil moisture vertical redistribution and availability to plants and microbes rather than from the relatively small differences in WTD. These differences could be caused by soil physical disturbances during pasture renewal or paddock recontouring, or time since initial drainage. Therefore, improved soil management might provide practical mitigation against excessive CO2 emissions during dry conditions, including droughts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon, are extremely vulnerable to climate change. The effects of climate change are projected to lead to a vegetation shift from Sphagnum mosses to sedges and shrubs. Impacts on the present moss-dominated peat remain largely unknown. In this study, we used a multiproxy approach to investigate the influence of contrasting vascular plant types (sedges, shrubs) on peat chemistry and decomposition. Peat cores of 20 cm depth and plant material (Sphagnum spp., Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum) from two ombrotrophic peatlands in the Italian Alps with a mean annual temperature difference of 1.4 degrees C were analyzed. Peat cores were taken under adjacent shrub and sedge plants growing at the same height above the water table. We used carbon, nitrogen and their stable isotopes to assess general patterns in the degree of decomposition across sampling locations and depths. In addition, analytical pyrolysis was applied to disentangle effects of vascular plants (sedge, shrub) on chemical properties and decomposition of the moss-dominated peat.
   Pyrolysis data confirmed that Sphagnum moss dominated the present peat irrespective of depth. Nevertheless, vascular plants contributed to peat properties as revealed by, e.g., pyrolysis products of lignin. The degree of peat decomposition increased with depth as shown by, e.g., decreasing amounts of the pyrolysis product of sphagnum acid and increasing delta C-13 with depth. Multiple parameters also revealed a higher degree of decomposition of Sphagnum-dominated peat collected under sedges than under shrubs, particularly at the high temperature site. Surprisingly, temperature effects on peat decomposition were less pronounced than those of sedges. Our results imply that vascular plants affect the decomposition of the existing peat formed by Sphagnum, particularly at elevated temperature. These results suggest that changes in plant functional types may have a stronger impact on the soil carbon feedback in a warmer world than hitherto assumed.

AB We test the hypothesis that rich occurrences of diatoms observed at transitions between major peat units representing different vegetation communities in a peat sequence from subarctic northern Sweden reflect responses to acid deposition from the Samalas AD 1257 and Laki AD 1783/1784 eruptions. We observe sudden changes in the mire ecosystem and thereby in the trophic status and biogeochemical cycling of the peatland. Both the eruptions are known to have been associated with significant acid deposition events and climatic anomalies, as recorded in polar ice cores. To test the hypothesis, new chronological analyses and age modelling were applied to existing biogeochemical and biological records from the peat sequence. This approach yielded modelled age ranges of AD 1239-1284 (1s)/AD 1210-1303 (2s) (median: AD 1260) and AD 1674-1795 (1s)/AD 1665-1875 (2s) (median AD 1743), respectively, for the stratigraphic transitions. Hence, the modelled age ranges bracket the ages of the eruptions in question and the hypothesis could therefore not be rejected. Impacts of acid deposition from the eruptions are assumed to have caused instant acidification, vegetation damage, increased nutrient cycling and blooms of opportunistic epiphytic diatoms. In addition, cooling may have contributed to vegetation changes through permafrost inception, frost heave and thereby altered hydrological conditions. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil nematodes were studied in five alpine habitats (sedge mat, pasture, peat bog, moraine, and lichen heath) in the Austrian Alps (Obergural, Tyrol) from 2001 to 2002. A total of 75 genera within 49 families were found. The mean nematode population density ranged from 80 to 383 individuals 100 g(-1) soil and increased during the short alpine growing season. The most abundant feeding groups were bacterial feeders followed by plant-parasitic nematodes. The number of nematode taxa differed only slightly between habitats. Diversity indices (H' = 3.7-4.8 based on genera) and maturity indices (MI = 2.7-3.4) were generally high. Nematode community composition of the pasture and the peat bog differed markedly from the other three sites. Nematode data on genera and feeding types yielded a comparable similarity pattern for all sites but site discrimination was better at the genus level.

ID PRINCE-EDWARD ISLANDS; PLANTS; AREA
AB We assessed the impact of human trampling in three different habitats on Marion Island (46degrees50'S, 37degrees50'E). The habitats were (1) mires with wet, peaty soils and grass- and bryophyte-dominated vegetation; (2) slopes with relatively dry mineral soils, dominated by small ferns and dwarf shrub; and (3) feldmark on dry mineral soils with an open vegetation of cushion dicots and bryophytes. We Track width (25 to 800 cm) increased with soil moisture content. Trampling reduced vegetation height, total cover, and species richness in mires and feldmark and vegetation height and herb layer cover (but not bryophyte cover or species richness) in slopes. In mires, most species were negatively affected by trampling, but in slopes trampling increased the cover of 6 out of 9 significantly affected species. The total number of species in all trampled plots in mire and feldmark communities was similar to10% lower, but in slopes 28% higher, than in control plots. The impact of trampling differed between growth forms. Cushion dicot, shrub, and fern covers were reduced, whereas graminoid and pleurocarpous moss covers were unaffected or increased with trampling. Trampling reduced the cover of most bryophyte species, but it did increase the cover of some. In the slope habitat, destruction by trampling of the closed herb canopy allows increased light penetration and makes the habitat more favorable for small plants such as bryophytes. We attribute the differences in how the vegetation of different habitats responds to trampling to differences in the structure of the original vegetation as well as differences in soil characteristics, especially the soil's structural stability under pressure. examined existing walking tracks on the island.

AB The Russian Far East is characterized by widespread peat bogs with a sufficiently thick peat accumulation. A series of radiocarbon dates from the studied peat bogs (in Lower Amur) were obtained. Analysis of these dates shows that the total peat formation in this territory began in the Late Pleistocene-Holocene (11,830 +/- 820, TIG-157; 9975 +/- 120, SOAN-4025). The rates of peat accumulation and the humidity index were counted. In addition, the botanical composition and degree of peat decomposition were defined. These data allow to study in more detail climate fluctuation and the C-14 chronology of Holocene events in the region studied.

AB Comparisons between in situ CH4 concentration and potential factors controlling its net production were made in a temperate swamp. Seasonal measurements of water table level and depth profiles of pH, dissolved CN4, CO2, O-2, SO42-, NO3-, formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate were made at two adjacent sites 1.5 to 2 m apart. Dissolved CH4 was inversely correlated to O-2 and, in general, to NO3- and SO42-, potential inhibitors of methanogenesis. At low water table levels (August 1992), maximal CH4 (2 to 4 mu M) occurred below 30 cm, whereas at high water table levels (October 1992) or under flooded conditions (May 1993), CH4 maxima (4 to 55 mu M) occurred in the top 10 to 20 cm. Higher CH4 concentrations were likely supported by inputs of fresh organic matter from decaying leaf litter, as suggested by high acetate and propionate concentrations (25 to 100 mu M) in one of the sites in fall and spring. Measurements of potential CH4 production (and consumption) showed that the highest rates generally occurred in the top 10 cm of soil. Soil slurry incubations confirmed the importance of organic matter to CH4 production but also showed that competition for substrates by nonmethanogenic microorganisms could greatly attenuate its effect.

AB Reclamation of peat bogs for agriculture changes the physical and chemical characteristics of the peat matrix, for example, drainage and tillage accelerate decomposition, altering peat porosity, pore size distribution, and hydraulic properties. This study investigated changes in near-saturated hydraulic conductivity over time after drainage of peat soil for agricultural use by conducting tension infiltrometer measurements in a mire that has been gradually drained and reclaimed for agriculture during the past 80 years (with fields drained 2, 12, 40, and 80 years before the measurements). At pore water pressure closest to saturation (pressure head -1 cm), hydraulic conductivity in the newest field was approximately nine times larger than that in the oldest field, and a decreasing trend with field age was observed. A similar (but weaker) trend was observed with -3 cm pressure head (approximately four times larger in the newest field in comparison to the oldest), but at -6 cm head, there were no significant differences. These results indicate that peat degradation reduces the amount of millimetre-sized pores in particular. They also indicate that changes in peat macroporosity continue for several decades before a new steady state is reached.

AB To study vegetation feedbacks of nutrient addition on carbon sequestration capacity, we investigated vegetation and ecosystem CO2 exchange at Mer Bleue Bog, Canada in plots that had been fertilized with nitrogen (N) or with N plus phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for 7-12years. Gross photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and net CO2 exchange were measured weekly during May-September 2011 using climate-controlled chambers. A substrate-induced respiration technique was used to determine the functional ability of the microbial community. The highest N and NPK additions were associated with 40% less net CO2 uptake than the control. In the NPK additions, a diminished C sink potential was due to a 20-30% increase in ecosystem respiration, while gross photosynthesis rates did not change as greater vascular plant biomass compensated for the decrease in Sphagnum mosses. In the highest N-only treatment, small reductions in gross photosynthesis and no change in ecosystem respiration led to the reduced C sink. Substrate-induced microbial respiration was significantly higher in all levels of NPK additions compared with control. The temperature sensitivity of respiration in the plots was lower with increasing cumulative N load, suggesting more labile sources of respired CO2. The weaker C sink potential could be explained by changes in nutrient availability, higher woody:foliar ratio, moss loss, and enhanced decomposition. Stronger responses to NPK fertilization than to N-only fertilization for both shrub biomass production and decomposition suggest that the bog ecosystem is N-P/K colimited rather than N-limited. Negative effects of further N-only deposition were indicated by delayed spring CO2 uptake. In contrast to forests, increased wood formation and surface litter accumulation in bogs seem to reduce the C sink potential owing to the loss of peat-forming Sphagnum.

AB Mires in the Danubian Lowland (Northern part of the Pannonian Basin) are typically overgrown with common alder (Alnus glutinosa). Similar stands at this location are unfortunately very rare, what is caused by continuous human intervention in landscape and its natural pattern from Early Holocene. Peatland degradation near Puste Ulany village started in the mid - eighteenth century, what is supported by historical maps. In the previous century a huge peat extraction took place at this specific mire. Despite these anthropogenic changes, there are still some remnants of natural habitats present, mostly dependant on ground water level. Methodology includes historical map's analysis, digital terrain model and vegetation cover mapping. Actual map of biotopes was completed for the current state of the vegetation cover acquaintance. Historical map's analysis revealed changes and development in the vegetation cover as well as the further relevant landscape changes in the mire during drainage system building. The first artificial drainage channel was built in the second half of the eighteenth century. Subsequently, dense system of the drainage channels was built near Tovarniky settlement, continuing the drainage of this area for meadows, pastures and arable land acquisition. This wetland habitat was probably one of the largest mires in Slovakia during Holocene. Its area used to be markedly larger and its sedimentary basin presented much more important influence on landscape development. However, the historical sources revealed higher occurrence of common alder in the past, as well as typical xerothermic oak forest in this area. 27 biotopes were identified, from which 13 biotopes was purely human induced. Most of the area is currently abandoned for its own vegetation succession.

AB The experimental Sandhill Wetland is the first permanent reclamation of a composite tailings deposit, and annual water quality monitoring is of specific interest for evaluating and predicting long-term reclamation performance. Here, we present water chemistry monitoring data obtained from Sandhill Wetland (years 2009-2019) and compare results to twelve natural reference wetlands and to environmental quality guidelines for Alberta surface waters. By comparing water quality at Sandhill Wetland and natural sites to established guidelines, we can begin to document the natural background water quality of wetlands in the region and examine if guideline exceedances are seen in natural undisturbed environments, or appear only at active reclamation sites. At Sandhill Wetland the dominant ions in near-surface water were bicarbonate, sulfate, chloride, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Since the first growing season concentrations for these ions have increased annually, causing concurrent increases in electrical conductivity. In year 2019, water chemistry at Sandhill Wetland was most comparable to regional saline fens, systems that exhibit elevated electrical conductivity and high sodicity. Near-surface water at Sandhill Wetland exceeded water quality guidelines for three substances/properties (dissolved chloride, iron, and total alkalinity) in the most recent year of monitoring. The saline fen natural sites also exceeded water quality guidelines for the same chemical substances/properties, suggesting guideline exceedances are a norm for some natural wetland site types in the region. Of note, in each year of monitoring at Sandhill Wetland, dissolved organic compounds evaluated in sub- and near-surface water were below detection limits.

AB The diurnal patterns of twig xylem water potential, net photosynthesis rate, water use efficiency of photosynthesis, and stomatal and mesophyll conductance to CO2 in tamarack, black spruce and swamp birch growing in a natural peatland in central Alberta, Canada, were examined. The relationships of photosynthesis to other ecophysiological parameters were investigated. Data were collected on three days with different weather and soil moisture conditions in the 1988 growing season. Day 1 was clear and warm and the ground water table was 7 cm above the average peat surface. Day 2 was clear and hot. Day 3 was cloudy but warm. On day 2 and day 3, the water tables were in the normal range for that season. Major findings were: 1) Soil flooding depressed photosynthesis in tamarack and black spruce. 2) Swamp birch was better adapted to flooding than tamarack or black spruce. 3) The trees experienced water stress in the afternoons of the two days with lower water table. 4) Changes in photosynthesis of the three species were primarily affected by changes in mesophyll conductance (g(m)) and the response of photosynthesis to changes in g(m) was similar for all three species.

AB Isotopic signature is a powerful tool to discriminate methane (CH4) source types and constrain regional and global scale CH4 budgets. Peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood about the isotopic signature of CH4 due to the limited experimental conditions. In this study, three campaigns of diurnal air samples spacing 2-3 h were taken from an alpine peatland on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to investigate its source signal characteristics. Both CH4 concentration and its stable carbon isotope (delta C-13-CH4) were measured to derive the carbon isotopic signature of the CH4 source using the Keeling plot technique. Diurnal variation patterns in CH4 concentration and delta C-13-CH4 were observed during summertime, with depleted delta C-13-CH4 signals and high CH4 concentration appearing at nighttime. The delta C-13-CH4 signature during summer was calculated to be -71% +/- 1.3%, which falls within the range of other wetland studies and close to high-latitude peatlands. The boundary layer dynamic and CH4 source were supposed to influence the measured CH4 concentration and delta C-13-CH4. Further investigations of CH4 isotopic signals into the non-growing season are still needed to constrain the delta C-13-CH4 signature and its environmental controls in this region.

AB In a peat bog from Black Forest, Southern Germany, the rate of atmospheric Pb accumulation was quantified using a peat core dated by Pb-210 and C-14. The most recent Pb accumulation rate (2.5 mg m(-2) y(-1)) is similar to that obtained from a snowpack on the bog surface, which was sampled during the winter 2002 (1 to 4 mg m(-2) y(-1)). The Pb accumulation rates recorded by the peat during the last 25 yr are also in agreement with published values of direct atmospheric fluxes in Black Forest. These values are 50 to 200 times greater than the "natural" average background rate of atmospheric Pb accumulation (20 mu g m(-2) y(-1)) obtained using peat samples from the same bog dating from 3300 to 1300 cal. yr B.C. The isotopic composition of Pb was measured in both the modern and ancient peat samples as well as in the snow samples, and clearly shows that recent inputs are dominated by anthropogenic Pb. The chronology and isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb accumulation recorded by the peat from the Black Forest is similar to the chronologies reported earlier using peat cores from various peat bogs as well as herbarium samples of Sphagnum and point to a common Pb source to the region for the past 150 years. In contrast, Pb contamination occurring before 1850 in southwestern Germany, differs from the record published for Switzerland mainly due to the mining activity in Black Forest. Taken together, the results show that peat cores from ombrotrophic bogs can yield accurate records of atmospheric Pb deposition, provided that the cores are carefully collected, handled, prepared, and analysed using appropriate methods.

AB This study determines spatial patterns of plant species richness and diversity in three calcareous fens and quantifies individual species response and range/tolerance to hydrological, peat physical, and porewater nutrient gradients using nonlinear quantile regression. Species richness and diversity were highly variable across the sites, with no single species occupying more than 25% of the area surveyed. Variable hydrological regime was related to distance from the principal source area of water to the fens. Surface peat organic matter and calcium carbonate content ranged from 11 to 91% and 2 to 83%, respectively. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and potassium concentrations from the shallow porewater ranged from 0 to 4 mg l-1, whereas available phosphorus was < 100 mu g l-1. Species exhibited various response shapes to the environmental gradients, which produced segregated realized ranges. The duration of initial saturation of the peat from the start of the growing season and the peat organic matter content produced the greatest number of complete species responses and ranges. Aggregation of species across growth types based on environmental responses mirrored visually described communities, demonstrating the applicability of the method of analysis. The generation of species response curves for a suite of readily measured environmental variables can be a useful tool for assessing conceptual models of ecosystem functioning and wetland restoration/creation success.

AB Due to their high emission potential, the reporting of CO2 emissions from peatlands requires exact emission factors for different land use categories. Recently used emission factors are mainly based on CO2 flux measurements by chamber techniques or the micrometeorological eddy covariance (EC) method. However, evidence about the reliability and comparability of annual CO2 balances based on these methods is scarce. Therefore, manual chamber measurements of ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were conducted for two years (March 2012-April 2014) to model annual balances of two sites on fen soils with different land use intensity in northern Germany: an unutilized and rewetted grassland (UG) and an intensively utilized wet grassland (GW). Simultaneously, EC measurements of NEE were conducted on the sites. Two reasons for occasionally great deviations in NEE between the methods could be observed: (1) the accordance of both methods was most hampered during transition periods such as the beginning of the growing season and the onset of regrowth after a grassland defoliation due to different spatial scales of EC and chamber measurements and (2) R-ECO and gross primary production (GPP) partitioned from EC NEE measurements were systematically lower than those from the chamber-based model, which could be a result of the EC energy balance gap. Differences were more pronounced for the managed site GW as a result of more frequent regrowth periods. It is concluded that the EC and chamber method can show comparable results for the CO2 exchange of grasslands on fen soils when the limitations of both methods are known and considered for the reporting of emission factors. These limitations are due to energy balance closure and potentially biased footprints for EC and a restricted representativeness especially during early stages of plant development for the chamber method.

AB Many harvested northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) sites have not regenerated to cedar but have become dominated by other species such as balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and tag alder (Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Spreng.) A regenerating cedar fen near Escanaba, Mich., was used to study factors related to regeneration success and failure. Twelve plots (6.1 X 6.1 m) were established on the site to collect data on hydrology, microtopography, stand composition, and stem density. Abundance of cedar regeneration was positively correlated with percentage of hummocks. There were more cedar on microsites with drier conditions (numerous hummocks) while more shrubs and hardwoods were found on the wetter areas (fewer hummocks) of the fen. The shallow depth to groundwater and unsaturated soil thickness early in the growing season are suggested to be factors.

AB This study was undertaken to analyse major and trace elements and the nature of their accumulation in peat, with a particular emphasis on peat properties and the impact of local and regional pollution sources on the character of element accumulation in ombrotrophic bogs in Latvia. The element concentration values in peat from Latvia reflect the local processes that affect element concentrations in the peat mass, indicating accumulation of trace elements - apparently of anthropogenic origin (Pb, Cd, Co, Ni and others) - in the upper layers of the peat profiles. In addition, they indicate accumulation of several elements (for example, As, Cr and others) in deeper layers of bog, possibly due to the feeding pattern, depending on the saturation of the groundwater.

ID POROUS MEDIA; PERMEABILITY
AB Determination of the gas diffusion coefficient D-s of peat soils is essential to understand the mechanisms of soil gas transport in peatlands, which have been one of major potential sources of gaseous carbons. In the present study, we aimed at determining the D-s of peat soils for various values of the air-filled porosity a and we tested the validity of the Three-Porosity Model (Moldrup et al. 2004) and the Millington-Quirk model (1961) for predicting the relative gas diffusivity, the ratio of D-s to D-0 the gas diffusion coefficient in free air. Undisturbed peat soil cores were sampled from aerobic layers in the Bibai mire, Hokkaido, Japan. The MQ model reproduced the measured D-s/D-0 curves better than the TPM. The TPM, a predictive model for undisturbed mineral soils, overestimated the D-s/D-0 values for peat soils, implying that in the peat soils the pore pathways were more tortuous than those in the mineral soils. Since the changes in the D-s/D-0 ratios with the a values of a well-decomposed black peat soil tended to be more remarkable than those of other high-moor peat soils, the existence of a positive feedback mechanism was assumed, such that peat soil decomposition itself would increase the soil gas diffusivity and promote soil respiration.

DT Article
DE Bryophyte; Monitoring; Peatland; Sphagnum
AB Increasing gaseous emissions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) associated with oil sands development in northern Alberta (Canada) has led to changing regional wet and dry N and S deposition regimes. We assessed the potential for using bog plant/lichen tissue chemistry (N and S concentrations, C:N and C:S ratios, in 10 plant/lichen species) to monitor changing atmospheric N and S deposition through sampling at five bog sites, 3-6 times per growing season from 2009 to 2016. During this 8-year period, oil sands N emissions steadily increased, while S emissions steadily decreased. We examined the following: (1) whether each species showed changes in tissue chemistry with increasing distance from the Syncrude and Suncor upgrader stacks (the two largest point sources of N and S emissions); (2) whether tissue chemistry changed over the 8 year period in ways that were consistent with increasing N and decreasing S emissions from oil sands facilities; and (3) whether tissue chemistry was correlated with growing season wet deposition of NH4+-N, NO3--N, or SO42--S. Based on these criteria, the best biomonitors of a changing N deposition regime were Evernia mesomorpha, Sphagnum fuscum, and Vaccinium oxycoccos. The best biomonitors of a changing S deposition regime were Evernia mesomorpha, Cladonia mitis, Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum capillifolium, Vaccinium oxycoccos, and Picea mariana. Changing N and S deposition regimes in the oil sands region appear to be influencing N and S cycling in what once were pristine ombrotrophic bogs, to the extent that these bogs may effectively monitor future spatial and temporal patterns of deposition.

DT Article
ID JERSEY PINE BARRENS; EVERGLADES; NUTRIENTS
AB This study examined the effects of agricultural runoff on the vegetation structure of Franklin Bog, a priority conservation area located in a rapidly developing region of northwestern Vermont. Forested and agricultural runoff from the mixed land use watershed created differential vegetation patterns in the wetland, including weedy species introductions. Concentrations of nitro-en and phosphorus were measured in the stream runoff from four forested subwatersheds and two agricultural subwatersheds. Nutrient concentrations were significantly higher for agricultural vs. forested runoff for all measured parameters. Nitrate-and total phosphorus concentrations in agricultural runoff ranged from 0.62 to 1.35 mg L-1 and 0.07 to 0.37 mg L-1, respectively Forested runoff values were less than 0.37 mg L-1 nitrate and 0.09 mg L-1 total phosphorus. Significantly higher proportions of weedy species occurred at impacted vs. reference sites (46 +/- 5%, vs. 23 +/- 4%). Furthermore, significantly higher total percent vegetated cover occurred at impacted vs. reference sites (116 +/- 11% vs. 77 +/- 9%) suggesting nutrient induced plant growth. Of the nine frequently occurring species categorized as bog species' only one was found within impacted sites while all nine were found at the reference sites. This suggests that the wetland's distinctive native flora is being replaced by widespread, vigorous species enhanced by agricultural nonpoint pollution in the watershed of Franklin Bog. Protection of wetlands requires attention to conservation measures throughout the entire watershed.

AB Permafrost peatlands are biogeochemical hot spots in the Arctic as they store vast amounts of carbon. Permafrost thaw could release part of these long-term immobile carbon stocks as the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but how much, at which time-span and as which gaseous carbon species is still highly uncertain. Here we assess the effect of permafrost thaw on GHG dynamics under different moisture and vegetation scenarios in a permafrost peatland. A novel experimental approach using intact plant-soil systems (mesocosms) allowed us to simulate permafrost thaw under near-natural conditions. We monitored GHG flux dynamics via high-resolution flow-through gas measurements, combined with detailed monitoring of soil GHG concentration dynamics, yielding insights into GHG production and consumption potential of individual soil layers. Thawing the upper 10-15 cm of permafrost under dry conditions increased CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (without vegetation: 0.74 +/- 0.49 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1); with vegetation: 1.20 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.32 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1), mean +/- SD, pre- and post-thaw, respectively). Radiocarbon dating (C-14) of respired CO2, supported by an independent curve-fitting approach, showed a clear contribution (9%-27%) of old carbon to this enhanced post-thaw CO2 flux. Elevated concentrations of CO2, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon at depth indicated not just pulse emissions during the thawing process, but sustained decomposition and GHG production from thawed permafrost. Oxidation of CH4 in the peat column, however, prevented CH4 release to the atmosphere. Importantly, we show here that, under dry conditions, peatlands strengthen the permafrost-carbon feedback by adding to the atmospheric CO2 burden post-thaw. However, as long as the water table remains low, our results reveal a strong CH4 sink capacity in these types of Arctic ecosystems pre- and post-thaw, with the potential to compensate part of the permafrost CO2 losses over longer timescales.

AB Closely spaced sequences of accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) C-14 dates of peat deposits display century-scale wiggles which can be fitted to the radiocarbon calibration curve. By wiggle-matching such sequences, high-precision calendar age chronologies can be generated which show that changes in mire surface wetness during the Bronze Age/Iron Age transition (c. 850 cal. BC) and the 'Little Ice Age' (Wolf, Sporer, Maunder and Dalton Minima) occurred during periods of suddenly increasing atmospheric concentration of C-14. Replicate evidence from peat-based proxy climate indicators in northwest Europe suggest these changes in climate may have been driven by temporary declines of solar activity. Carbon-accumulation rates of two raised peat bogs in the UK and Denmark record low values during the 'Little Ice Age' which reflects reduced primary productivity of the peat-forming vegetation during these periods of climatic deterioration.

AB Sphagnum moss is the major peat-forming vegetation component in boreal peatlands. The relationship between Sphagnum productivity and moss moisture content has been documented; however, the link between moss moisture content and conditions in the underlying peat column is less clear. We conducted a pilot study in which we monitored volumetric moisture content with depth and gravimetric water content of Sphagnum capitula and CO2 exchange for two peat monoliths with intact moss layer dominated by Sphagnum fuscum and S. magellanicum. Measurements were made under drying conditions and rewetting from below and following simulated precipitation events. Capitulum moisture content was related to water table position but varied between species. Both capitulum moisture content and water table position could be used to explain net CO2 exchange and respiration during drying and rewetting from below, although hysteresis was apparent where respiration was lower on rewetting than drying for the same water table position. Precipitation complicated these relationships because small events (<5 mm) rewetted the upper few centimeters of moss resulting in a change in capitulum moisture content equivalent to a rise in water table position of similar to 20 cm. This change in capitulum moisture content resulted in substantial shifts in both photosynthesis and respiration rates without affecting water table position or subsurface volumetric water contents as shallow as 5 cm below the surface. While these small events will be difficult to measure in the field, this study suggests they are essential to effectively track or model Sphagnum productivity because they may contribute significantly to seasonal carbon balance.

AB The population density of bacteria in peat deposits along the landscape profile of the Vasyugan Marsh has been found to be as high as tens of millions of CFU/g peat. The abundance and diversity of bacteria increased with depth within the peat deposit, correlating with an increasing level of peat degradation. Variations in these parameters with depth and season were greater in peat deposits located in transaccumulative and transitional positions than in the sedge-sphagnum bogs located at the eluvial region of the profile. In the upper 1-m-thick layer of the peat deposits studied, bacilli, represented by five species, dominated, whereas, in the deeper layers, spirilla and myxobacteria prevailed. These bacteria are major degraders of plant polymers. Unlike the bacteria communities found in the peat deposits of European Russia, the dominant taxa in the studied peat deposits of western Siberia are represented by bacteria resistant to extreme conditions.

AB The vegetation communities in the Arctic environment are very sensitive to even minor climatic variations and therefore the estimation of surface energy fluxes from high-latitude vegetated areas is an important subject to be pursued. This study was carried out in July-August and used micrometeorological data, spectral reflectance signatures, and vegetation biomass to establish the relation between the soil heat flux/net radiation (G/Rn) ratio and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs). Continuous measurements of soil temperature and soil heat flux were used to calculate the surface ground heat flux by use of conventional methods, and the relation to surface temperature was investigated. Twenty-seven locations were established, and six samples per location, including the measurement of the surface temperature and net radiation to establish the G/Rn ratio and simultaneous spectral reflectance signatures and wet biomass estimates, were registered. To obtain regional reliability, the locations were chosen in order to represent the different Arctic vegetation communities in the study area; ranging from dry tundra vegetation communities (fell fields and dry dwarf scrubs) to moist/wet tundra vegetation communities (snowbeds, grasslands and fens). Spectral vegetation indices, including the simple ratio vegetation index (RVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were calculated. A comparison of SVIs to biomass proved that RVI gave the best linear expression, and NDVI the best exponential expression. A comparison of SVIs and the surface energy flux ratio G/Rn proved that NDVI gave the best linear expression. SPOT HRV images from July 1989 and 1992 were used to map NDVI and G/Rn at a regional scale.

ID NORTHERN PEATLANDS; EBULLITION; FLUX; FLOW
AB We performed surface and borehole ground penetrating radar (GPR) tests, together with moisture probe measurements and direct gas sampling to detect areas of biogenic gas accumulation in a northern peatland. The main findings are: (1) shadow zones (signal scattering) observed in surface GPR correlate with areas of elevated CH4 and CO2 concentration; (2) high velocities in zero offset profiles and lower water content inferred from moisture probes correlate with surface GPR shadow zones; (3) zero offset profiles depict depth variable gas accumulation from 0-10% by volume; (4) strong reflectors may represent confining layers restricting upward gas migration. Our results have implications for defining the spatial distribution, volume and movement of biogenic gas in peatlands at multiple scales.

AB A laboratory investigation was used to determine whether biogenic gas bubbles accumulate and block water-conducting pores below the water table in poorly decomposed Sphagnum peat. We found that biogenic gas bubbles did accumulate under realistic incubation temperatures. At the end of incubations at 10.5 degreesC, volumetric water contents in two peat samples decreased to between 0.8 and 0.85 (porosity of the samples ranged from 0.96 to 0.97), indicating that the peat was considerably undersaturated with respect to water. Methane was found to be an important constituent of the gas bubbles. The presence of gas bubbles appeared to have a major effect on hydraulic conductivity (K). In control incubations, prior to which the peat had been irradiated and dosed with a biocide, biogenic gas bubbles did not accumulate, and K was 5-8 times higher than at the end of the microbially active incubations. Our results suggest that biogenic gas bubbles have a potentially significant effect on seepage in peat soils.

ID BACTERIAL PHYLUM; CLASSIS NOV; GEN. NOV.; MICROORGANISMS; SOIL; BOG
AB The Gahai Lake wetland natural conservation area in northwestern China includes peatland that has been accumulating over hundreds of years and is seldom disturbed by industry. Bacteria and archaea in peat soil, which is a reservoir for carbon and water, may influence its ecological function. The objective of this study was to obtain a clearer understanding of peat microbial ecology and its relationship to the environmental conditions of this area. Hence, the microbial community of the peatland ecosystem was investigated by sequencing bacterial and archaeal DNA extracted from samples collected at different peat depths. Results showed that in all samples the dominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria (relative abundance 0.39 +/- 0.12) and Chloroflexi (0.16 +/- 0.09), while the dominant archaeal phyla were Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG) (0.62 +/- 0.21) and Euryarchaeota (0.27 +/- 0.16). The diversity and microbial community structure at deeper depths (90 and 120cm below the peat surface) significantly differ from that at shallower depths (10, 30 and 50cm deep). In contrast to the shallow layers, the deeper layers became more abundant in the bacterial phyla Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Chlorobi, TA06, Caldiserica and Spirochaetae; and in the archaeal phyla MCG and Miscellaneous Euryarchaeotic Group (MEG). This study revealed a significant shift in microbial community in peat between 50cm and 90cm deep, as probably influenced by the oxygen supply at different depths. Furthermore, new insights into the microbial taxa were obtained, thus providing a baseline for future studies of this peat ecosystem.

AB Peat bogs are valuable archives of environmental change, including climate history, landscape evolution, and atmospheric deposition of trace elements, fallout radionuclides, and organic contaminants. Maintaining the fidelity of peat samples during collection and handling can be challenging, given that bogs consist mainly of fossil plant materials that typically have a very low density and are easily compressed. The surface layers of bogs, which are dominated by living plants and poorly decomposed fibrous peats, are especially problematic. To extract peat monoliths, we use a Belarus corer for deep layers and a Wardenaar device for surface layers. Both corers are constructed using titanium alloys to improve strength, reduce weight, and minimize the risk of contamination by the trace metals of environmental relevance. In this review, we include detailed drawings of the Belarus corer and photographs of the modifications to the Wardenaar corer. Modifications to the motorized Noernberg corer for frozen peat are described, and a complete set of drawings provided. A summary is given of simple procedures to minimize the risk of metal contamination in the laboratory from slicing and subsampling the peat cores and milling the dried samples.

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

AB Interactions between tephra deposits from volcanic eruptions and peatland carbon (C) dynamics are poorly understood despite the significant extent of peatlands influenced by tephra worldwide. Tephra falls can affect peat accumulation within a radius of at least 1,000 km. In Iceland, volcanic activity is amongst the highest in the world and it might even increase due to pressure release on subglacial volcanoes. A potent combination of sparse vegetation, low cohesion of Andosols, and frequent strong winds, facilitates the regular input of mineral aeolian material from eroded areas into peatlands in Iceland, in addition to tephra deposits. We present results of a study on the impact of a major tephra deposit, the Hekla 4 tephra, on C dynamics in Icelandic peatlands. We investigated three sites at differing distances from the active volcanic zones and major erosion areas in the interior of the country. A combination of variables was applied, including laboratory C mineralization at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C and C structure obtained by solid-state(13)C NMR spectroscopy. Tephra deposits seem to affect C dynamics. Differences in C mineralization can only be partially explained by C structure. The C mineralization from soils with conspicuously similar C structure differs by a factor of up to 2.7. Temperature sensitivity of decomposition after the tephra deposition increases by a factor of up to 2.2. Changes in inorganic matter and the ratio of soil organic matter to soil organic carbon by a factor of up to 1.3 and 1.4, respectively, were also observed.

AB The object of research is the Holocene massive ice veins on the Eastern coast of the Daurkin Peninsula, the easternmost part of the Chukotka. Peat bogs with ice veins occur on the surface of marine terraces (near Uelen and Lorino settlements) and on flood plain of the Koolen Lake; the thickness of peat varies from 0.7 to 2.5 m. Radio-carbon dating of the peat enclosing the investigated ice veins near Uelen and Lorino indicated that the beginning of peat accumulation began at the end of Late Pleistocene - early Holocene, about 11 cal ka BR On the flood plain of the Koolen Lake peat bogs began to accumulate in the middle Holocene, i.e. around 6 cal ka BR At the initial stage of peat bogs formation the rate of peat accumulation was high and could reach 1 cm/10 years. Ice veins occur at a depth of 0.5-1 m, and their lower parts are located in the underlying peat sandy loams and loams. In the upper levels of the peat bogs, narrow present-day ice veins are found, which are sometimes embedded in the upper parts of Holocene veins. A clear sign of syngenetic growth of veins is the upward bending of the layers of the host peat at the lateral contacts with the veins. The main source of water for the formation of ice veins is snow, as evidenced by the ratio of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen and the values of deuterium excesses in the ice. A slight admixture of saline water (probably from a seasonally thawed layer) was noted in the veins near the Lorino settlement. Reconstructions of winter air paleotemperatures, performed on the basis of data of isotope-oxygen composition of ice from the veins, did show that at the period between 11 and 6 cal Ka BR the mean winter air temperature on the Daurkin Peninsula was by 2-5 degrees C lower than today, but the air temperature of the coldest month (January or February) was still lower (by 4-8 degrees C) than today. The noticeable trend of increase of stable isotope values in the ice veins from early Holocene to the present time is indicative of a steady positive trend of mean winter air temperatures in the Holocene.

AB In the Central Coast region of the Sydney Basin, the Vales Point, Wallarah and Great Northern Coals coalesce and comprise the topmost unit of the Late Permian Newcastle Coal Measures. These coals reach a combined thickness of 8 in and, in places, are separated by 50-m-thick conglomeratic, incised valley fills at several stratigraphic horizons. Early Triassic, terrestrial sedimentary rocks unconformably onlap onto the eroded coal. Although the coalesced coals are remarkably free of siliciclastic interbeds, coal plies (subsections) have been correlated for more than 20 kin using brightness profiles (lithotypes) and gamma-ray logs. Plies average about 0.5 in thick and indicate that the original peat was deposited episodically. The concept that coal originated from low-lying peat mires on flood basins adjacent to, and coeval with, active river systems is not supported here. Instead, correlations show that gravel was deposited at a time that equates to the hiatus between coal plies. Gravel-filled incised valleys were eroded into peat mires, removing all peat in the deepest places. Where the coals are coalesced, the only evidence for adjacent, thick conglomerate is a gamma-ray spike and a thin clay pellet layer of altered volcanogenic fragments. It is proposed that the coal is composed of individual plies originating from raised peat mires that grew during cyclical base-level rises. Afterwards, the mires became dormant during base-level falls, creating a hiatal surface above the degrading peat. During base-level fall, the increasing gradient initiated erosion of an incised valley into the dormant peat mire. Subsequently, as base level rose again, fluvial gravel aggraded in the valley. When the water table rose to the top of the incised valley, the flanking dormant peat mire was reactivated, initiating the accumulation of another ply above the hiatal surface. As peat grew and accumulated in raised mires, the sediment-filled incised valley may have resembled a muddy, estuarine body of water, no longer capable of transporting the coarse elastic bed load it did at times of lower base level. Repetition of base-level rise and fall is considered the main controlling factor in producing vertically stacked coal plies separated by hiatal and erosional surfaces, split in places, by thick conglomerate.

AB A large number of studies on trace metals and metalloids (TMs) accumulations in peatlands have been reported in Europe and North America. Comparatively little information is available on peat chronological records of atmospheric TMs flux in China. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine the concentrations and accumulation rates (ARs) of TMs in Motianling peatland from Great Hinggan Mountain, northeast China, and to assess these in relation to establish a historical profile of atmospheric metal emissions from anthropogenic sources. To meet these aims we analyzed 14 TMs (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Sb, Tl, and Zn) and Pb isotopes (Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208) using ICP-AES and ICP-MS, respectively, in three peat sections dated by Pb-210 and Cs-137 techniques (approximately spanning the last 200 years). There is a general agreement in the elemental concentration profiles which suggests that all investigated elements were conserved in the Motianling bog. Three principal components were discriminated by principal component analysis (PCA) based on Eigen-values >1 and explaining 85% of the total variance of element concentrations: the first component representing Ba, Co, Cr, Mo, Ni, Sr and Tl reflected the lithogenic source; the second component covering As, Cu and Sb, and Cd is associated with an anthropogenic source from ore mining and processing; the third component (Pb isotope, Pb and Zn) is affected by anthropogenic Pb pollution from industrial manufacturing and fossil-fuel combustion. The pre-industrial background of typical pollution elements was estimated as the average concentrations of TMs in peat samples prior to 1830 AD and with a Pb-207/Pb-206 ratio close to 1.9. ARs and enrichment factors (EFs) of TMs suggested enhanced metal concentrations near the surface of the peatland (in peat layers dated from the 1980s) linked to an increasing trend since the 2000s. This pollution pattern is also fingerprinted by the Pb isotopic composition, even after the ban of leaded gasoline use in China. Emissions from coal and leaded gasoline combustions in northern China are regarded as one of the major sources of anthropogenic Pb input in this region; meanwhile, the long-distance transportation of Pb-bearing aerosols from Mongolia should be also taken into consideration. The reconstructed history of TMs' pollution over the past ca. 200 years is in agreement with the industrial development in China and clearly illustrates the influence of human activities on local rural environments. This study shows the utility of taking multi-cores to show the heterogeneity in peat accumulation and applying PCA, EF and Pb isotope methods in multi-proxies analyses for establishing a high resolution geochemical metal record from peatland.

AB Ecosystem restoration by rewetting of degraded fens led to the new formation of large-scale shallow lakes in the catchment of the River Peene in NE Germany. We analyzed the biomass and the nutrient stock of the submersed (Ceratophyllum demersum) and the floating macrophytes (Lemna minor and Spirodela polyrhiza) in order to assess their influence on temporal nutrient storage in water bodies compared to other freshwater systems. Ceratophyllum demersum displayed a significantly higher biomass production (0.86-1.19 t DM = dry matter ha(-1)) than the Lemnaceae (0.64-0.71 t DM ha(-1)). The nutrient stock of submersed macrophytes ranged between 28-44 kg N ha(-1) and 8-12 kg P ha(-1) and that of floating macrophytes between 14-19 kg N ha(-1) and 4-5 kg P ha(-1) which is in the range of waste water treatment plants. We found the N and P stock in the biomass of aquatic macrophytes being 20-900 times and up to eight times higher compared to the nutrient amount of the open water body in the shallow lakes of rewetted fens (average depth: 0.5 m). Thereafter, submersed and floating macrophytes accumulate substantial amounts of dissolved nutrients released from highly decomposed surface peat layers, moderating the nutrient load of the shallow lakes during the growing season from April to October. In addition, the risk of nutrient loss to adjacent surface waters becomes reduced during this period. The removal of submersed macrophytes in rewetted fens to accelerate the restoration of the low nutrient status is discussed.

AB The use of nutrient concentrations in plant biomass as easily measured indicators of nutrient availability and limitation has been the subject of a controversial debate. In particular, it has been questioned whether nutrient concentrations are mainly species' traits or mainly determined by nutrient availability, and whether plant species have similar or different relative nutrient requirements. This review examines how nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and the N:P ratio in wetland plants vary among species and sites, and how they are related to nutrient availability and limitation. We analyse data from field studies in European non-forested wetlands, from fertilisation experiments in these communities and from growth experiments with wetland plants. Overall, the P concentration was more variable than the N concentration, while variation in NT ratios was intermediate. Field data showed that the N concentration varies more among species than among sites, whereas the N:P ratio varies more among sites than among species, and the P concentration varies similarly among both. Similar patterns of variation were found in fertilisation experiments and in growth experiments under controlled nutrient supply. Nutrient concentrations and N:P ratios in the vegetation were poorly correlated with various measures of nutrient availability in soil, but they clearly responded to fertilisation in the field and to nutrient supply in growth experiments. In these experiments, biomass N:P ratios ranged from 3 to 40 and primarily reflected the relative avallabilities of N and P, although NT ratios of plants grown at the same nutrient supply could vary three-fold among species. The effects of fertilisation with N or P on the biomass production of wetland vegetation were well related to the N:P ratios of the vegetation in unfertilised plots, but not to N or P concentrations, which supports the idea that NT ratios, rather than N or P concentrations, indicate the type of nutrient limitation. However, other limiting or stressing factors may influence N:P ratios, and the responses of individual plant species to fertilisation cannot be predicted from their N:P ratios. Therefore, NT ratios should only be used to assess which nutrient limits the biomass production at the vegetation level and only when factors other than N or P are unlikely to be limiting.

AB The main objective of the present study was to attempt to assign different vegetation types in South Sweden to the Braun-Blanquet system of syntaxa. The alliance was chosen as the most appropriate phytosociological unit for this purpose. Coniferous forests represent the zonal vegetation in large parts of South Sweden: spruce forests on mesic to moist sites and pine forests on dry, often strongly oligotrophic sites can be assigned to the Piceion excelsae and Dicrano-Pinion respectively. In addition, various types of atonal vegetation (e.g., mires, springs, swamps and salt-marshes) subjected to some form of extreme environmental factor can be placed in alliances described from Central Europe. In contrast, some southern vegetation types in Sweden are difficult to assign, partly due to a lack of character species, as in the case of deciduous hardwood forests. In other cases, species of southern syntaxa are still frequent, for example in dry basiphilous grasslands and sun-exposed forest edges, but the syntaxonomical difficulties arise from an intermixture of diagnostic species of complementary alliances. This might be explained by the floristic and climatic conditions in South Sweden which deviate considerably from those in e.g. Germany, a feature supported by the communities' indicator figures for temperature and continentality. This refers particularly to the combination of rather low average temperatures and, except in the west, a strong thermal or hygric continentality.

AB While the location and identification of archaeological features from vegetative responses on "dry-sites" is well understood in a British context, its application to wet sites is less well explored. Following the recovery of Glasson Moss, Cumbria, from a major fire in 1976, and a programme of hydrological restoration, a pattern of circular and linear features was observed during a field survey in the mid-1990s. Assessment of the archaeological significance of these features was undertaken in 1996 and 1997 using aerial photography, fieldwork and historical research. The results suggest that during the Early Mediaeval period, natural pools within the moss were used for hemp retting. It appears that water levels within the pools were controlled by the construction of narrow ditches with possible simple sluice systems. One pool was examined in detail; it was used for retting from c.7th century AD until it dried out during the late 12th to mid-13th centuries. Disruption to the mire hydrology, possibly combined with trampling activity around the pool and ditch, appears to have instigated vegetation succession, which resulted ultimately in the colonization of the edges of both pool and ditch by swathes of Calluna vulgaris (heather). The time scale involved in these changes is unknown, although similar responses were noted as beginning to occur at the site of nearby tithe apportionment boundaries (narrow ditches) dating from 1816. This process of vegetation change is examined. Copyright 2001 Academic Press

AB Recent high-latitude warming is increasing the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw, which is amplified by local disturbances such as fire. However, the long-term ecological effects and carbon dynamics are not well understood. Here we present a 2200-year record of pollen, plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, and apparent carbon (C) accumulation rates from two peat cores in a collapse-scar bog (thermokarst) near Fairbanks, Alaska. A black spruce ecosystem with low apparent C accumulation rates existed on the site during the first similar to 1500 years of the record. We identify two thaw events, which are linked to local fires. Permafrost aggraded rapidly following the first thaw, which we attribute to local vegetation feedbacks and a cooler climate. The second thaw event at 525 cal y BP is preceded by a stand-replacing fire, as evidenced by a drastic decline in Picea and an initial increase in Epilobium, Salix, and ericaceous shrubs, followed by a sustained increase in Populus. Locally, the forest does not recover for more than 100 years, and the site has remained permafrost-free for the last 500 years. Following thaw, average apparent C accumulation rates (60 to > 100 g C m(-2) y(-1)) are 5-6 times higher than average boreal C accumulation rates, indicating that peat C accumulation rates can remain substantially elevated for much more than a century following thaw. The low apparent C accumulation for the formerly forested, permafrost peat (< 5 g C m(-2) y(-1)) may suggest that C accumulation increases substantially following thaw, but it remains unknown whether deep peat C loss occurred immediately following thaw. Well-preserved Sphagnum peat dominates during this period of rapid accumulation, except for an interval from similar to 400 to 275 cal y BP which alternates between Sphagnum and vascular plant-dominated peat and wetter, minerotrophic conditions. A decline in Picea pollen during this interval and again similar to 100 cal y BP suggests a decrease in suitable substrate for tree growth likely attributable to thermokarst expansion on the collapse-scar margin. These findings suggest that the combined effects of fire and thermokarst will result in a long-term reduction of spruce ecosystems in interior Alaska.

AB Extreme climate events are observed and predicted to increase in frequency and duration in high-latitudeecosystems as a result of global climate change. This includes extreme precipitation events, which maydirectly impact on belowground food webs and ecosystem functioning by their physical impacts and byaltering local soil moisture conditions.
   We assessed responses of the Collembola community in a northern Sphagnum fuscum-dominatedombrotrophic peatland to three years of experimentally increased occurrence of extreme precipitationevents. Annual summer precipitation was doubled (an increase of 200 mm) by 16 simulated extremerain events within the three months growing season, where on each occasion 12.5 mm of rain was addedwithin a few minutes. Despite this high frequency and intensity of the rain events, no shifts in Collemboladensity, relative species abundances and community weighted means of three relevant traits (moisturepreference, vertical distribution and body size) were observed. This strongly suggests that the peatlandCollembola community is unaffected by the physical impacts of extreme precipitation and the short-termvariability in moisture conditions. The lack of response is most likely reinforced by the fact that extremeprecipitation events do not seem to alter longer-term soil moisture conditions in the peat layers inhabitedby soil fauna.
   This study adds evidence to the observation that the biotic components of northern ombrotrophicpeatlands are hardly responsive to an increase in extreme summer precipitation events. Given the importance of these ecosystems for the global C balance, these findings significantly contribute to the currentknowledge of the ecological impact of future climate scenarios.

AB Permafrost thaw in continental lowlands produces large number of thermokarst (thaw) lakes, which act as a major regulator of carbon (C) storage in sediments and C emission in the atmosphere. Here we studied thaw lakes of the NE European permafrost peatlands - shallow water bodies located within frozen peat bogs and receiving the majority of their water input from lateral (surface) runoff. We also conducted mesocosm experiments via interacting lake waters with frozen peat and dominant ground vegetation - lichen and moss. There was a systematic decrease in concentrations of dissolved C, CO2, nutrients and metals with an increase in lake size, corresponding to temporal evolution of the water body and thermokarst development. We hypothesized that ground vegetation and frozen peat provide the majority of C, nutrients and inorganic solutes in the water column of these lakes, and that microbial processing of terrestrial organic matter controls the pattern of CO(2 )and nutrient concentrations in thermokarst lakes. Substrate mass-normalized C, nutrient (N, P. K), major and trace metal release was maximal in moss mesocosms. After first 16 h of reaction, the pCO(2) increased ten-fold in mesocosms with moss and lichen; this increase was much less pronounced in experiments with permafrost peat. Overall, moss and lichen were the dominant factors controlling the enrichment of the lake water in organic C. nutrients, and trace metals and rising the CO2 concentration. The global significance of obtained results is that the changes in ground vegetation, rather than mere frozen peat thawing, may exert the primary control on C, major and trace element balance in aquatic ecosystems of tundra peatlands under climate warming scenario.

AB The present paper investigates rank and composition of coal as well as depositional and hydrogeological settings persisting during the stage of peat accumulation and evaluates taphonomy and conditions for the in-situ preservation of outstanding fossilized stump and trunks, using coal petrological and xylotomical analyses. The obtained results are further interpreted and compared with existing literature records. Lignite samples and fossil wood specimens were collected from the 2nd MPH (2nd Miocene Seam Horizon) or its equivalent present at Meuro, Piskowitz, and Welzow-Siid open-cast mines located in Lusatia, Germany. The examined lignite samples indicate low rank coals at lignite or subbituminous rank stage and are characterised by slight dominance of attrinite over textinite, ulminite, suberinite, cutinite porigelinite, resinite, and corpohuminite macerals. Waterlogged conditions prevailing in the mire are associated with peat accumulation under anoxic conditions accompanied by low decomposition rates. The determined facies indicators suggest a moderate to high as well as low gelification of the organic matter for the Meuro and Piskowitz open-cast mines, respectively. In Meuro open-cast mine, the prevalence of herbaceous plant in a mire or a bacterial/fungal degradation of woody plant tissues can be envisaged, whereas in the Piskowitz open-cast mine, it is suggested that peat formed in a wet forest mire environment with a limited oxygen supply and a relatively low bacterial/fungal degradation. The studied fossil wood specimens revealed the presence of Quasisequoioxylon piskowitzense preserved as an in-situ fossilized stump, as well as Taxodioxylon ctyptomerioides and Sciadopityoxylon wettsteinii species preserved as fossilized trunks. The examined species belong to the families of Sciadopityaceae and Cupressaceae Li sensu lato. The taphonomy of the in-situ fossilized stump and trunks can be explained by nutrient-, and oxygen-poor oligotrophic mires distinguished as raised bogs and suggesting generally anoxic conditions during Middle to late Miocene Climate transition.

AB An ecological analysis of wetlands in the high mountain jalca above 3700 m elevation in the Andes near Cajamarca. Peru, indicated that most wetlands are groundwater-supported peat-accumulating fens. The floristic composition of fen communities was controlled largely by groundwater chemistry, which was highly variable and influenced by watershed bedrock composition. Watersheds with highly mineralized rock discharged water as acidic as pH 3.7, which was high in CaSO4, while watersheds with limestone, marble, and skarn produced groundwater as basic as pH 8.2 and high in CaHCO3. Of the 125 plots sampled in 36 wetland complexes, >50% of plots had at least 3 m of peat, and 21 plots had peat thicker than 7 m. Most soil horizons analyzed had 18 to 35% organic carbon, indicating high C storage. A total of 102 vascular plants, 69 bryophytes, and 10 lichens were identified. Study plots were classified using TWINSPAN into 20 plant communities, which were grouped into four broad categories by dominant life form: (1) cushion plant communities, (2) sedge- and rush-dominated communities, (3) bryophyte and lichen communities, and (4) tussock grass communities. Direct gradient analysis using canonical correspondence analysis indicated that Axis I was largely a water chemistry gradient, while Axis 2 was a complex hydrology and peat thickness gradient. Bryophytes and lichens were more strongly separated in the ordination space than vascular plants and were better indicators of specific environmental characteristics.

AB The influence of past depositional environments on the chemistry of sub-fossil Juncus seed coats (testa) from the top I m (corresponding to ca. 900 years of peat accumulation) of a peat bog in the Faroe Islands was examined. The chemistry of the testa of fresh Juncus seeds were characterised using thermally assisted pyrolysis and methylation (THM) in the presence of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and 'type' compounds were identified, representative of the major chemical groups in the testa (cellulose-related sugars, lignin-related phenolics, fatty acids). The abundance of the 'type' compounds in the products from sub-fossil testae (the internal tissues of the seeds do not survive beyond the very early stages of decomposition) was then quantified at contiguous 1 cm depth intervals. Major losses of C-18 unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters and sugars were associated with the fresh to sub-fossil transition at ca. 7 cm depth. The preservation of the phenolic ferulic acid in the seed testa appears to be favoured by the input of small basaltic particles from the nearby stream channel. The mechanism by which inwash of inorganic material may be responsible for the improved chemical preservation of the Juncus seed testa is, however, unclear. The sugars were easily metabolised by microorganisms under aerobic conditions of low water table and preserved under anoxic conditions with high water table, suggesting that a drier mire surface may result in the more efficient depletion of polysaccharides and cellulose during the initial stage of decomposition in the acrotelm.

AB Peatlands are recognized as important carbon stores; despite this, many have been drained for agricultural improvement. Drainage has been shown to lower water tables and alter vegetation composition, modifying primary productivity and decomposition, potentially initiating peat loss. To quantify CO2 fluxes across whole landscapes, it is vital to understand how vegetation composition and CO2 fluxes vary spatially in response to the pattern of drainage features. However, Molinia caerulea-dominated peatlands are poorly understood despite their widespread extent.
   Photosynthesis (P-G600) and ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) were modelled (12 degrees C, 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), greenness excess index of 60) using empirically derived parameters based on closed-chamber measurements collected over a growing season. Partitioned below-ground fluxes were also collected. Plots were arranged 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 the distance between adjacent ditches in two catchments located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   Water table depths were deepest closest to the ditch and non-significantly (p = 0.197) shallower further away. Non-Molinia species coverage and the Simpson diversity index significantly decreased with water table depth (p < 0.024) and increased non-significantly (p < 0.083) away from the ditch. No CO2 fluxes showed significant spatial distribution in response to drainage ditches, arguably due to insignificant spatial distribution of water tables and vegetation composition. Whilst R-Eco showed no significant spatial variation, P-G600 varied significantly between sites (p = 0.012), thereby controlling the spatial distribution of net ecosystem exchange between sites. As P-G600 significantly co-varied with water table depths (p = 0.034), determining the spatial distribution of water table depths may enable CO2 fluxes to be estimated across M. caerulea-dominated landscapes.

AB We examine variability in carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange as a function of meteorological conditions using static chambers across a peatland microtopographic gradient (high hummock, low hummock, lawn and hollow microforms) between June and August 2006, 2007, and 2008. Total June to August precipitation increased during the study period with 285 mm in 2006, 320 mm in 2007, and 369 mm in 2008, whereas monthly average temperature was similar among years, with the exception of August 2008, which was 2.4 degrees C warmer than previous years. Significantly different relationships between photosynthetic photon flux density and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were observed in 2008 on three of the four microforms corresponding with the different meteorological conditions. The controls on CO2 exchange varied among microforms: a water table closer to the peat surface increased NEE on the high and low hummocks by increasing maximum rates of photosynthesis (PSNmax) but reduced NEE on the hollow microform by flooding the surface vegetation and reducing PSNmax. Water table position was a significant control on ecosystem respiration (ER) only on the lawn microform. We examine relationships between water table position and PSNmax and ER, and propose a theoretical relationship, which supports results from other studies examining water table position and peat accumulation.

AB Differences in topographic structure, vegetation structure, and surface wetness exist between peatland classes, making active remote sensing techniques such as SAR and LiDAR promising for peatland mapping. As the timing of green-up, senescence, and hydrologic conditions vary differently in peatland classes, and in comparison with upland classes, full growing-season time series SAR imagery was expected to produce higher accuracy classification results than using only a few select SAR images. Both interferometric coherence, amplitude and difference in amplitude time series datasets were assessed, as it was hypothesized that these may be able to capture subtle changes in phenology and hydrology, which in turn differentiate classes throughout a growing season. Groups of variables were compared for their effectiveness in Random Forest classification for both Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2. The Shapley value was used to determine the contribution of each group of variables in thirty scenarios, and Mean Decrease in Accuracy was compared to evaluate its ability to rank variables by relative importance. Despite being dual-pol, the results of classifications using Sentinel-1 coherence (12-day repeat) were significantly better than using fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 coherence (24-day repeat), likely owing to the difference in baseline and specific acquisition dates of the data in this study. Overall, full growing season Sentinel-1 coherence time series produced higher accuracy results than fully polarimetric quad pol RADARSAT-2 coherence amplitude, difference in amplitude and polarimetric decomposition time series. Using a full growing season of time-series imagery in classification resulted in higher accuracy than using a few dates over a growing season. Using mean decrease in accuracy to rank and reduce variables resulted in a weaker classification than if the entire time series is used.

AB Methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) within the genus Methylobacter constitute the biological filter for methane (CH4) in many Arctic soils. Multiple Methylobacter strains have been identified in these environments but we seldom know the ecological significance of the different strains. High-Arctic peatlands in Svalbard are heavily influenced by herbivory, leading to reduced vascular plant and root biomass. Here, we have measured potential CH4 oxidation rates and identified the active methantrophs in grazed peat and peat protected from grazing by fencing (exclosures) for 18 years. Grazed peat sustained a higher water table, higher CH4 concentrations and lower oxygen (O-2) concentrations than exclosed peat. Correspondingly, the highest CH4 oxidation potentials were closer to the O-2 rich surface in the grazed than in the protected peat. A comparison of 16S rRNA genes showed that the majority of methanotrophs in both sites belong to the genus Methylobacter. Further analyses of pmoA transcripts revealed that several Methylobacter OTUs were active in the peat but that different OTUs dominated the grazed peat than the exclosed peat. We conclude that grazing influences soil conditions, the active CH4 filter and that different Methylobacter populations are responsible for CH4 oxidation depending on the environmental conditions.

AB This report describes the Romanian Grassland Database (RGD), registered under EU-RO-008 in the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD). This collaborative initiative aims to collect all available vegetation-plot data (releves) of grasslands and other open habitats from the territory of Romania to provide them for science, nationally and internationally, e.g. via the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and the global database "sPlot". The database mainly contains vegetation-plots from not only wet, mesic, dry, saline, alpine and rocky grasslands, but also other vegetation types like heathlands, mires, ruderal, segetal, aquatic and cryptogamdominated vegetation. Currently, 21,685 releves have mainly been digitised from literature sources (90%), while the remainder comes from individual unpublished sources (10%). We report on the background and history of the RGD, explain its "Data Property and Governance Rules" under which data are contributed and retrieved, and outline how the RGD can contribute to research in the fields of vegetation ecology, macroecology and conservation.

AB Trends in the growing season Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series were analyzed for the time period from 2000 to 2010 to understand landscape-level patterns of vegetation change in ecosystems of interior Alaska. The analysis compared data-sets for Alaska vegetation cover types, wetland cover classes, wildfire boundaries since the 1940s, permafrost type, and elevation to identify the most likely combination of factors driving regional changes in habitat quality and ecosystem productivity. Approximately 48% of all ecosystem areas in interior Alaska were detected with significant (p < 0.05) positive or negative MODIS growing season EVI trends from 2000 to 2010. Three-quarters of these ecosystem areas (nearly 110,000 km(2)) were detected with significant positive growing season EVI trends. The vast majority of interior Alaska area detected with significant positive growing season EVI trends was classified as upland shrub cover, although non-forested wetlands (marshes, bogs, fens, and floodplains) were colocated on 13% of that total area. Evidence supports the hypothesis that temperature (warming) has markedly enhanced the rates of shrubland and tundra vegetation growth across interior Alaska over recent years.

AB A 4 m core was extracted from the center of a peatland located in the Drugeon valley (France). Thirteen radiocarbon dates were used to build a robust age model. Testate amoebae were used for reconstructing mire surface wetness. High-resolution pollen analysis of the sequence reconstructed 9 millennia of development of the peatland and its surrounding vegetation. During the early/middle Holocene (9500 to 5800 cal BP), warm conditions led to high evapotranspiration and low water levels. The vegetation history is characterized by the development of a Pinus and a mixed Quercus forest. From 5800 cal BP, testate amoebae show wetter conditions, indicating the onset of the cooler Neoglacial period. The cooling is also evidenced by the development of Abies and Fagus trees, replacing the oak forest. The first indicators of human impact appear at about 4800 cal BP, and indicators of farming activity remains very rare until ca. 2600 cal BP, at the beginning of the Iron Age. The development of the peatland responded to climatic fluctuation until 2600 cal BP, after which human impact became the main driver. The last millennium has been characterized by sudden drying and the spread of pine on the peatland.

AB A model framework for national greenhouse gas emission and removal estimation for Canadian peatlands (CaMP v2.0) was developed and tested. It provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) developed to eventually replace the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) as the core model in Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System. The CaMP (v2.0) provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories. It tracks the growth, turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components (foliage, branches, stems, and roots of trees, shrubs, sedges and mosses). It uses a Q(10) relationship to model peat C pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature, and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth. The CaMP takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally-available Canadian Fire Weather Index Drought Code to predict long-term and annual water table depth. The CaMP (v2.0) provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version. Model behavior and sensitivity were assessed, and evaluated against observed flux data. Results suggest that the CaMP (v2.0) provides an appropriate structure for large spatial- and temporal-scale estimation of emissions, owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables, and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals. Methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites), and by 8 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 12 sites, >= 3 years of data per site). The model overestimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 20 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites), and by 2 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 11 sites, >= 3 years of data per site), and results demonstrate that inter-site variation is greater than temporal variation across NEE measures. Several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer-scale emission estimates. Recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re-calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize NPP rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types, as well as developing a national annual-scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature (Q(10)) decay relationship currently used in the CaMP (v2.0). Data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual-scale meta-data. Future work is required to include permafrost dynamics, as well as additional natural, and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) were measured at open and treed portions of a temperate ombrotrophic bog using the eddy covariance technique to examine the potential influence of plant community characteristics on peatland carbon and water vapour exchange. The sites were located 2.7 km from each other within the same peatland complex and thus experienced similar weather. Both sites were characterized by a Sphagnum ground cover and a shrub layer with similar total biomass. However, at the treed bog, 35% of this understory vascular plant layer was made up of Picea mariana (<0.5 m tall) compared to less than 0.2% in the open bog. The treed bog was also characterized by an overstory dominated by a patchy distribution of stunted P. mariana. Over a single year, net CO2 uptake and ET was lower at the treed bog (NEE: -72 g C m(-2) year(-1) and ET: 449 mm year(-1)) than at the open bog (NEE: -104 g C m(-2) year(-1) and ET: 493 mm year(-1)). Chamber measurements revealed that P. mariana was associated with low rates of net primary productivity (NPP) compared to the relatively more productive ericaceous and deciduous shrubs. Although the presence of a P. mariana overstory increases both the total aboveground biomass and leaf area index in this peatland, P. mariana appears to be important in reducing both ecosystem-scale carbon sequestration and water vapour loss.

AB In pristine Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, (di) nitrogen (N-2) fixing (diazotrophic) microbial communities associated with Sphagnum mosses contribute substantially to the total nitrogen input, increasing carbon sequestration. The rates of symbiotic nitrogen fixation reported for Sphagnum peatlands, are, however, highly variable, and experimental work on regulating factors that can mechanistically explain this variation is largely lacking. For two common fen species (Sphagnum palustre and S. squarrosum) from a high nitrogen deposition area (25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), we found that diazotrophic activity (as measured by N-15-15(2) labeling) was still present at a rate of 40 nmol N gDW(-1) h(-1). This was surprising, given that nitrogen fixation is a costly process. We tested the effects of phosphorus availability and buffering capacity by bicarbonate-rich water, mimicking a field situation in fens with stronger groundwater or surface water influence, as potential regulators of nitrogen fixation rates and Sphagnum performance. We expected that the addition of phosphorus, being a limiting nutrient, would stimulate both diazotrophic activity and Sphagnum growth. We indeed found that nitrogen fixation rates were doubled. Plant performance, in contrast, did not increase. Raised bicarbonate levels also enhanced nitrogen fixation, but had a strong negative impact on Sphagnum performance. These results explain the higher nitrogen fixation rates reported for minerotrophic and more nutrient-rich peatlands. In addition, nitrogen fixation was found to strongly depend on light, with rates 10 times higher in light conditions suggesting high reliance on phototrophic organisms for carbon. The contrasting effects of phosphorus and bicarbonate on Sphagnum spp. and their diazotrophic communities reveal strong differences in the optimal niche for both partners with respect to conditions and resources. This suggests a trade-off for the symbiosis of nitrogen fixing microorganisms with their Sphagnum hosts, in which a sheltered environment apparently outweighs the less favorable environmental conditions. We conclude that microbial activity is still nitrogen limited under eutrophic conditions because dissolved nitrogen is being monopolized by Sphagnum. Moreover, the fact that diazotrophic activity can significantly be upregulated by increased phosphorus addition and acid buffering, while Sphagnum spp. do not benefit, reveals remarkable differences in optimal conditions for both symbiotic partners and calls into question the regulation of nitrogen fixation by Sphagnum under these eutrophic conditions. The high nitrogen fixation rates result in high additional nitrogen loading of 6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) on top of the high nitrogen deposition in these ecosystems.

AB Gross primary production (GPP) is a key driver of the peatland carbon cycle. Although many studies have explored the apparent GPP under natural light conditions, knowledge of the maximum GPP at lightsaturation (GPP(max)) and its spatio-temporal variation is limited. This information, however, is crucial since GPP(max) essentially constrains the upper boundary for apparent GPP. Using chamber measurements combined with an external light source across experimental plots where vegetation composition was altered through long-term (20-year) nitrogen addition and artificial warming, we could quantify GPP(max) in-situ and disentangle its biotic and abiotic controls in a boreal peatland. We found large spatial and temporal variations in the magnitudes of GPP(max) which were related to vegetation species composition and phenology rather than abiotic factors. Specifically, we identified vegetation phenology as the main driver of the seasonal GPP(max) trajectory. Abiotic anomalies (i.e. in air temperature and water table level), however, caused species-specific divergence between the trajectories of GPP(max) and plant development. Our study demonstrates that photosynthetically active biomass constrains the potential peatland photosynthesis while abiotic factors act as secondary modifiers. This further calls for a better representation of species-specific vegetation phenology in process-based peatland models to improve predictions of global change impacts on the peatland carbon cycle.

AB Water table decline is a major threat to soil organic carbon in peatlands worldwide principally because it may largely increase soil CO2 emission (SCE). This study is to determine the response of SCE to water table decline in the Zoige peatland of Tibetan Plateau, which has experienced rapid decline of water table due to climate change and anthropogenic drainage. We conducted a field in situ drainage experiment consisting of low (plots surrounded by 50 cm deep ditches), intermediate (20 cm deep) and high (intact) water table levels. The experiment lasted for about four years, during which we measured SCE rate and associated variables including soil temperature and moisture with a higher frequency in the growing season (May-September) than the non-growing season (October-April). Experimental drainage decreased water table height by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the intact) and soil moisture (at 5 cm soil) by 6% and 12% (relative to 45% in the intact) on average in intermediate and low water table treatments, respectively, but it did not affect soil temperature during the experimental years.
   The effect of drainage on SCE varied with season. In the non-growing season, the drainage effect was nonsignificant in each measurement possibly because the low-temperature effect overrode the drainage effect on SCE. In the growing season, the drainage mostly increased the emission except for several cases, in which a negative effect was observed. The negative effect of drainage could be due to the low soil moisture (< 25%) in the drained treatments. Provided that the magnitude and the duration of the SCE increase were greater than those of the decrease, it can be estimated that drainage increased SCE by 17% and 20% on average in the low and the intermediate water table treatments, respectively, over the experimental years. Our results suggest that water table decline may facilitate net carbon emission and hence decrease soil carbon storage in the Zoige peatland. We call for artificial filling of the ditches that were historically created by both human beings and storm waters to increase water table in the Zoige peatland.

AB Due to their location at the southern margin of the Arid Diagonal, only a limited number of archives in the western Central Andes of Chile is capable for paleoclimate investigations. High-altitude cushion peatlands are potentially suitable to fill this gap despite their heterogenic stratigraphies representing past geomorphodynamics, especially for the Late Holocene. We investigated a 4 m sediment profile from the Lagunillas cushion peatland (LP, 27'12' S, 69 degrees 17 W), located in the dry Puna of the Western Central Andes. Directed by Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements, sediment cores were recovered at the deepest point of the investigated valley section. In total, 10 radiocarbon samples were used to build the age-depth model resulting in a sediment chronology spanning the last 1800 cal. yr BR Core stratigraphy and ERT data were applied to allow insights into the sedimentary environment. Geochemical (X-ray fluorescence) and sedimentological (grain size) analyses were conducted to identify significant changes in sedimentation dynamics during the Late Holocene. Grain size analyses were investigated on 24 samples from peat layers as well as from stratigraphical sections characterized by allochthonous sediments. In combination with the results of the XRF measurements, evidence for changes in geomorphodynamic processes during the last 1800 cal. yr BP could be revealed.
   Our data disclose that investigations of heterogenic peat stratigraphies could also provide promising inferences about paleoclimatic changes. Within the Lagunillas record, stable phases of peat accumulation alternate with phases dominated by clastic material input. A stable phase of peat accumulation prevailed from 1750 cal. yr BP until about 1250 cal. yr BP and was followed by a phase with unstable conditions from 1250 to 980 cal. yr BP. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 980 to 620 cal. yr BP, drier conditions prevailed at Lagunillas peatland, while shorter humid periods favored peat accumulation between 620 to 560 cal. yr BR Higher precipitation amounts were evident during the Little Ice Age (LIA) from 560-160 cal. yr BR During the period from 160 cal. yr BP to recent times, a higher frequency of changes between peat accumulation and clastic layers occurred, presumably due to a decreasing trend in precipitation.

AB Models of peat accumulation assume that peat decomposition occurs mostly above the water table, with little or no decomposition once it enters the deeper, saturated, anoxic zone. Few studies have used molecular biomarkers for tracing post depositional, decomposition-related trends in peat deposits. We studied the major diagenetic changes in the phenolic constituents within a Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bog deposit. The yield of lignin-derived phenols and degree of decomposition, measured using alkaline cupric oxide oxidation of bulk peat samples and their corresponding humic acids, revealed that most of the degradation takes place in the surface layers corresponding to the acrotelm. In fact, total phenolic constituents of peat samples decrease from 36.1 to 21.6 mg g(-1) OC (organic carbon) over the first 36 cm, whereas in the deeper anoxic layers, phenolic constituents tend to accumulate, reaching a highest concentration of 71.0 mg g(-1) OC. The diagenetic alteration of these phenolic constituents during peat accumulation involves significant demethoxylation and an increasing yield of vanillyl oxidation products despite the low redox potential. Syringyl phenols tend to be particularly resistant to diagenetic alteration and are significantly enriched within the humic acid fraction (similar to twofold) with respect to the bulk peat. This, together with the higher degree of oxidation, suggests that this organic matter fraction is enriched in more resistant, but nonetheless diagenetically altered, phenolic constituents. This suggests that humic acids constitute a refractory pool of organic C with a relatively low turnover rate. Our results confirm that the major processes involved in the variation in phenolic constituents with depth are strongly related to the post depositional environment and that evaluation of diagenetic trends in phenolic constituents may provide molecular-level information on the changes that fresh biomass undergoes during early diagenesis in peatlands.

AB Peatlands represent one of the largest terrestrial carbon pools. Phenol oxidase is widely considered to play a critical role in the decomposition of organic matter in peatlands, which is known as the "enzymatic latch". However, our recent studies have indicated that the formation of iron-organic matter (Fe-OM) associations is more likely to occur in the presence of laccase, the largest class of phenol oxidases in soils. As the formation of Fe-OM associations is recognized as an important stabilization mechanism for soil organic matter, further clarification of the potential mechanisms contributes to a better understanding of the role of laccase in peatland carbon sequestration. In this study, a series of experiments using different phenolic compounds and peat-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) were performed. The results from liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses indicated that laccase catalyzed the polymerization of phenolics and peat-derived DOM by coupling of the C-O bond, the C-C bond and the C-C/C-O bonds. The polymerized products can combine more effectively with Fe to form Fe-OM associations. FTIR spectral analysis indicated that organic matter associated with Fe under laccase catalysis contained more oxygen-containing functional groups but fewer aromatic C]C bonds. Although laccase catalysis can change the chemical structure of organic matter, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses showed minimal influence of laccase on the Fe chemical species in the Fe-OM associations. Thus, we propose that laccase mediated the formation of Fe-OM associations by polymerizing organic matter and by increasing the O/C ratio of organic matter. In addition, laccase can improve the sequestration of organic carbon by increasing the C/Fe molar ratio of the formed Fe-OM associations. This mechanism may provide further insight into the role of laccase in the carbon cycling in peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands contain a considerable share of the terrestrial carbon (C) pool, which climate change will likely affect in the future. The magnitude of this effect, however, remains uncertain, due mainly to difficulties in predicting decomposition rates in the old peat layers. We studied the effects of water level depth (WL) and soil temperature on heterotrophic soil respiration originating from peat decomposition (R(PD)) in six drained peatlands using a chamber technique. The microbial community structure was determined through PLFA. Within the studied sites, temperature appeared to be the main driver of R(PD). However, our results indicate that there exist mechanisms related to lower WL conditions that can tone down the effect of temperature on R(PD). These mechanisms were described with a mathematical model that included the optimum WL response of R(PD) and the effect of average WL conditions on the temperature sensitivity of R(PD). The following implications were apparent from the model parameterisation: (1) The instantaneous effect of WL on R(PD) followed a Gaussian form: the optimum WL for R(PD) was 61 cm. The tolerance of R(PD) to the WL however, was rather broad, indicating that the overall effect of WL was relatively weak. (2) The temperature sensitivity of R(PD) depended on the average WL of the plot: plots with a high average WL showed higher temperature sensitivity than did those under drier conditions. This variation in temperature sensitivity of R(PD) Correlated with microbial community structure. Thus, moisture stress in the surface peat layer or, alternatively, the lowered temperature sensitivity of R(PD) in low water level conditions via microbial community structure and biomass may restrict R(PD). We conclude that a warmer future climate may raise R(PD) in drained peatlands only if the subsequent decrease in the moisture of the surface peat layers is minor and, thus, conditions remain favourable for decomposition.

AB 1 The effect of fire on vegetation development and accumulation rates in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands of western boreal Canada was studied through plant macrofossil and physicochemical analyses of two Holocene peat sequences characterized by a large number of macroscopic charcoal layers.
   2 Field observations and detailed macrofossil analyses of charcoal horizons indicate that these layers represent local fires that burnt the superficial peat deposit.
   3 Peat surface fires do not influence the long-term vegetation development of Sphagnum-dominated boreal peatlands. Vegetation response such as species composition changes in moss cover, if any, is generally limited to a few decades after the fire event.
   4 Accumulation rates in Sphagnum-dominated boreal peatlands decrease significantly with increasing fire frequencies. Rates of height of peat accumulation and carbon accumulation would approximate zero with a five- to sevenfold increase in the frequency of peat surface fires, compared to the average frequency of this type of fire during the last 2500 years.
   5 The frequency of peat surface fires at 7000 years BP, in the Hypsithermal period, was about twice as high as during the period 0-2500 BP, in the Late Holocene.

AB Turloughs are karst wetland ecosystems that are virtually unique to Ireland. Flooding annually in autumn through springs and fissures in the underlying limestone and draining in the springtime, often through the same fissures or swallow-holes, they have been described as 'temporal ecotones'. Over 300 have been documented. They are priority habitats in the EU Habitats Directive and support a variety of wet grassland and fen type vegetation. Though the vegetation has been recorded and mapped for over 80 turloughs, records for invertebrates are more sporadic. Characteristic species include some aquatic species-often benefiting from the absence of fish-, and many wetland terrestrial species, including carabid beetles that are rare on a European scale. Due to their shallow nature and the full vegetation cover of the basin, turloughs can host internationally significant numbers of visiting winter wildfowl, particularly whooper swans. The variety of plant and invertebrate communities between turloughs is primarily due to different hydrogeomorphological characteristics, but also depends on the range of grazing practices on turloughs. Since these often vary within a turlough basin, this helps maintain within-turlough biodiversity. The main threat to turloughs in the past was drainage, but pollution by nutrients is also now potentially detrimental. However, a more recent and important threat may be the cessation of farming within turloughs. As potentially threatened wetlands of European importance, turloughs require a full inventory of their biodiversity and the factors affecting it. The collation here of all literature concerning turloughs will provide a basis for an integrated approach to future research on turloughs that is essential for a full understanding of these complex ecosystems.

AB Quantifying rates of microbial carbon transformation in peatlands is essential for gaining mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence methane emissions from these systems, and for predicting how emissions will respond to climate change and other disturbances. In this study, we used porewater stable isotopes collected from both the edge and center of a thermokarst bog in Interior Alaska to estimate in situ microbial reaction rates. We expected that near the edge of the thaw feature, actively thawing permafrost and greater abundance of sedges would increase carbon, oxygen and nutrient availability, enabling faster microbial rates relative to the center of the thaw feature. We developed three different conceptual reaction networks that explained the temporal change in porewater CO2, CH4, delta C-13-CO2 and delta C-13-CH4. All three reaction-network models included methane production, methane oxidation and CO2 production, and two of the models included homoacetogenesis-a reaction not previously included in isotope-based porewater models. All three models fit the data equally well, but rates resulting from the models differed. Most notably, inclusion of homoacetogenesis altered the modeled pathways of methane production when the reaction was directly coupled to methanogenesis, and it decreased gross methane production rates by up to a factor of five when it remained decoupled from methanogenesis. The ability of all three conceptual reaction networks to successfully match the measured data indicate that this technique for estimating in situ reaction rates requires other data and information from the site to confirm the considered set of microbial reactions. Despite these differences, all models indicated that, as expected, rates were greater at the edge than in the center of the thaw bog, that rates at the edge increased more during the growing season than did rates in the center, and that the ratio of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greater at the edge than in the center. In both locations, modeled rates (excluding methane oxidation) increased with depth. A puzzling outcome from the effort was that none of the models could fit the porewater dataset without generating "fugitive" carbon (i.e., methane or acetate generated by the models but not detected at the field site), indicating that either our conceptualization of the reactions occurring at the site remains incomplete or our site measurements are missing important carbon transformations and/or carbon fluxes. This model-data discrepancy will motivate and inform future research efforts focused on improving our understanding of carbon cycling in permafrost wetlands.

AB The interrelationships between biomass characteristics and soil properties (including in situ annual nitrogen mineralization) were statistically investigated in a descriptive study using a broad range of plant communities in unfertilized road verges. Not only the dependence of biomass characteristics on soil properties, but also the possibility of inferring soil nutrient availability from biomass characteristics was investigated. Possible effects of vegetation management (mowing) and overstory trees (shading) were accounted for. Annual aboveground biomass production was mainly explained by annual N mineralization, average soil moisture content, shading intensity, and soil pH (optimum at pH-CaCl2 5.7). Average tissue nutrient concentrations were primarily explained by mowing frequency, shading intensity, the availability of the corresponding soil nutrient, and pH (optima between 5.5 and 6.0). Results also implied that making hay twice per year removes more nutrients than a single cut at the end of the season. N mineralization may be inferred from the aboveground biomass production, but only across sites with equal moisture and shading conditions (partial r=0.74). In general, it is concluded that nutrient availability can only be deduced from biomass characteristics if sites with similar moisture content are compared. The only exception to this general rule is K availability. The latter was mainly indicated by the K concentration in vegetation biomass (partial r=0.80), and the confounding effect of other factors was small (bivariate r was still 0.71). Soil available P could not be satisfactorily indicated, even across sites with equal moisture and shading conditions. Also, different nutrients appeared to interact, and should not be considered in isolation. K was the only element with a strong relationship between its soil and tissue concentration. For the other nutrients, tissue concentrations did not depend predominantly on the soil availability. It seems most likely that the species occurring in semi-natural vegetation are adapted to the local fertility by means of their physiology or growth rate. It is concluded that, with the possible exception of K, simple relationships between soil properties and biomass characteristics cannot be expected over wide environmental gradients.

   FIELD; MODEL; REINTRODUCTION; NEWFOUNDLAND; RESTORATION
AB Mined peatlands do not readily recover their hydrological function, mainly because the dominant peat-forming plant genus, Sphagnum, cannot easily reestablish on the degraded surface peat found on cutover sites. Drainage and removal of the acrotelm can result in surface subsidence of up to 3.7 cm y(-1) m(-1) of peat shortly after drainage (compression), and long-term rates up to 0.3 cm y(-1) m(-1) (compression and oxidation). This can decrease the hydraulic conductivity by over 75%, and decrease the water retention capacity and specific yield. In old abandoned systems, drainage ditches may continue to facilitate a significant seasonal water loss. Colonization of abandoned sites by trees may increase the evapotranspirative losses by as much as 25%, and interception losses can be as high as 32% of rainfall. Without natural or planned occlusion of ditches, some peatlands become drier over time. Blocking ditchesmay largely restore water balance components, although the hydrological regime requires years to stabilise sufficiently for Sphagnum recolonization, especially where residual peat is well decomposed, having inadequate water storage capacity. Consequently, winter precipitation (Europe) and spring snowmelt (North America) are critical recharge periods. Over the long term, consolidation of the peat due to drainage and methane production (where drainage systems are blocked and soils reflooded) decreases hydraulic conductivity, thereby reducing lateral seepage losses. This may actually assist in Sphagnum recolonization. A regenerated cover of Sphagnum increases soil wetness and reduces water tension (increases pore-water pressure) in the substrate, thus ameliorating its own environment. However, natural recolonization and recovery of many hydrological and ecological processes may not occur, or may require many decades. Water management and selective plant reintroduction can accelerate this. Water management options such as blocking ditches, constructing bunds, reconfiguring the surface and managing microclimate havemet with varying degrees of success. No standard management prescription can be made because each site presents unique challenges.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained and converted to agriculture more than a century ago, and since then has experienced extreme rates of soil subsidence from peat oxidation. To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes. We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CO2 and 3.3 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) of CO2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to seek a method for the quick revegetation of depleted peat mining areas in a near-city landscape, where the natural recovery of vegetation was impeded by a lack of some nutrients.
   The test area was pure milled peat that remained mainly free of vegetation cover for ten years after the mining process ended. Seedlings of Alnus glutinosa (black alder) and Betula pendula (silver birch) were planted in sewage sludge compost-filled drill-holes with a diameter of 20 cm and depth of 50 cm. For comparison, spot-applied multicomponent fertiliser was used in drill-holes of the same size, which were back-filled with the same peat, for the test group. Seedlings with spot-applied fertiliser without drill-holes and control seedlings Without treatment were also planted into cutover peatland. Significantly greater (p < 0.001) average annual growth of height (73 cm) was followed with one-year-old silver birches planted With sewage sludge compost at the end of the growing season compared to other seedlings treated with multicomponent fertiliser (56 ens with drill-holes and 55 cm without holes). Significantly longer (p < 0.05) root growth in the vertical direction (53 cm) was achieved for compost-treated birches compared to both fertiliser treatment groups (47 and 42 cm). The average values of the length of the largest leaves were determined in the case of the compost treatment group (83 mm) compared to fertiliser treatment groups (68 and 67 cm; p < 0.05). Similar growth trends of the same parameters were achieved with one-year-old black alder seedlings, but the differences were not statistically' significant in most cases. Usage of sewage sludge compost with the current drill-hole planting method can be suggested for afforestation of cutover peatlands with silver birch for its remarkably high height growth-promoting efficiency compared to fertiliser treatments. With black alder, the height growth-promoting effect of the compost was weaker, being similar to the fertiliser treatments.

AB Spatial relationships between concentrations of Cd, Fe, Mn, S, and Zn and bacterial genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction were studied in soils of the Manning peatland region in western New York. Peat cores were collected within a field exhibiting areas of Zn phytotoxicity, and pH and elemental concentrations were determined with depth. The oxidation states of S were estimated using S-XANES spectroscopy. Soil microbial community DNA was extracted from peat soils for ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) of diversity profiles with depth. To assess the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM), DNA extracts were also used as templates for PCR detection of dsrAB genes coding for dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase. Elemental distributions, S redox speciation, and detection of dsrAB genes varied with depth and water content. The pH of peat soils increased with depth. The highest concentrations of Zn, Cd, and S occurred at intermediate depths, whereas Mn concentra tions were highest in the topmost peat layers. Iron showed a relatively uniform distribution with depth. Concentrations of redox sensitive elements, S and Mn, but not Fe, seemed to respond to variations in water content and indicated vertical redox stratification in peat cores where topmost peats were typically acidic and oxidizing and deeper peats were typically circumneutral and reducing. Even then, S-XANES analyses showed that surface peats contained > 50% of the total S in reduced forms while deep peats contained generally < 5% of the total S in oxidized forms. While bacterial RISA profiles of the peats were diverse, dsrAB gene detection followed redox stratification chemistry closely. For the most part, dsrAB genes were detected in deeper peats, where S accumulation was evident, while they were not detected in topmost peat layers where Mn accumulation indicated oxic conditions. Combined chemical, spectroscopic, and microbiological analyses indicated that prolonged exposure to dry-wet cycles resulted in the formation of two redox-stratified zones with distinct chemical and microbiological signatures within peat cores of the Manning peatland region. As illustrated in this study, changes in redox conditions affect bacterial community composition and downward mobility of toxic elements, which has implications for water contamination and the design of metal remediation strategies.

AB Hummocks. small earth or peat mounds, are widely distributed in the arctic and develop a., a consequence of biomass accumulation and cryoturbation in the active layer. There is general agreement that the type of vegetation covering peat hummocks may alter the accumulation rate of organic material and thus hummock growth and local carbon sink dynamics. Studies on hummock plant community compositions from the arctic are very scarce. Here, I present results of a case study from the arctic tree-line near Churchill, Manitoba (Canada). Vegetation composition, hummock height and soil moisture content were recorded in 40 peat hummocks located along a tree-line gradient from open forest to tundra. Based on a cluster analysis I found three moss-dominated types of hummock vegetation, according to (1) a Tomenthypnum nitens (golden fuzzy fen moss) type on low hummocks, (2) a Hylocomium spledens (stair-step moss) type on medium-sized hummocks, and (3) a Pleurozium schreberi (red-stemmed feathermoss) type on hummocks higher than 60-70 cm. I found hummock height to increase towards the forest interior with decreasing water content of the upper organic layer on the hummock top. This is indicated by a significant change in vegetation composition towards drought resistant moss species on higher hummocks. Furthermore, species richness decreased with increase in hummock height. Based on evidence from historical tree-line invasion the overall results suggest that hummock height increases due to peat accumulation over the course of time resulting in a typical change in plant community composition.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the surface energy balance were gathered from an elevated peat plateau within the Hudson Bay Lowlands near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada (58 degrees 43'46 '' N, 93 degrees 49'57 '' W) during the growing season of 2007. Data were segregated into onshore and offshore wind regimes to assess the advective influence of the generally cold and moist Hudson Bay air masses compared to generally warm and dry air masses of nonmarine origin. Monthly average NEE ranged from an uptake of 0.2 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in September to 5.6 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in July. Over the growing season, onshore winds from Hudson Bay contributed to an average 4.2 degrees C reduction in air temperature and an NEE increase of 27%. When normalized with respect to sunlight receipt, the ratio of gross primary production to photosynthetically active radiation (GPP/PAR) was 26% stronger for off-shore regimes than for onshore, while the ratio of ecosystem respiration to PAR (ER/PAR) was 71% stronger for offshore regimes. It was concluded that GPP maintains the same strength for both wind regimes, while ER is significantly stronger for offshore regimes, resulting in reduced NEE capacity during periods when winds originate from inland.

AB Northern peatlands are often dominated by ericaceous shrub species which rely on ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERM) for access to organic sources of nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and host abundant dark septate endophytes (DSE). Relationships between hosts and fungal symbionts may change during deposition of anthmpogenic N and P. We studied the long-term effects of N and P addition on two ericaceous shrubs, Cantina vulgaris and Erica tetralix, at Whim Bog, Scotland by analyzing fungal colonization of roots, enzymatic activity, and fungal species composition. Unexpectedly, the frequency of typical ERM intracellular colonization did not change while the occurrence of ERM hyphae tended to increase and DSE hyphae to decrease. Our findings indicate that altered nutrient limitations shift root associated fungal colonization patterns as well as affect ericaceous root enzyme activity and thereby decomposition potential. Reduction of recalcitrant fungal biomass in melanized DSE may have implications for peatland C sequestration under nutrient addition.

AB 16 peat bogs of Tomsk region (in Siberia) were used to study trace elements concentrations in ombrotrophic peat. The calculations of concentration coefficient in relation to the sedimentary rocks allowed us to determine some elements which tend to accumulate in ombrotrophic peat of Tomsk region. They are Au, Br, Sr, Ba, Fe, and Cr. For selective trace elements we considered spacial variability of their mean contents in the ombrotrophic peat of Tomsk region. Together with the study of vertical distribution of trace elements in the studied peat bogs we outlined factors influencing their accumulation in peat. Lithological and mineral composition of surrounding territories plays role in the accumulation of Cr, Sc, Br, Au, and lanthanides, climatic conditions and necessity for living plants cause Ca variations. Cr, Sc, lanthanides and U are also actively accumulated in the peat near industrial cities in the south of Tomsk region.

AB The Holocene paleoenvironment in Nur sphagnum bog, northern Mongolia, was reconstructed by diatom, pollen analysis and measurement of chemical properties on a 3.7 m long peat boring sample. Development processes of peatland are well reflected in these multiproxy records, showing that peat accumulation started as early as 9 ka cal BP, and the present acidic peat bog was established no later than 6 ka cal BP. Synchronous trends in diatom and pollen assemblages revealed wetter climate in the early Holocene and extensive drought in the mid-late Holocene centered at 5900-2800 cal BP as a result of temperature increase and low precipitation. Periods of shifts in proxy data were potentially correlated with other studies in not only Mongolia and Siberia, but also the North Atlantic Ocean, and the climatic periods at 8.4 and 2.8 ka cal BP were highly significant. However, responses to climate changes seem regionally varied in time and strength, demonstrating that local differences in vegetation and orography greatly influence the balance of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Climate changes that coincided in time with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age were observed as wetter (1200-980 cal BP) and drier (370-240 cal BP) conditions, probably caused by meridional shifts of westerlies.

AB Plant community modification may play an important role in peatlands' carbon balance. We investigated how Molinia caerulea altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes and DOC concentration as well as their sensitivity to water table level, air and soil temperature in Sphagnum-dominated peat mesocosms. The presence of Molinia caerulea significantly increased CO2 and CH4 emissions compared to Sphagnum and decreased the DOC concentration. The rise in temperature exponentially increased DOC as well as CO2 and CH4 emissions. Molinia caerulea decreased the temperature sensitivity of CO2 emissions, suggesting the presence of a more labile substrate (root exudates), while it increased the temperature sensitivity of CH4 emissions, suggesting a possible change in methanogenic communities. Our study highlights a strong impact of vegetation change on C dynamics in peatlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The changes in the amounts and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) following long-term peat restoration are unknown, although this fraction of soil organic matter affects many processes in such ecosystems. We addressed this lack of knowledge by investigating a peatland in south-west Germany that was partly rewetted 20 years ago. A successfully restored site and a moderately drained site were compared, where the mean groundwater levels were close to the soil surface and around 30 cm below surface, respectively. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at 4 depths were measured over one year. The specific absorbance was measured at 280 nm and the fluorescence spectra were used to describe the aromaticity, and complexity of DOM.
   The investigations showed that 20 years of peatland restoration was able to create typical peatland conditions. The rewetted site had significantly lower DOC concentrations at different depths compared to the drained site. The specific UV absorbance showed that the rewetted site had a lower level of aromatic DOM structures. The decreasing specific UV absorbance might indicate an increasing contribution of small organic molecules to DOM. It was hypothesized that the decreasing DOC concentrations and the relative enrichment of small, readily degradable organic molecules. reflect the slower decomposition of organic matter after the re-establishment of the water table. Seasonal trends provided substantial evidence for our hypothesis that reduced DOC concentrations were caused by reduced peat decomposition. During summer, the elevated DOC values were accompanied by an increase in DOM aromaticity and complexity. Our results demonstrated a close link between C mineralization and DOC production. We concluded that long-term peatland restoration in the form of the successful re-establishment of the water table might result in reduced peat decomposition and lower DOC concentrations. The restoration of peatlands seems to have a positive impact on C sequestration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work focuses on building a high-resolution age-depth model for quantitative palaeoclimate study from the Mohos peat bog, East Carpathian mountains. The investigated core presents a continuous peat profile for the last 12 kyr. The chronology was based on 36 accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS C-14) analyses of the separated Sphagnum samples from different depths of the profile. Dry Sphagnum samples for AMS dating were prepared using the classic acid-base-acid (ABA) method followed with an oxidative bleaching step to get clean cellulose. Sphagnum cellulose samples were measured by AMS using the EnvironMICADAS at the ICER (Debrecen, Hungary). A high-resolution chronology was obtained with the use of Bayesian age-depth modeling. Peat accumulation rate has been calculated and the sections with variable accumulation rate values were observed along the profile.

AB Ecological restoration of mined peatlands in North America involves active reintroduction of bog plant species. Animals are not actively reintroduced, thus the re-establishment of peatland fauna must occur either by inoculation along with introduced plant material or by dispersal. We examined the extent to which insects are reintroduced to restored sites with plant material by rearing insects from shredded vegetation collected in three donor sites. We assessed differences in abundance, diversity, and composition of taxonomic and trophic groups among seasons and sites. Abundance and species richness did not differ by season, but species assemblages did. The three sites were significantly different in abundance, but not in species richness and assemblages. Few insects emerged from the vegetation, suggesting that shredded plant material may not be the primary source of insect colonists. Insects likely recolonize by active or passive dispersal from the surrounding area. The species pool was similar among donor sites; consequently a mined site could be inoculated with vegetation from another peatland in the same region and this would not affect the insect assemblages at the initial stage of establishment. Diapause may be a major factor for emergence success among seasons of collection. Knowledge of how restoration techniques influence establishment of insect communities will help predict longer-term outcomes of restoration on biotic communities in peatlands.

TI A DEBRIS FLOW DEPOSIT IN ALLUVIAL, COAL-BEARING FACIES, BIGHORN BASIN,
   WYOMING, USA - EVIDENCE FOR CATASTROPHIC TERMINATION OF A MIRE
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID POWDER RIVER BASIN; ENVIRONMENTS; MODELS
AB Coal and clastic facies investigations Of a Paleocene coal-bearing succession in the Grass Creek coal mine, southwestern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, suggest that disruption of peat accumulation in recurrent mires was caused by the repetitive progradation of crevasse splays and, ultimately, by a catastrophic mass movement. The mass movement, represented by deposits of a debris flow, marked the termination of significant peat accumulation in the Grass Creek coal mine area.
   Megascopic and microscopic analyses of coal beds exposed along the mine highwalls suggest that these deposits developed in low-lying mires, as evidenced primarily by their ash yields and maceral composition. Disruption of peat accumulation in successive mires was caused by incursions of sediment into the mire environments. Termination by crevasse splay progradation is represented by coarsening-upward successions of mudrock and tabular, rooted sandstone, which overlie coal beds in the lower part of the coal-bearing interval. A more rapid process of mire termination by mass movement is exemplified by a debris flow deposit of diamictite, which overlies the uppermost coal bed at the top of the coal-bearing interval. The diamictite consists of a poorly sorted, unstratified mixture of quartzite cobbles and pebbles embedded in a claystone-rich or sandy mudstone matrix. Deposition of the diamictite may have taken place over a matter of weeks, days, or perhaps even hours, by catastrophic flood, thus reflecting an instantaneous process of mire termination. Coarse clastics and mud were transported from the southwest some 20-40 km as a viscous debris flow along stream courses from the ancestral Washakie Range to the Grass Creek area, where the flow overrode a low-lying mire and effectively terminated peat accumulation.

AB Northern peatlands represent about 30% of the global soil C pools. The C pool in peat is a result of a relatively small imbalance between production and decay. High water levels and the consequent anoxia are considered the major causes for the imbalance. As such, the C sink of a peatland is labile, and sensitive to disturbances in environmental conditions.
   Changes in peatland ecosystem functions may be mediated through land-use change, and/or climatic warming. In both cases, lowering of the water level may be the key factor. Logically, lowered water levels with the consequent increase in oxygen availability in the surface soil may be assumed to result in accelerated rates of organic matter decomposition. Yet, earlier research has given highly contrasting results concerning the effects of lowered water levels on the rates of decomposition and the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands. The mechanisms controlling this variation remain unresolved.
   This paper summarizes the changes observed in the biotic and abiotic controls of decomposition following natural or artificial lowering of peatland water levels and show that they are complex and their interactions have not been previously explored. Long-term changes in the C cycle may differ from short-term changes. Short-term changes represent a disturbance in the ecosystem adapted to the pre-waterlevel-lowering conditions, while long-term changes result from several adaptive mechanisms of the ecosystem to the new hydrological regime. While in a short term, the disturbed system will always lose C, the long-term changes inherently vary among peatland types, climates, and extents of change in the water level. The paper closes by identifying the gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed when proceeding towards a causal and unifying explanation for the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands following persistent lowering of the water level.

TI Peat compressibility: A parameter for automatic depth control of milling
   machines
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The primary object of the peat milling operation is to mill a layer of peat on the surface of the bog such that all of this layer (throughout the bog) dries to the required moisture content in the same time interval, so that it can all be harvested simultaneously. Feat type (and hence drying characteristics) vary considerably throughout a given bog, hence the depth of this milled layer should at any given location in the bog match the drying characteristics of the peat at this location. In order to do this, it is necessary to determine some measurable characteristic,of peat, representative of the drying time, so this can be used to determine the milling depth. Field and laboratory experiments revealed that compressibility of milled peat is a good depth control characteristic because of its high correlation with the relative drying time of milled peat. For example a typical high density peat (compressibility of 12%) has a milling depth requirement of 21 mm compared with 9 mm for a low density peat (compressibility of 25%). Results indicate that the application of this method within the peat industry would give a 27% increase in dry matter yields per hectare and the variation of the moisture content of the harvested milled peat would be reduced from a standard deviation of 0.55 kg/kg to one of 0.22 kg/kg.

AB The formation of microrelief forms in peatlands - elevated and dry hummocks, depressed wet hollows and intermediate lawns - is controlled by the interaction of water table, nutrient availability and dominant plant communities. This affects the composition and activity of various functional groups of microorganisms. With depth, the change in peat quality from less to more highly processed organic material additionally regulates microbial activity. We hypothesized that microbial biomass and enzyme activities are driven by aeration and by peat quality and therefore (i) they increase from hollows (water saturated/anaerobic) through lawns (intermediate) to hummocks (aerobic) in the top peat and ii) they decrease with depth due to increasing distance from fresh plant-derived inputs and lower oxygen availability. These hypotheses were tested for enzymes catalysing the decomposition of C-, N-, P- and S-containing organic compounds in peat of the three microform types at three depths (15, 50 and 200 cm). Microbial biomass and peat chemical characteristics were compared with enzyme kinetic parameters, i.e. maximal potential activity (V-maa) and the Michaelis constant (K-m).
   Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and V-maa of beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl glucosaminidase increased by 30-70% from hummocks and lawns to hollows in the top 15 cm, contradicting the hypothesis. Similarly, K-m and the catalytic efficiency of enzymes (K-a = V-max/K-m) were best related to MBC distribution and not to the aeration gradient. With depth, V-ama of beta-glucosidase, xylosidase and leucine aminopeptidase followed the hypothesized pattern in hollows. In contrast, MBC was 1.3-4 times higher at 50 cm, followed by successively lower contents at 15 and 200 cm in all microforms. The same depth pattern characterized the V-ama distribution of 6 out of 8 enzymes. Phosphatase activity decreased from drier hummock to wetter hollows and the higher activity throughout the peat profile suggested a high microbial demand for P. Enzyme activities and catalytic efficiency in peat were closely linked to the distribution of microbial biomass with depth, which in turn was best explained by P content. From the ecological perspective, these results clearly show that peat decomposition will be accelerated when microbial activity is stimulated e.g. by increased P availability.

AB 1 We tested predictions about how the effect of vegetation and litter on seedling establishment varies among sites and herbaceous community types (sand barrens, prairies, Fens). For both vegetation and litter, we also separated direct interactions from indirect interactions and interaction modifications along the gradient.
   2 Although the intensity of the effects varied across sites, the direct effects of vegetation or litter alone were consistently facilitative along the productivity gradient. Predominance of facilitative effects may be due to the focus on the seedling establishment phase.
   3 However, inclusion of indirect interactions and interaction modifications caused the net effects of both vegetation and litter to become largely negative, While one layer of biomass may be advantageous to ameliorate some moisture stress, the addition of another layer may be disadvantageous if this layer limits light proportionally more than it relieves moisture stress.
   4 One exception to this pattern occurred at high productivity when the net effect of vegetation, even in the presence of litter, remained facilitative. The net effect of vegetation was competitive at low productivity and grew increasingly facilitative with productivity. Thus, indirect effects of litter may alter interaction patterns across this gradient.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) provides unique possibilities to monitor peatland vegetation traits and their temporal dynamics at a fine spatial scale. Peatlands provide a vital contribution to ecosystem services by their massive carbon storage and wide heterogeneity. However, monitoring, understanding, and disentangling the diverse vegetation traits from a heterogeneous landscape using complex RS signal is challenging, due to its wide biodiversity and distinctive plant species composition. In this work, we aim to demonstrate, for the first time, the large heterogeneity of peatland vegetation traits using well-established vegetation indices (VIs) and Sun-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) for describing the spatial heterogeneity of the signals which may correspond to spatial diversity of biochemical and structural traits. SIF originates from the initial reactions in photosystems and is emitted at wavelengths between 650-780 nm, with the first peak at around 687 nm and the second peak around 760 nm. We used the first HyPlant airborne data set recorded over a heterogeneous peatland area and its surrounding ecosystems (i.e., forest, grassland) in Poland. We deployed a comparative analysis of SIF and VIs obtained from differently managed and natural vegetation ecosystems, as well as from diverse small-scale peatland plant communities. Furthermore, spatial relationships between SIF and VIs from large-scale vegetation ecosystems to small-scale peatland plant communities were examined. Apart from signal variations, we observed a positive correlation between SIF and greenness-sensitive VIs, whereas a negative correlation between SIF and a VI sensitive to photosynthesis was observed for large-scale vegetation ecosystems. In general, higher values of SIF were associated with higher biomass of vascular plants (associated with higher Leaf Area Index (LAI)). SIF signals, especially SIF760, were strongly associated with the functional diversity of the peatland vegetation. At the peatland area, higher values of SIF760 were associated with plant communities of high perennials, whereas, lower values of SIF760 indicated peatland patches dominated by Sphagnum. In general, SIF760 reflected the productivity gradient on the fen peatland, from Sphagnum-dominated patches with the lowest SIF and fAPAR values indicating lowest productivity to the Carex-dominated patches with the highest SIF and fAPAR values indicating highest productivity.

AB 1. The vascular flora of 65 raised bogs was determined across climatic gradients in eastern North America. The major geographic patterns in species richness and floristic composition were analysed using linear regression, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2. The vascular bog flora consists of 81 species in this region. Four major floristic regions distinguished by DCA correspond to the geographic zonation of bog land-forms. Each of these floristic regions is characterized by a different mean value for species richness.
   3. Raised bogs in the southern-continental floristic region (I) contain fewer than 20 species and have the most impoverished vascular floras in eastern North America. In the transitional-continental (II) and northern-continental (III) regions, the bog flora is slightly larger, although the mean number of species remains below 26.
   4. The richest bog floras are found in the maritime region (IV), where species richness declines along a latitudinal gradient from 50 species in the south (subregion IV.1) to 32 in the north (subregion IV.2).
   5. The relationship of species richness to various environmental factors was analysed using linear regression. The most important factors are mean annual precipitation (MAP) and annual freezing degree-days (FDD) with a base temperature of 0-degrees-C. Factors that are also significantly related to species richness are mean annual temperature (MA T), the number of wet-to-dry habitats, and the concentration of magnesium and sodium in the surface water. No significant relationship was found for growing degree-days (base temperature = 5-degrees-C.), mean annual snow depth, or spatial dimensions of bogs.
   6. The regressions indicate that a climatic threshold of 1000 mm of annual precipitation and 1000 freezing degree-days separates the floristically rich maritime bogs from the floristically impoverished bogs of northern and continental regions.
   7. The relative importance of these environmental factors is supported by CCA. In addition, the CCA ordination identifies two groups of species on the basis of their response to these environmental factors. Species that are generally restricted to the maritime region (IV) have weighted averages that are above average for MAP and MA T, but below average for FDD. Species that are common to all bogs or that are more continental in their distribution have the reverse relationship.
   8. The tolerance of the regional bog flora to the acidic, anoxic rooting zone changes across this climatic gradient. One third of the species that grow on bogs in the southern maritime region are restricted to fens or mineral uplands in continental or northern regions. This shift in ecological tolerance may be related to (i) slower rates of peat accumulation on the maritime bogs, (ii) longer time available for the evolution of local tolerant populations on maritime bogs, or (iii) a physiological adaptation to the maritime climate.

AB The transport and fate of mercury (Hg) was studied in two forest wetlands; a riparian peatland and an abandoned beaver meadow. The proportion of total mercury (THg) that was methyl mercury (% MeHg) increased from 2% to 6% from the upland inlets to the outlet of the wetlands. During the growing season, MeHg concentrations were approximately three times higher (0.27 ng/L) than values during the non-growing season (0.10 ng/L). Transport of Hg species was facilitated by DOC production as indicated by significant positive relations with THg and MeHg. Elevated concentrations of MeHg and % MeHg (as high as 70%) were found in pore waters of the riparian and beaver meadow wetlands. Groundwater interaction with the stream was limited at the riparian peatland due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the peat. The annual fluxes of THg and MeHg at the outlet of the watershed were 2.3 and 0.092 mu g/m(2) year respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are important sources of fluvial carbon. Previous research has shown that riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are largely controlled by soil type. However, there has been little work to establish the controls of riverine DOC within blanket peatlands that have not undergone major disturbance from drainage or burning. A total of 119 peatland catchments were sampled for riverine DOC and water colour across three drainage basins during six repeated sampling campaigns. The topographic characteristics of each catchment were determined from digital elevation models. The dominant vegetation cover was mapped using 0.5 m resolution colour infrared aerial images, with ground-truthed validation revealing 82% accuracy. Forward and backward stepwise regression modelling showed that mean slope was a strong (and negative) determinant of DOC and water colour in blanket peatland river waters. There was a weak role for plant functional type in determining DOC and water colour. At the basin scale, there were major differences between the models depending on the basin. The dominance of topographic predictors of DOC found in our study, combined with a weaker role of vegetation type, paves the way for developing improved planning tools for water companies operating in peatland catchments. Using topographic data and aerial imagery it will be possible to predict which tributaries will typically yield lower DOC concentrations and which are therefore more suitable and cost-effective as raw water intakes.

AB Peatlands, used for purification of mining waste waters, have shown efficient solid-phase sequestration of contaminants such as arsenic (As). However, contaminant re-mobilization may occur related to management changes or chemical alteration of original peatland conditions. For a treatment peatland in Finnish Lapland, we here confirm efficient As retention in near-surface peat layers close to the mining waste water inflow, likely due to binding to Fe-III-phases. Seven years into operation of the treatment peatland, there appears to be further retention potential, as large areas downstreamstill had solid-phase As concentrations at background levels. However, via depth-resolved pore water analysis we observed a hotspot 170 m from the inflow at 10-50 cm depth, where As pore water concentrations exceeded input concentrations by a factor of 20, indicating substantial As re-mobilization. At the same spot, a peak of reduced sulfur (S) species was found. Arsenic species detected were arsenite and up to 26% methylated oxyarsenates, 15% methylated and 7.9% inorganic thioarsenates. We postulate that As mobilization is a result of short-term re-equilibration to a changed inflow chemistry after installation of a process water treatment plant and a long-term consequence of changing pore water pH from acidic to near-neutral, releasing reduced S and As. We infer that the co-occurrence of reduced S and As leads to formation of methylated and/or thiolated As species with known low sorption affinity, thereby further enhancing As mobility. Laboratory incubation studies with two peat cores confirmed a high S-induced As mobilization potential, especially when As-Fe-rich, oxic surface layers were incubated anoxically at near-neutral pH. Highest risk of As re-mobilization from this treatment peatland is expected in a scenario in which mining waste water inflow has stopped but the peatland remains flooded, and near-surface layers transition from oxic to anoxic conditions.

AB The global increase in atmospheric nitrogen deposition leads to changes in decomposition activity, which has been observed especially in nutrient-limited bog ecosystems relying on atmospheric inputs as the sole source of external nutrients. We conducted a reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment in two bogs in central Europe to test the effects of Sphagnum species (S. fallax, S. magellanicum, S. rubellum/russowii, cellulose strips as controls), material origin and the environment on Sphagnum decomposition and related nutrient release. Cellulose, but not Sphagnum biomass, decomposed more rapidly in the warmer and nitrogen-richer conditions of the suboceanic Jizera Mts. than in the subcontinental Jeseniky Mts. In the Sphagnum biomass transplants, interspecific differences in decomposition overruled the effects of both the origin of the material and the environment of the decomposition site, with S. magellanicum decomposing the slowest. Possible relationships between decomposition rates and recent changes in Sphagnum species composition in N-polluted bogs are discussed.

ID HERCYNIAN BASEMENT; MONTES
AB We have limited knowledge about the biodiversity and vulnerability of peatlands in the lower-altitude mountains of the Iberian Peninsula, largely because peatlands have not been routinely differentiated from other habitat types in Spain. Understanding is now developing about the ecology of peatlands in central Spain, but they are already under severe threat of conversion and degradation. In this article we describe the results of a field survey and literature review study to characterise and describe the current condition of peatlands in the Toledo Mountains in terms of their typology, the representation of habitat types protected by European (EU) designations, threats, endangered plant species, and conservation status. Our results suggest that the principal threats are overgrazing by domestic animals and ungulates (red deer and wild boar), fire, expansion of cereal crops, drying-out and erosion. Disturbance is most severe in areas that are not protected by nature conservation designations, where peatlands are especially vulnerable to damage arising from human activities.

AB This study concerns the mass balance in hummocks and hollows on three ombrotrophic boreonemoral bogs in both a short (ca 10 yr) and long (1000 yr) time scale. Nitrogen,C-14, and 10Pb are used to establish detailed time scales and to estimate productivity and decay losses in four different microtopographical units: hummocks with either. Sphagnum or lichens and hollows with either Sphagnum lawns or bare hollows. The accumulation of N and Pb-210 was greater in hummocks than in hollows. The litter input was higher in Sphagnum hummocks (170 = 210 g m (-2) yr (-1)) than in lawns (110-145 g m (= 2) yr (= 1)) while its decay rate (0.011 = 0.014 yr (1)) did not differ. The arotelm was deeper in Sphagnum hummocks than in lawns but because of less compaction in lawns, neither residence time (80 = 100 yr) nor decay losses (70-75%) differed. Productivity in lichen hummocks and bare hollows was insignificant and the mass balance negative. It is concluded that the higher productivity in Sphagnum hummocks maintains the, microtopography on the mire surface. The mass balance in hummocks will determine not only the development in hollows bur also the rise of the ground water mound, and the height increment of a bog. The addition of mass to the catotelm has generally been less in hollows than in hummocks. Since 800 BP the overall input to the catotelm has decreased from about 150 to < 50 g m (= 210) yr (= 1) due to longer residence time increasing losses through decay in the acrotelm from < 20% to 70% and is the result of either climatic changes or autogenic processes in the bog ecosystem. Before recent centuries the whole bog surface must have been covered with Sphagnum mosses. forming an overall input of litter as large as in the recent Sphagnum hummocks and lawns. Due to the present lesser cover of peat forming mosses (20-50% of the surface). the recent overall input of peat-forming litter is only 50-65 g m (- 2) yr (- 1). The bogs no longer act as sinks for cal bun since the input of carbon only just covers the losses as CH4 and CO2.

AB The chemical composition and mineral inclusions in peats and the underlying soils of the eutrophic Obskoye fen (Western Siberia, Tomsk Region) are studied. The basic pattern of a change in the mineralogical and geochemical conditions at depth consists in domination of hydroxides on top of the peat deposit and sulfides at the bottom. The geochemical reduction barrier is formed at the bottom of the peat deposit. Its functioning is related to increased concentrations of U and Hg. The markedly pronounced influence exerted by sewage discharge is associated with an increase in the Na concentration in acid extracts from peats and additional accumulation of the mixture of suspended, colloidal, and dissolved forms of some metals in the boggy environment.

TI Effect of Carex rostrata on seasonal and interannual variability in

AB Peatlands are a large natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4), and the sedge Carex rostrata plays a critical role in the production, oxidation, and transport of CH4 in these systems. This 4 year clipping experiment examined the changes in CH4 emissions from a temperate peatland after removing all aboveground C. rostrata biomass. Methane fluxes, dissolved CH4, and environmental variables were measured during spring, summer, and fall from 2008 to 2011. Clipping and removing the C. rostrata leaves and stems caused an immediate decrease in CH4 emissions that persisted over 4 years of this study. There was a strong seasonal trend in CH4 flux, with the largest treatment effects occurring during the fall months when the sedges were senescing. As expected, there was a strong positive correlation between C. rostrata green-leaf area and CH4 flux, implying that the presence of C. rostrata increases CH4 emissions from this peatland. Large interannual variability in vegetation distribution and biomass, water table depth, and temperature was observed in this study, indicating the importance of multiyear studies for understanding the interactions among these factors to determine how they could be incorporated into biogeochemical models to predict CH4 emissions under changing environmental conditions.
   Key Points
   Clipping aboveground sedge biomass decreases methane emissions from wetlands Carex rostrata has greatest impact on methane emissions during fall senescence

AB Peatlands represent the largest natural terrestrial carbon (C) store, however, this C can become destabilized, particularly in response to anthropogenic disturbance or lowering of the water table. Several different paradigms have been proposed to explain the positive or negative relationships of moisture status with C loss rates in peat soils (e.g. 'enzyme latch', 'iron gate'). The relative importance of these regulatory mechanisms and whether they are mutually exclusive, however, remain unknown. To address this, we evaluated the effects of contrasting soil moisture regime and iron concentration on organic matter mineralization in an agriculturally managed lowland fen peat. Our results showed that for the first 50 days of incubation, phenol oxidative activity under saturated conditions (120% water holding capacity; WHC) was lower than that at 65% WHC, but after this period the pattern was reversed. These results suggest that two different mechanisms may control phenol oxidative activity simultaneously, with the dominant controlling factor and final response being dependent on the trade-offs between oxygen and Fe(II) effects. Although Fe(II) addition increased phenol oxidative activity, it suppressed SOC mineralization regardless of the soil moisture content, suggesting that iron can protect soil C from microbial decomposition in lowland peat soils. Our study has implications for understanding the widely divergent bio-geochemical functions of soil moisture on peat soils and emphasizes the influence of oxygen and Fe(II) on phenol oxidative activity and SOC mineralization.

TI Halogen retention, organohalogens, and the role of organic matter
   decomposition on halogen enrichment in two Chilean peat bogs

AB Natural formation of organohalogen compounds can be shown to occur in all natural environments. Peat bogs, which are built up exclusively of organic matter and cover approximately 3% of the total continental world area, are potentially significant reservoirs for organohalogen formation. Up to now, fluxes and retention rates of halogens and organohalogen formation in peat bogs were mostly unquantified. In our study, we investigated the retention of atmospheric derived halogens and the natural formation of organohalogens by differential halogen analysis in two peat bogs in southernmost Chile. Atmospheric wet deposition rates of chlorine, bromine, and iodine range between 600 and 36000, 6 and 160, and 1 and 3 mg m(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Mean annual net accumulation rates of these halogens in peat are calculated to be 12-72 mg of Cl m(-2), 1.7-12 mg of Br m(-2), and 0.4-1.2 mg of l m(-2). Retention rates are similarly high for iodine (36-46%) and bromine (7.5-50%), and substantially lower for chlorine (0.22%). To evaluate influences of peat decomposition processes on halogen enrichment, halogen concentrations were compared to carbon/nitrogen ratios (C/N). Our results indicate that up to 95% of chlorine, 91% of bromine, and 81% of iodine in peat exist in an organically bound form. The results also indicate that the concentrations of halogens, especially of bromine and iodine,in peat are largely determined by peat decomposition processes and that halogens are not conservative in bogs.

AB Purpose CH4 emissions from peatlands are space and time dependent. The variety of efflux routes contributes to these variabilities. CH4 bubbling remains difficult to investigate since it occurs on a timescale of seconds. The aims of this study were to use for the first time the recently built infrared high-resolution spectrometer, SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Tropospherique to (1) measure in situ CH4 fluxes in natural and artificial peatland plot and (2) observe online bubbling events with quantification of CH4 emission fluxes corresponding to this very sudden degassing event.
   Material and methods The closed dynamic chamber method was used and the gas concentration was measured every 1.5 s. Emission fluxes were calculated by the accumulation rate of CH4 against time. Measurements were undertaken during daytime in March 2009 and during day-and nighttime in May 2009, in Sphagnum and Betula plots and in a wet artificially bared peat area with Eriophorum vaginatum.
   Results and discussion The results show that the CH4 emissions estimated with the SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Tropospherique (SPIRIT) are consistent with those already published. The high emissions, both through diffusion and bubbling in the Eriophorum plot, were on the same order as the emissions estimated in natural shallow pools. During daytime, CH4 bubbling was higher in May (54.7% of the total emission) than in March (40.7%) probably because of increased CH4 production and accumulation in peat. In May, bubbling was higher at nighttime (65.5%) than in daytime (54.7%). This has an important implication for carbon budget assessment in peatlands.
   Conclusions The recently built infrared spectrometer, SPIRIT, was able to reliably measure CH4 fluxes and quantify CH4 flux during the degassing of bubbles. The emissions obtained are in agreement with previously published data using other measurement techniques. The results of this preliminary work highlight (1) the importance of shallow pools in peatland CH4 emissions and (2) the sensitivity of such fluxes to atmospheric pressure, a relation that has not been fully investigated or taken into account in assessing peatland carbon balance.

AB To assess the effects of global change on peatland vegetation and biogeochemistry we used a long term (21 years) in-situ plot scale manipulation experiment comprising nitrogen (N; ambient and 30 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), temperature (T; ambient and + 3.6 degrees C during growing season) and sulfur (S; ambient and 20 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) treatments in an oligotrophic boreal peatland. Vegetation was assessed by plant species cover estimates, while biogeochemical processes were characterized by measuring potential extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) of glucosidase, cellulase, aminopeptidase, phosphatase, and sulfatase in the peat matrix. We hypothesized that the plant communities would change in response to the N and T manipulations, and that belowground EEA would respond distinctively to the applied treatments as well as to changes in plant community. We found vascular plant cover to have strongly increased in the T treatment, whereas theSphagnumcover collapsed in the high N treatment. Belowground we found enhanced enzymatic C and N acquisition activity in response to the N treatment, but EEA showed no response to the T treatment. No S effects were found, neither aboveground nor belowground. Contrary to our expectations, our data reveal a mismatch between above-ground vegetation patterns and belowground decomposition processes. In particular, the large increase in vascular plant cover in the warming treatment found no reflection in belowground EEA.

DE Cuscuta; Hungary; host species
AB Hitherto eight Cuscuta species (C. lupuliformis Krock., C. australis R.Br., C. campestris Yuncker, C. epilinum Weihe, C. europaea L., C. approximata Bab., C. kotschyi Desmoul., C. epithymum (L.) Nath.) have been recorded in Hungary.
   In our surveys C. campestris, C epithymum and C europaea showed to be the most frequent. C epilinum is supposedly extinct. C australis and C lupuliformis have only a few recent data. C. approximata has been recorded as a new element.
   Up until the middle of the 20(th) century dodders used to cause severe damage to agriculture, this effect has completely disappeared lately though. Now C campestris occurs in great quantities on the edge of roads and agricultural fields, C. europaea along streams and wet ditches. C. epithymum is widespread on mesophilous meadows and pastures, C. kotschyi in dry grasslands. C. australis occurs in extensive large sedge vegetation, swamps and fens. C lupuliformis, though getting rare, is a characteristic species of floodplains, while C approximata is found in acidophilous oakwoods.
   Compiling the host spectra of the different Cuscuta species based on herbaria, literature and our own observations revealed that these plants parasitize at minimum 12% of the vascular plants in Hungary (approx. 2500 species altogether). The rarer the plant, the narrower is the host spectrum of the species. C. epithymum has the widest host spectrum, while C approximata, known only at two locations, has the narrowest.

TI Assessing the reliability of peatland GPP measurements by remote

AB Estimates of peatland carbon fluxes based on remote sensing data are a useful addition to monitoring methods in these remote and precious ecosystems, but there are questions as to whether large-scale estimates are reliable given the small-scale heterogeneity of many peatlands. Our objective was to consider the reliability of models based on Earth Observations for estimating ecosystem photosynthesis at different scales using the Forsinard Flows RSPB reserve in Northern Scotland as our study site. Three sites across the reserve were monitored during the growing season of 2017. One site is near-natural blanket bog, and the other two are at different stages of the restoration process after removal of commercial conifer forestry. At each site we measured small (flux chamber) and landscape scale (eddy covariance) CO2 fluxes, small scale spectral data using a handheld spectrometer, and obtained corresponding satellite data from MODIS. The variables influencing GPP at small scale, including microforms and dominant vegetation species, were assessed using exploratory factor analysis. A GPP model using land surface temperature and a measure of greenness from remote sensing data was tested and compared to chamber and eddy covariance CO2 fluxes; this model returned good results at all scales (Pearson's correlations of 0.57 to 0.71 at small scale, 0.76 to 0.86 at large scale). We found that the effect of microtopography on GPP fluxes at the study sites was spatially and temporally inconsistent, although connected to water content and vegetation species. The GPP fluxes measured using EC were larger than those using chambers at all sites, and the reliability of the TG model at different scales was dependent on the measurement methods used for calibration and validation. This suggests that GPP measurements from remote sensing are robust at all scales, but that the methods used for calibration and validation will impact accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI Impact of Groundwater Table and Plateau Zokors (Myospalax baileyi) on

AB Peatlands contain large amount of carbon stock that is vulnerable to release into the atmosphere. Mostly because of human impact, the peatlands at Zoige Wetlands face severe degradation, and the groundwater table is now lower than before, which has increased the population of the plateau zokor, a burrowing rodent. However, the impact of these changes on ecosystem carbon flows has not been studied. To investigate how the plateau zokor and the groundwater level alter the ecosystem respiration of the Zoige peatlands, we sampled the CO2 flux of hummocks shaped by the zokors and compared it with the CO2 flux of undisturbed sites with different groundwater table levels. The soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature at 5 cm (T-5) were measured. SOC showed no significant difference among the four sampling sites and did not correlate with the CO2 flux, while SWC was found to partly determine the CO2 flux. A linear equation could adequately describe the relationship between the natural logarithm of the ecosystem respiration and the soil temperature. It is demonstrated that descending groundwater table might accelerate ecosystem respiration and the CO2 flux from hummocks was higher than the CO2 flux from the control site in the non-growing season. With rising temperature, the CO2 flux from the control site accelerated faster than that from the hummocks. Our results show that ecosystem respiration was significantly lower from hummocks than at the control site in the growing season. The results on the impact of zokors on greenhouse gas emissions presented in this paper provide a useful reference to help properly manage not only this, but other litter-burrowing mammals at peatland sites.

AB Peatlands contain a large portion of Earth's terrestrial soil organic matter in part due to a reduction in decomposition rates. Organic matter decomposition is initially mediated by extracellular enzyme activity, which is in turn controlled by temperature, moisture, and substrate availability; and all are subject to seasonal variation. As depth increases in peatlands, temperature variability and labile carbon inputs decrease. We hypothesized that the more stable recalcitrant subsurface would contain a smaller less diverse enzyme pool, that is better adapted to a narrow temperature range. Thus temperature dependence would be diminished at depth compared to superficial peat. Potential enzyme activity rates were determined across seasons and with depth in peat samples collected from the Marcell Experimental Forest in northern Minnesota, USA. The temperature dependence, assessed by activation energy, was quantified for three hydrolytic enzymes involved in nutrient cycling at up to 15 temperature points ranging from 2 degrees C to 65 degrees C. Potential enzyme activity decreased with peat depth as expected and corresponded with changes in peat composition and microbial biomass from the acrotelm to the catotelm. In an environmentally relevant temperature range (2-23 degrees C), activation energy decreased with depth for beta-glucosidase as predicted and leucine amino peptidase activation energy was the lowest of all enzymes. Stable temperatures at depth appear to result in a microbial community containing enzymes that have lower sensitivity to temperature increases. Surprisingly, there was no significant seasonal effect on enzyme temperature dependence observed in our study. Based on these results, and without shifts in microbial community composition, warming of peat could result in increased carbon and phosphorus cycling at the surface but little change at depth. Additionally differences in enzyme temperature sensitivity suggest nitrogen cycling could remain constant with warming, potentially resulting in proteolytic nitrogen cycling being decoupled from carbon and phosphorus cycling.

AB The fate of the Rare Earth Elements (REE) were investigated in different types of archives of atmospheric deposition in the Black Forest, Southern Germany: (1) a 70 cm snow pack collected on the domed part of a raised bog and representing 2 months of snow accumulation, (2) a snow sample collected close to the road about 500 m from the peat bog, (3) two species of lichens and (4) a peat profile representing 400 years of peat accumulation as well as a "preanthropogenic" sample and the living moss layer from the top of the core. REE concentrations in peat are significantly correlated to Ti which is a lithogenic conservative element suggesting that REE are immobile in peat bog environments. Snow, lichens and peat samples show similar PAAS (Post Archean Australian Shale) normalized REE distributions suggesting that the complete atmospheric REE signal is preserved in the peat profile. However, the annual flux of REE accumulated by the peat is ca. 10 times greater than that of the bulk winter flux of REE. This difference probably indicates that the REE concentrations in the snowpack are not representative of the average REE flux over the whole year. Despite the pronounced geological differences between this site (granite host-rock) and a previously studied peat bog in Switzerland (limestone host-rock) similar REE distribution patterns and accumulation rates were found at both sites. Given that both sites confirm an Upper Continental Crust signature, the data suggests both sites are influenced by regional and not local, soil-derived lithogenic aerosols. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sulfate Pollution of lakes and rivers is recognized as a serious problem in many regions of Central Europe, thus we evaluated the role of rewetted fens in Mitigating sulfate Pollution and tested if high sulfate concentrations in fen-feeding water counteract the re-establishment of their function as sinks for phosphorus (P). A long-term incubation experiment was conducted with highly decomposed peat from upper soil layers of fens that have been rewetted for 1 to 15 years, Periodic sulfate pulses to inundated peat mesocosms, equating to an annual loading of 50 g S m(-2) induced significant changes of sulfate consumption and phosphorus mobilization. Sulfate consumption of highly decomposed peat from all sampling sites was related to sulfate concentrations in overlying water (linear regression, p < 0.01). Sulfate additions also led to significant increases of P concentrations or P mobilization in peat porewater (t test, p < 0.05) and P concentrations in the overlying water were 2-3 times higher than in non-treated controls. In conclusion, rewetting of fens is an important tool to mitigate Sulfate Pollution of adjacent lakes and rivers. However, an elevated sulfate concentration in waters feeding the fen impairs P retention and increases P losses to adjacent surface waters.

AB This in situ study assesses the long term sorption of I in a natural peat bog, a matter that is scarcely addressed but required for safety studies such as for radioactive waste disposal. Fifteen years after the artificial contamination of a boreal peat bog, the groundwater (piezometers), the peat and the vegetation were resampled to determine I distribution with comparison to the initial situation (1989). Spectroscopic analyses (SS-NMR, electronic microscopy and EDX spectroscopy) were carried out on the peat solids to identify the sorption processes. Over the past 15 a the I has been spreading mostly outwards and possibly upwards in the groundwater. Sorption of I is higher at the surface of the bog (K-d = 37.6 L kg(-1)) than at the bottom (K-d = 5.1 L kg(-1)), and this is attributed to the oxic/anoxic conditions of the peat layers. The average surface K-d values showed more than a 2-fold increase after 15 a. TEM-EDX analyses of the surface peat showed here for the first time that I was only associated with natural polyphenolic substances contained in humified plant tissues. Plants growing in the bog have not taken up much I with the exception of sedge species ([1](sedge leaves) is up to 283 mg kg(-1)). (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Influence of season and frequency of fire on Henslow's sparrows
   (Ammodramus henslowii) wintering on Gulf Coast pitcher plant bogs
SO AUK
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION; GRASSLAND; COMPETITION
AB Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) is a grassland bird that has suffered drastic population declines for over 30 years. Declining populations can be largely attributed to loss of breeding habitat, but loss of wintering habitat associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) communities, especially pitcher plant (Sarracenia spp.) bogs, along the Gulf Coast also may be a contributing factor. Fire is critical for restoration and conservation of remaining longleaf pine communities, but the influence of fire on wintering Henslow's Sparrows has not been evaluated. We examined the influence of season and frequency (time since burning) of fire on use of pitcher plant bogs by Henslow's Sparrows wintering in the Conecuh National Forest, Alabama, and Blackwater River State Forest, Florida, during winters of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. Density of Henslow's Sparrows was greatest on bogs the first winter after burning. Although significant effects for season of burning were not found, bogs burned during winter typically hosted Henslow's Sparrows for only one winter, whereas bogs burned during the growing season hosted sparrows for at least three winters. Growing-season fires may be more beneficial than dormant-season fires and will prevent forced abandonment of bogs burned during winter. Frequency of seed stalks of grasses and density of forbs were the most influential vegetation parameters affecting occurrence of Henslow's Sparrows at pitcher plant bogs. Henslow's Sparrows were found on bogs as small as 0.06 ha, but were found on bogs >0.25 ha more frequently than on smaller bogs. We conclude that burning pitcher plant bogs on an annual or biennial basis during the growing season will maximize the benefits to both wintering Henslow's Sparrows and the host of other organisms associated with those unique communities.

AB Differently directed and heterochronous cryogenic processes have contributed to the contrasting soil cover patterns and spatial heterogeneity of the properties of soils in hydromorphic ecosystems of the discontinuous permafrost zone of the northern taiga in Western Siberia. Frost heave and permafrost thawing within ecosystems of highmoor bogs have led to the development of specific cryogenic landforms, such as flat-topped and large peat mounds. A set of cryogenic soils is developed in these ecosystems; it includes different variants of cryozems, gleyzems (Cryosols), and peat soils (Histosols). The distribution of these soil types is controlled by the local topography and thawing depth, other factors being insignificant. Alternation of peat horizons of different types and ages, whirl-like patterns of horizon boundaries, considerable variations in the thickness of soil horizons, and inversions of soil horizons under the impact of frost cracking, frost heave, and cryoturbation are typical of the considered soils. Thawing depth is the most significant factor affecting the thickness of organic horizons, the soil pH, and the degree of decomposition of peat. As a result of the upward movement of bog ecosystems under the impact of frost heave, peat soils are subjected to considerable transformation: peat horizons undergo mineralization, and the thickness of organic horizons decreases; in some cases, eluvial-illuvial differentiation of the mineral horizons takes place, and peat podzols are developed. However, the opposite process of the return of the soils to the bog stage of pedogenesis with peat accumulation may take place in any time in the case of activation of thermokarst processes.

AB Rhizospheric methane oxidation was evaluated at a Carex (spp.) dominated fen in Alberta, Canada over three growing seasons. Aerobic incubations of bulk peat and live roots in the laboratory show a clear association between active methane oxidizing bacteria and the rhizosphere. Aerobic incubations also show an oxidation potential that far exceeds methane production potential measured in the laboratory. Quantitative estimates of how this oxidation potential is expressed in situ depend strongly on which of two common approaches are used. (1) Subtracting in situ methane emission rates from methane production rates measured in the laboratory with anaerobic incubations suggest that methane oxidation may attenuate emissions by 58 to 92%. (2) Applying the inhibitor methyl fluoride (CH3F) to whole plants in situ suggest methane oxidation attenuates emissions by less than 20% seasonally. The production minus emission technique likely overestimates methane oxidation because methane production measured via anaerobic incubations in the laboratory are probably overestimates. Oxidation percentages measured by CH3F were greatest early in the growing season when emission rates were low and fell to almost nondetectable levels as emission rates peaked in late summer. Estimates provided by the CH3F technique were generally in better agreement with estimates of oxidation based on a stable isotope mass balance (0-34%) determined in a companion study (Popp et al. 1999).

TI Time, Hydrologic Landscape, and the Long-Term Storage of Peatland Carbon
   in Sedimentary Basins
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
LA English
DT Article
DE carbon; hydrologic landscape; peat; sedimentary basin; time
AB Peatland carbon may enter long-term storage in sedimentary basins preserved as either coal or lignite. The time required to account for the carbon in 1-10 m thick coal seams must represent 10(5)-10(6) years, an order of magnitude more than previously assumed. To understand the process by which this happens requires extrapolation of our understanding of peatland carbon accumulation over timescales that greatly exceed those of Holocene peat. We analyze the consequences of extrapolating peat growth to periods of 10(6) years. We deduce that that key to sustained peat growth are hydrologic landscapes that can maintain a saturated peat body above the level of clastic deposition. Contrary to current stratigraphic frameworks, we conclude that the generation of accommodation space at low rates of 0.1-0.2 mm/yr can adequately accommodate thick peat accumulation over periods >10(5) years. However, generation of accommodation space at rates >0.5 mm/yr cannot. The low rates that permit accommodation of thick peat are typical of the rates of subsidence in specific tectonic settings, particularly foreland basins, and this has implications for our understanding of the links between terrestrial carbon burial, tectonics and the carbon cycle. The long-term stability of extensive peatland required to form coal also requires sediment bypass, modifying basin wide sediment transport and deposition. Limits to peatland growth under very low accommodation rates must exist but the relative importance of the limiting process is not understood. Finally, we discuss the consequences of these factors for predicting the future of the peatland carbon reservoir.

TI Microscopic charcoal and tar (CHAT) particles in peat: a 6500-year
   record of palaeo-fires in southern Sweden
SO MIRES AND PEAT
LA English
DT Article
DE charcoal and tar particle classification; fire frequency; late and
   middle Holocene
AB Peat stratigraphies of eleven raised bogs in southern Sweden were investigated. Measurements included the occurrence of charcoal and various tar particles. Most of the particles found were microscopic, i.e. 5-100 mu m in diameter. Two distinctly different groups of particles were distinguished: (A) charred fragments of plant tissue and (B) objects formed from tar, which were classified into five sub-groups on the basis of morphology. Both charcoal and tar are indicative of mire and forest fires. We suggest that it is possible to use the different groups of particles as fire regime indicators. Hence, the high frequency of charcoal and tar (CHAT) in the lower parts of the stratigraphies, i.e. in the lower strongly decomposed fen and carr peats that were formed before ca. 4000 cal C-14 BP, could be indicative of intense and frequent local fires. The decreasing abundance of CHAT and the lower relative share of Type A particles within the lower strongly decomposed Sphagnum peat ca. 4000-2500 cal C-14 BP signify a transition from local to regional fires. With a few exceptions, the uppermost weakly decomposed ombrotrophic peats formed after ca. 2500 cal C-14 BP, in which both charcoal and tar are rare, indicate a period of low fire frequency at both local and regional scales. There is no regional variation in the lower material, and it seems that wildfires were common phenomena throughout southern Sweden during the first few thousand years after peat formation began 6-8000 years ago. From a climatological point of view, the mass occurrence of CHAT in the lower parts of the profiles indicates a warm and dry Mid Holocene with frequent and widespread wildfires, and a moist and cool Late Holocene with more sporadic fires. Spectral analysis of the entire dataset shows significant periodicities of 610, 70, 30, 21, 17 and 14 years, the two most significant being 14 and 70 years.

AB The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) drives the carbon (C) sink-source strength of northern peatlands. Since NEE represents a balance between various production and respiration fluxes, accurate predictions of its response to global changes require an in depth understanding of these underlying processes. Currently, however, detailed information of the temporal dynamics as well as the separate biotic and abiotic controls of the NEE component fluxes is lacking in peatland ecosystems. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using an automated chamber system established across natural and trenching/vegetation removal plots to partition NEE into its production (i.e., gross and net primary production; GPP and NPP) and respiration (i.e., ecosystem, heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration; ER, Rh and Ra) fluxes in a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results showed that daily NEE patterns were driven by GPP while variations in ER were governed by Ra rather than Rh. Moreover, we observed pronounced seasonal shifts in the Ra/Rh and above/belowground NPP ratios throughout the main phenological phases. Generalized linear model analysis revealed that the greenness index derived from digital images (as a proxy for plant phenology) was the strongest control of NEE, GPP and NPP while explaining considerable fractions also in the variations of ER and Ra. In addition, our data exposed greater temperature sensitivity of NPP compared to Rh resulting in enhanced C sequestration with increasing temperature. Overall, our study suggests that the temporal patterns in NEE and its component fluxes are tightly coupled to vegetation dynamics in boreal peatlands and thus challenges previous studies that commonly identify abiotic factors as key drivers. These findings further emphasize the need for integrating detailed information on plant phenology into process-based models to improve predictions of global change impacts on the peatland C cycle.

AB Root exudates and litter are the main sources of inputs of labile carbon into the microbial pool in successional ecosystems. Here we studied whether typical pioneer species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium and Calluna vulgaris) alter the functional response of the microbial community of a previously cutover peatland. Peat was sampled at three depths (0-5, 20-25 and 40-45 cm) from beneath these species and from bare soil areas. MicroResp analysis using ecologically relevant, radiolabelled, carbon sources showed significant separation in community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of soil microorganisms according to peat depth. This effect was also reflected in microbial biomass carbon, which also decreased with increasing depth. Furthermore, distinct differences in CLPP were observed between the three plant species and the bare soil in the absence of an effect on microbial biomass carbon or total soil carbon. The plant species effects were driven by differential utilisation of xylose, glutamic acid, lysine and phenylethylamine. The data suggest that 'new' carbon inputs from plants colonising abandoned cutover peatland may support communities of microorganisms that have functionally distinct roles in carbon turnover.

AB Short-term effects of lime application on a 9-year-old Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.)) stand planted on a deep blanket peat soil were investigated. Ground limestone was applied at three rates: 7.5 (L-1), 15.0 (L-2) and 22.5 t ha(-1) (L-3) Plus a control (L-0). The peat was sampled on the first and second growing seasons after lime application. Soil properties were examined for the litter layer and three depths of the peat profile at 5 cm intervals, while fine root (<2 mm in diameter) characteristics were examined for the litter layer and top 5 cm of the peat profile. Soil water pH and minerals were determined for the second growing season only. Liming decreased the concentration of N in the litter layer and top 10 cm of the peat profile at the first growing season. In contrast, concentration of this element in the litter layer and top 15 cm of the peat profile was increased by liming at the second growing season. Concentration of C in the liner and below-litter layers was unaffected by liming on both sampling occasions. Lime application increased the soil water pH and concentrations of P, Ca, B and NH4+-N in the soil water. Concentration of Mg in the soil water was increased by liming only for the L-2 and L-3 plots. The soil water had a high concentration of NO3--N in the L-1 plots and low concentrations of Cu and NO3--N in the L-3 plots compared with unlimed plots. Mean fine-root dry weight and length were 0.21 g l(-1) and 177 cm l(-1), respectively. Dead fine roots were present in small amounts and only in limed plots at the first growing season. Distribution of fine roots was restricted to the litter layer and the top 5 cm of the peat profile with the majority in the litter layer. Fine-root dry weight was unaffected by liming at the first growing season, but increased by 40, 93 and 127 per cent in the L-1, L-2 and L-3 plots, respectively, at the second growing season. Fine-root length in the L-1 plots was 36 per cent lower than that in the L-0 plots at the first growing season. Length of fine roots was increased by 93, 131 and 137 per cent in the L-1, L-2 and L-3 plots, respectively, at the second growing season. The L-1 Plots had a low number of long root tips (>1 cm in length) in the litter layer compared with the L-0 plots at the first growing season, while numbers of short (<1 cm in length) and long root tips were increased by liming at the second growing season. Number of root tips per fine root length (no. cm(-1)) in the litter layer and number of total root tips per root length were increased in the L-1 and L-2 plots. Concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg in the live fine roots were increased by liming at the first growing season. Liming increased the concentration of Ca and decreased the concentrations of Mn and Al in live fine roots at the second growing season. It seems that fine-root minerals are changed by liming and Such changes are dependent on the time interval following lime application to the peat soil.

AB Natural wetland excluding lake and floodplain in China at present covers an area of around 94, 000 km(2) and are mainly located in Qinghai-Tibet Highland (similar to50%) and northeast China (similar to30%), which can be divided into the peatlands (similar to42,000 km(2)), freshwater marsh (similar to25,000 km(2)), swamp (similar to2,500 km(2)), and salt marsh (-24,000 km(2)). The CH4 flux measured in 2001 and 2002 from the peatland in Qinghai-Tibet Highland and the freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain ranged from 0.16 to 10.0 and 1.18 to 54.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and averaged 2.96 and 19.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively.

AB Rates of organic matter mineralization in peatlands, and hence production of the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2, are highly dependent on the distribution of oxygen in the pear. Using laboratory incubations of peat, we investigated the sensitivity of the anoxic production of CH4 and CO2 to a transient oxic period of a few weeks' duration. Production rates during 3 successive anoxic periods were compared with rates in samples incubated in the presence of oxygen during the second period. In surface peat (5-10-cm depth), with an initially high level of CH4 production, oxic conditions during period 2 did not result in a lower potential CH4 production rate during period 3, although production was delayed similar to 1 week. In permanently anoxic, deep peat (50-55-cm depth) with a comparatively low initial production of CH4, oxic conditions during period 2 resulted in zero production of CH4 during period 3. Thus, the methanogens in surface peat-but not in deep pear-remained viable after several weeks of oxic conditions. In contrast to CH4 production, the oxic period had a negligible effect on anoxic CO2 production during period 3, in surface as well as deep pear. In both surface and deep pear, CO2 production was several times higher render oxic than under anoxic conditions. However for the first 2 weeks of oxic conditions, CO2 production in the deep pear was very low. Still, deep pear obviously contained facultative microorganisms that, after a relatively short period, were able to maintain a considerably higher rare of organic matter mineralization under oxic than under anoxic conditions.

AB Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores. Restoration of degraded peatlands to restore ecosystem services is a major area of conservation effort. Monitoring is crucial to judge the success of this restoration. Remote sensing is a potential tool to provide landscape-scale information on the habitat condition. Using an empirical modelling approach, this paper aims to use airborne hyperspectral image data with ground vegetation survey data to model vegetation abundance for a degraded upland blanket bog in the United Kingdom (UK), which is undergoing restoration. A predictive model for vegetation abundance of Plant Functional Types (PFT) was produced using a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and applied to the whole restoration site. A sensitivity test on the relationships between spectral data and vegetation abundance at PFT and single species level confirmed that PFT was the correct scale for analysis. The PLSR modelling allows selection of variables based upon the weighted regression coefficient of the individual spectral bands, showing which bands have the most influence on the model. These results suggest that the SWIR has less value for monitoring peatland vegetation from hyperspectral images than initially predicted. RMSE values for the validation data range between 10% and 16% cover, indicating that the models can be used as an operational tool, considering the subjective nature of existing vegetation survey results. These predicted coverage images are the first quantitative landscape scale monitoring results to be produced for the site. High resolution hyperspectral mapping of PFTs has the potential to assess recovery of peatland systems at landscape scale for the first time.

AB Atmospheric deposition is the most important pathway by which Hg reaches marine ecosystems, where it can be methylated and enter the base of food chain. The deposition, transport and chemical interactions of atmospheric Hg have been simulated over Europe for the year 2013 in the framework of the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project, performing 14 different model sensitivity tests using two high-resolution three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs), varying the anthropogenic emission datasets, atmospheric Br input fields, Hg oxidation schemes and modelling domain boundary condition input. Sensitivity simulation results were compared with observations from 28 monitoring sites in Europe to assess model performance and particularly to analyse the influence of anthropogenic emission speciation and the Hg-(g)(0) atmospheric oxidation mechanism. The contribution of anthropogenic Hg emissions, their speciation and vertical distribution are crucial to the simulated concentration and deposition fields, as is also the choice of Hg-(g)(0) oxidation pathway. The areas most sensitive to changes in Hg emission speciation and the emission vertical distribution are those near major sources, but also the Aegean and the Black seas, the English Channel, the Skagerrak Strait and the northern German coast. Considerable influence was found also evident over the Mediterranean, the North Sea and Baltic Sea and some influence is seen over continental Europe, while this difference is least over the north-western part of the modelling domain, which includes the Norwegian Sea and Iceland. The Br oxidation pathway produces more Hg-(g)(II) in the lower model levels, but overall wet deposition is lower in comparison to the simulations which employ an O-3/OH oxidation mechanism. The necessity to perform continuous measurements of speciated Hg and to investigate the local impacts of Hg emissions and deposition, as well as interactions dependent on land use and vegetation, forests, peat bogs, etc., is highlighted in this study.

AB After drainage of natural boreal peatlands, the decomposition of organic matter increases and peat soil may turn into a net source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission is known to decrease. Afforestation is a potential mitigation strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emission from organic agricultural soils. A static chamber technique was used to evaluate the fluxes of CH4, N2O and CO2 from three boreal organic agricultural soils in western Finland, afforested 1, 6 or 23 years before this study. The mean emissions of CH4 and N2O during the growing seasons did not correlate with the age of the tree stand. All sites were sources of N2O. The highest daily N2O emission during the growing season, measured in the oldest site, was as high as 29 mg N2O m(-2)d(-1). In general, organic agricultural soils are sinks for methane. Here, the oldest site acted as a small sink for methane, whereas the two youngest afforested organic soils were sources for methane with maximum emission rates (up to 154 mg m(-2)d(-1)) similar to those reported for minerogenous natural peatlands. Soil respiration rates decreased with the age of the forest. The high soil respiration in the younger sites, probably resulted from the high biomass production of herbs, could create soil anaerobiosis and increase methane production. Our results show that afforestation of agricultural peat soils does not abruptly terminate the N2O emissions during the first two decades, and afforestation can even enhance methane emission for a few years. The carbon accumulation in the developing tree stand can partly compensate the carbon loss from soil.

AB A peat profile, 5.5 m in depth, laid in a bog complex comprising frost mounds, bog hollows, and lakes was studied. This bog complex was located in one of the most swamped regions of the middle taiga of the West Siberian Plain. Botanical and spore-pollen analyses of the peat field were conducted. Across the thickness of the peat deposit, 17 points at 25-cm intervals were dated by the radiocarbon method. The dynamics of vegetation and climate during the past 9500 years were determined. It was revealed that, during this period, the rate of peat accumulation constantly tended to decrease, with some fluctuations. The results of mathematical and ecological simulation of this process predict that it will cease in another 1000 years.

AB In five tributary streams (four inflowing and one outflowing) of 1600-ha Trout Lake in northern Wisconsin, USA, we examined factors that can affect the magnitude of stream flow and transport of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) through the streams to the lake. One catchment, the Allequash Creek basin, was investigated in more detail to describe the dynamics of carbon flow and to identify potential carbon sources. Stream flows and carbon loads showed little or no relation to surface-water catchment area. They were more closely related to ground-water watershed area because ground-water discharge, from both local and regional sources, is a major contributor to the hydrologic budgets of these catchments. An important factor in determining carbon influx to the stream is the area of peatland in the catchment. Peatland porewaters contain DOC concentrations up to 40 mg l(-1) and are a significant potential carbon source. Ground-water discharge and lateral flow through peat are the suspected mechanisms for transport of that carbon to the streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested that the sources of DOC in Allequash Creek above Allequash Lake were wetland vegetation and peat and that the sources below Allequash Lake were filamentous algae and wild rice. Catchments with high proportions of peatland, including the Allequash Creek catchment, tended to have elevated DOC loads in outflowing stream water. Respiration and carbon mineralization in lakes within the system tend to produce low DOC and low DOC/DIC in lake outflows, especially at Trout Lake. In Allequash Lake, however, the shallow peat island and vegetation-filled west end were sources of DOC. Despite the vast carbon reservoir in the peatlands, carbon yields were very low in these catchments. Maximum yields were on the order of 2.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DOC and 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DIC. The small yields were attributable to low stream flows due to lack of significant overland runoff and very limited stream channel coverage of the total catchment area.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, serving as both the largest terrestrial soil carbon pool and a significant source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). In Sphagnum moss-dominated wetlands, anaerobic decomposition, and in particular the production of CH4, is highly variable and controlling factors are poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to determine if leachates of Sphagnum can explain differences in anaerobic decomposition and CH4 production from three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.
   Soils from each peatland were incubated anaerobically for 40 days with Sphagnum-derived organic matter (S-DOM) extracted using distilled water at 25 or 60 degrees C in a fully-crossed experimental design. S-DOM extracted at 25 degrees C had a minimal effect on decomposition, but S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C increased CO2 production in all soils. The magnitude of the increased CO2 production in response to S-DOM depended on the source site of the S-DOM. The response of CH4 production to additions of S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C was more complex. Soils from one peatland produced no CH4 during the incubation, regardless of S-DOM source. The same S-DOM additions led to an increase in CH4 production in a second soil, but a decrease in CH4 production in the third soil. Stable isotopic evidence suggests that these patterns were driven by the selective inhibition or stimulation of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest S-DOM alone does not explain differences in anaerobic decomposition in peatlands, but may play a role in regulating CO2 and CH4 production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim the study. In the taiga zone of Western Siberia geochemically conjugated marsh landscapes associated with migratory flows of surface and soil-groundwater are spread. The aim of the work is to study the distribution of a group of elements in a peat deposit of two geochemically conjugated bogs occupying a watershed and a terrace within a common inter fluve.
   Relevance. The data on distribution of elements in geochemically conjugated pools of bogs allow us to relate the conditions of peat accumulation (relief, composition of sedimentary inter fluves, vegetation cover, water-mineral regime) to migration of mineral compounds in marsh landscapes of the interfluve. The information obtained is relevant in environmental applications. It can be used to assess the reservoir of a low-lying terraced swamp as a geochemical barrier in protection of river waters from man-made pollution.
   Research methods. The work included peat sampling on two geochemically conjugated peat bogs (Chistoe and Klyukvennoe) and analysis of samples for the content of ash-forming elements and trace elements. On each swamp, five technological samples were selected, in which the content of Ca, Fe, Co, La, Sc, Ce, Th, Br was determined using the instrumental neutron activation analysis. In addition, the content of Mn is determined by a bulk method with a photocolorimetric termination.
   Results. It is established that the ash content in peat bog Klyukvennoe is 3,8 times higher than in the peat of Chistoe. The contribution of different elements to mineralization of the peat deposit of Klyukvennoe bog is significantly different. The greatest increase (in 8-10 times) is revealed in Fe and Mn. The average growth rates (4,5-5 times) were noted in Sc, Co. The minimum values of growth (2-3 times) were recorded in Ca, Ce, Th, La, Br.
   Conclusions. Peat deposit mineralization at Klyukvennoe bog is associated with removal of iron, manganese and other elements during interfluve slope svvamping and their subsequent accumulation in Klyukvennoe bog.

AB Fertilization in agricultural peatlands accelerates nutrient cycling and creates a potential risk to nearby natural peatlands. Here, using undisturbed peatlands as reference, we studied soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and the key enzymes for nutrient cycling at 0-50 cm soil depth in agricultural, nearby disturbed peatlands in a temperate fen in Northeast China. Agricultural intervention significantly increased total P in agricultural and disturbed peatlands, and decreased soil organic carbon content and total N in surface soil of agricultural peatlands, however total N significantly accumulated at 20-30 cm soil both in agricultural and disturbed peatlands (p < 0.05). Both N-acetyl-13-glucosaminidase and phosphatase significantly declined in agricultural peatlands, while only phosphatase decreased in disturbed peatlands (p < 0.05), and linear regression models showed strong effects of changes of soil nutrient levels on enzyme activities. The ratios of 13-D-glucosidase to N-acetyl-13-glucosaminidase and phosphatase markedly increased in agricultural peatlands and showed higher ratios in deeper soil of disturbed peatlands, suggesting relatively higher microbial demand for carbon. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that variations of enzyme activity and stoichiometry can be used to reveal agricultural disturbance, and further redundancy analysis identified that total P and SOC explained 38.3% and 8.3% of the variance. Overall, our findings show that microbial enzymatic activity and stoichiometry can be effective and sensitive indicators of agricultural intervention and nutrient changes in peatlands, which implies that they can be used in monitoring of future fertilization management strategies aimed at fostering more sustainable agriculture.

AB The Oostriku peat bog (central Estonia) has been exposed to metal-rich groundwater discharge over a long period of time and has accumulated high concentrations of Fe (up to 40 wt-%), heavy metals (e.g. Ph, Zn, Mn, Cu), and As. In this study, the peat was characterised with respect to composition and metal content with depth. The peat pore water was analysed and compared to a spring water emerging at the site. Sequential extraction, using a Tessier scheme optimised for iron-rich sediments, was used to understand the relative roles of binding mechanisms involved in the retention of different metals in the peat. Significant difference in depth distribution was found between different metals bound in the peat, which was partly attributed to varying compositions of the peat with depth and different dominant binding mechanisms for different metals.

AB Drainage of peatlands affects the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Organic soils used for agriculture contribute a large proportion of anthropogenic GHG emissions, and on-farm mitigation options are important. This field study investigated whether choice of a cropping system can be used to mitigate emissions of N2O and influence CH4 fluxes from cultivated organic and carbon-rich soils during the growing season. Ten different sites in southern Sweden representing peat soils, peaty marl and gyttja clay, with a range of different soil properties, were used for on-site measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. The fluxes during the growing season from soils under two different crops grown in the same field and same environmental conditions were monitored. Crop intensities varied from grasslands to intensive potato cultivation. The results showed no difference in median seasonal N2O emissions between the two crops compared. Median seasonal emissions ranged from 0 to 919 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1), with peaks on individual sampling occasions of up to 3317 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1). Nitrous oxide emissions differed widely between sites, indicating that soil properties are a regulating factor. However, pH was the only soil factor that correlated with N2O emissions (negative exponential correlation). The type of crop grown on the soil did not influence CH4 fluxes. Median seasonal CH4 flux from the different sites ranged from uptake of 36 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) to release of 4.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1). From our results, it was concluded that farmers cannot mitigate N2O emissions during the growing season or influence CH4 fluxes by changing the cropping system in the field.

AB The Rano Aroi mire on Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui; 27 degrees 09'S, 109 degrees 27'W, 430 m above sea level) provides a unique non-marine record in the central South Pacific Ocean for reconstructing Late Pleistocene environmental changes. The results of a multiproxy study on two cores from the center and margin of the Rano Aroi mire, including peat stratigraphy, fades analysis, elemental and isotope geochemistry on bulk organic matter, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and macrofossil analysis, were used to infer past water levels and vegetation changes. The chronology was based on 18 14C AMS dates for the upper 8.7 m. The extrapolated age for the base of the sequence is 70 kyr, which implies that this record is the oldest paleolimnological record on Easter Island. The recovered Rano Aroi sequence consists of a radicel peat formed primarily from the remains of sedges, grasses and Polygonaceae that have accumulated since Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 4 (70 kyr BP) to the present. From 60 to 40 kyr BP (MIS 3), high precipitation/runoff events were recorded as organic mud facies with lighter delta C-13, low C/N values and high Ti content, indicating higher detritic input to the mire. A gradual shift in delta C-13 bulk organic matter from -14% to -26%, recorded between 50 and 45 cal kyr BP, suggests a progressive change in local peat-forming vegetation from C4 to 0 plant types. Post-depositional Ca and Fe enrichment during sub-aerial peat exposure and very low sedimentation rates indicate lower water tables during Late MIS 3 (39-31 cal kyr BP). During MIS 2 (27.8-19 cal kyr BP), peat production rates were very low, most likely due to cold temperatures, as reconstructed from other Easter Island records during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Geochemical and macrofossil evidence shows that peat accumulation reactivates at approximately 17.5 cal kyr BP, reaching the highest accumulation rates at 14 cal kyr BP. Peat accretion decreased from 5.0 to 2.5 cal kyr BP, coinciding with a regional Holocene aridity phase. The main hydrological and environmental changes in Rano Aroi reflect variations in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), Southern Westerlies (SW) storm track, and South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) locations.

AB 1. Growth in length and weight of three species of Sphagnum (S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. fallax) was studied in a glasshouse experiment. The Sphagnum mosses were cultivated at natural density on cores of five different peat types, representing a gradient of increasing disturbance. Two water levels were controlled and maintained to simulate natural and drained situations.
   2. Significant differences in the growth of the three Sphagnum species were observed. Canonical multivariate analyses showed decreasing influence by explanatory variables in the order: species > water level > peat-type.
   3. S. fallax was more sensitive both to water table depth and to peat properties. Yet, in the Swiss Jura Mountains, it is the most widespread species in paludification processes of drained bogs after the cessation of peat mining or harvesting. This apparent paradox is discussed.
   4. Feat type was influential only when the water table was maintained at a low level (-40 cm), simulating drained conditions. Results of analyses taking into account peat physical and chemical properties show that drained sites undergo a strong chemical disturbance, which, in turn, affects the growth of Sphagnum mosses. However, depending on the evolution of the peat, a particular combination of chemical and physical properties may favour the growth of Sphagnum mosses even at a low water table.
   5. In setting priorities for bog restoration, S. fallax should be favoured as a pioneer to stimulate a rapid colonization and recovery of Sphagnum lawns on which other species, more characteristic of the ombrotrophic bog environment, can re-establish.

AB In wetland ecosystems, little is known about the relationships between above- and below-ground plant biomass and water table, a primary driver of their distribution in these systems. These relationships can provide a means for estimating belowground stocks over large areas with variable biomass and predicting vascular plant responses to changing water tables resulting from climate change. We measured above- and below-ground vascular plant biomass across species and microtopography (i.e., hummocks and lawns) in a bog in eastern Ontario. We examined the relationships between above- and below-ground vascular plant biomass their variation with water table and species richness. We took 56 cores during a growing season, separating above- and below-ground biomass by species and plant part (small and coarse root, leaf, stem). Hummocks had greater above- and below-ground biomass, and significantly greater aboveground:belowground ratios than lawns. Lawns had a more even distribution of biomass across species than hummocks aboveground, indicating that only a few species (e.g., Vaccinium myrtilloides Michx. and Chamaedaphne calyculata Moench) are able to thrive in the driest bog conditions. Additionally, fewer species contributed to root biomass at depth, suggesting possible resource partitioning among species. Lower water tables lead to greater belowground biomass. Total above- to below-ground plant biomass relationships were strongest when separated by plant species.

AB Reservoirs are sources of greenhouses gases to the atmosphere, primarily due to organic carbon mineralization in flooded plants and soils to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Floating peat islands are common in reservoirs that inundated peatlands. These islands can decompose on mass, or small pieces of peat can erode from islands to decompose in the water column or on the bottom of reservoirs. Here we used large 450 liter sealed enclosures to measure mineralization rates of small peat pieces and larger peat blocks collected from floating peat islands. Mineralization rates were calculated by quantifying dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4 accumulation within the water and headspace of the enclosures over time. We found that peat did decompose under water, but rates of mineralization of peat pieces were not different than rates of mineralization of larger peat blocks. Mineralization rates ranged between 59 and 140 mug C g(-1) d(-1). Peat pieces acidified the water, shifting the bicarbonate equilibrium to almost exclusively dissolved CO2, which was then readily able to flux to the atmosphere. We estimated that 2.4-5.6% of peat carbon was mineralized annually, suggesting that fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from reservoirs that flood peatlands could last at minimum 18-42 years from this carbon source alone.

AB This paper describes the first application of compound-specific stable carbon isotope and radiocarbon isotope analyses Co the investigation of microbial processes in pear deposits. Carbon recycling in both modern and ancient peats is fundamental in assessing the release of methane to the atmosphere. Important relicts of carbon recycling observed in Holocene peat deposits are reservoir effects, in which the peat is as much as 200 C-14 yr older than its actual age. This appears to be related to either consumption of large quantities of microbially respired CO2 or smaller quantities of relatively older methane. We sought evidence for such recycling in two Holocene peat deposits. High abundances of methanogen biomarkers suggest that methanogenesis was a significant process. However, we found neither molecular nor isotopic evidence for methanotrophic activity; while this does not preclude such activity, it suggests that it was not sufficiently important to influence the C-14 composition of the bulk peat, Likewise, compound-specific radiocarbon dates of bacterial and higher plant biomarkers were not significantly different from the dates of bulk peat, indicating that the reservoir effect was not focused in a specific subfraction of biomass, Instead, we propose that old carbon was incorporated directly into the peat-forming vegetation via fixation of old CO2.

AB The structural arrangement of peat constituents controls the hydrological and thermal properties of peat. However, the importance of these structural characteristics on other physical processes within a peatland has not been fully assessed. Here, we evaluate the importance of peat structure on its ability to entrain biogenic gas bubbles and control ebullition, an important transport mechanism for methane. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was applied to characterize the structure of a range of peats at varying levels of decomposition. The structural properties of the peat were quantified from a vector representation of the CT images, and the potential of each sample to entrain biogenic gas bubbles was quantified using a rule-based Monte Carlo model that calculates the tortuosity of bubbles pathways through the peat. Sixty-six percent of the variability in the trapping potential of the peat results from porosity variations and 34% from structural variations between samples. A metric that represents this structural control was not identified for all peat types because of difficulties adequately representing some peats as a vector network. However, for S. magellanicum peat we were able to establish that the influence of peat structure on the entrainment of gas bubbles is characterized by (L) over bar (v), the average vector length of the stems and branches. Peat characterized by longer structural components (larger (L) over bar (v)) enhances the entrainment of gas bubbles. Our findings demonstrate the need to incorporate some representation of the peat structure in numerical models of biogenic gas transport in peat.

AB About a fifth of the global wetland methane emissions originate from boreal peatlands, which represent an important land cover type in boreal landscapes in the sporadic permafrost zone. There, rising air temperatures could lead to warmer spring and longer growing seasons, changing landscape methane emissions. To quantify the effect of warmer spring conditions on methane emissions of a boreal peat landscape in the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, we analyzed four years (2013-2016) of methane fluxes measured with the eddy covariance technique and long-term (1951-2016) meteorological observations from a nearby climate station. In May, after snowmelt was complete, mean air temperatures were more than 2 degrees C warmer in 2013, 2015, and 2016 than in 2014. Mean growing season (May-August) air temperatures, in contrast, differed by less than 1 degrees C over the four years. WarmerMay air temperatures caused earlier wetland soil warming, with temperatures rising from similar to 0 degrees C to > 12 degrees C 25 to 40 days earlier and leading to similar to 6 degrees C warmer mean soil temperatures between May and June. However, from July to August, soil temperatures were similar among years. Mean May to August and annual methane emissions (6.4 g CH4 m(-2) and 9.4 g CH4 m(-2), respectively) of years with warmer spring (i.e. May) temperatures exceeded emissions during the cooler year by 20%-30% (4.5 g CH4 m(-2) and 7.2 g CH4 m(-2), respectively). Among years with warmer springs, growing season methane emissions varied little (+/- 0.5 g CH4 m(-2)). The observed interannual differences are most likely caused by a strong soil temperature control on methane fluxes and large soil temperature differences during the spring. Thus, in a warming climate, methane emissions from waterlogged boreal peat landscapes at the southern limit of permafrost are likely to increase in response to more frequent occurrences of warm springs.

AB In Finland, ditch network maintenance (DNM) is carried out annually on 60-70,000 ha of drained peatland to promote tree growth for forestry purposes. However, it is important to avoid ditching that contributes little to the stand growth and productivity, both to improve the economical profitability of forestry and to mitigate DNM-induced nutrient release to watercourses.
   We hypothesised that mature forest stands with substantial evapotranspiration potential do not necessarily need DNM, even if the ditch networks are in poor condition. We estimated evapotranspiration (EVT) of forest vegetation during the growing seasons (June-September) of 2007-2011 in four forested artificial peatland catchments dominated by Scots pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.) (stand volume 93-151 m(3) ha(-1)) located in southern, western, central and northern Finland. Precipitation (P), runoff (R) and water table level (WTL) were monitored continuously in the field. The water storage change (Delta S) was estimated on the basis of WTL measurements and peat pF curves determined from in situ peat samples. In addition, tree stand transpiration (T) was estimated in two of the catchments using the sap flow method. EVT was estimated as the residual term of the water balance equation.
   During the growing season, EVT (153-295 mm) was 49-161 % of the total accumulated P (155-368 mm), and decreased from south to north. Within each growing season, EVT was always largest in July or August. Tree transpiration was about 50 % of the total forest EVT in the two sites where it was measured directly. The mean WTL was at depth 36-63 cm during the growing seasons. Clear-cutting of a 100m(3) ha(-1) stand on one site resulted in an average rise of WTL by 18 cm.
   The results suggested that, in the southernmost site in particular, no drainage network management would be necessary to sustain satisfactory drainage conditions for tree growth because growing-season precipitation is transferred back to the atmosphere by forest EVT. In the northernmost site, ditch networks were considered important in controlling drainage conditions because of the low EVT potential of <100 m(3) ha(-1) tree stands. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind forest EVT potential, as one site with high tree stand volume had surprisingly low EVT potential.

AB Antimony concentrations were measured in a core collected from Myrarnar, a blanket bog on the Faroe Islands which has been accumulating peat for more than six thousand years. The vertical distribution of Sb indicates that it has been supplied to the peat exclusively from the atmosphere. Despite the proximity to the ocean, the contribution of Sb to the peat from marine aerosols amounts to less than ca. 10% of the natural inputs. Although the peat core contains four notable layers of volcanic ash originating from Iceland, these have not contributed significantly to the Sb inventory. However, the distribution of Sb closely resembles that of Pb, with most of the Sb found in peats dating from the industrial period. Peat samples dating from the Roman Period are not only contaminated with Pb, but also with Sb. Lead is known to be immobile in peat bogs, and in Europe has been derived predominantly from industrial sources for thousands of years. The correlation between Sb and Pb in the peat core from the Faroe Islands supports the hypothesis that Sb is also effectively immobile in peat, and that ombrotrophic bogs are faithful archives of atmospheric Sb deposition. The data presented here also reinforces the view that natural Sb inputs during the past two centuries are dwarfed by industrial inputs, and that human activities have affected the atmospheric Sb cycle to a comparable extent to that of Pb. The natural rate of atmospheric Sb deposition recorded by the peat core ( 0.33 mu g m(-2) year(-1)) is remarkably similar to the value obtained from a Swiss peat bog ( Etang de la Gruere) in the samples dating from ca. 6000 to 9000 years ago ( 0.35 mu g m(-2) year(-1)) which suggests that the background rates obtained from the peat cores have broader validity. Consistent with previous work, the data from the Faroe Islands suggests that the natural flux of Sb to the global atmosphere may have been overestimated by a factor of ten, and that the influence of human activities has been underestimated to the same extent.

AB Flooding of a small boreal forest wetland (979) in northwestern Ontario, caused the formation of peat islands, which resulted in an approximate 10 degrees C increase in peat temperatures at a depth of 50 cm. Feat collected from the flooded wetland and a natural unflooded wetland was incubated anaerobically at temperatures of 4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 20 to 25 degrees C. Flooding of the wetland greatly increased CH4 production rates by increasing the ratio of CH4 : CO2 produced from 979 peat (40% : 60%) compared to 632 peat (20% : 80%), at both preflood and postflood temperatures, likely due to the altered hydrological and geochemical conditions within the peat mats due to flooding. CH4 and CO2 production rates approximately tripled for every 10 degrees C temperature increase and may have been linked to to the metabolic rate of the methanogens or the fermenters independent of the substrate quality. Methane production rates from deep peat deposits within the islands were also significant and responded well to temperature increases despite peat C-14 ages of 1000 years. Due to the large quantity of carbon stored within natural wetlands, artificial reservoirs may act as a significant and long term source of CH4 to the atmosphere.

AB Boreal peatlands are key high-latitude ecosystem types and act as a carbon (C) sink storing an estimated 25% of the world's soil C. These environments are currently seeing the most substantial changing climate, especially during the winter. CO2 emissions during the winter can correspond to 80% of the growing season's net CO2 assimilation. Yet, our conceptual understanding of the controls on microbial metabolic activity in peat soils at temperatures <= 0 degrees C is poor. We used stable isotope probing of peat samples and tracked the fate of C-13-glucose using C-13-NMR. We show that microorganisms in frozen boreal peat soils utilize monomeric C-substrates to sustain both catabolic and anabolic metabolism at temperatures down to -5 degrees C. The C-13-substrate was transformed into C-13-CO2, different metabolites, and incorporated into membrane phospholipid fatty acids. The 16S rRNA-based community analyses revealed the activity at -3 degrees C changes the composition of the bacterial cornmunity over relevant timescales. Below 0 degrees C, small temperature changes have strong effects on process rates and small differences in winter soil temperature may affect C dynamics of northern peatlands. Understanding biological processes at low and below zero temperatures are central for the overall functioning of these systems representing one of the world's major soil C pools.

AB Despite the important role of soil fauna in the decomposition of soil organic matter, the abundance response of soil fauna to environmental changes has been scarcely studied in peatlands, where soil carbon content is exceptionally high. The water table of the Zoige peatland, the largest alpine peatland worldwide, has been declining due to climate change and human drainage in recent decades, which likely induces changes in the abundance of soil fauna. In order to examine the abundance response of soil mites, springtails, and nematodes to water table decline in the Zoige peatland, we conducted an in situ field drainage experiment, consisting of low, intermediate, and ambient water table levels for four consecutive years. We measured the abundances of mites, springtails, and nematodes at five soil depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm), for four times in the third and fourth year of the experiment. Results show that the effect of water table decline on the abundance of soil fauna varied among soil animal groups, soil depths, and the sampling times over the course of the experiment. While mites did not respond significantly to the experimental treatments, the abundance of springtails at soil depths of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 cm and that of nematodes at a depth of 15-20 cm were significantly higher in the drained treatments than in the undrained one. Moreover, water table decline increased the proportion of herbivorous nematodes in the top soil (0-5 cm) and decreased the proportion of bacterivorous nematodes at soil depths of 0-5 and 5-10 cm, while fungivorous and omnivorous-predaceous nematodes did not respond significantly. Given the demonstrated importance of soil fauna to soil carbon dynamics, the changes in the abundances of soil mites, springtails, and nematodes depicted here indicate that soil fauna should be further studied in relation to the recently reported rapid loss of soil carbon in the Zoige peatland.

AB A unique artefact - the fragment of a bow made of yew wood, indicating the hunting activity of prehistoric man - was found within the sediments of the landslide peat bog (at the depth of 330 cm) formed on the Mt. Kamiennik (Polish Flysch Carpathians). The datings of this artefact using C-14 method at ca 3790-3380 cal BC indicate its connection with the activity of the Neolithic man, related to the Funnel Beaker Culture. In the sequence of the peat bog deposits formed since the Atlantic Phase, the palaeoclimatic changes of the Middle- and Late Holocene, as well as traces of human impact in these and subsequent periods were recorded and analysed using palynological, macrofossils, lithological methods, and dated with radiocarbon. Palaeoenvironmental changes identified in the peat horizon bearing the artefact were marked by the delivery of minerogenic, "high energy" deposits (with charcoal) to the peat bog, as well as distinct changes of plant communities. These phenomena confirm a significant human impact caused by the Prehistoric man on landslide areas. On the other hand, the study confirms significant importance of climatic condition for human activity and proves that landslide peat bog deposits are very sensitive records of palaeoenvironmental changes. The archaeological artefact essentially supplements the results of our interdisciplinary palaeoenvironmental study. It is one of the rare Neolithic bows found in the area of Europe. till now.

AB Drainage and conversion of natural peatlands to forestry increases soil CO2 emissions through decomposition of peat and modifies the quantity and quality of litter inputs and therefore the soil carbon balance. In organic soils, CO2 net emissions and removals are reported using carbon emission factors (EF). The choice of specific default Tier 1 EF values from the IPCC 2013 Wetlands supplement depends on land-use categories and climate zones. However, Tier 1 EF for afforested peatlands in the temperate maritime climate zone are based on data from eight sites, mainly located in the hemiboreal zone, and the uncertainty associated with these default values is a concern. In addition, moving from Tier 1 to higher-Tier carbon reporting values is highly desirable when large areas are affected by land-use changes. In this study, we estimated site-specific soil carbon balance for the development of Tier 2 soil CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands. Soil heterotrophic respiration and aboveground tree litterfall were measured during two years at eight afforested peatland sites in Ireland. In addition, fine-root turnover rate and site-specific fine-root biomass were used to quantify belowground litter inputs. We found that drainage of peatlands and planting them with either Sitka spruce or lodgepole pine, resulted in soils being net carbon sources. The soil carbon balance at multi-year sites varied between 63 +/- 92 and 309 +/- 67 g C m(-2) year(-1). Mean CO2-C EF for afforested peatlands was 1.68 +/- 0.33 t CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1). The improved CO2-C EFs presented here for afforested peatlands are proposed as a basis to update national CO2-C emissions from this land-use class in Ireland. Furthermore, new data from these sites will significantly contribute to the development of more reliable IPCC default Tier 1 CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands in the maritime temperate climate zone.

AB The export of fixed carbon from peatlands is likely important in driving freshwater ecosystem productivity in head water streams. Here we studied the stream composition from three peatlands, and the sub-catchment containing these peatlands, in response to a natural storm event. We investigated the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) mobilised by this event as well as the dissolved combined amino acids (DCAAs; proteins, peptides and free AAs) component of the DOC/DON. The storm pulse was characterised by a strong DOC/DON/DCAA pulse reflecting the mobilisation of materials from the peat profile. Through the storm cycle a transient increase in the C:N ratio of the DOC was observed (ranging over 20 - 50 across the four sites), likely reflecting the mobilisation of less decomposed material from higher in the peat soil profile. By comparing the DCAA and DON dynamics we show that a DCAA-rich component (fast-DCAA) is mobilised earlier in the storm cycle, likely reflecting a higher mobility in the peat soil. Similarly, comparison of the DCAA and DOC dynamics suggests that at least part of the DOC is mobilised more rapidly than fast-DCAA (fast-DOC). While we may not expect the composition of a storm pulse to be uniform through the cycle, this study shows that within the DOC and DON pools there is spatial and temporal separation of molecular groups. Proteins (in principal) represent both highly bioavailable N-sources as well as potential biological trigger molecules, so our work shows that these compounds are more dominant in the early part (rising limb) of the storm pulse. This understanding of the changing composition of DOC through a storm peak also provides greater insight into the concentration-discharge (C-Q) response of peatlands; our work shows that the activation of water paths higher in the peat profile at high flows leads to the mobilisation of different pools of DOC such that the molecular characteristics of DOC change through the storm cycle.

AB We studied vegetation dynamics at peatlands, differing in their climate, land use management history and vegetation community in Ireland and Finland over a two-year period. Our aim was to develop a species-specific method to be used to (1) describe the seasonal dynamics of green (photosynthetic) area (GA) of the vegetation and (2) incorporate these changes into CO2 exchange models. The extent of temporal and spatial variation between and within communities indicated the need for a two-step calculation approach for each community. Firstly, at biweekly to monthly intervals, GA of all species within a range of vascular plant communities was estimated by non-destructive field measurements. Gaussian or log-normal models were fitted to describe the seasonal dynamics of each species. Secondly, an estimate of community vascular green area (VGA) was obtained by summing the modelled daily GA of all species within the community. The highest values of VGA (2.1-6.0 m(2) m(-2)) occurred within the reed communities at the rewetted cutaway peatland in Ireland and the lowest at the ombrotrophic lawn communities in Finland (0.5-1.0 m(2) m(-2)). The relationship between light saturated gross photosynthesis (P (G)) and VGA was either linear or hyperbolic depending on the degree of self-shading that occurred within each community. The addition of the VGA term into P (G) models improved the explaining power of the model by 57.6, 24.5 and 23% within the Typha latifolia, Phalaris arundinacea and Eriophorum angustifolium/Carex rostrata communities, respectively. VGA proved useful in recording the seasonal development of a wide range of peatland vascular plant communities over geographically and climatically different regions.

AB Except for Sphagnum mosses of peatland habitats, reliable methods to assess moss productivity in arctic or boreal biomes give usually highly variable results. Therefore, ecosystem processes are poorly understood in these biomes where mosses are an important component of the system. The aim of this study was to compare three methods to estimate moss growth in polygon patterned fens: cranked wires, natural markers and artificial white marks (an alternative to the spray method). Precision of estimates was significantly higher when natural markers were used (coefficients of variation, CV, between 17 and 27%), compared to cranked wires (CV=370/0) or white marks (CV=56%). Natural markers also provided estimates for growth of moss stems 32 to 113% higher than the other methods. Although cranked wires were calibrated shortly after snowmelt, some moss growth is still missed and consequently moss growth is underestimated. Accuracy of cranked wires was poor, mainly caused by frost heaving or permafrost activities that can affect wire position. Thus, this method should be avoided in arctic ecosystems. Even if white marks were painted on moss stems at the end of the growing season prior to the sampling year, lower estimates of moss growth were still found. We suspect some interference with moss growth processes during the marking process, at least when used with brown mosses. The natural marker method, which provides increment for an entire growing season, appears to be the most accurate method of the three. Additionally, it is also the easiest and the least time consuming method to use. Its main drawback is that relatively few species have natural growth marks and these species may not always be present among the targeted species under study. Also, measurements of stem growth on the same sample did not differ between observers, even if the second measurement was done 12 years later. In conclusion, when species with natural markers are present, this method should be used to assess moss growth. For arctic/sub-arctic studies where such species are lacking, the artificial white marks method should be refined further.

AB Boreal peatlands are significant natural sources of methane and especially vulnerable to abrupt climate change. However, the controlling factors of CH4 emission in boreal peatlands are still unclear. In this study, we investigated CH4 fluxes and abiotic factors (temperature, water table depth, active layer depth, and dissolved CH4 concentrations in pore water) during the growing seasons in 2010 and 2011 in both shrub-sphagnum-and sedge-dominated plant communities in the continuous permafrost zone of Northeast China. The objective of our study was to examine the effects of vegetation types and abiotic factors on CH4 fluxes from a boreal peatland. In an Eriophorum-dominated community, mean CH4 emissions were 1.02 and 0.80 mg m(-2) h(-1) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. CH4 fluxes (0.38 mg m(-2) h(-1)) released from the shrub-mosses-dominated community were lower than that from Eriophorum-dominated community. Moreover, in the Eriophorum-dominated community, CH4 fluxes showed a significant temporal pattern with a peak value in late August in both 2010 and 2011. However, no distinct seasonal variation was observed in the CH4 flux in the shrub-mosses-dominated community. Interestingly, in both Eriophorum- and shrub-sphagnum-dominated communities, CH4 fluxes did not show close correlation with air or soil temperature and water table depth, whereas CH4 emissions correlated well to active layer depth and CH4 concentration in soil pore water, especially in the Eriophorum-dominated community. Our results suggest that CH4 released from the thawed CH4-rich permafrost layer may be a key factor controlling CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands, and highlight that CH4 fluxes vary with vegetation type in boreal peatlands. With increasing temperature in future climate patterns, increasing active layer depth and shifting plant functional groups in this region may have a significant effect on CH4 emission.

AB We quantified the response of peatland water table level (WTL) and energy fluxes to harvesting of a drained peatland forest. Two alternative harvests (clear-cut and partial harvest) were carried out in a mixed-species ditch-drained peatland forest in southern Finland, where water and energy balance components were monitored for six pre-treatment and three post-treatment growing seasons. To explore the responses caused by harvestings, we applied a mechanistic multi-layer soil-plant-atmosphere transfer model. At the clear-cut site, the mean growing season WTL rose by 0.18 +/- 0.02 m (error estimate based on measurement uncertainty), while net radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes decreased after harvest. On the contrary, we observed only minor changes in energy fluxes and mean WTL (0.05 +/- 0.03 m increase) at the partial harvest site, although as much as 70% of the stand basal area was removed and leaf-area index was reduced to half. The small changes were mainly explained by increased water use of spruce undergrowth and field layer vegetation, as well as increased forest floor evaporation. The rapid establishment of field layer vegetation had a significant role in energy balance recovery at the clear-cut site. At partial harvest, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and model-data comparison suggested the shade-adapted spruce undergrowth was suffering from light stress during the first post-harvest growing season. We conclude that in addition to stand basal area, species composition and stand structure need to be considered when controlling WTL in peatland forests with partial harvesting. Our results have important implications on the operational use of continuous cover forestry on drained peatlands. A continuously maintained tree cover with significant evapotranspiration capacity could enable optimizing WTL from both tree growth and environmental perspectives.

AB The Blue Creek and Mary Lee coals in the lower part of the Mary Lee coal zone, Upper Pottsville Formation, northwestern Alabama, record deposition in peat-accumulating environments or mires.  Intervening strata contain a series of stacked clastic swamps (forested wetlands which grew on a clastic sediment substrate, rather than a peat soil).  These clastic swamp horizons are identified on the basis of:  (1) autochthonous, erect, lycophyte and Calamites trunks; (2) mud-cast, prostrate, hypoautochthonous lycophyte and Calamites trunks; (3) compression-impression assemblages of autochthonous to hypoautochthonous pteridosperm and lycophyte foliage, branches, and reproductive structures; (4) autochthonous axes and appendages of Stigmaria, and Pinnularia; and (5) siderite nodules associated with "rooting" structures and other plant material.  Sedimentological and biostratinomic features of the Mary Lee coal to Blue Creek coal interval are used as the basis for the interpretation that sediment loading and compaction of buried peat controlled the alternation between peat mires and clastic swamps, and the stacking of the clastic swamps.

AB Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.)
   Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Introduction Ash peaks along ombrotrophic bog profiles may arise from several different processes. In a recent paper, Leifeld and co-authors (Plant Soil 341:349-361, 2011) argued that ash peaks along the Etang de la Gruere (EGr) peat bog profiles are signs of previous periods of higher peat decomposition rather that an indication of periods of elevated dust inputs.
   Aims and methods Here we question the approach and scrutinize results using published data on several peat cores from EGr, demonstrating that peaks in ash content at EGr are very reproducible when cores are carefully collected (e. g., using the Wardenaar corer), and age dated (using Pb-210 and C-14).
   Results Data clearly show that variations in ash content along bog profiles cannot be attributed simply, or exclusively, to differences in organic matter mineralization rate, and that averaging the ash contents and normalizing to a single ash peak leads to losses in valuable information and defeats the purpose of detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions.
   Conclusions Comparing results obtained using sensitive spectroscopic and isotopic tools with the ash content profiles at EGr shows clearly that the distribution of ash and/or acid-insoluble ash cannot be used as a surrogate for the intensity of processes including organic matter mineralization, decomposition and/or humification.

AB Essential for successful bog restoration is the reestablishment of Sphagnum mosses. High carbon dioxide availability has been shown to be of great importance for the growth of Sphagnum mosses. In well-developed Sphagnum bogs large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced by (an)aerobic decomposition of the peat layer. In cut-over Sphagnum bogs this carbon source is often greatly reduced. In this study the importance of groundwater-derived carbon dioxide is demonstrated in aquatic environments, where Sphagnum species have started to form floating mats after former cutover activities by farmers. We discuss the results of measures taken to restore one of the largest wet heathland reserves in western Europe. After rewetting, some bogs developed markedly well, whereas others did not. The developmental success of 10 small bogs was quantified by analysing aerial photographs and sampling of surface and groundwater. The analysis of the ground- and surface water samples revealed that in the well-developed bogs there were significantly higher TIC/CO2 concentrations than in poorly developed bogs. It is concluded that in the early stages of bog formation the growth of Sphagnum is better in bog systems that are fed by an inflow of carbonrich groundwater from outside the bog. The present findings suggest that high carbon dioxide availability is a prerequisite for the successful reestablishment of Sphagnum mosses in peat-bog restoration projects and that carbon-rich groundwater can substitute for the carbon dioxide from decomposing peat.

AB The paper presents the results of the research on biogenic sediments from the Jalewka profile (Podlasie region, NE Poland) situated at the foot of a dry valley slope. A 35 cm monolith of sediments was collected from the excavation pit. The sediments were deposited beneath 4 m thick mineral sediments. Interdisciplinary research helped to reconstruct the possible transformations of the local environment. Palynological, physical, and geochemical analyses were applied to organic sediments, and plant macroremains were examined. Five local pollen zones were identified in palynological terms and correlated with the late Warta Stadial (MIS 6) of the Odra Glaciation (Saalian), and four older periods of the Eemian Interglacial: MIS 5e (E1, E2, E3 and E4). Younger zones have not been preserved. They were eroded in the early Vistulian. During the late MIS 6, there was a eutrophic water body with highly transparent water, characterized by a relative stable water level. The landscape was dominated by tundra with a high proportion of Juniperuse-Artemisia. Curves of oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotopes confirmed the boundary between MIS 6 and MIS 5e. The beginning of the interglacial vegetation succession (E1) was characterized by expansion of birch-pine-spruce forests. Probably at the end of this period, the lake became shallower. E2 is distinguished by the dominance of pine and birch. The lake was replaced by a peat bog. The sequence of vegetation succession in the landscape was as follows: Quercus (E3), Corylus, Fraxinus-Alnus and Tilia (E4). Probably, the peat bog drained in the E4 and the water level rose again in the climate optimum of the Eemian Interglacial. The results of physical and geochemical analysis clearly corresponded with climatic changes determined by palynological analysis. They provided evidence of the changing redox conditions, variability and intensity of denudation, the scale of biological productivity, and fertility of the environment. The studied sediments were characterized by reducing conditions. The increase in terrigenous silica content and the relatively high N:K ratio indicated the predominance of mechanical denudation during the late glacial period of the Warta Stadial and the E2 period.

AB High altitude, Andean wetlands, or bofedales as they are locally known, are important regulators of the local water balance and also play a key role in sustaining biodiversity. Nevertheless, there is almost no information regarding their hydrogeological structure and functioning. This paper aims to characterize the thickness of the alluvial filling of one peat-accumulating wetland in North-Central Chile using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to assess its role as a water reservoir. To develop a quasi-3D understanding of the peatland's structure, four ERT profiles were conducted. Results highlight a conductive basin shape of the peatland, with a thicker interface downstream than upstream between alluvial materials and the underlying bedrock or rock screes. Those results allow the estimate of the water column (1000-3400 mm) within the peatland alluvial filling. The second objective is to better understand the water exchanges between the peatland and the streamflow using discharge measurements and water stable isotopes. Water and isotopes budgets highlight a streamflow loss towards the peatland groundwater reservoir at the end of spring season. In addition, ten delta O-18 and delta H-2 surveys were used to characterize the distinct wetland water sources and their temporal variations. A peatland conceptual model is proposed to connect groundwater, rock glaciers, snowmelt, and hillslope flows. Andean peatlands provide a pivotal control on water delivery downstream, and therefore, understanding their structure and function is important, because they are unique structures providing ecological services at high elevations.

AB We examined the sources, sinks, and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its chemical fractions over a 4-year period in upland and wetland catchments in the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario. In an upland catchment, the major sources of DOC were precipitation, vegetation, and soil organic matter, resulting in a summer (June to October) export of 2.1 g.m(-2). DOC concentrations in peat pore water ranged from 20 to 60 mg.L-1 and were related to hydrologic pathways. DOC export from catchments containing wetlands ranged from 0.8 to 5.7 g.m(-2) and export from the peatland portion of the catchment was estimated to be 28-30 g.m(-2). Flooding to a depth of 1.2 in in the peatland section of one catchment resulted in an increase in pore-water and pond DOC concentrations, attributed to the decomposition of plant tissues and peat. Because only 14% of the catchment was flooded, impoundment did not result in a significant increase in DOC export. Between 85 and 93% of DOC was contained in the acid fractions, with small amounts in the neutral fractions. Flooding increased the proportion of the hydrophilic neutral fraction in peat pore waters for 2 years after flooding.

AB Arctic and boreal peatlands play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle. They are particularly efficient at sequestering carbon because their high water content limits decomposition rates to levels below their net primary productivity. Their future in a climate-change context is quite uncertain in terms of carbon emissions and carbon sequestration.
   Nuuk fen is a well-instrumented Greenlandic fen with monitoring of soil physical variables and greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4 and CO2) and is of particular interest for testing and validating land-surface models. But knowledge of soil carbon stocks and profiles is missing. This is a crucial shortcoming for a complete evaluation of models, as soil carbon is one of the primary drivers of CH4 and CO2 soil emissions. To address this issue, we measured, for the first time, soil carbon and nitrogen density, profiles and stocks in the Nuuk peatland (64 degrees 07'51 '' N, 51 degrees 23'10 '' W), colocated with the greenhouse gas measurements. Measurements were made along two transects, 60 and 90 m long and with a horizontal resolution of 5m and a vertical resolution of 5 to 10 cm, using a 4 cm diameter gouge auger. A total of 135 soil samples were analyzed. Soil carbon density varied between 6.2 and 160.2 kg C m(-3) with a mean value of 50.2 kg C m(-3). Mean soil nitrogen density was 2.37 kg N m(-3). Mean soil carbon and nitrogen stocks are 36.3 kg C m(-2) and 1.7 kg N m(-2). These new data are in the range of those encountered in other arctic peatlands. This new dataset, one of very few in Greenland, can contribute to further development of joint modeling of greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon and nitrogen in land-surface models. The dataset is open-access and available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.909899 (Morel et al., 2019b).

AB Northern wetlands with organic soil i.e., mires are significant carbon storages. This key ecosystem service may be threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change, yet we still lack a consensus on how these major changes affects their carbon sink capacities. We studied how forestry drainage and restoration combined with experimental warming, impacts greenhouse gas fluxes of wetlands with peat. We measured CO2 and CH4 during two and N2O fluxes during one growing season using the chamber method.
   Gas fluxes were primarily controlled by water table, leaf area and temperature. Land use had a clear impact of on CO2 exchange. Forestry drainage increased respiration rates and decreased field layer net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) and leaf area index (LAI), while at restoration sites the flux rates and LAI had recovered to the level of undrained sites. CH4 emissions were exceptionally low at all sites during our study years due to natural drought, but still somewhat lower at drained compared to undrained sites. Moderate warming triggered an increase in LAI across all land use types. This was accompanied by an increase in cumulative seasonal NEE. Restoration appeared to be an effective tool to return the ecosystem functions of these wetlands as we found no differences in LAI or any gas flux components (PMAX, Reco, NEE, CH4 or N2O) between restored and undrained sites. We did not find any signs that moderate warming would compromise the return of the ecosystem functions related to C sequestration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atmospherically-fed Earth surface archives such as ombrotrophic peatlands, lake sediments, and ice consistently show an upward increase in Zn concentrations of hitherto unclear origin. Here, we present-a combined stable Zn isotope and trace element (Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, V, Ta, Pb) dataset for a historically polluted, near-urban bog (Liffey Head) from the east coast of Ireland. This peat record is compared to an archive from a rural site at the west coast of Ireland (Brackloon Wood). Both archives show a clear near-surface increase in Zn deposition, accompanied by periodic deposition in Cr, Ni, Mo, and V suggesting a co-genetic origin of these elements. In the Liffey Head site, biologic upward distillation of nutrients can be excluded as the origin of the elemental enrichments. The differences in the excess metal ratios between the two sites (e.g., Zn/Cd of 426-1564, east, and 77-106, west) are attributed to a higher contribution from traffic emissions (diesel, petrol) and oil-burning at the near-urban site, and dominant atmospheric influence from solid fossil fuel combustion emissions (e.g., mixed fuel, coal and wood) at the rural site.
   The Zn isotope composition in the historically-polluted Liffey Head bog evolved from delta Zn-66/64(JMC) (Lyon) values of 0.72 +/- 0.03%. in the peat accumulated during the 19th century to lighter ratios (0.18 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand) towards the top of the monolith (i.e., recent.). Zinc-isolope ratios are positively correlated with excess metal/Cd ratios and also with Pb-206/Pb-207, collectively fingerprinting the gradual change from a mining-dominaled to a traffic-dominated atmospheric pollution at the east coast. over the past century. A prevalent input, interpreted to represent. combustion emissions from diesel engines, is observed for the pas. 15 years. Combined with trace elements and radiogenic Pb isotopes, the information obtained with the Zn isotope systematics adds towards an in-depth characterisation of the pollution signals.

AB Losses of dry weight, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from shoot litter of Carex diandra Schrank and Carex acutiformis Ehrh. were studied in a 2-year litter bag experiment in two fens, each dominated by one of these species. Weight losses over time showed negative exponential curves during Year 1, with k values of 0.0018 and 0.0009 day-1 for Carex diandra and Carex acutiformis, respectively. Total weight loss during Year 1 equalled that during Year 2, and amounted to 45% and 27% of the initial weight for Carex diandra and Carex acutiformis, respectively.
   Total nitrogen in the litter bags remained approximately constant throughout the 2-year-period for Carex acutiformis, whereas it remained constant during Year 1 and then dropped to 23% of the initial value during Year 2 for Carex diandra. Total phosphorus showed a similar pattern: no changes for Carex acutiformis, and a substantial decrease to 15% of the initial value during Year 2 for Carex diandra.
   A study of cotton strip tensile strength loss showed that conditions for cellulose decay are much more suitable in the groundwater fed (base-rich) fen dominated by Carex diandra than in the rain-water fed (base-poor) fen with Carex acutiformis, which is in accordance with the results of the litter bag study.
   The slower nutrient release from Carex acutiformis litter does not lead to a lower mineralization rate of soil organic matter in the fen dominated by this species. The high release rates of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in this fen are probably because of the presence of Sphagnum-derived organic matter.

AB Globally important carbon (C) stores in northern peatlands are vulnerable to oxidation in a changing climate. A growing body of literature draws attention to the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in governing anaerobic metabolism in organic soil, but exactly how the reduction-oxidation (redox) activities of DOM, and particularly the phenolic fraction, are likely to change in an altered climate remain unclear. We used large mesocosms in the PEATcosm experiment to assess changes in peatland DOM and redox potential in response to experimental manipulations of water table (WT) position and plant functional groups (PFGs). WT position and PFGs interacted in their effects on redox potential and quantity and quality of DOM. Phenolics were generally of higher molecular weight and more oxidized with sedges in lowered WTs. Altered DOM character included changes in dissolved nitrogen (N), with higher N: [phenolics] with higher E4:E6 (absorbance ratio lambda = 465:665) DOM in the lowered WT and sedge PFG treatments. Conversely, biomolecular assignments to amino-sugars were largely absent from low-WT treatments. Low WT resulted in the creation of unique N compounds, which were more condensed (lower H:C), that changed with depth and PFG. The accumulation of oxidized compounds with low WT and in sedge rhizospheres could be very important pools of electron acceptors beneath the WT, and their mechanisms of formation are discussed. This work suggests the effects of changes in vegetation communities can be as great as WT position in directly and interactively mediating peat redox environment and the redox-activity of DOM.
   Plain Language Summary Peatlands are important ecosystems in both the global carbon (C) cycle and the Earth's climate system owing to their ability to store vast quantities of C taken from the atmosphere. Peat C stays locked up in these ecosystems largely owing to cool and wet conditions, and as such, these C stores are vulnerable to release back to the atmosphere if the climate or water levels change. Water table level and plant species composition have a combined effect on C and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands. We manipulated both factors in an experimental setting composed of 24 large bins into which we put intact peatland miniecosystems. Sedges play a big role in producing N compounds below the peat surface, and this work suggests these compounds can actually be synthesized into larger, less accessible compounds. In addition, activities of sedge roots and other dominant plant communities (such as shrubs in the heath family of plants) may interact in the synthesis of oxidized, larger molecules. These molecules can allow microbes to continue to decompose peat even in the absence of oxygen. This could increase the release of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, while reducing inputs of the stronger greenhouse gas methane.

AB Mosses are keystone species in peatlands and are an important part of the vegetation of the pre-mined peatlands. Therefore, mosses should be included in rehabilitation projects following oil sands exploitation in north-western Canada. However, mosses growing in post-mined landscapes must tolerate elevated salinity levels found in oil sands process water (OSPW). Knowledge of salinity tolerance and thresholds for fen mosses is needed to place these mosses in the newly created landscapes. We tested the effects of NaCl and Na2SO4 on four fen moss species growing in Petri dishes in growth chambers. We simulated two scenarios: (1) four immersion times (1/4, 1, 3 and 7 days) in NaCl (0%, 20%, 60% or 100% of the concentration found in OSPW) mimicking periodic flooding and (2) a permanent saline influence (NaCl or Na2SO4 alone or in combination at 0%, 30%, 50% or 70% of the concentrations found in OSPW) mimicking situations of high water tables with different contamination levels. The effects on moss growth were estimated by counting new innovations of Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Campylium stellatum, Sphagnum warnstorfii and Tomenthypnum nitens. All tested mosses tolerated saline levels typically found in post-mined landscapes (up to 500 mg L-1 of NaCl and 400 mg L-1 of Na2SO4) for up to 100 days of exposure. Short periods of immersion (up to 7 days independently of salt concentrations) induced the production of innovation in non-Sphagnum species, but S. warnstorfii was more rapidly impacted at higher salt concentrations. Short pulses of salt (from 6 h to 7 days) did not influence the formation of new innovations for C. stellatum and T. nitens. Salt type (NaCl and/or Na2SO4) had no effect on moss growth. However, a longer exposure (100 days) with saline water, even at low concentrations, diminished the formation of new innovations for B. pseudotriquetrum and T. nitens. C. stellatum was the least affected by salinity and thus we suggest it is the best species to reintroduce in constructed fens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FUSCUM
AB Sphagnum mosses dominate the plant cover of boreal bogs and accumulate carbon as peat. However, discoloured necrotic Sphagnum patches are also common in bogs. Necrotic Sphagnum inhibits peat accumulation, and consequently these areas may sink with respect to their surroundings with healthy mosses and continuing peat accumulation. Therefore, necrotic patches in the moss carpet could have an important role in triggering the succession of Sphagnum communities and the differentiation of bog microtopography. Our main aim was to find out how necrotic Sphagnum patches are distributed on a microtopographic gradient and among Sphagnum species. Based on these results we discuss the development and likely role of necrotic patches. It was found that necrotic patches occur on all types of bog microfonns and contain the most of common Sphagnum species. Necrotic patches were more common and larger in wet hollows. The development of necrotic patches depends on their location on the microtopographic gradient. Necrotic patches on higher microforms usually re-vegetate, whereas those in hollows can result in mud-bottom hollows.

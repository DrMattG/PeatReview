AB The objective of this study was to examine plant community development and peat stratigraphy in the context of ground-water flow systems for five forested peatlands in central New York State for which extensive vegetation, surface hydrology, and water chemistry analyses has been performed. Peatland development trends, from the initial period of peat accumulation to the present, were explored using pear stratigraphy, analysis of ground-water flow systems and evidence fi om existing vegetation. Detailed analyses, including the construction of numerical ground-water models were performed for one of the five sites to examine the process of bog development within what was once a highly calcareous fen and to examine the impacts of agricultural drainage on peatland ground-water flow. Feat stratigraphy analysis indicated two pathways of peatland development: infilling of shallow lakes and peat accumulation on ground-water seeps. Lake-infill peatlands were characterized by a sequence of Limnic peat--> bryophyte-sedge peat-->hemic-fibric sedge peat-->sapric wood peat (or Sphagnum peat). Analysis of ground-water flow systems indicated that four of the peatlands were characterized by mineral-rich ground-water discharge along peatland margins, with lateral flow through the peatlands towards drainage features. The fifth peatland was characterized by a more complex ground-water flow system with a weakly minerotrophic water-table mound driving shallow ground-water recharge flow. The water-table mound has been reduced in extent by agricultural drainage and demonstrates seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head and areal extent.

AB Surface-atmosphere energy exchange is strongly ecosystem-specific. At the same time, as the energy balance constitutes responses of an ecosystem to environmental stressors including precipitation, humidity and solar radiation, it results in feedbacks of potential importance for the regional climate. Northern peatlands represent a diverse class of ecosystems that cover nearly 6 x 10(6) km(2) in the Boreal region, which makes the inter-comparison of their energy balances an important objective. With this in mind we studied energy exchange across a broad spectrum of peatlands from pristine fens and bogs to forested and agriculturally managed peatlands, which represent a large fraction of the landscape in Finland and Sweden. The effects of management activities on the energy balance were extensively examined from the micrometeorological point of view, using eddy covariance data from eight sites in these two countries (56 degrees 12'-62 degrees 11' N, 13 degrees 03'-30 degrees 05' E). It appears that the surface energy balance varies widely amongst the different peatland types. Generally, energy exchange features including the Bowen ratio, surface conductance, coupling to the atmosphere, responses to water table fluctuations and vapour pressure deficit could be associated directly with the peatland type. The relative constancy of the Bowen ratio in natural open mires contrasted with its variation in tree-covered and agricultural peatlands. We conclude that the impacts of management and the consequences of land-use change in peatlands for the local and regional climate might be substantial.

AB This study presents a new data synthesis of Finnish peatland area and carbon (C) store in peat from 1950 to 2015. We present updated results from the most comprehensive compilation of Finnish peat soil properties with associated C accumulation rates from undrained mires and C sources from different forms of anthropogenic land use. Since 1950, different forms of land use of Finnish peatlands have reduced the total peat C store by 3-10%, approximately 172-510 Tg. The most significant C losses have occurred from forestry-drained peatlands, but significant losses have also occurred from agricultural peat soils, peat extraction, and other forms of peatland exploitation such as building water reservoirs. However, the C accumulation of undrained mires and especially the increased biomass production of drained peatlands have partly compensated for the anthropogenic C losses. The total C store of peatland vegetation biomass (trees, seedlings, ground vegetation, detritus and below-ground roots) was estimated to have increased by 92 Tg due to intensive peatland drainage. The present total C store of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5618 Tg, which includes 5079 Tg as peat. The total C store estimate is approximately 1-7 % lower compared to the 1950s. Today, the undrained mires still represent a significant national C sink, with the rate of C sequestration estimated at 0.82 Tg yr(-1). However, across all land uses the present peat soil is a C source by 3.7-10.0 Tg yr(-1). Significant anthropogenic C losses from peat soil underline the urgent need for sustainable C management of all peatlands, including the preservation of the C store in existing natural mires, stopping land clearing on undisturbed organic soils, and improving the peatland hydrology by restoration to create long-term C sinks especially within the large unproductive drainage area and northern aapa mire area.

AB This study summarizes the present knowledge of Finnish peatland areas and carbon (C) storage in peat from 1950 to 2000. In 1950, approximately 8.8 million ha of the Finnish peatland area was still undisturbed and 1.4 million ha drained. In 2000, almost 55% (5.7 million ha) of the peatland area in Finland was drained for forestry, 38.4% (4.0 million ha) was undrained, 0.8% (85 000 ha) was in agriculture, 0.6% (60 000 ha) was under water reservoirs, 0.3% (35 000 ha) was under roads and 0.6% was in peat harvesting or had been removed from the harvesting business (63 000 ha). The change in mire area is considered relatively reliable, whereas the net changes in the actual C sequestration and the actual C storage change from 1950 to 2000 involves much more uncertainty. In 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5960 Tg, which includes 5304 Tg as peat. Since 1950, the C sequestration of undrained and drained peatlands (peat, plant biomass) basically compensated for the anthropogenic losses. The most important forms of anthropogenic C losses have occurred from agricultural peat soils, water reservoirs, harvested peat and DOC output from forestry drained peatlands. From 1950 to 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatlands, which includes peat and living plant biomass, was estimated to increased by 52 Tg because the intensive peatland drainage significantly increased the total C storage of vegetation. However, the actual C storage in peat decreased by about 73 Tg. The well-defined changes include the decrease of mire diversity because of forestry drainage.

AB Peatlands are significant global carbon stores and play an important role in mediating the flux of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. During the 20th century substantial areas of northern peatlands were drained to repurpose the land for industrial or agricultural use. Drained peatlands have dysfunctional microbial communities, which can lead to net carbon emissions. Rewetting of drained peatlands is therefore an environmental priority, yet our understanding of the effects of peatland drainage and rewetting on microbial communities is still incomplete. Here we summarize the last decade of research into the response of the wider microbial community, methane-cycling microorganisms, and micro-fauna to drainage and rewetting in fens and bogs in Europe and North America. Emphasis is placed on current research methodologies and their limitations. We propose targets for future work including: accounting for timescale of drainage and rewetting events; better vertical and lateral coverage of samples across a peatland; the integration of proteomic and metabolomic datasets into functional community analysis; the use of RNA sequencing to differentiate the active community from legacy DNA; and further study into the response of the viral and micro-faunal communities to peatland drainage and rewetting. This review should benefit researchers embarking on studies in wetland microbiology and non-microbiologists working on peatland drainage and rewetting in general.

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB 1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.
   2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.
   3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.
   4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

AB Processes affecting CO2 and CH4 emissions and their budgets have been relatively well studied in northern temperate peatlands, whereas similar studies are almost absent in southern Patagonia and the high-altitude Andean peatlands, both of which are currently under heavy anthropogenic pressure. Theobjectives of this study were to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in natural and managed peatlands to examine the effect of management on GHG emissions and identify the environmental parameters affecting them. We analysed CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions related to the physical and chemical conditions of the peat: in a natural and managed transitional bog in Quebec, Canada, a natural paramo andgrazed peatland in the Colombian Andes, and a bog and a fen in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. GHG fluxeswere measured using the dark static chamber method. Groundwater table, temperature, O-2 content, pH and redox potential were measured from observation wells, soil temperature was measured at four depths, peat samples were analysed for pH, soil organic matter and dry matter content, P, K, Ca, Mg, NH4-N, NO3-N, total N and C. In all regions, human- impacted peatlands showed significantly higher CO2-C, N2O-N and CH4-C emissions than their natural counterparts. The Canadian managed transitionalbog showed the highest average CO2-C (575 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O-N (0.08 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) emissions, whereas the Colombian pasture was the largest emitter of CH4-C (2.35 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). CO2-C emissionswere controlled by soil temperature and C content, whereas CH4-C flux was negatively correlated to dissolved oxygen content in peat water, and positively to water table level and soil log (C/NO3-N) ratio. Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN), C/N ratio, and soil temperature were the main factors controlling N2O emissions. Intensive peatland management alters the soil C/N balance, and increases and leads to higher variability of GHG emissions. Agricultural activities, especially crop production in peatlands, as well asintensive grazing in mountain peatland pastures, are the main factors increasing GHG emissions in the peatlands studied. Mitigation is possible via regulation of grazing intensity and replacing arable fields with grasslands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the main problems associated with small natural reserves is their progressive loss of ecological integrity owing to the influence of surrounding human activities. In southern Quebec (Bas-Saint-Laurent, Canada), peatlands are extensively mined to extract peat for the production of horticultural compost and are isolated within agricultural lands. Government environmental agencies have proposed that peat industries set aside 5-10% of a bog's area as a natural refuge for peatland plants and animals. Do these fragments constitute reliable refuges? Do they maintain their ecological characteristics over a long period? We studied the recent evolution of plant communities in peatland fragments using paleoecological techniques and a geographical information system. In the study area, some treeless fragments dominated by Sphagnum species have recently (since 1940) converted to forest sites. Macrofossil and dendrochronological analyses suggest that peat-mining activities were not the main factors responsible for the afforestation of peatland fragments. On the other hand, the isolation of the Bas-Saint-Laurent peatlands within an agricultural plain for more than 100 years may explain the afforestation process (drainage activities). Furthermore, fires may have accelerated afforestation by facilitating the spread of seeds of tree species with serotinous cones. Because most peatlands of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region are still affected by drainage and fires, it is probable that several open bog fragments will not maintain their treeless vegetation structure over a long period. Consequently, peatland fragments should not be considered as a solution to long-term conservation needs in southern Quebec, at least not for plant and animal species of open bogs. This study also shows that even ecosystems known to be resistant to invasions by exotic species (such as peatlands) can be strongly affected by fragmentation and by their surrounding environment on a long-term basis.

AB The agricultural use of peatlands, the stabilization of the substrate for building or road construction or for increasing the capacity of soil to support heavy machinery for industrial activities (peat and petroleum extraction), harvesting to provide peat for energy, and the growing media and initiation of chemical processes must be preceded by drainage. As a consequence of drainage, peat underwent an irreversible conversion into moorsh (secondary transformation of the peat). The object of the study was to investigate comparatively the organic matter composition and molecular structure of humic acids (HAs) in the raised bog, fen, and peat-moorsh soils developed in various compositions of botanical cover, peat-forming species, and oxic and anoxic conditions as a result of the oscillation of ground water during drainage as well as to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition. Drainage was shown to be the principal factor causing the various chemical compositions and physicochemical properties of HAs. Large and significant differences in chemical composition of peat and the properties of HAs were found to be related to the degree of decomposition. The HAs from drained peatlands were less chemically mature. In contrast, the HAs from fen and raised bog were found to be more mature than that of the corresponding drained peatlands. The above findings showed the distinguishable structure of HAs within the soil profile created by the plant residue biodegradation and formed in both oxic and anoxic conditions. The analytical methods of thermal analysis together with the optical densities and paramagnetic behaviour are suitable and effective tools for studying structure-property relationships characterizing the origin and formation process of HAs in various environmental conditions.

AB Peatlands occupy about 4% of Poland's area and perform important environmental and economic functions, including agricultural ones. In the last century, the majority of fen peatlands were drained for agricultural use. Drainage reduced the water retention of peat and initiated changes in their physical and water properties. In order to determine the rate and extent of changes in these properties, in the following years 1987, 2007 and 2018, studies were carried out within the Suprasl Dolna fen peatland, NE Poland, in two prognostic soil-moisture complexes: moist (PSMC-B) and dry (PSMC-C). Studies have shown that in the PSMC-B complex, the water table depth decreased to a maximum of 100 cm below ground level, while on the PSMC-C complex, the ground water decreased even to 150 cm below ground level. In the PSMC-B complex, peat mineralisation and physical-water properties changed to a small extent during the research period (statistically insignificant). In the PSMC-C habitat, the subsidence of peatland surface was observed (11 cm), bulk density increased, whereas the total porosity and full water capacity decreased. Deterioration in physical and water properties caused gradual degradation of drained fen peatland soils and their evolution towards organo-mineral soils. In order to slow down or even stop degradation processes in shallow and medium deep peat-mursh soils, there is a need to stop and regulate the outflow of water using efficient drainage facilities, as well as to carry out technical restoration works.

AB When restoring ecosystems, the simple removal of stresses causing degradation may seem preferable over other more costly and time consuming approaches. However, some restoration techniques can be implemented at reasonable cost and with increased efficiency in certain cases. We examined the successional trajectories of vegetation within abandoned block-cut peatlands in a major peat-producing region of Eastern Canada to evaluate whether the use of rewetting as a restoration technique can assist in the recovery of a typical bog plant community dominated by Sphagnum compared to spontaneous recolonization alone. We surveyed a total of 55 trenches in 6 peatlands twice, similar to 25 and similar to 35 years after the cessation of peat extraction. Canonical ordinations evidenced a generalized process of afforestation during the decade studied, partially driven by agricultural drainage in the surrounding landscape. Plant communities were dominated by ericaceous shrubs that hampered the spontaneous recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system typical of bogs in the short and medium-term. Three of the six peatlands surveyed were partially restored by blocking drainage ditches. There, we surveyed plant composition in rewetted (28) and non-rewetted (26) trenches and observed that rewetting mitigated the increase in tree dominance, decreased the dominance by ericaceous shrubs, and favored the spread of non-vascular species with a wet habitat preference (notably Sphagnum species from the Cuspidata section). We conclude that the use of low intervention restoration techniques in block-cut bogs, such as the blockage of former drainage ditches, can re-orient undesired vegetation trajectories driven by spontaneous recolonization alone.

AB Even though bogs function as the most important terrestrial carbon store on Earth and play a crucial role in the conservation of highly endangered species, the area covered by peatlands is declining globally. Consequently, numerous restoration efforts within degraded bogs have been realized. In many cases, however, it is unknown whether the conservation measures have been successful.
   We used Odonata (hereafter referred to as dragonflies) as ecological indicators to evaluate the restoration success of rewetting measures in central European degraded raised bogs. Depending on their land-use history (rewetted industrial peat cuts with and without former agricultural use), two types of bog restoration were compared with rural peat cuts (control).
   Our study demonstrated that restored bogs are important habitats for dragonfly conservation. Both types of restored bogs were as diverse in overall species richness as the control plots. However, land-use history had a strong effect on restoration success. All raised-bog species of the study area were able to recolonize at least some of the nutrient-poor restored bogs. The situation was different for the nutrient-rich restored bogs. Due to the high nutrient content - caused by the former agricultural use - the characteristic dragonfly fauna of raised bogs will be unlikely to be able to recolonize in these locations in the long term. Nevertheless, the nutrient-rich restored bogs represent an important secondary habitat, especially for transition-bog species. In conclusion, the conducted restoration measures created a network of small oligo- to mesotrophic water bodies, which fosters aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in bogs.

AB This study proposed that due to their high standing water tables that peatlands would be cold humid islands within their landscape, and especially so relative to farmland on mineral soils. To test this hypothesis, we measured air temperature and humidity at 17 locations along a 7.8 km transect across the UK's largest lowland raised bog from February 2018 to January 2019. Air temperature and humidity were measured hourly for 1 year and supported with spot albedo measurements. The study represented a factorial experiment with respect to sites of measurement, the type of land use (peat vs. arable land) and time of sampling over both the seasonal and diurnal cycles. We show that: (a) That although mean annual temperature was not significantly different between arable and peatlands, the arable land showed a decreased amplitude to its seasonal cycle - this is the reverse of the expected pattern. (b) The albedo of the peatland was significantly lower than that of arable land showing that vegetated peatland still absorbed more solar radiation. (c) The specific humidity was lower on the peatland than on the surrounding arable land. The study showed that while shrubby vegetation exists over a peatland then energy budgets are more likely to be dominated by the lower aerodynamic resistance and lower albedo of the vegetated peatland relative to arable land. Thus, shrub-dominated peatlands will not be a cold humid island in their landscape.

AB Numerous peatlands in eastern North America are currently experiencing an accelerated process of tree encroachment. Deciduous species, particularly gray birch, can sometimes form large, dense stands. Our objectives were to document the periods during which gray birch established in temperate peatlands of southern Quebec (Canada), and examine the factors that may have contributed to such massive establishment. We hypothesized that the abundant presence of gray birch is a relatively recent phenomenon associated with human activities that are creating conditions favorable to the establishment of this species. We analyzed dendrochronological, plant-macrofossil, aerial photographs and climatic data for 10 sites. All of the peatlands recently experienced a major increase in forest cover. The first sign of gray birch establishment dates back to the 1950s, although at over half of sites, establishment took place after 1980. Abundant macroremains of the species were found only in the upper portion of peat deposits. Birch encroachment most often occurred after a fire had spread through the peatland. Increasing agricultural and draining activities on the periphery of the peatlands, that coincides with drier climatic conditions, likely induced a drying out of the peat, thereby creating conditions propitious for fire and subsequent germination and growth of birch seeds.

AB Methane emission feedbacks in wetlands are predicted to influence global climate under climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Herein, we review the taxonomy and physiological ecology of the microorganisms responsible for methane production in peatlands. Common in peat soils are five of the eight described orders of methanogens spanning three phyla (Euryarchaeota, Halobacterota and Thermoplasmatota). The phylogenetic affiliation of sequences found in peat suggest that members of the thus-far-uncultivated group Candidatus Bathyarchaeota (representing a fourth phylum) may be involved in methane cycling, either anaerobic oxidation of methane and/or methanogenesis, as at least a few organisms within this group contain the essential gene, mcrA, according to metagenomic data. Methanogens in peatlands are notoriously challenging to enrich and isolate; thus, much remains unknown about their physiology and how methanogen communities will respond to environmental changes. Consistent patterns of changes in methanogen communities have been reported across studies in permafrost peatland thaw where the resulting degraded feature is thermokarst. However much remains to be understood regarding methanogen community feedbacks to altered hydrology and warming in other contexts, enhanced atmospheric pollution (N, S and metals) loading and direct anthropogenic disturbances to peatlands like drainage, horticultural peat extraction, forestry and agriculture, as well as post-disturbance reclamation.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from agricultural soils. As a consequence of both drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic mixing with mineral soils, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use underwent a secondary transformation of the peat (e.g. formation of aggregates). These soils show contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. However, the carbon (C) dynamics of such soils have rarely been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition over the whole range of peat-derived soils under agriculture including very carbon rich mineral soils (76-526 g kg(-1) SOC). A total of 62 soil samples covering a broad range of soil and site characteristics were selected from the sample set of the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. Potential CO2 production was measured by aerobic incubation. Fen and bog peat samples were grouped into disturbance classes according to their soil properties. Specific basal respiration rates (SBR), i.e. CO2 fluxes per unit SOC, showed the highest values for the most disturbed samples for both fen peat (13.9 +/- 6.0 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)) and bog peat (10.9 +/- 4.7 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)). Respiration rates of bog peat increased more strongly with an increasing degree of disturbance than those of fen peat. Perhaps counterintuitively, SOM vulnerability to decomposition thus increased with an increasing degree of disturbance and a decreasing SOC content, indicating positive feedback mechanisms as soon as peat soils are disturbed by drainage. Furthermore, the variability of the SBR increased drastically with increasing degree of disturbance. The turnover of SOM in less disturbed peat samples tended to be higher in samples with higher nitrogen (N) content, higher pH value and lower C:N ratio, while plant-available phosphorus was important for the mineralisation of more severely disturbed peat. However, clear correlations between a single soil property and SBR could not be identified. The high potential of CO2 emissions from organic soils with a low SOC content implies that mixing organic soil with mineral soil does not seem to be a promising option for mitigating greenhouse emissions.

AB Natural peatlands provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and habitat, which can be negatively affected (degraded) by the proximity of agricultural land due to lowered water table and increased nutrient deposition. We assessed peat biochemistry and microbial function in the dry, fluctuating and saturated zones of the peat deposits at Moanatuatua (degraded) and Kopuatai (intact) raised bogs in New Zealand to investigate the effects of adjacent agriculture on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Peat C and N density were elevated, due in part to greater bulk density, in the dry and saturated zones at Moanatuatua compared with Kopuatai. Functional capacity (multi-substrate induced respiration) at Moanatuatua was greater than at Kopuatai, and water-soluble C was at lower concentration but more degradable, indicating that microbes were C limited at Moanatuatua but N limited at Kopuatai. Greater microbial function at Moanatuatua infers C inputs may be more rapidly converted to gaseous or waterborne exports, and agriculturally affected peatlands may be more susceptible to losses of labile C. We conclude that proximity to agriculture is likely to have caused changes in chemical properties and altered microbial functioning of restiad bog and has important implications for C and N turnover within these peatland systems.

ID PEAT
AB Sphagnum farming provides an alternative to detrimental peatland drainage in two ways. Firstly, Sphagnum mosses are cultivated on rewetted peatlands. Secondly, Sphagnum biomass is a high-quality growing media constituent suitable for replacing peat in horticulture. This study investigated the shift from drained bog grassland to a wet Sphagnum farming site from the micro-economic perspective. Based on five years of field experience, we calculated costs and revenues of Sphagnum farming for a total cultivation time of 20 years. Sensitivity analysis encompassed costs, yields, prices and the effect of public non-market payments. We found that cultivated Sphagnum biomass could not compete with peat at current market prices, whereas its use for orchid cultivation was economically viable in the case of medium to high Sphagnum productivity. Selling Sphagnum shoots as founder or "seeding" material was profitable even in pessimistic scenarios with high costs and low yields. Cost-covering prices for Sphagnum biomass substituting peat seem achievable, if end consumers pay a surcharge of 10 % for plants cultivated without using peat (peat free). A commercial-scale implementation, an increasing market demand for renewables, and setting climate targets for the agricultural and horticultural sectors will accelerate the development of Sphagnum farming as a profitable alternative to drainage-based peatland agriculture and peat extraction.

AB Water table depth (WTD) is one of the key variables controlling many processes in peatlands. Reliable WTD estimates based on remote sensing data would advance peatland research from global-scale climate monitoring to field-scale ecosystem management. Here, we evaluate the relationship between ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) C-band backscatter (sigma degrees) and in situ observed WTD dynamics over 17 peatlands in Germany covering deeply-drained to natural conditions, excluding peatlands dominated by forest or inundation periods. The results show increasing sigma degrees with shallower WTD (= wetter conditions), with average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.38 and 0.54 (-) for natural (also including disturbed and rewetted/restored states) and agriculturally-used drained peatlands, respectively. The anomaly correlation further highlights the potential of ASAR backscatter to capture interannual variations with values of 0.33 and 0.43 (-), for natural and drained peatlands. The skill metrics, which are similar to those for evaluations of top soil moisture from C-band over mineral soils, indicate a strong capillary connection between WTD and the ' C-band-sensitive' top 1-2 cm of peat soils, even during dry periods with WTD at around -1 m. Various backscatter processing algorithms were tested without significant differences. The cross-over angle concept for correcting dynamical vegetation effects was tested, but not superior, to constant incidence angle correction.

AB Peatlands have been subject to artificial drainage for centuries. This drainage has been in response to agricultural demand, forestry, horticultural and energy properties of peat and alleviation of flood risk. However, there are several environmental problems associated with drainage of peatlands. This paper describes the nature of these problems and examines the evidence for changes in hydrological and hydrochemical processes associated with these changes. Traditional black-box water balance approaches demonstrate little about wetland dynamics and therefore the science of catchment response to peat drainage is poorly understood. It is crucial that a more process-based approach be adopted within peatland ecosystems. The environmental problems associated with peat drainage have led, in part, to a recent reversal in attitudes to peatlands and we have seen a move towards wetland restoration. However, a detailed understanding of hydrological, hydrochemical and ecological process-interactions will be fundamental if we are to adequately restore degraded peatlands, preserve those that are still intact and understand the impacts of such management actions at the catchment scale.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pristine peatlands and peatlands drained for agriculture, forestry or peat extraction have been studied intensively. However, few studies have compared GHG emissions from peatlands under different land-use type within the same peatland area. This study examined methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and respiration (CO2) from a peatland complex in northern Finland, including a peatland used for grass cultivation, a Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens dominated forested peatland, a peat-extraction site and a pristine mire. Gas fluxes were measured in 2011 and 2012 with chambers during the snow-free period, and using the snow-gradient method in winter 2012/2013. Soil respiration was highest in the cultivated site (median during growing season 350 mg CO, m(-2) h(-1)), and lower in the forest site and in the peat-extraction site (median for growing season 49 and 130 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The peat-extraction site and the cultivated site were large sources of N2O during the growing season (median 89 and 28 pig m(-2) h(-1), respectively) and during the winter (median 56 and 460 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The pristine site was a large source of CH4 during the growing season (median 0.98 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas CH4 emissions from the drained sites during the growing season were minor. However, during winter, the peat-extraction site and the cultivated site emitted CH4 (median 0.58 and 0.029 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The cultivated site had the highest estimated CO2 equivalent emissions, due to the high CO2 and N2O fluxes, but the peat-extraction site also had large annual emissions, mainly as N2O.

AB Worldwide, drainage-based water management is applied to facilitate agricultural use of coastal peatland areas, leading to large-scale peat oxidation and land subsidence. Meanwhile, there is a strong call for a more sustainable use and management of drained peatlands. Drainage severely enhances greenhouse gas emission and land subsidence, which can be counteracted by rewetting. However, this advocated alternative may also induce unwanted processes affecting ecosystem functioning. In this overview we discuss the complex biogeochemical responses related to drainage and rewetting in peatlands and compare the biogeochemical effects of deep drainage to those of rewetting in order to identify the most sustainable management strategy for drained coastal peatlands. Due to drainage, oxidation of the iron sulphide pool leads to a highly underestimated source of sulphate for adjacent surface waters, indirectly enhancing eutrophication. Although rewetting also enhances eutrophication by mobilisation and discharge of phosphorus to surface waters, we propose this effect may be mitigated by co-discharged iron, binding phosphorus. As rewetting is expected to reduce societal costs and maximises ecosystem services of peatlands, we suggest to rewet drained agricultural peatlands wherever feasible. We discuss several promising, more sustainable, land use alternatives for rewetted coastal peatlands.

DE MECHANICAL PEAT CUTTING; BLANKET BOG; LAND USE CHANGE; MONITORING;
   PEATLAND
AB The amount of blanket peat in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) in Northern Ireland, its associated vegetation and recent changes in peatland exploitation have been estimated from a random sample of 25 ha grid squares stratified by multivariate land class.
   The total estimated area of peatland, defined on the basis of its vegetation, was 1190 km2, with approximately one third of this consisting of intact peat. The total estimated area of machine cut peat was 51.7 km2. Estimates of the area of peatland with active hand cutting, disused hand cutting, new drains, old drains, disturbance, burning and erosion have also been established.
   The rate of increase of mechanical peat cutting between 1987-1989 was marked in the Sperrins AONB (14.7% annual increase), particularly in wet bog. Most machine cut plots were being harvested by auger cutters for domestic purposes with a quarter of plots being cut commercially. Access to peat was largely by traditional tracks but in Fermanagh, a high proportion of plots were being accessed along recently constructed tracks.
   Regional variation in the composition and distribution of peatland vegetation is described, together with the methods and socio-economic context of mechanized peat extraction. The ecological effects of land use change on blanket bog vegetation are discussed, particularly in relation to peat extraction, agriculture and nature conservation.

AB Pristine peat soils are characterized by large porosity, low density and large water and organic matter contents. Drainage and management practices change peat properties by oxidation, compaction and mineral matter additions. This study examined differences in physical properties (hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, bulk density, porosity, von Post degree of decomposition) in soil profiles of two peatland forests, a cultivated peatland, a peat extraction area and two pristine mires originally within the same peatland area. Soil hydraulic conductivity of the drained sites (median hydraulic conductivities: 3.3 x 10(-5) m/s, 2.9 x 10(-8) m/s and 8.5 x 10(-8) m/s for the forests, the cultivated site and the peat extraction area, respectively) was predicted better by land use option than by soil physical parameters. Detailed physical measurements were accompanied by monitoring of the water levels between drains. The model 'DRAINMOD' was used to assess the hydrology and the rapid fluctuations seen in groundwater depths. Hydraulic conductivity values needed to match the simulation of observed depth to groundwater data were an order of magnitude greater than those determined in field measurements, suggesting that macropore flow was an important pathway at the study sites. The rapid response of depth to groundwater during rainfall events indicated a small effective porosity and this was supported by the small measured values of drainable porosity. This study highlighted the potential role of land use and macropore flow in controlling water table fluctuation and related processes in peat soils.

AB Peatland drainage has caused enormous environmental problems at global scale; in particular, ongoing greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation. In Belarus, which is rich in peatlands and a hotspot of emissions from drained peatlands, several thousand hectares have already been re-wetted but are not used productively. Moreover, vast areas of wet (undrained) peatland that are designated for nature conservation are in need of mowing and biomass removal. Plants such as common reed (Phragmites australis), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and sedges (Carex spp.) which frequently dominate these areas could be harvested and used as fuel, potentially as a substitute for peat. In this study we analysed the yield and combustibility of late harvests in March/April 2009 and 2010. The yields of 3.7-11.7 t DM ha(-1) were within the range reported from other studies on wetland plants. Concentrations of Cl, S, N, P, C, Ca, K, Mg and Na, as well as water and ash contents, indicated similar or better combustibility when compared to other strawlike (graminaceous) plants such as Miscanthus. The full replacement of peat fuel by biomass from wet peatlands in Belarus would require an area of 680,000 ha, i.e. 'only' half of the peatland that has been drained for agriculture.

AB Historical drainage of peatlands across the East Anglian Fenlands has led to subsidence and degradation of the vast majority of the regional peat resource, to the extent that many areas can no longer be classified as peatland. Water-table management strategies have been introduced to reduce the rate at which these peatlands subside and physically and biochemically degrade. We assessed the rate of subsidence and extent of peat soil degradation across an intensively farmed peatland where such water management measures have been introduced. When compared against historical reports of subsidence across the East Anglian Fenlands, the rate of subsidence does appear to have reduced over the last two decades. The rate of subsidence does, however, vary spatially and is dependent on the geographical distribution of peat types and underlying mineral deposits. The rate of subsidence and peat degradation has been greater in soil profiles which had a higher proportion of semi-fibrous and fibrous pears in 1982/3, compared against those with a higher proportion of humified peat in 1982/3. Over the last 22 years the proportion of more fibrous peat in all peat deposits has decreased to the extent that areas once classified as fibrous peat are now dominated by humified peat. This suggests that future subsidence will be less influenced by shrinkage and controlled by biochemical processes. Where Fen Clay underlies a peat deposit it acts as an impermeable boundary, thus keeping the overlying peat more saturated and reducing the degree of peat consolidation. However, the presence of Fen Clay also increases the degree of biochemical degradation of overlying fibrous peat horizons. Indeed, where drains have been laid within such mineral strata there is an increase in soil acidity. During autumnal drainage operations the environment is therefore optimised for sulfate reducing bacteria, resulting in acid sulfate soils with increased rates of degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) is a critical parameter to estimate the gross primary production (GPP) for terrestrial ecosystems from remotely sensed data. Only a few studies have estimated the LUE for boreal peatlands and none has calculated the LUE for a drained boreal peatland due to the limited availability of direct measurement of GPP and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), which are required to calculate the LUE. In this study, we used eddy covariance (EC) measurement of GPP and APAR at a drained peatland pasture and an adjacent boreal bog to calculate the LUE. The pasture had a significantly higher LUE (0.034 +/- 0.0109 mol mol(-1)) than the bog (0.028 +/- 0.098 mol mol(-1)). The LUE showed significant year-to-year variation at the pasture, but not at the bog. The LUE variation strongly correlated with air temperature and water table depth at both sites, but did not correlate well with vapor pressure deficit. This study indicates that agricultural drainage significantly alters the LUE of boreal peatlands and that the drained peatlands need to be considered separately in LUE-based models for northern peatlands. Moreover, a longer period of study is needed to fully understand the temporal dynamics of LUE in natural peatlands.

AB Methodological aspects of studying the organic carbon budget of drained peat bogs used in agriculture are discussed. Difficulties in the assessment of carbon budget on the basis of measured carbon inflows and outflows are shown. The "soil pool" model of the carbon budget is suggested. It is based on the results of long-term experimental studies of a drained peatland in Ukrainian Polesie. An algorithm for calculating the carbon budget in the aerated part of the peatland-the peat soil proper-is developed with due account for a gradual involvement of the deep peat layers into the zone of soil processes. Data on the loss of dry peat mass and organic carbon per in the course of peat mineralization and surface subsidence are given with due account for the nature of the peatland and the duration of its agricultural use.

ID CARBON-CYCLE; GROWTH; BOGS
AB On a global scale, over the past 200 years peatlands have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Drainage for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction have resulted in a 16-37 per cent loss in the carbon sink capacity. The current scenarios for climate change in Britain will exacerbate this loss. A shift in the carbon balance of peatlands is not necessarily the only outcome of climate change. Indirect hydrological changes-especially alteration of the position of the peat water table-will affect the stability of peatland ecosystems. This raises a number of questions concerning the future of British peatlands: the most important of which is how will the water balance change on a regional scale? In Britain the potential response of peatlands to climate change varies spatially. In upland areas, where rainfall is the main source of water, the key question is will erosion increase and if so, how fast? It will also be important to establish the drainage network response in terms of run-off, sediment loading and stream water quality. Increased precipitation may increase the rate of sedimentation in reservoirs thus affecting their water-holding capacity and water quality. Enhanced decomposition at elevated temperatures may also increase the microbial release of humic acids and increase the incidence of colour in upland waters which will in turn increase the cost of water quality treatment. In lowland Britain, the increased flood risk and more or less permanently elevated water table (as a result of both a rising sea level and sinking land surface) may enable peat regeneration through paludification. Key areas that are likely to be affected have spring or floodwater as their main source of water. They include the Norfolk Broads, Suffolk valley peats, Cambridgeshire Fens, Humberhead Levels, Derwent Ings and possibly the Somerset and Gwent Levels. In order to minimize the effects of climate change on peatlands and to preserve their existing carbon sink capacity (however small) they must remain hydrologically intact, and as high a water table as possible must be maintained. This may be possible in low-lying areas if flooding reinstates paludification but the process of peat regeneration is a slow one. In upland areas the effect of climate change is less clear; increased precipitation may encourage peat formation but it may also result in greater erosion.

AB Of all terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands store carbon most effectively in long-term scales of millennia. However, many peatlands have been drained for peat extraction or agricultural use. This converts peatlands from sinks to sources of carbon, causing approx. 5% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect and additional negative effects on other ecosystem services. Rewetting peatlands can mitigate climate change and may be combined with management in the form of paludiculture. Rewetted peatlands, however, do not equal their pristine ancestors and their ecological functioning is not understood. This holds true especially for groundwater-fed fens. Their functioning results from manifold interactions and can only be understood following an integrative approach of many relevant fields of science, which we merge in the interdisciplinary project WETSCAPES. Here, we address interactions among water transport and chemistry, primary production, peat formation, matter transformation and transport, microbial community, and greenhouse gas exchange using state of the art methods. We record data on six study sites spread across three common fen types (Alder forest, percolation fen, and coastal fen), each in drained and rewetted states. First results revealed that indicators reflecting more long-term effects like vegetation and soil chemistry showed a stronger differentiation between drained and rewetted states than variables with a more immediate reaction to environmental change, like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variations in microbial community composition explained differences in soil chemical data as well as vegetation composition and GHG exchange. We show the importance of developing an integrative understanding of managed fen peatlands and their ecosystem functioning.

AB Peatland soils play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle due to their high organic carbon content. Lowering of the water table e.g. for agricultural use accelerates aerobic secondary peat decomposition and processes of earthification. Peatlands change from C sinks to C sources. We characterized soil organic matter (SOM) with special attention to human impact through drainage. Our aim was to gain knowledge of SOM quality and soil-forming processes in drained fen soils in northeastern Germany.
   Through techniques of representative landscape analysis, we identified two typical and representative sampling sites in different stages of land use, representing the most important hydrogenetic mire types in northeastern Germany. We adapted chemical fractionation procedures which include hot water extraction (C-hwe and N-hwe) for determination of the labile fraction. Furthermore, a stepwise acid hydrolysis procedure was performed to measure the chemical recalcitrant part of SOM as it is more resistant to biodegradability.
   Total organic C decreased with increasing human impact and intensity of drainage. Conversely, C-hwe and N-hwe concentrations increased with increasing drainage and human impact. In contrast, the more recalcitrant fractions increased with soil depth.
   Generally, there is a lack of existing data about SOM quality and the factors controlling its stability and decomposition in fen soils. For northeastern German fen soils, the data are even more inadequate. Influence of drainage seems to overlap natural influences of site on SOM quality. The used extraction scheme was suitable for the chemical fractionation of SOM into labile and more recalcitrant parts.

AB 1 Blanket mire in Northern Ireland is an ecologically threatened habitat in which land use for hand peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture has had a major influence. A recent land use change is the introduction of tractor-powered peat-harvesting. In this paper, the effect of machine peat-cutting on ombrotrophic blanket mire vegetation is assessed from a regional sample of cut and uncut plots.
   2 Principal components analysis identified watertable depth and grazing intensity as major factors influencing the species composition of uncut mire. A key variable affecting the composition of machine-cut mire across the drainage gradient was the number of times cut, with multiple annual cutting causing progressive decreases in acrotelm depth, catotelm bulk density and plant cover. Ericaceous species and Sphagnum spp. were particularly sensitive to cutting, with Eriophorum angustifolium and Campylopus introflexus characteristic of multiple-cut sites.
   3 Redundancy analysis, with number of times cut partialled out, showed that recovery time accounted for a significant amount of variance in vegetation composition. Species that significantly increased in abundance with recovery time were Sphagnum spp., Odontoschisma sphagni, Erica tetralix and Drosera rotundifolia.
   4 Sites cut frequently, or which were grazed, recovered more slowly. Recovery from cutting was partly dependent on the post-cutting structure of the mire surface and the species that survive cutting. The rate of recovery on sites cut once, then abandoned, is relatively rapid compared with multiple-cut sites where species colonization is constrained by bare compacted peat.

AB In the UK, drainage for agricultural reclamation during the 19th and 20th centuries is responsible for an alteration of the ecological and hydrological functioning of peatlands, in turn, affecting a whole suite of ecosystem services. Today, initiatives are in place throughout the UK to reinstate this eco-hydrological functioning by blocking drainage ditches. Effects on ecosystem services remain unclear, as does the overlapping impact of climate change on peatland recovery. This article uses a conceptual model to present the effects of restoration on ecosystem services, that is, water provision and quality, carbon storage, biodiversity, food and fibre provision and cultural services, both immediately after ditch blocking and in the few years post-restoration. The model is then applied in the context of Exmoor National Park, in South West England and used to perform a costbenefit analysis of the restoration and monitoring programme, as these shallow peatlands are located in geographically marginal areas, and therefore more sensitive to climate change. Past research indicates that some processes tend to return progressively to their predisturbance state, but whether the complete recovery of peatlands to functioning mires occurs after restoration remains unclear, partly due to the difference between the temporal and spatial scale at which processes occur (i.e. up to decadal) and are monitored (typically a few years). Overall, on Exmoor, the long-term benefit of peatland restoration to some ecosystem services, such as a reduction in carbon losses and improvement of water storage and quality, has the potential to balance high financial investment. Synthesis and applications. Gaining a better understanding of the effects of peatland restoration on ecosystem services provided is essential to assess the potential value of restoration projects. Using the case of the shallow peatlands of Exmoor National Park, located in geographically marginal areas in the UK and therefore more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, we find that there is potential for both the value of carbon storage and water provision to offset the costs of restoration in the long-term. Our results from Exmoor can provide ecological analogues of impending change further north.

AB 1. Multivariate analysis of vegetation and water beetles recorded in the abandoned drains and flooded workings of a cut-over lowland Irish raised bog, Montiaghs Moss, shows that water depth and trophic status are key predictors of plant species composition and that vegetation community structure significantly explains water beetle composition.
   2. The spatial distribution of secondary and tertiary drains and peat pits influences species composition indirectly, through trophic status, by connecting habitats with primary agricultural drains passing through the bog.
   3. Habitat isolation and the cessation of drain management promote change in the submerged aquatic vegetation, emergent-swamp and poor-fen habitats recorded by facilitating vegetation development and surface acidification.
   4. The ecological consequences are likely to be a reduction in the area of open-water habitats, the development of poor-fen vegetation and the subsequent loss of high conservation value species of plants and beetles.
   5. Management for biodiversity conservation should initially address water quality, for example, through the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive, followed by restoration to promote structural and spatial heterogeneity of drain and peat-pit habitats.
   6. At a landscape scale, implementing ditch and peat-pit management across abandoned cut-over lowland raised bog habitats in the farmed Northern Ireland countryside, through EU Common Agricultural Policy agri-environment schemes, would give regional gains.

TI Greenhouse impact due to different peat fuel utilisation chains in
   Finland - a life-cycle approach
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EMISSIONS; CO2
AB Greenhouse impacts of different peat fuel utilisation chains were studied. A life cycle approach was used in order to cover all important emissions and sinks due to activities linked to the peat fuel production and utilisation. Radiative forcing was used to describe the greenhouse impact, and the results are given per one petajoule of energy produced. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and sinks were considered. Investigated peat production reserves were pristine peatland (fen), forestry-drained peatland, and cultivated (cropland) peatland. The considered phases of the peat utilisation chain included peat fuel production, storage, transport, combustion and the after-treatment of the cut-away peatland. After-treatment alternatives were afforestation and restoration. The greenhouse impact of a considered peat fuel chain was calculated by subtracting the emissions/sinks of a production reserve in a state of non-utilisation from the emissions/sinks of peat utilisation chain. According to the results, the most climate-friendly peat production chain is cultivated peatland-afforestation. Cultivated peatland has large greenhouse gas emissions and these emissions from the land area are ceased by the removal of the peat layer, when the area is utilised for peat fuel production. If forestry-drained peatland or pristine fen is used for peat fuel production, the greenhouse impacts of these chains are of the order of the greenhouse impact of the utilisation chain for coal. Improvement of peat production and combustion methods can be applied to decrease to some extent the greenhouse effect of peat energy.

AB In the UK, the majority of peatlands have been damaged by drainage, agriculture, forestry plantations or erosion, compromising the ecosystem services they deliver including carbon sequestration. On the other hand, since the 1990s many projects have carried out a range of interventions to restore peatlands. In forest-to-bog restoration, tree removal and drain blocking lead to immediately visible changes. However, while some key plant species return within years, they may continue to exhibit differences in how they perform and interact with their environment. To investigate this, plant functional traits were measured and compared for Calluna vulgaris, Erica tetralix, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum papillosum collected in an open blanket bog, a forestry plantation and two forest-to-bog restoration sites in northern Scotland. Significantly lower specific leaf area and chlorophyll content, and higher leaf dry matter content, were found in the open bog site compared with plantation and forest-to-bog sites. This could be related to nutrient enrichment derived from brash and needle decomposition in the latter sites, suggesting a lasting effect of coniferous plantations even after decades of restoration management. Altered plant functional traits may have feedbacks on ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and peat formation.

AB Large peatland areas have been drained for forestry and agricultural purposes, resulting in the decline of characteristic biodiversity. Two measures commonly suggested for restoring drained fens is ditch blocking and tree removal to raise the groundwater table and increase light availability, respectively. In 2002, we initiated factorial restoration experiments, including ditch blocking and tree removal, in three former rich fens that had been drained for forestry purposes. Species cover of vascular plants and bryophytes were monitored during 8 years in permanent plots along transects perpendicular to the ditch for all four treatment combinations. Both methods had positive and independent effects on the cover of wetland vegetation. Specifically, Sphagnum species and wetland bryophytes showed a persistent positive response to both clear cutting and rewetting. Wetland vascular plants and grasses showed a persistent positive response to clear cutting. Sedges and species number responded positively to both clear cutting and ditch blocking, but the response was partly transient, and for species richness the response was limited when restoration methods were applied separately. Rich fen indicators of vascular plants and bryophytes did not respond to any of the restoration treatments. This indicates that species introduction in combination with further habitat restorations may be necessary to re-establish the original rich fen flora. Nevertheless, we conclude that the combination of ditch blocking and clear cutting are effective measures to partly restore wetland vegetation on previously drained and forested fens, while peat subsidence along the ditch may restrict the success further away from ditches.

TI Water Table and Vegetation Response to Ditch Blocking: Restoration of a

LA English
DT Article
ID SPHAGNUM REGENERATION; CUTOVER BOG; PEATLAND; MOISTURE; QUEBEC
AB Large-scale peat harvesting operations alter hydrology of raised bogs so that natural regeneration may not occur without altering the water table. This paper describes efforts to restore key hydrologic and ecologic processes in a southwest BC raised bog (Burns Bog) highly disturbed by decades of peat extraction, drainage, filling, and conversion to agriculture, urban, and industrial uses. The restoration goals are to return a high water table throughout the bog, but particularly in the pine forests at the edge of the bog, to re-establish Sphagnum cover, and to re-start the peat-forming process in degraded peat-harvested sectors. Peripheral and interior ditches are being blocked to increase the retention of winter precipitation into the drier summer months. Piezometer/well measurements have detected water table increases in the past two years, including a relatively immediate response in one site. New Sphagnum colonies have become established in the dry perimeter forest, a first indication that the water table may be rising and that peat-forming vegetation may be responding positively. These preliminary results suggest that it is possible to detect a rapid hydrological response with a comprehensive monitoring net-work in raised bogs; this observation is key to early prediction of future peatland restoration initiatives.

AB The agricultural use of drained peatlands leads to huge emissions of greenhouse gases and nutrients. A land-use alternative that allows rewetting of drained peatland while maintaining agricultural production is the cultivation of Sphagnum biomass as a renewable substitute for fossil peat in horticultural growing media (Sphagnum farming).
   We studied Sphagnum productivity and nutrient dynamics during two years in two Sphagnum farming sites in NW Germany, which were established on drained bog grassland by sod removal, rewetting, and the introduction of Sphagnum fragments in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
   We found a considerable and homogeneous production of Sphagnum biomass (>3.6 ton DW ha(-1) yr(-1)), attributable to the high nutrient levels, low alkalinity, and even distribution of the irrigation water. The ammonium legacy from former drainage-based agriculture rapidly declined after rewetting, while nutrient mobilization was negligible. CH4 concentrations in the rewetted soil quickly decreased to very low levels. The Sphagnum biomass sequestered high loads of nutrients (46.0 and 47.4 kg N, 3.9 and 4.9 kg P, and 9.8 and 16.1 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 7.5 y and 2.5 y old sites, respectively), preventing off-site eutrophication.
   We conclude that Sphagnum farming as an alternative for drainage-based peatland agriculture may contribute effectively to tackling environmental challenges such as local and regional downstream pollution and global climate change. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands accumulate organic matter (OM) under anaerobic conditions. After drainage for forestry or agriculture, microbial respiration and peat oxidation induce OM losses and change the stoichiometry of the remaining organic material. Here, we (i) evaluate whether land use (cropland CL, grassland GL, forest FL, natural peatland NL) is associated with different peat stoichiometry, (ii) study how peat stoichiometry changes with OM content and (iii) infer the fate of nitrogen upon soil degradation. Organic C and soil N were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland degradation. OM contents (CL<GL<FL<NL), H/C, O/C, C/N ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce a progressed state of soil degradation.

AB Global peatlands store more carbon than is naturally present in the atmosphere(1,2). However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland(3-5). Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems(6). Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions.

AB Commercial cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is cultivated on postglacial deposits of peat capped by 0.3-1 m of anthropogenic sand. Despite distinct soil layering, a general paucity of information exists on the physical properties of sand and peat in cranberry bogs. Field measurements and ground penetrating radar (GPR) were used to determine sand and peat thicknesses of 30 cranberry bogs in Massachusetts, United States. GPR-based estimates of peat volume and detailed soil maps were then used to develop a geospatial model of mean peat thickness (L*) in cranberry bogs. The model was applied to 505 cranberry bogs that covered in area of 2827 ha. Based on model results and field measurements, average sand and peat thicknesses were 0.5 and 0.9 m, respectively. For individual bogs, mean peat thickness exhibited considerable range, with deep peat (L* > 1.8 m) identified in 22% of the cranberry bogs. Peat was absent (L* = 0 m) in 26% of the cranberry bogs, which reflected modified upland or glaciolacustrine soils rather than peat. Using average thickness, nutrient concentration, and bulk density of peat and sand layers, a typical cranberry bog stores 750 Mg ha(-1) of carbon, 22,900 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen, and 790 kg ha(-1) of phosphorus. We estimate that peat stores 91% and 78% (by mass) of carbon and nitrogen in cranberry bogs, respectively. In contrast, sand stores the majority of P (78% by mass) in cranberry bogs.

AB The growing demand for bioenergy increases pressure on peatlands. The novel strategy of wet peatlands agriculture (paludiculture) may permit the production of bioenergy from biomass while avoiding large greenhouse gas emissions as occur during conventional crop cultivation on drained peat soils. Herein, we present the first greenhouse gas balances of a simulated paludiculture to assess its suitability as a biomass source from a climatic perspective. In a rewetted peatland, we performed closed-chamber measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide exchange in stands of the potential crops Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, and Carex acutiformis for two consecutive years. To simulate harvest, the biomass of half of the measurement spots was removed once per year. Carbon dioxide exchange was close to neutral in all tested stands. The effect of biomass harvest on the carbon dioxide exchange differed between the 2years. During the first and second year, methane emissions were 13-63gm(-2)a(-1) and 2-5gm(-2)a(-1), respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions lay below our detection limit. Net greenhouse gas balances in the study plots were close to being climate neutral during both years except for the Carex stand, which was a source of greenhouse gases in the first year (in CO2-equivalents: 18 tha(-1)a(-1)). Fifteen years after rewetting the net greenhouse gas balance of the study site was similar to those of pristine fens. In addition, we did not find a significant short-term effect of biomass harvest on net greenhouse gas balances. In our ecosystem, 17 tha(-1)a(-1) of CO2-equivalent emissions are saved by rewetting compared to a drained state. Applying this figure to the fen area in northern Germany, emission savings of 2.8-8.5 Mta(-1) CO2-equivalents could possibly be achieved by rewetting; this excludes additional savings by fossil fuel replacement.

AB A peat core from the Barschpfuhl kettlehole mire in north-east Germany was analysed for multiproxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk density, loss on ignition), to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 300 years. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards. The mire hydrology of this relatively small bog was heavily influenced by forestry changes in the area. The climate signal was therefore obscured. Afforestation with fast-growing conifers and drainage for agricultural purposes resulted in a lowering of the water level, changes in trophic status, changes in mire surface vegetation and increased decomposition of the peat. Variations in the openness and cultivated land indicators in the pollen data of Barschpfuhl reflect regional population density and land use changes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A drained boreal bog with active drainage ditches and the introduction of forage grass was compared with a natural bog site to assess the effect of agricultural drainage on the photosynthetic capacity of boreal peatlands. In this study, the net carbon dioxide uptake and the ecosystem respiration were measured using a pair of clear and dark chambers, connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer in order to estimate the gross primary production (GPP). Environmental factors, including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), peat soil temperature, soil moisture, electrical conductivity and water table depth (WTD), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were also investigated at each site. Our results confirmed a correlation between water table depth, peat soil temperature, electrical conductivity and peatland productivity. Changes in electrical conductivity, water table depth, and peat soil temperature together explained 61% of gross primary productivity variance at our drained peatland pasture site. In general, plant functional types/growth forms did not have any significant difference in their GPP at the drained site except shrubs which had a significantly higher GPP at PAR level greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, p < 0.001). At the natural site, GPP was significantly higher at the hollow (0.168 +/- 0.02 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.098 +/- 0.01 mg/m(2)/s) where relatively the higher WTD was recorded. We therefore concluded that water shortage to the shallow rooting depth of shrubs on our hummock subplots may be the cause of the low productivity. At PAR greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s, productivity at the hollow was still significantly higher (0.17 +/- 0.002 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.10 +/- 0.00 mg/m(2)/s). This suggests that, for ecosystem carbon modelling, the minimum PAR level at which the GPP is estimated is very crucial. All the growth forms at the drained site recorded a significantly higher GPP than the microforms at the natural site. We speculate that not only hydrological changes via agricultural drainage can affect the carbon balance of boreal peatland ecosystem through photosynthesis, but also the hydrological changes in the peat due to the differences in peat soil makeup, structure and density. We, therefore, conclude that differences in microtopography and the corresponding changes in vegetation, land-use practice and its effects on peat soil properties and hydrology should be taken into account when modelling the gross primary production in a peatland ecosystem.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is approximately 265 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2) in atmospheric warming. Degraded peatlands are important sources of N2O. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the N2O-N emissions from peat. In this study, soil bulk density was used as a proxy for peat degradation to predict N2O-N emissions. Here we report that the annual N2O-N emissions from European managed peatlands (EU-28) sum up to approximately 145 Gg N year(-1). From the viewpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, highly degraded agriculturally used peatlands should be rewetted first to optimally reduce cumulative N2O-N emissions. Compared to a business-as-usual scenario (no peatland rewetting), rewetting of all drained European peatlands until 2050 using the suggested strategy reduces the cumulative N2O-N emissions by 70%. In conclusion, the status of peat degradation should be made a pivotal criterion in prioritising peatlands for restoration.
   Rewetting agricultural peatlands first is the best strategy for reducing cumulative nitrous oxide emissions from European peatlands, according to an analysis of soil bulk density as a proxy for peat degradation.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been important global carbon sinks throughout the Holocene. Most of the research on peatland carbon budgets and effects of variable weather conditions has been done in Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated systems. Given their importance in other geographic and climatic regions, a better understanding of peatland carbon dynamics is needed across the spectrum of global peatland types. In New Zealand, much of the historic peatland area has been drained for agriculture but little is known about rates of carbon exchange and storage in unaltered peatland remnants that are dominated by the jointed wire rush, Empodisma robustum. We used eddy covariance to measure ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes and a water balance approach to estimate the sub-surface flux of dissolved organic carbon from the largest remaining raised peat bog in New Zealand, Kopuatai bog. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was estimated over four years, which included two drought summers, a relatively wet summer, and a meteorologically average summer. In all measurement years, the bog was a substantial sink for carbon, ranging from 134.7 to 216.9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), owing to the large annual net ecosystem production (161.8 to 244.9 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1)). Annual methane fluxes were large relative to most Northern Hemisphere peatlands (14.2 to 21.9 gCH(4)-Cm-2 yr(-1)), although summer and autumn emissions were highly sensitive to dry conditions, leading to very predictable seasonality according to water table position. The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon was similar in magnitude to methane emissions but less variable, ranging from 11.7 to 12.8 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Dry conditions experienced during late summer droughts led to significant reductions in annual carbon storage, which resulted nearly equally from enhanced ecosystem respiration due to lowered water tables and increased temperatures, and from reduced gross primary production due to vapor pressure deficit-related stresses to the vegetation. However, the net C uptake of Kopuatai bog during drought years was large relative to even the maximum reported NECB from Northern Hemisphere bogs. Furthermore, global warming potential fluxes indicated the bog was a strong sink for greenhouse gases in all years despite the relatively large annual methane emissions. Our results suggest that adaptations of E. robustum to dry conditions lead to a resilient peatland drought response of the NECB.

AB 1. Peatlands are globally important habitats, which act as net carbon stores. As a result of drainage, peat extraction and agricultural intensification, raised bogs in the midlands of Ireland are a diminishing and increasingly fragmented peatland habitat. A network of protected sites has been established, which is intended to represent the best abiotic and plant community systems.
   2. Lepidoteran communities are an important component of raised bog biodiversity and may be useful as biodiversity indicators, yet they are a neglected area of research.
   3. We address this by surveying night-flying macro-moths on six protected and six degraded raised bogs to establish whether there is a distinct moth fauna associated with the wettest areas of protected sites by comparing them to assemblages found on degraded sites where this wet habitat has been lost.
   4. In general, differences between moth assemblages on protected and degraded raised bogs are rather subtle, with assemblages on both site types generally similar. But, a number of species were found to be associated with protected sites, three of which are bog-associated species of conservation concern and may be particularly vulnerable due to the continuing loss of the wettest areas of raised bogs.
   5. Degraded sites were found to harbour a significant number of bog-associated species of conservation concern and may have a role to play in peatland invertebrate conservation, hitherto undervalued. To determine this, further research is required to describe the invertebrate fauna of these sites and of marginal areas of protected sites.

AB Questions: What vegetation changes occurred over three decades on two large temperate peatlands (1115 ha) isolated in an agricultural landscape and affected by a human-ignited fire?
   Location: Southwest Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: In 2012, we revisited 103 plots first sampled in 1984-85. Changes in species composition were evaluated using the Sorensen dissimilarity index, in species frequency with Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, and in species cover using one-sample t-tests. Tree encroachment was evaluated using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. We used linear discriminant analyses (LDA) and ANOVA to evaluate the impact of tree encroachment on species composition.
   Results: We found a floristic dissimilarity of 35% between 1984 and 1985 and 2012. Most species whose frequency and mean cover increased were peatland species, while most species with lower frequency and mean cover in 2012 were non-peatland species. The total area occupied by forest increased from 26% to 51%, an overall gain of 280 ha of forest. The species composition of old and new forests as well as of open sectors was highly distinct, as shown by the LDA that correctly assigned 97% of the sampling plots to these groups. Non-peatland species were 15 and five timesmore abundant than peatland species in old and new forests than open habitats, respectively.
   Conclusions: Gradual drying of the peatland margins due to drainage of the surrounding catchment, as well as post-fire succession are likely the main drivers of the changes observed. Overall, our study showed that peatlands isolated in an anthropogenic landscape are dynamic ecosystems where vegetation communities can experience substantial changes in a short time frame. The broader implication is that peatland conservation in highly modified landscapes must be linked to restoration.

AB Managed northern peatlands are an important source of the strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, N2O emissions from these managed peatlands display a high spatial variability, and processes governing N2O production and emissions from these ecosystems are still not well understood. To constrain the factors regulating N2O emissions from managed northern peat soils, we determined a wide set of soil physical and chemical properties of peatlands with different management histories spread across Finland, Sweden and Iceland. We included eleven peatland sites with available in situ N2O flux data, and complemented our analyses with detailed measurements of soil nitrogen (N) cycling processes such as N2O production, gross N mineralization and gross nitrification and, in addition, soil microbial biomass. This study included drained peatlands with different land-use types and management intensities, comprising forested, cultivated or only drained peatlands and afforested or abandoned agricultural peatlands. All selected peatland sites displayed a low soil carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 15-27, traditionally used to predict high N2O emissions. Despite the narrow C/N range, the N2O emissions at our sites varied greatly within and between land-use groups, ranging from 0.03 to 2.38 g N m(-2) y(-1). Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory factors underlying the variability in N2O emissions and show that a low C/N ratio in managed peatlands cannot be used to predict high N2O emissions. Instead, our results demonstrate that higher N2O emissions are linked to higher peat phosphorus (P) and copper (Cu) content, suggesting that low P and Cu concentrations can limit N2O production in peat even with sufficient N availability. While known factors such as soil moisture, oxygen content and the degree of peat humification partially explained the variability in N2O emissions, this study directly links soil P and Cu availability to N2O production processes. The availability of P and especially Cu seemed to promote nitrification activities, thereby increasing N2O production. Our study highlights the link between N2O emissions and soil P and Cu availability and the strong coupling of the soil N and P cycles in peatlands, which is to date severely understudied.

AB Drainage turns peatlands from natural carbon sinks into hotspots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils due to alterations in hydrological and biogeochemical processes. As a consequence of drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic sand addition, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use have soil organic carbon (SOC) contents at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. Previous research has shown that the variability of GHG emissions increases with anthropogenic disturbance. However, how and whether sand addition affects GHG emissions remains a controversial issue. The aim of this long-term incubation experiment was to assess the influence of hydrological and biogeochemical soil properties on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Strongly degraded peat with sand addition (peat-sand mixtures) and without sand addition (earthified peat) was systematically compared under different moisture conditions for fen and bog peat. Soil columns originating from both the topsoil and the subsoil of ten different peatlands under grassland use were investigated. Over a period of six months the almost saturated soil columns were drained stepwise via suction to -300 hPa. The CO2 fluxes were lowest at water-saturated and dry soil moisture conditions, resulting in a parabolic dependence of CO2 fluxes on the water-filled pore space (WFPS) peaking at 56-92% WFPS. The highest N2O fluxes were found at between 73 and 95% WFPS. Maximum CO2 fluxes were highest from topsoils, ranging from 21 to 77 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while the maximum CO2 fluxes from subsoils ranged from 3 to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1). No systematic influence of peat type or sand addition on GHG emissions was found in topsoils, but CO2 fluxes from subsoils below peat-sand mixtures were higher than from subsoils below earthified peat. Maximum N2O fluxes were highly variable between sites and ranged from 18.5 to 234.9 and from 0.2 to 22.9 mu g N m-2 h-1 for topsoils and subsoils, respectively. CH4 fluxes were negligible even under water-saturated conditions. The highest GHG emissions occurred at a WFPS that relates - under equilibrium conditions - to a water table of 20-60 cm below the surface in the field. High maximum CO2 and N2O fluxes were linked to high densities of plant-available phosphorus and potassium. The results of this study highlight that nutrient status plays a more important role in GHG emissions than peat type or sand addition, and do not support the idea of peat-sand mixtures as a mitigation option for GHG emissions.

AB The drainage of low-lying peatland for agriculture and subsequent conservation measures adopted on some of these peatlands has led to differing degrees of change in the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the soil. We assessed the degree of peat decomposition and measured the soil organic matter (SOM) content, particle density, dry bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention and shrinkage characteristics for a range of peat soil horizons sampled in two low-lying agricultural peatland in England. The physical and hydraulic properties of the peats considered were significantly influenced by the degree of decomposition. Higher decomposition resulted in lower SOM content, higher bulk density and lower porosity. In addition, pedogenic alterations due to intensive drainage and land use lead to a greater degradation of the soil structure in the upper soil layers. Less decomposed peats had a higher propensity to shrink under increasing water potentials. They had a lower air entry pressure and drained faster than degraded peats. In addition, they had a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. This shows that decomposition and pedogenic alterations lead to the loss of structural pores. Hence decomposition and humification result in the degradation of the soil structure and a reduction in the soil capacity to store, retain and transmit water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands require soil improvement to be suitable for cultivation. Creating eco-friendly and cost-effective carbon sinks in peatlands originated from peat production has several benefits. For this purpose various valuable biomass can be used by utilizing industrial by-products also as soil conditioners and fertilizers. For example, the addition of such materials has potential to transform peat bogs, which otherwise would slowly release methane, into productive cultivated areas. The rehabilitation of peat bogs from unused land into various agricultural and forestry areas is also a viable business activity. The examined industrial by-products could have many agricultural applications in non-food potato production, wherein monoculture causes problems such as condensed soil, lost humus or soil organic matter, and reduced nutrient retention capacity, leading to increased leaching of nutrients and negative impacts on the environment. Five industrial by-products were examined in this study as soil conditioners and fertilizers: fiber sludge, biocarbon, hygienic biodigestate, paper mill sludge, and gypsum waste. Based on the results of a nutrient content analysis, hygienic biodigestate and fiber sludge were the most effective fertilizers.

If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO(2)emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 degrees C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO(2)throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protectionandrestoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.

ID SOIL PROPERTIES; CARBON; STRATIGRAPHY; GERMANY; FENS
AB The application of electrical resistivity tomography to peatlands supports conventional coring by providing data on the current condition of peatlands, including data on stratigraphy, peat properties and thickness of organic deposits. Data on the current condition of drained peatlands are particularly required to improve estimates of carbon storage as well as losses and emissions from agriculturally used peatlands. However, most of the studies focusing on electrical resistivity tomography surveys have been conducted on natural peatlands with higher groundwater levels. Peatlands drained for agriculture have not often been studied using geophysical techniques. Drained sites are characterized by low groundwater levels and high groundwater fluctuations during the year, which lead to varying levels of water saturation. To validate better electrical resistivity tomography surveys of drained peatlands, the aim of this laboratory study is to investigate the influence of varying water saturation levels on electrical conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) for a variety of peat and gyttja types, as well as for different degrees of peat decomposition. Results show that different levels of water saturation strongly influence bulk electrical conductivity. Distinct differences in this relationship exist between peat and gyttja substrates and between different degrees of peat decomposition. Peat shows an exponential relationship for all degrees of decomposition, whereas gyttja, in particular organic-rich gyttja, is characterized by a rather unimodal relationship. The slopes for the relationship between electrical conductivity and water content are steeper at high degrees of decomposition than for peat of low degrees of decomposition. These results have direct implications for field electrical resistivity tomography surveys. In drained peatlands that are strongly susceptible to drying, electrical resistivity tomography surveys have a high potential to monitor the actual field water content. In addition, at comparable water saturations, high or low degrees of decomposition can be inferred from electrical conductivity.

AB Peatlands drained for agriculture are sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Resulting emissions may depend on land-use, often as grassland or cropland, but few studies have directly compared the effects of land-uses. Here, we measured annual emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) from five sites in a temperate bog, representing an undrained natural bog (NB) site, and four drained sites used as permanent grassland (PG) and croplands with rotations of oat-potato, oat-spring barley and potato-spring barley (PO:SB) in the study year. Gas fluxes were measured at 1-2 week intervals using static chambers, and auxiliary data were obtained, such as temperature, depth of water table, ratio-vegetation index, pH and soil mineral N. Annual CO2 emissions were derived from empirical modelling, whereas CH4 and N2O emissions were linearly interpolated between measurement dates by bootstrapping. Soil respiration was lower at the NB site (1.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than at the drained sites where emissions were in the range of 5.0-8.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O emission was negligible at NB (0.3 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), low at three of the drained sites (1.5-3.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), but high at PO:SB (37.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). The CH4 emission was high at NB (172 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), but negligible at the drained sites (-1.5 to 1.5 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil respiration at the drained sites indicated that peat losses were rather similar among the different cropping systems and depended mostly on drainage status, although soil respiration and peat mineralization may not scale directly. The pattern of N2O emissions suggested an increased risk of N2O emission from potato cultivation before and after the period of potato growth, likely due to microbial availability of NO3- outside the growing season. For initiatives aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peat soils, this means that, e.g., conversion from cropland to permanent grassland should preferably be accompanied by measures of rewetting, whereas for potato cropping, N availability outside the growing season should be minimized.

AB Peatlands are ecosystems of exceptional conservation value because of their beauty, biodiversity, importance in global geochemical cycles, and the paleoenvironmental records they preserve. Commercial extraction and drainage for forestry or agriculture have caused the destruction of many peatlands, especially in or close to urban areas of the northern temperate zone. Are these commercial and environmental interests irreconcilable? A close analysis suggests that limited peat extraction may actually increase biodiversity in some cases, and may be sustainable over the long term. As we learn more about how peatlands spontaneously regenerate following disturbance, and what conditions govern the re-establishment of a diverse community and the ability to sequester carbon, we increase our chances of being able to restore damaged peatlands. Preserving the chronological records hidden in the peat profile, the natural heritage value of peatlands, and the bulk of sequestered carbon, however, will remain incompatible with any form of exploitation.

AB Peatlands are globally important areas for carbon preservation; although covering only 3% of global land area, they store 30% of total soil carbon. Lowland peat soils can also be very productive for agriculture, but their cultivation requires drainage as most crops are intolerant of root-zone anoxia. This leads to the creation of oxic conditions in which organic matter becomes vulnerable to mineralisation. Given the demand for high quality agricultural land. 40% of the UK's peatlands have been drained for agricultural use.
   In this study we present the outcomes of a controlled environment experiment conducted on agricultural fen peat to examine possible trade-offs between celery growth (an economically important crop on the agricultural peatlands of eastern England) and emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) at different temperatures (ambient and ambient +5 degrees C), water table levels (-30 cm, and -50 cm below the surface), and fertiliser use.
   Raising the water table from -50 cm to -30 cm depressed yields of celery, and at the same time decreased the entire ecosystem CO2 loss by 31%. A 5 degrees C temperature increase enhanced ecosystem emissions of CO2 by 25% and increased celery dry shoot weight by 23% while not affecting the shoot fresh weight. Fertiliser addition increased both celery yields and soil respiration by 22%. Methane emissions were generally very low and not significantly different from zero.
   Our results suggest that increasing the water table can lower emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce the rate of peat wastage, but reduces the productivity of celery. If possible, the water table should be raised to -30 cm before and after cultivation, and only decreased during the growing season, as this would reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and peat loss, potentially not affecting the production of vegetable crops.

AB Peatlands represent globally-important ecosystems and carbon stores. However, large areas of peat land have been drained for agriculture, or peat has been harvested for use as fuel or in horticulture. Increasingly, these landscapes are being restored through ditch blocking and rewetting primarily to improve biodiversity and promote peat accumulation. To date we have little knowledge of how these interventions influence the microbial communities in peatlands. We compared the responses of dominant microbial consumers (testate amoebae) to drainage ditch restoration relative to unblocked ditches in a UK upland blanket peatland (Migneint, North Wales). Two techniques were used for restoration: (i) dammed ditches with re-profiling; and (ii) dammed ditches with pools of open water behind each dam. Testate communities in the inter-ditch areas changed markedly over time and between treatments illustrating the potential of this group of organisms as indicators of blanket peatland restoration status. However, the responses of testate amoebae to peat rewetting associated with restoration were partially obscured by inter-annual variability in weather conditions through the course of the experiment. Although there was considerable variability in the response of testate amoebae communities to peatland drain blocking, there were clearly more pronounced changes in samples from the dammed and reprofiled treatments including an increase in diversity, and the appearance of unambiguous wet-indicator species in relatively high abundances (includingAmphitrema stenostoma, Archerella flavum, Arcella discoides type, Difflugia bacillifera and Difflugia bacillarium). This reflects a shift towards overall wetter conditions across the site and the creation of new habitats. However, water-table was not a significant control on testate amoebae in this case, suggesting a poor relationship between water table and surface moisture in this sloping blanket peatland. Our findings highlight the potential of testate amoebae as bioindicators of peatland restoration success; however, there is a need for caution as mechanisms driving change in the microbial communities may be more complex than-first assumed. Several factors need to be taken into account when implementing biomonitoring studies in peatlands including: (i) the natural variability of the peatland ecosystem under changing weather conditions; (ii) any disturbance connected with the restoration procedures; and (iii) the timescales over which the ecosystem responds to the management intervention. Our results also suggest an indicator species approach based on population dynamics may be more appropriate for biomonitoring peatland restoration than examining changes at the community level.

AB Land-use conversion of pristine boreal peatlands for agricultural purposes is an ongoing process and projected to become more intensive with rising population growth and increased demands for food production. However, agricultural use of peatlands affects the production and emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), a very potent greenhouse gas currently gaining more attention in the global assessment of greenhouse gases. While the intensity of N2O emissions depends on a range of environmental factors, including hydrological parameters, temperature and the availability of nitrogen in soils, key driving processes remain poorly understood. In order to understand the effects of land-use change on the peatland ecosystem, we quantified N2O fluxes under different land-use in a comparative study between a natural bog and an adjacent abandoned pasture in Newfoundland, Canada. We conducted in situ gas flux measurements using the static chamber method over five growing seasons. In addition, we measured photosynthetic rates and environmental parameters, namely soil temperature and moisture, water table and concentrations of total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon in pore waters. According to previous studies, we hypothesized higher N2O emissions from the abandoned pasture due to drainage compared to the natural bog. However, despite significant differences of environmental parameters and photosynthetic rates, we found no significant difference of N2O fluxes between the two sites. We argue that N2O production at the abandoned pasture was inhibited due to exhaustion of plant-available nitrogen as a result of increased gross primary production compared to the natural bog. We conclude that the effect of drainage and fertilization on N2O fluxes during the growing season was superposed by vegetation composition change effects at the abandoned pasture, leading to similar N2O fluxes at both sites.

AB Most of the pressures on peat soils that are responsible for their declining state are associated with human interventions, most notably land drainage for agriculture. Deteriorating stocks of peat soils and degradation of related ecosystem service flows have impacts not only on immediate users but also on society as a whole. It is important therefore that strategies to address these issues fully integrate socio-economic factors as they influence the pressures, help interpret the impacts, and justify suitable interventions to deliver sustainable management of peat soils. In this context, using a combination of stakeholder analysis and the functions, uses and values framework, stakeholder preferences for peatland functions were explored, along with the current drivers and associated responses in peatland areas. It was found that non-use values such as nature conservation are more prevalent now than in the past, and that agricultural economics has reflected this. it was also found that a high value placed is on the agricultural use of peatlands, and its associated benefits. Indeed, in the context of very recent strengthening of food prices in response to global deficits, there is renewed interest in sustaining the productive capacity of peatlands for some types of intensive farming. Although reconciling differing stakeholder interests is not easy, there is opportunity to develop a policy framework to encourage wise peatland management systems across Northern Europe. This requires that peatland ecosystems are explicitly incorporated into peatland management decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There have been widespread attempts to rewet peatlands in Europe and elsewhere in the world to restore their unique biodiversity as well as their important function as nutrient and carbon sinks. However, changes in hydrological regime and therefore oxygen availability likely alter the abundance of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenolic compounds, which have been suggested as a "latch" preventing large amounts of carbon from being released into the atmosphere by microbial mineralization. In recent years, a variety of factors have been identified that appear to weaken that latch including not only oxygen, but also pH. In minerotrophic fens, it is unknown if long-term peat mineralization during decades of drainage and intense agricultural use causes an enrichment or a decline of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenols. To address this, we collected peat samples and fresh roots of dominating plants (i.e., the peat parent material) from the upper 20cm peat layer in 5 rewetted and 6 natural fens and quantified total phenolic content as well as hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Polyphenols from less decomposed peat and living roots served partly as an internal standard for polyphenol analysis and to run enzyme inhibition tests. As hypothesized, we found the polyphenol content in highly decomposed peat to be eight times lower than in less decomposed peat, while condensed tannin content was 50 times lower in highly degraded peat. In addition, plant tissue polyphenol contents differed strongly between peat-forming plant species, with the highest amount found in roots of Carex appropinquata at 450 mg g(-1) dry mass, and lowest in Sphagnum spp. at 39 mg g(-1) dry mass: a 10-fold difference. Despite large and clear differences in peat and porewater chemistry between natural and rewetted sites, enzyme activities determined with Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and peat degradation were not significantly correlated, indicating no simple linear relationship between polyphenol content and microbial activity. Still, samples with low contents of polyphenols and condensed tannins showed the highest microbial activities as measured with FDA.

AB 1. A valid strategy to mitigate the eutrophication of water bodies due to non-point source phosphorus (P) pollution and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases is the rewetting of degraded peatlands. However, long-term drainage and intensive agricultural use make it unlikely that the original sink functions for nutrients and carbon (C) as well as low-nutrient conditions can be re-established within a human time perspective.
   2. We hypothesized that the removal of the upper degraded peat layer can be a suitable measure to avoid the negative implications of excess mobilization of P and C after rewetting. To evaluate the effect of top soil removal (TSR) we performed lab and field experiments in six inundated peatlands in northern Germany without TSR compared to six inundated sites with TSR. In addition, we included data from a rewetted peatland where the degraded peat had been removed from about half of the area and groundwater level was just beneath the soil surface.
   3. The results emphasized that following inundation newly formed detritus mud layers overlying the former peat surface are the dominating source for P and methane in particular in sites without TSR but also in sites with TSR, although at significantly lower rates. Although highly decomposed peat released more or less no methane, dissolved organic matter mobilization was highest in this substrate while less decomposed peat was characterized in general by lowest rates of mobilization.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Top soil removal prior to rewetting can be a suitable method to avoid the negative consequences of the excess release of phosphorus (P) and carbon post-rewetting. We developed a simple decision support schematic to assist the peatland restoration process and to better understand the implications of top soil removal. Despite the potential benefits, top soil removal should not be declared as a universal method, as it requires detailed consideration prior to application. However, this and other research demonstrate that it is inevitable that without any further management interventions high mobilization of P, dissolved organic matter and methane may persist for centuries following rewetting of peatlands.

AB Wetlands can either be net sinks or net sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), depending on the mean annual water level and other factors like average annual temperature, vegetation development, and land use. Whereas drained and agriculturally used peatlands tend to be carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) sources but methane (CH4) sinks, restored (i.e. rewetted) peatlands rather incorporate CO2, tend to be N2O neutral and release CH4. One of the aims of peatland restoration is to decrease their global warming potential (GWP) by reducing GHG emissions.
   We estimated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence over a period of 2 yr (1 July 2007-30 June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in northwest Germany. We set up three study sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (deeply drained, mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4-5 cuts per year); extensive grassland (rewetted, no fertilizer or manure, up to 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). Daily and annual greenhouse gas exchange was estimated based on closed-chamber measurements. CH4 and N2O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements were carried out every 34 weeks. Annual sums of CH4 and N2O fluxes were estimated by linear interpolation while NEE was modelled.
   Regarding GWP, the intensive grassland site emitted 564 +/- 255 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 850 +/- 238 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in the first (2007/2008) and the second (2008/2009) measuring year, respectively. The GWP of the extensive grassland amounted to -129 +/- 231 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 94 +/- 200 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), while it added up to 45 +/- 117 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and -101 +/- 93 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the near-natural site. In contrast, in calendar year 2008 GWP aggregated to 441 +/- 201 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), 14 +/- 162 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 31 +/- 75 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) for the intensive grassland, extensive grassland, and near-natural site, respectively.
   Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands. Extensively used grassland on moderately drained peat approaches the carbon sequestration potential of near-natural sites, although it may oscillate between being a small sink and being a small source depending on inter-annual climatic variability.

AB Little is known about solute transport in peats, despite the obvious importance of solute transport on ecohydrological processes in both managed and natural peatlands. To address this lack of knowledge, we investigated solute transport processes in an agricultural fen peat using a conservative KBr tracer. The main aim of the study was to elucidate solute transport behaviour in general in this peat, with a more specific aim of investigating whether preferential or bypassing flow occurred. The tracer moved through the peat more rapidly than expected, and the pattern of movement showed clear evidence of plot-scale bypassing flow. The data also provide evidence that bypassing flow occurs in pores at smaller scales. The implications of this study for management of wetland pastures in the Somerset Moors in south-west England are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Forty percentage of UK peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, which has caused serious peat wastage and associated greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)). In this study, we evaluated potential trade-offs between water-table management practices for minimizing peat wastage and greenhouse gas emissions, while seeking to sustain romaine lettuce production: one of the most economically relevant crop in the East Anglian Fenlands. In a controlled environment experiment, we measured lettuce yield, CO2, CH4 fluxes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from an agricultural fen soil at two temperatures (ambient and +2 degrees C) and three water-table levels (-30 cm, -40 cm and -50 cm below the surface). We showed that increasing the water table from the currently used field level of -50 cm to -40 cm and -30 cm reduced CO2 emissions, did not affect CH4 fluxes, but significantly reduced yield and increased DOC leaching. Warming of 2 degrees C increased both lettuce yield (fresh leaf biomass) and peat decomposition through the loss of carbon as CO2 and DOC. However, there was no difference in the dry leaf biomass between the intermediate (-40 cm) and the low (-50 cm) water table, suggesting that romaine lettuce grown at this higher water level should have similar energetic value as the crop cultivated at -50 cm, representing a possible compromise to decrease peat oxidation and maintain agricultural production.

TI The Border Mires in Kielder Forest: A review of their ecology and
   conservation management

LA English

DE ombrotrophic; mire; conservation; hydrology; grazing
ID GREAT-BRITAIN; PEAT
AB The vegetation, physical characteristics and conservation value of mires (peatlands) within Kielder Forest, northern England, are described. A review of the options available for their conservation management examines the effects of changes in the water table, the impact of grazing livestock and changes brought about by neighbouring conifer plantations.
   These raised and blanket mires vary in size from 0.6 to 69.6 ha, and are dominated by ombrotrophic vegetation. Their main conservation value lies in their 'naturalness', which arises from the extensive nature of locally used stock grazing systems and the intrinsic difficulty of draining mires that lie in depressions and experience an upland climate. Such sites are rare and contain uncommon plants and invertebrates, whilst collectively these mires exhibit considerable topographical and hydrological variety,
   A review of the hydrological effects of conifer plantations on mire catchments concludes that the catchments probably have little, if any, influence on the mires themselves. Management of water flow on the mires has the objective of reducing the rate of discharge of precipitation from them by damming agricultural and forestry drainage channels.
   A review of the role of livestock grazing concludes that there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is required to maintain the mire plant communities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that its impact is minimal on vegetation over deep peat, and probably most influential on vegetation over shallower peat at mire margins.

AB Since the 1990s, many peatlands that were drained for peat extraction and agriculture in Russia have been abandoned with high CO2 emissions and frequent fires, such as the enormous fires around Moscow in 2010. The fire hazard in these peatlands can be reduced through peatland rewetting and wetland restoration, so monitoring peatland status is essential. However, large expanses, poor accessibility, and fast plant succession pose as challenges for monitoring these areas without satellite images. In this study, a technique involving multispectral satellite data was used to identify six land cover classes that meet the requirements for peatland monitoring using the Meschera National Park as the testing area. This park is the largest area of once-exploited and now rewetted peatlands. However, data from one scanner are often insufficient to successfully implement this technique. In this study, we compared the land cover classifications obtained by using data from Spot-5, Spot-6, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The Spot-6 data were insufficient, despite having a higher spatial resolution, due to the lack of a shortwave infrared (SWIR) band. The high classification accuracy attained using data from other sensors enabled their combined use to provide an acceptable accuracy in the final product. The classification results were compared using minimum distance Erdas Imagine and the object-oriented ScanEx Image Processor, and the classification accuracy was similar between satellite images, which facilitates the transition from one method to another without quality loss. The proposed and tested approach can be used to analyze the status of abandoned and rewetted peatlands in other locations for the inventory and prioritization of sites for rewetting and restoration, monitoring status changes, and assessing restoration efficacy. The comparability of the data from different sensors allows for the combination of classified images and creates new possibilities for time series analysis.

ID PEAT SOILS; ORGANIC SOILS; EMISSIONS
AB Agriculturally used peatlands are prone to carbon loss and soil degradation. The intensity of the underlying processes differs locally with respect to land management practices as well as hydro-geomorphic setting and soil conditions. A reliable assessment of the site specific vulnerability to carbon loss is important information to enable effective and precise agricultural and environmental policy. In the frame of a research project to derive an updated map of peatland soils for the Federal State of Brandenburg, located in the North-East of Germany, 7725 soil investigations on peatland sites were carried out thereof 3729 were suitable for peatland subsidence analyses. These data, together with extensive legacy data consisting of approx. 246,650 soil profiles, allow for robust carbon loss estimations based on peatland subsidence records. Observed carbon losses amount to 0.234 kg/m(2) * yr at (presently) uncultivated sites, 0.562 kg/m(2) * yr for grassland and 0.645 kg/m(2) * yr for arable land. These figures agree well with recently published data for similar landscapes and land management practices. Taking into account additional information on the initial peat thickness, the type of underlying substrate and the presence or absence of a mineral top layer, a robust site-specific assessment of vulnerability to carbon loss for agriculturally used peatlands has been done. It is shown that >50% of agriculturally used peatlands in Brandenburg are characterized by medium or high vulnerability to carbon loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Globally 15%, and in Europe over 50%, of all peatlands have been drained for agricultural use leading to high carbon (C) losses, severe land subsidence and increased flooding risks. For the restoration of C sequestration and peat formation, abandoned peatlands are being rewetted at a large scale, but this transforms them into strong methane (CH4) sources. Furthermore, due to the high topsoil nutrient contents and/or high buffering capacities of water used for rewetting, this will inevitably result in eutrophication of restored peatlands and downstream areas, which may compromise the regrowth of peat forming vegetation including Sphagnum spp.
   To experimentally determine the extent of these negative side effects in relation to water quality, and to test topsoil removal as an abatement strategy, we used a controlled laboratory approach in which topsoil and subsoil monoliths of a former agricultural peatland were rewetted with water of different qualities (+P, +HCO3-, +P/+HCO3- and Control), mimicking rainwater vs. surface water storage. In addition, two different Sphagnum moss species (S. squarrosum and S. palustre) were compared.
   Without topsoil removal, rewetting led to high P and N mobilisation, algal blooms, and high CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) emissions. P-rich water resulted in further eutrophication. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) enrichment by surface water not only stimulated P release and CO2 emission, but also strongly reduced Sphagnum vitality.
   We conclude that topsoil removal will, at least in initial stages of rewetting, strongly reduce eutrophication problems (by 80-90%), CH4 emission (99%), DOC loss (60%) and global warming potential (50-70%) of rewetted former agricultural peatlands. Furthermore, to reduce mineralisation rates and enable Sphagnum growth, storage of rainwater rather than surface water is preferred. Finally, removed topsoils can be reused in adjacent subsiding agricultural areas, and thereby optimise the overall C balance and allow higher water levels in rewetted peatlands.

AB This paper summarises the results of several research groups participating in the research programme "Greenhouse Impacts of the use of Peat and Peatlands in Finland", and presents emission factors for peat-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, filling gaps in knowledge concerning the afforestation of organic croplands and cutaways, and improves the emission assessment of peatlands drained for forestry. Forest drainage may result in net binding of soil carbon or net release, depending on site characteristics and the tree stand. Use of peatlands for agriculture (48-4821 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)), even after the cultivation has ceased, or for milled peat harvesting (1948-2478 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)) can cause the highest overall emissions. Extremely high CO2 emissions are possible from peat harvesting areas during wet and warm summers. Afforestation of those peatlands abandoned from cultivation or peat harvesting can reduce the warming impact at least during the first tree generation. Heterotrophic soil respiration may have a systematic south-north difference in temperature response. More data must be collected before the information on peatland forest soil CO 2 emissions can be adapted for different climatic regions in Finland. A test of the model DNDC against measured data showed that DNDC has to be developed further before it can be used in estimating N2O emissions from boreal peatlands.

AB When a peatland is drained and cultivated, it behaves as a notable source of CO2. However, we lack temporally and spatially explicit estimates of carbon losses from cultivated peatlands. Using a process-based land surface model that explicitly includes representation of peatland processes, we estimate that northern peatlands converted to croplands emitted 72 Pg C over 850-2010, with 45% of this source having occurred before 1750. This source surpassed the carbon accumulation by high-latitude undisturbed peatlands (36 to 47 Pg C). Carbon losses from the cultivation of northern peatlands are omitted in previous land-use emission assessments. Adding this ignored historical land-use emission implies an 18% larger terrestrial carbon storage since 1750 to close the historical global carbon budget. We also show that carbon emission per unit area decrease with time since drainage, suggesting that time since drainage should be accounted for in inventories to refine land- use emissions from cultivated peatlands.

TI Subsidence Rates of Drained Agricultural Peatlands in New Zealand and
   the Relationship with Time since Drainage
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

DT Article

   PASTURE; AREA
AB The drainage and conversion of peatlands to productive agro-ecosystems leads to ongoing surface subsidence because of densification (shrinkage and consolidation) and oxidation of the peat substrate. Knowing the rate of this surface subsidence is important for future land-use planning, carbon accounting, and economic analysis of drainage and pumping costs. We measured subsidence rates over the past decade at 119 sites across three large, agriculturally managed peatlands in the Waikato region, New Zealand. The average contemporary (2000s-2012) subsidence rate for Waikato peatlands was 19 +/- 2 mm yr(-1) (+/- SE) and was significantly less (p = 0.01) than the historic rate of 26 +/- 1 mm yr(-1) between the 1920s and 2000s. A reduction in the rate of subsidence through time was attributed to the transition from rapid initial consolidation and shrinkage to slower, long-term, ongoing oxidation. These subsidence rates agree well with a literature synthesis of temperate zone subsidence rates reported for similar lengths of time since drainage. A strong nonlinear relationship was found between temperate zone subsidence rates and time since initial peatland drainage: Subsidence (mm yr(-1)) = 226 x (years since drained)(-0.59) (R-2 = 0.88). This relationship suggests that time since drainage exerts strong control over the rate of peatland subsidence and that ongoing peatland subsidence rates can be predicted to gradually decline with time in the absence of major land disturbance.

AB We studied the long-term changes in groundwater composition in the context of peat restoration at a degraded water-table managed peatland site typical for many agriculturally used fen areas in the northern hemisphere. At the study site, peatland rewetting with groundwater control and pumped canal water was carried out in two periods: from 1997 to 2002 and from 2011 to 2013. The site was not managed between 2002 and 2011, which led to an unstable groundwater table that had declined in part The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of rewetting and desiccation on groundwater chemistry. We pursued a multivariate approach using nonlinear principal component analysis (Isomap) to identify the prevailing processes that control the groundwater quality in this system.
   Sixteen years after peatland restoration, the groundwater quality had significantly improved. Principal component analysis revealed that hydrological processes had a major impact on groundwater quality, i.e. fluctuations between upwelling of local, salt-influenced groundwater and downwelling of surface and rainwater (first principal component) as well as upwelling of regional groundwater from deeper layers (second principal component) which originated from the catchment. In particular, the upwelling of regional deep groundwater had a strong positive impact on the groundwater quality of upper layers at the Biesenbrow site. Another major impact on groundwater quality was nutrient withdrawal by macrophytes and incorporation into organic matter. In the upper groundwater layer, peat mineralization processes resulted in substantially increased SO4 concentrations.
   We concluded that potential matter release after rewetting is buffered by hydrological barriers, and seems to be marginal with little impact on adjacent environments in the long term. The ecosystem is sustainably stabilized, and therefore has no negative impact on groundwater quality during periods of water shortage. Due to the strong influence of regional groundwater, management measures in the catchment are very important for maintaining and improving groundwater quality in peatlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands, including those transformed by economic activities (drainage for forestry and agriculture, peat extraction), belong to various land categories. There is no general system for their inventory and accounting. Remote sensing methodology based on high-resolution space imagery is proposed and applied for mapping peatlands of different types and states based on the example of Moscow oblast. The methodology can be used to solve scientific and practical tasks that require the development of a regional peatland geoin-formation system (GIS) using a common base map. The total area of peatlands and peatbogs is shown to surpass 6% of the oblast territory.

AB In Europe peatlands are wetlands of postglacial origin. Because of climatic changes and agricultural activities (i.e. drainage and peat extraction), they are one of the most endangered ecosystems worldwide. Water mites are well known as indicators of changing environments in other ecosystems such as springs and lakes. For our study we selected seven peatlands located in North-Western Poland and focused on water mite distribution and associated habitat and water quality variables. We described water mite fauna in various microhabitats (aquatic and semiaquatic) along the mineral-richness gradient to test whether this gradient is reflected in the composition of water mite assemblages. We selected conductivity, pH and vegetation as variables reflecting the poor-rich gradient. Additionally, we measured water depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen, which are often important parameters for water mites. We also noted presence of prey and host taxa of particular water mite species. Based on physicochemical parameters we identified three types of habitats harbouring three distinctive species groups of water mites. We were able to distinguish species that appear to be typical of spring fens (e.g. Hygrobates norvegicus, Lebertia separata), connected with acidic, nutrient poor pools (e.g. Arrenurus neumani, A. pustulator) and species seemingly typical of temporary habitats dominated by Sphagnum mosses (e.g. Piersigia intermedia, Zschokkea oblonga, A. stecki). The poor-rich gradient is strongly reflected in the composition of water mite assemblages. We also found strong correlations between the water mite fauna and both conductivity and pH gradient. Our results show that water conductivity is the most important of the examined factors, driving mite-species distribution in peatlands.

TI Greenhouse gas exchange of rewetted bog peat extraction sites and a

AB During the last decades an increasing area of drained peatlands has been rewetted. Especially in Germany, rewetting is the principal treatment on cutover sites when peat extraction is finished. The objectives are bog restoration and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The first sites were rewetted in the 1980s. Thus, there is a good opportunity to study long-term effects of rewetting on greenhouse gas exchange, which has not been done so far on temperate cutover peatlands. Moreover, Sphagnum cultivating may become a new way to use cutover peatlands and agriculturally used peatlands as it permits the economical use of bogs under wet conditions. The climate impact of such measures has not been studied yet.
   We conducted a field study on the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide at three rewetted sites with a gradient from dry to wet conditions and at a Sphagnum cultivation site in NW Germany over the course of more than 2 years. Gas fluxes were measured using transparent and opaque closed chambers. The ecosystem respiration (CO2) and the net ecosystem exchange (CO2) were modelled at a high temporal resolution. Measured and modelled values fit very well together. Annually cumulated gas flux rates, net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) and global warming potential (GWP) balances were determined. The annual net ecosystem exchange (CO2) varied strongly at the rewetted sites (from -201.7 +/- 126.8 to 29.7 +/- 112.7 gCO(2)-C m(-2) a(-1)) due to differing weather conditions, water levels and vegetation. The Sphagnum cultivation site was a sink of CO2 (-118.8 +/- 48.1 and -78.6 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2) a(-1)). The annual CH4 balances ranged between 16.2 +/- 2.2 and 24.2 +/- 5.0 gCH(4)-C-2 a(-1) at two inundated sites, while one rewetted site with a comparatively low water level and the Sphagnum farming site show CH4 fluxes close to 0. The net N2O fluxes were low and not significantly different between the four sites.
   The annual NECB was between -185.5 +/- 126.9 and 49.9 +/- 112.8 gCO(2)-Cm(-2)a(-1) at the rewetted sites and -115.8 +/- 48.1 and -77 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1) at the Sphagnum cultivating site. The annual GWP100 balances ranged from -280.5 +/- 465.2 to 644.5 +/- 413.6 gCO(2)-eq.m(-2) a(-1) at the rewetted sites. In contrast, the Sphagnum farming site had a cooling impact on the climate in both years (-356.8 +/- 176.5 and -234.9 +/- 145.9 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1)). If the carbon exported through the harvest of the Sphagnum biomass and the additional CO2 emission from the decay of the organic material is considered, the NECB and GWP100 balances are near neutral.
   Peat mining sites are likely to become net carbon sinks and a peat accumulating ("growing") peatland within 30 years of rewetting, but the GWP100 balance may still be positive. A recommended measure for rewetting is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground.
   Sphagnum farming is a climate-friendly alternative to conventional commercial use of bogs. A year-round constant water level of a few centimetres below ground level should be maintained.

AB Peatlands are large terrestrial stores of carbon, and sustained CO2 sinks, but over the last century large areas have been drained for agriculture and forestry, potentially converting them into net carbon sources. More recently, some peatlands have been re-wetted by blocking drainage ditches, with the aims of enhancing biodiversity, mitigating flooding, and promoting carbon storage. One potential detrimental consequence of peatland re-wetting is an increase in methane (CH4) emissions, offsetting the benefits of increased CO2 sequestration. We examined differences in CH4 emissions between an area of ditch-drained blanket bog, and an adjacent area where drainage ditches were recently infilled. Results showed that Eriophorum vaginatum colonization led to a "hotspot'' of CH4 emissions from the infilled ditches themselves, with smaller increases in CH4 from other re-wetted areas. Extrapolated to the area of blanket bog surrounding the study site, we estimated that CH4 emissions were around 60 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) prior to drainage, reducing to 44 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) after drainage. We calculated that fully re-wetting this area would initially increase emissions to a peak of around 120 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1), with around two-thirds of the increase (and 90% of the increase over pre-drainage conditions) attributable to CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum-colonized infilled ditches, despite these areas only occupying 7% of the landscape. We predicted that emissions should eventually decline toward pre-drainage values as the ecosystem recovers, but only if Sphagnum mosses displace E. vaginatum from the infilled ditches. These results have implications for peatland management for climate change mitigation, suggesting that restoration methods should aim, if possible, to avoid the colonization of infilled ditches by aerenchymatous species such as E. vaginatum, and to encourage Sphagnum establishment.

AB The evaporation regimes of two northern New Zealand raised peat bogs with vegetation dominated by the restionaceous rush Sporadanthus traversii were investigated. One of the bogs is unmodified while the other is affected by the drainage practices of surrounding agricultural land. Measurements of the latent heat flux obtained concurrently with Bowen ratio and eddy covariance techniques were in close agreement, and good energy balance closure was demonstrated when there was adequate fetch. Evaporation rates and energy partitioning behaviour were similar for the two bogs despite differences in water table elevation and peat moisture content. Evaporation rates averaged 2.9 mm day(-1), equivalent to 55% of the equilibrium evaporation rate. Energy balance partitioning favoured the sensible heat flux, and Bowen ratios of around 2 were common. The importance of the latent heat flux in the energy balance depended on the state of canopy wetness following frequent rainfall events. When the canopy was completely wet, evaporation rates approximated, or exceeded, the equilibrium evaporation rate. Evaporation rates were evidently constrained by a combination of plant physiological and canopy structural factors which combined to prevent high rates of evaporation from the moist peat surface. These findings provide evidence of strong canopy-hydrological feedbacks within the raised peat bogs of northern New Zealand which result in conditions favourable for peat formation.

AB Drainage ditches and ground-water gradients in abandoned agricultural sapric peatlands (mucklands) produce distinctive vegetation patterns. Ditches in abandoned mucklands were ineffective in creating ground-water depression in adjacent soil, while ditches in a newly-cleared muckland were effective in doing so. Upon abandonment, drainage ditches are subject to bank erosion and sedimentation. Coupled with years of soil subsidence and an altered hydrologic regime, ditches lose effectiveness in draining and function merely as small-scale topographic depressions, providing linear zones of seasonally high water levels. Species are distributed on abandoned mucklands in association with soil moisture conditions induced by topographic variation at both small (i.e., ditches) and larger (i.e., site-wide) spatial scales. Vegetation that is usually restricted to moist or saturated soils had greater cover closer to or within drainage ditches or in other topographically low areas, while species with low fidelity to saturated soil dominated the remaining drier areas. Some shrub species had slightly greater stem densities either within or immediately adjacent to ditches, resulting in a ''parallel'' distribution (i.e., illustrating ditch-fidelity). Species having higher affinity to lower soil moisture conditions, such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), showed significantly greater stem density in areas farther away from ditches. Ground-water levels are of primary importance in affecting distribution patterns on naturally revegetating, abandoned agricultural mucklands. The accuracy of the wetland indicator status for woody and herbaceous species encountered on these abandoned mucklands is supported quantitatively by direct gradient analysis. The functioning of existing drainage ditch systems should be assessed prior to any mitigation or restoration activities.

AB Peatlands have an important global role as carbon sinks. Locally, however, peat bog extraction can cause pollution in nearby watercourses. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of multivariate methods in the renovation and protection of eutrophic lakes surrounded by agricultural and peat extraction areas. The analytical data used in the study originated from a national water quality database and the period studied was 2000-2013. Multivariate methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) were applied to solve interactions of variables and pollution sources in a complex water ecosystem. Leaching from the peat bog area was found to be the main source of iron, which has an important role as a precipitator of phosphorus in loose sediment and in water. Nutrient ratios had no direct correlation to algae blooms, but high ratios indicated an increased likelihood of an upcoming bloom.

AB In this study, a process-based model was developed for studying the climatic sensitivity of the soil moisture content (theta) in a cutaway peatland cultivated with a perennial crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L, RCG). The model was parameterized based on the canopy development and the soil properties measured in Linnansuo peatland in Eastern Finland. The model was also calibrated and validated by continuous measurements of meteorology, soil temperature, soil moisture and energy fluxes (eddy covariance system) during a wet year (2009) and a dry year (2010). The results showed that the model captured well the seasonal trend of the latent heat flux during the two-year period. Moreover, the model explained the major seasonal variations of the moisture content in multiple peat layers in the soil profile. Sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the fluctuation of the water table (WT) had little impact on the seasonal dynamics of the peat moisture content in the Linnansuo site. These results indicated that anthropological disturbances, such as peat extraction, drainage and energy crop cultivation, critically weakened the theta-WT interaction in the Linnansuo peatland. Moreover, these changes indicated the high climatic sensitivity of the peat moisture content especially to the variations of the seasonal pattern of precipitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study assessed the risk of decomposition-driven soil subsidence in drained peat soils in the Netherlands, contrasting in peat origin and current land use. In a full factorial design, fen peat and bog peat were sampled from sites in use for nature conservation and for dairy farming, which contrast in history of drainage and fertilisation. In these four peat types, which frequently occur in the Netherlands, the microbial activity and respiration dynamics were studied in samples from superficial oxic peat layers by measuring Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR) and Substrate Induced Growth Response (SIGR). Total and active microbial biomass, microbial growth potential and potential exo-enzyme activities were determined in unamended samples and after nitrogen and/or glucose amendments.
   Remarkably, peat origin and land use did not affect basal respiration rates. In contrast, land use affected microbial biomass and potential growth rates as they were quadrupled in dairy meadows compared to nature reserves. This may be attributable to the pulses of organic and inorganic fertiliser that are being supplied in agricultural peatlands. Potential activities of oxidative exo-enzymes (phenol oxidase, PDX, and phenol peroxidase, POD), in contrast, depended more on peat type, indicating a difference in peat substrate quality. Basal respiration rates and enzyme activities were not related. Phosphorus enrichment was identified as a potential driver of increased peat decomposition. The activity of the oxidative enzyme phenol oxidase and the concentration of phenolic compounds, which are considered to be the main regulators of peat decomposition according to the enzymic latch theory, were not related to respiration rates. It was concluded that decomposition theories like the enzymic latch theory (attributing a main role in the regulation of decomposition to phenolic compounds and phenol oxidase) were not supported by our research in the drained peat soils in the Netherlands.

AB Globally, large areas of peatland have been drained through the digging of ditches, generally to increase agricultural production. By lowering the water table it is often assumed that drainage reduces landscape-scale emissions of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere to negligible levels. However, drainage ditches themselves are known to be sources of CH4 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), but emissions data are scarce, particularly for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and show high spatial and temporal variability. Here, we report dissolved GHGs and diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from ditches at three UK lowland fens under different management; semi-natural fen, cropland, and cropland restored to low-intensity grassland. Ditches at all three fens emitted GHGs to the atmosphere, but both fluxes and dissolved GHGs showed extensive variation both seasonally and within-site. CH4 fluxes were particularly large, with medians peaking at all three sites in August at 120-230 mg m(-2) d(-1). Significant between site differences were detected between the cropland and the other two sites for CO2 flux and all three dissolved GHGs, suggesting that intensive agriculture has major effects on ditch biogeochemistry. Multiple regression models using environmental and water chemistry data were able to explain 29-59% of observed variation in dissolved GHGs. Annual CH4 fluxes from the ditches were 37.8, 183 and 272 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) for the semi-natural, grassland and cropland, and annual CO2 fluxes were similar (1100 to 1440 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) among sites. We suggest that fen ditches are important contributors to landscape scale GHG emissions, particularly for CH4. Ditch emissions should be included in GHG budgets of human modified fens, particularly where drainage has removed the original terrestrial CH4 source, e.g. agricultural peatlands.

DT Article
AB Northern Ireland has a tradition of peat cutting; 78 per cent by area of remaining lowland bogs and 46 per cent of blanket bogs have been cut in the past, Since the early 1980s, machine peat extraction for fuel and horticulture has increased, against a background of changing economic support for agriculture, high rural unemployment and agricultural underemployment. Cutting fuel peat can reduce household fuel costs and some peat fuel is sold to gain income, Horticultural peat is cut mainly for sale, Expansion of machine extraction, with possible environmental impacts, occurred as interest in peatland conservation increased, Potential conflict arises between local economic needs and conservation, Machine cutting for fuel is widespread, but affects only 2.6 per cent of the blanket peat area; horticultural extraction is more localized and is only one-fifth of the extent of fuel extraction, Altitude, distance from roads, land ownership and rights, turbary, religious affiliation, local economic needs and the role of government departments all contribute to explaining the distribution and extent of extraction.

AB Land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) have been directly altering climate, and it has been proposed that such changes could mitigate anthropogenic climate warming brought about by increases in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Changes due to LULUCF alter the Bowen ratio, surface roughness, and albedo and so directly change air temperatures. Previous studies have focused on changes in the area of forestry and have used space-for-time substitutions to assess the impact of LULUCF. This study considered 18 years of daytime land surface temperature over an area of actual land use change in comparison to its surrounding landscape and considered the restoration of a lowland peat bog: satellite land surface temperature data across 49, 1-km(2) grid squares with 20 on peatland and 29 on surrounding agricultural land on mineral soils from 2000 to 2017. The peatland squares were, until 2004, dug for horticultural peat and after 2004 were restored with revegetation of bare soil and restoration of natural water tables. Over the 18 years, the average annual daytime land surface temperature significantly decreased for six grid squares, five of which were on the restored peatland where land surface temperature decreased by 2 K. In 2000, before restoration, the peatland was 0.7 K warmer than the surrounding agricultural land on mineral soils but by 2016 was 0.5 K cooler. This study has shown that anthropogenic land use change could cool a landscape and that functioning peatlands could act as cool, humid islands within a landscape.

   chamber measurements; mitigation action; data assimilation
AB Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) reservoirs, storing about one-third of the global terrestrial soil C pool. Anthropogenic influences, such as drainage for agriculture and forestry, lower the originally high groundwater level, leading to peat aeration and decomposition. This is particularly reflected in significant losses of CO2, while fluxes of N2O and CH4 are generally considered of minor importance for the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of cultivated peatlands in Scandinavia. Setting land aside from agricultural production has been proposed as a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from drained peatland, restore natural habitats, and increase C sequestration. However, the evidence for this is rather scarce unless drainage is terminated. In this study, we measured respiration using dark automatic chambers, and CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes using manual static chambers, on: 1) cultivated peatland and 2) adjacent set-aside peatland in Central Sweden. The set-aside site was found to be a greater source of respiration than the cultivated site, while higher N2O fluxes and lower CH4 uptake rates were observed for the cultivated site. However, to compare the full GHG balance and assess the abandonment of drained cultivated peatland, additional measures, such as gross primary production (GPP) but also dissolved organic C losses would have to be taken into account.

ID HABITAT; AREA
AB Aim The state of peatlands in eastern Canada is of growing concern. This habitat is in decline due tu urban sprawl, agriculture, forestry, and peat mining. Moreover reduction and fragmentation have led to increasing isolation of remaining peatlands. We determined how bird species distribution in peatlands conforms to expectations drawn from island dynamics. We also determined the factors influencing the occurrence of 10 common peatland bird species, two of which rely mainly on peatlands for nesting in the study region.
   Location We sampled sixty-three peatlands in southern Quebec, Canada, within a landscape characterized by a mosaic of forest stands and farmland.
   Methods We sampled nesting bird populations within peatlands from 4 June to 14 July 1995, using both transect lines and fixed-radius point counts. Each sampled peatland was characterized by area, vegetation structure (microhabitats), and isolation. We used multiple regression to test the relationship between bird species richness, peatland area, heterogeneity, microhabitat richness, and relative isolation, after correction for sampling effort. Relationships between bird species abundances and the variables the environmental variables were investigated with Canonical Correspondence Analyses. We calculated probabilities of occurrence of individual species in peatlands by logistic regression, with the same explanatory variables as mentioned previously.
   Results Bird species richness was mainly explained by microhabitat richness, and to a lesser extent, by sampling effort. By contrast, the occurrence of more than half of the species was mainly explained by peatland microhabitat heterogeneity. Palm warbler Dendroica palmarum (Gmelin) and upland sandpipers Bartramia longicauda (Bechstein) were the only species less frequent in small and isolated peatlands than in other peatlands.
   Main conclusions The results for species richness support both the habitat diversity, and passive sampling hypotheses for patchy distribution of birds. By contrast, results from individual species emphasized the difference between factors affecting total species richness and individual species distribution. The distribution of palm warbler, the only species restricted to peatlands regionally, was consistent with expectations from island dynamics.

AB Drainage of peatlands for agriculture causes an increase of CO2 flux from peat decomposition, contributing to national CO2 emission. The reverse process, i.e. for re-creation of wetlands, reduces the CO2 flux, but increases the CH4 flux. We developed a process model (PEATLAND) to simulate these fluxes from peat soils subject to different water-table management scenarios. The model combines primary production, aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (including the soil-parent material, peat), CH4 formation, oxidation, and transport. Model input requires specification of water table and air temperature data sets, vegetation parameters such as primary production and parameters related to gas transport, and basic soil physical data. Validation using closed flux-chamber measurements Of CO2 and CH4 from five different sites in the western Netherlands shows that seasonal changes in fluxes Of CO2 and CH4 are correctly modelled. However, the CO2 submodel underestimates peat decomposition when peat decomposition rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are used as input. Field decomposition rates are considerably higher. This is attributed to enhancement of decomposition by the addition of easily decomposable material from root exudation ('priming effect'). Model experiments indicate that 1) drainage increases the CO2 production from peat decomposition strongly; 2) restoring a high water table may decrease the total greenhouse gas flux by a small amount although the CH4 flux increases strongly; 3) a warmer climate may cause higher greenhouse gas fluxes from peat soils resulting in a positive feedback to climate warming, and 4) high vegetation productivity in fen meadows may stimulate peat decomposition by the priming effect.

AB This article provides an overview of the effects of land-use on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and from peatlands in the Nordic countries based on the field data from about 100 studies. In addition, this review aims to identify the gaps in the present knowledge on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances associated with the land-use of these northern ecosystems. Northern peatlands have accumulated, as peat, a vast amount of carbon from the atmosphere since the last glaciation. However, the past land-use and present climate have evidently changed their GHG balance. Unmanaged boreal peatlands may act as net sources or sinks for CO2 and CH4 depending on the weather conditions. Drainage for agriculture has turned peatlands to significant sources of GHGs (mainly N2O and CO2). Annual mean GHG balances including net CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 2260, 2280 and 3140 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) (calculated using 100 year time horizon) for areas drained for grass swards, cereals or those left fallow, respectively. Even after cessetion of the cultivation practices, N2O and CO2 emissions remain high. The mean net GHG emissions in abandoned and afforested agricultural peatlands have been 1580 and 500 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), respectively. Peat extraction sites are net sources of GHGs with an average emission rate of 770 gCO(2) eq. m(-2). Cultivation of a perennial grass (e. g., reed canary grass) on an abandoned peat extraction site has been shown to convert such a site into a net sink of GHGs (-330 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). In contrast, despite restoration, such sites are known to emit GHGs (mean source of 480 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), mostly from high CH4 emissions). Peatland forests, originally drained for forestry, may act as net sinks (mean -780 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, the studies where all three GHGs have been measured at an ecosystem level in the forested peatlands are lacking. The data for restored peatland forests (clear cut and rewetted) indicate that such sites are on average a net sink (190 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). The mean emissions from drained peatlands presented here do not include emissions from ditches which form a part of the drainage network and can contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Peat soils submerged under water reservoirs have acted as sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O (mean annual emission 240 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, we cannot yet predict accurately the overall greenhouse gas fluxes of organic soils based on the site characteristics and land-use practices alone because the data on many land-use options and our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling associated with the gas fluxes are limited.

AB As most ecosystems, peatlands have been heavily exploited for different human purposes. For example, in Finland the majority is under forestry, agriculture or peat mining use. Peatlands play an important role in carbon storage, water cycle, and are a unique habitat for rare organisms. Such properties highlight their environmental importance and the need for their restoration. To monitor the success of peatland restoration sensitive indicators are needed. Here we test whether testate amoebae can be used as a reliable bioindicator for assessing peatland condition. To qualify as reliable indicators, responses in testate amoebae community structure to ecological changes must be stronger than random spatial and temporal variation. In this study, we simultaneously assessed differences between the effects of seasonality, intermediate scale spatial variation and land uses on living testate amoebae assemblages in natural, forested and restored peatlands. We expected the effects of seasonality on testate amoebae communities to be less pronounced than those of land use and within site variation. On average, natural sites harboured the highest richness and density, while the lowest numbers were found at forestry sites. Despite small changes observed in taxa dominance and differences in TA community structure between seasons and years at some sites, spatial heterogeneity, temperature, pH, nor water table depth seemed to significantly affect testate amoebae communities. Instead, observed differences were related to type of land use, which explained 75% of the community variation. Our results showed that testate amoebae community monitoring is a useful tool to evaluate impacts of human land use on boreal peatlands.

AB On a global scale, the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) from peatland drainage and cultivation are believed to account for similar to 5% of estimated anthropogenic GHG emissions. Drainage generally leads to peat subsidence and extensive soil loss, resulting in a diminishing store of soil carbon (C). This is a challenge for maintaining drainage -based agriculture, as such practices will eventually lead to the loss of organic soils that arable cultivation depends on. The conversion of croplands on peat to semi-natural grasslands, alongside raising water tables, is one possible way to reduce the loss of these valuable C stores. Here, we report the net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of two lowland peatlands in East Anglia, south-east UK. One site is a relic conservation-managed fen on deep peat, subject to active hydrological management to maintain water levels, and dominated by Cladium and Phragmites sedge and reed beds, whilst the other is a former cropland that has been converted to seasonally inundated grazed grassland. Despite occasionally experiencing severe water table drawdown, the conservation managed fen was a strong C sink of-104 g C m(-2) yr(-1). In contrast, the grassland was a C source of 133 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being the main loss pathway, due to low water tables exposing the soil profile in summer. At each site, ditch emissions of CO2 were moderately large (22 and 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), whilst ditch methane (CH4) emissions (0.2 and 1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) made a negligible contribution to the NECB, but are important when considering the ecosystem GHG balance in terms of CO2 equivalents. Excluding dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fluvial C losses were 6 g C M-2 yr(-1) for the conservation-managed fen and 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the former cropland, and were dominated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The small fluvial C loss is the result of both sites being hydrologically isolated from the surrounding agricultural landscapes. Although the partially re-wetted cropland was still acting as a net C source, our estimates suggest that seasonal rewetting has reduced net annual C losses to similar to 20% of their former cropland values. Maintaining high water tables year round would potentially further reduce C losses, and shallow inundation might allow the return of wetland species such as Phragmites and Typha, perhaps as floating rafts.

AB Artificial drainage for agriculture causes the alteration of peatlands through excessive oxidation and fires. Peats lose their functions and also contribute to the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. In this study, morphological, micro morphological and chemical soil characteristics of an artificially drained peat land located in the southern Turkey were investigated to assess the effects of excessive oxidation and fire. Soil samples described as sapric, hemic, or burnt were collected along four transects on the peatland. The results clearly indicated that burning process resulted in significant decrease in total carbon and nitrogen content of soils since 1950 whereas pH, ash content, available P and K contents were increased. Interpretations recognized as a degradation sequence after drainage. The results demonstrated that artificial drainage of peatlands for agricultural purposes leads to a change in organic soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen sink were depleted, C by about 2 x 10(6) and N by about 0.1 x 10(6) tons, and pH was raised above the level that is ideal for cropping, in a system that is not only completed changed but unsustainable without increasing soil inputs in the long term.

Thus, the purpose of this research was to determine whether short-term changes in DOC and DON content and microbial properties are related to variations in weather conditions, soil properties and human activity. The study was conducted in May and September 2017 & ndash;2019 to determine the seasonal variations in the abovementioned parameters in soil layers (0 & ndash;30 cm) of a long-term agricultural peatland additionally affected by open-pit mining. We found that the most critical environmental factors that shape microbial community structure and activity are air temperature and precipitation, which explained 59.9% of the variability. Air temperature was also the most important explanatory factors for DOC and DON variation, which explained 18.9% of the total variability. Moreover, in the case of DOC and DON production, significant positive correlations with soil organic carbon content (DOC r = 0.46, p < 0.01; DON r = 0.54, p < 0.001) was found. The potential impact of open-pit mines on the DOC and DON production was not confirmed, as there was no significant difference between sites located in the depression cones (caused by lignite mining) and those sites affected exclusively by agriculture drainage. This work hopes to contribute towards a deeper understanding of the variables and dependencies that affect the production of labile organic forms in degraded fen peatland soils in the temperate climate zone.& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB 1. Agricultural peatlands and their associated drainage systems are often highly managed and exposed to anthropogenic pressures, such as eutrophication and stable water tables, maintained via drainage during periods of high rainfall and inlet of, alkaline-rich, waters during dry periods. These pressures promote peat degradation, resulting in the accumulation of fine-degraded peat particles that dramatically alter aquatic habitats by smothering surfaces and decreasing water quality. Consequential effects on benthic communities are expected but have not been investigated so far.
   2.We hypothesised that peat degradation can lead to the decline in submerged macrophytes, which are of critical importance to sustaining biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities. To investigate this, we analysed decadal (1985-2007) changes in benthic species richness in 29 peat ditches in the Netherlands and, to determine patterns of macroinvertebrate habitat occupancy, carried out a complementary field experiment with submerged artificial macrophytes, natural sediments and emergent bank vegetation.
   3. Results from long-term monitoring indicate that chemical conditions in agricultural peat ditches have improved slightly over the last decades; however, there has been a simultaneous decline in benthic invertebrate species richness and densities corresponding to a decline in the numbers of submerged macrophytes. The apparent dependence of macroinvertebrates on macrophytes was reinforced by our field experiment which revealed that invertebrate density was highest in submerged artificial plants, while invertebrate species richness was highest in natural emergent vegetation. Conversely, degraded peat sediments supported extremely few invertebrates.
   4. Our results clearly illustrate the strong influence of submerged macrophyte loss on macroinvertebrate assemblages in peatland waters. Furthermore, this suggests that improvements in water quality alone will not benefit invertebrates in the absence of suitable vegetative habitats.

AB Drainage of peatlands causes severe environmental damage, including high greenhouse gas emissions. Peatland rewetting substantially lowers these emissions. After rewetting, paludiculture (i.e. agriculture and forestry on wet peatlands) is a promising land use option. In Northeast Germany (291,361 ha of peatland) a multi-stakeholder discussion process about the implementation of paludiculture took place in 2016/2017. Currently, 57% of the peatland area is used for agriculture (7% as arable land, 50% as permanent grassland), causing greenhouse gas emissions of 4.5 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1). By rewetting and implementing paludiculture, up to 3 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1)from peat soils could be avoided. To safeguard interests of both nature conservation and agriculture, the different types of paludiculture were grouped into 'cropping paludiculture' and 'permanent grassland paludiculture'. Based on land legislation and plans, a paludiculture land classification was developed. On 52% (85,468 ha) of the agriculturally used peatlands any type of paludiculture may be implemented. On 30% (49,929 ha), both cropping and permanent grassland paludiculture types are possible depending on administrative check. On 17% (28,827 ha), nature conservation restrictions allow only permanent grassland paludiculture. We recommend using this planning approach in all regions with high greenhouse gas emissions from drained peatlands to avoid land use conflicts.

AB Hot and cold water-extractable organic carbon (HWC and CWC, respectively) fractions, as good indicators of organic matter quality, as well as water repellency (WDPT test) and state of secondary humification were analyzed in topsoil samples of peatland drained for agricultural purposes 160 years ago. The examined sites (drained and used as grassland) at the peatland had been affected by the moorsh-forming process. During this process, intense mineralization and secondary humification of organic matter took place. The state of transformation of organic soils varied from weak to complete degradation. The HWC contents ranged between 2.623 and 3.572 g kg(-1) in field-moist samples and 3.999 and 6.074 g kg(-1) in air-dried soil samples. The CWC contents were generally lower than HWC and ranged between 0.411 and 0.535 g kg(-1) in field-moist samples and 0.696 and 0.939 g kg(-1) in air-dried soil samples. The examined soils were extremely water repellent when dried. The measures of transformation of peat after drainage and WDPT were not significantly correlated, but a tendency for higher values of water repellency at the site regarded as degraded was noted. Deep drainage caused an increase of HWC fraction, which in light of the moorsh-forming process should be regarded as negative. The topsoil of the peatland became dry and resistant to rewetting. However, when the ground water level is maintained at not deeper than 0.50 m, the changes in peat matter do not lead to degradation. HWC is a good measure to show differences occurring within the ecosystem. Given its correlation with state of transformation (W1 index) and water repellency (WDPT test), HWC is a good measurement of peat quality. HWC and WDPT measurements may be helpful in determining degradation of peat soil after drainage.

AB This study compared the energy budget components of latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), net radiation (Rn) and ground heat flux (G) between an undisturbed bog and an adjacent abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. The analysis was based on the period of April 2014 to August 2015 when measurements were concurrent at both sites, thus encompassing two growing seasons. The overall objective was to identify the impact of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland energy flux and partitioning. LE and H showed strong seasonal patterns for both sites. LE, which was higher at the pasture, peaked near the middle of the growing season. H at the bog was smaller than that at the pasture during the early growing season, but became larger during the middle and late growing seasons, with the maximum H occurring during the early growing season. G was the smallest flux in the energy budget at both sites, and it showed no obvious temporal pattern at either site. The variation in daytime average evapo-transpiration (ET) was related to net radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at both sites. However, it was more strongly related to Rn. ET at the pasture site exhibited greater sensitivity to changes in Rn and VPD. Daytime ET increased and decreased with water table depth (WTD) when WTD was above and below a threshold of -0.24 m at the bog and -0.46 m at the pasture. The between-site differences in growing season H and LE (Delta H and Delta LE) were mainly caused by their different vegetation conditions, and Delta H and Delta LE were negatively and positively related to Delta EVI (difference in enhanced vegetation index), respectively.

AB The majority of peatlands in the temperate zone is subjected to drainage and agricultural land use and have been found to be anthropogenic emission hot spots for greenhouse gases. At the same time, many peatlands receive increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition by intensive agricultural practices. Here we provide eddy covariance measurements determining net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at a protected but moderately drained ombrotrophic bog in Northwestern Germany over three consecutive years. The region is dominated by intensive agricultural land use with total (wet and dry) atmospheric N deposition being about 25kgNha(-1)yr(-1). The investigated peat bog was a small net CO2 sink during all three years ranging from -9 to -73gCm(-2)yr(-1). We found temperature- and light-dependent ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production, respectively, but only weak correlations to water table depths despite large interannual and seasonal variability. Significant short-term effects of atmospheric N deposition on CO2 flux components could not be observed, as the primary controlling factors for N deposition and C sequestration, i.e., fertilization of adjacent fields as well as temperature and light availability, respectively, exceeded potential interactions between the two.

AB Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10%-20% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.

TI Carbon budget response of an agriculturally used fen to different soil

SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The agricultural use of peatlands usually requires drainage, thereby transforming these organic soils from a net carbon sink into a net source. The Seeland region of Switzerland is characterised by fens that have been intensively used for agriculture for 150 years. Our site is a degraded fen with a remaining peat layer of 60 cm that had been used as cropland until 2009. In connection to a nature protection project it has been managed as extensive permanent grassland since then. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was determined for two years (2015-2016). For this purpose, the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes were measured by eddy covariance, and the carbon removed by harvest was quantified. Our degraded fen site was found to be a net carbon source of 477 +/- 73g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 434 +/- 51 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were marginal in both years with 0.4 +/- 0.8 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2015) and 0.7 +/- 0.7 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2016). In contrast to NECB, the NEE was considerably higher in 2015 than in 2016 (308 +/- 71 g C m(-2) yr(-1) vs 117 +/- 39 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The year 2015 was characterised by partial flooding of the grassland, followed by a dry and hot summer leading to lower CO2 uptake due to reduced growth, which was reflected in lower harvest compared to 2016. Thus, the short-term plant-induced carbon fluxes were altered, whereas total soil carbon loss remained rather constant. This was verified by an intra site comparison between the flooded and non-flooded part in 2015. Our results indicate that the soil carbon loss of this highly degraded peatland with a shallow peat layer is relatively moderate and hardly influenced by interannual weather variations.

AB The Over Wyre region of Lancashire, England, was formerly dominated by a complex of ombrotrophic intermediate raised mires, most of which have been severely damaged by agricultural activity during the last 250 years. The degree of truncation and desiccation of the remaining peats means that opportunities for studying environmental history in this part of lowland England are extremely rare. An exception occurs at Fenton Cottage where a relict, non-truncated portion of original mire survives and forms an environmental archive spanning the second half of the Holocene. The palaeoecological record shows that there has been a continual human influence on the development of the landscape since the mire began growing, with a particularly significant deforestation episode commencing in the late Iron Age. A major expansion of the mire system commenced in the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age and may have led to the abandonment of settlement in and around the peatlands during much of the Iron Age. The investigation also yielded the first tephra to be discovered in English peats. This took the form of a discrete layer of microscopic tephra, geochemically assigned to the Icelandic Hekla-4 eruption of ca. 2300 cal. B.C.. This was recorded in Scheuchzeria palustris-dominated peat which formed during a period of freshwater flooding. The find represents the most southerly geographical location in the British Isles where Hekla-4 tephra has been detected to date. The study demonstrates the palaeoecological value of threatened relict lowland peat archives in agricultural landscapes and highlights the potential of tephrochronology as a tool for studying environmental changes and wetland archaeology in southern Britain.

AB Ground- and surface-water-fed peatlands (i.e., fens) of temperate Europe face high anthropogenic nutrient loads from atmospheric deposition, agricultural catchment areas, and from peat decomposition, if drained. As a result, nitrogen loads may exceed a fen's natural nutrient removal capacity, leading to increased eutrophication of adjacent water bodies. Therefore, it is important to address possible means to decrease a fen's nutrient load, including nutrient uptake by fen plants. To assess how much fen plants can contribute to nutrient removal by uptake, nutrient stocks of above- and below-ground biomass need to be quantified. Therefore, we investigated nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium uptake capacities of sedges (Carex species), which are common dominants in fen plant communities. We grew specimens of five Carex species with varying preferences in nutrient availability under controlled, different nutrient levels. We show that Carex above-ground biomass harvest can remove up to one third of a system's total nitrogen even at high loads of about 40 g nitrogen m & minus;2. Species-specific differences in biomass production, rather than preferences in nutrient availability under natural conditions, were drivers of standing nutrient stocks: Highly productive species, i.e., C. acutiformis and C. rostrata, had highest nutrient standing stocks across all nutrient levels. Amounts of nutrients stored in shoots increased almost linearly with increasing nutrient levels, whereas below-ground nutrient stocks species-specifically increased, saturated, or decreased, with increasing nutrient levels. As a rough estimate, depending on the species, 6 & ndash;16 cycles of an-nual above-ground harvest would suffice to decrease nitrogen concentrations from the highest to the lowest level used in this study. Overall, our results indicate that Carex biomass harvest can be an efficient means to coun-teract anthropogenic nitrogen eutrophication in fens.

AB Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are receiving increased attention among governmental and commercial actors. In recent years, the interest in paludiculture, i.e. the use of rewetted peatlands, has grown because of its potential to reduce GHG emissions by stopping soil decomposition. Moreover, cultivating wetland plants on rewetted peatlands for bioenergy production that replaces fossil fuels in the transport sector, can contribute to additional GHG emission reductions. In this study, an analysis of literature data was conducted to obtain data on GHG emissions (CO2 and CH4) and biomass production from rewetted peatlands cultivated with two different wetland plant species: Phragmites australis (Pa) and Typha latifolia (Tl). In addition, a biogas experiment was carried out to investigate the biomethane yield of Pa and Tl biomass, and the reduction of global warming potential (GWP) by using biomethane as vehicle fuel. The results show that peatland rewetting can be an important measure to mitigate the GWP as it reduces GHG emissions from the soil, particularly on a 100-year timescale but also to some extent on a 20-year timescale. More specifically, rewetting of 1 km(2) of peatland can result in a GWP reduction corresponding to the emissions from +/- 2600 average sized petrol cars annually. Growing Pa on rewetted peatlands reduces soil GHG emissions more than growing Tl, but Pa and Tl produced similar amounts of biomass and biomethane per land area. Our study concludes that Pa, because of a more pronounced GWP reduction, is the most suitable wetland plant to cultivate after peatland rewetting.

ID RETENTION
AB Minerotrophic peatlands play an important role in the regulation of water quality and quantity but due to drainage and agricultural land use most of these systems have lost this function. In Central Europe, many re-wetting projects have been implemented to restore wetlands for multifunctional purposes during the last years. The Pohnsdorfer Stauung (Northern Germany) is a eutrophic fen which was used for intensive agriculture for 40 years. The peatland is divided in two subareas by a small stream. In the scope of re-wetting measures, one subarea (westpolder) was flooded by blockading the main drainage ditch in 1996/97, a second subarea (eastpolder) was re-connected to the stream by an inlet and outlet in 2001. Nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics were investigated in the surface water of these systems over a 5-year (westpolder) and 3-year (eastpolder) period, and balances were calculated. In both polders high dynamics of nitrogen and phosphate concentrations were observed in the surface water. Nitrate peaked in the winter months, whereas ammonium, phosphate and organically bound nitrogen (No,,) revealed highest values during summer. Daily balances for the eastpolder and annual balances for both polders were calculated. In both polders nitrate was retained but phosphate and N-org were exported. Differences of the nutrient dynamics and the absolute and relative balances between the polders were due to the different hydrology: the eastpolder received a high nitrate load by the stream, in the westpolder nutrient loads are low and internal nutrient cycles are dominating. During the summer months, high ammonium concentrations, oxygen depletion, and phosphate release occur in the warm, stagnant water of both polders. Normally, high phosphate and ammonium concentrations did not coincided with discharge phases from the polders. However, in August 2002 after heavy rainfall high phosphorus and ammonium discharge was observed. One important factor influencing the detected nutrient dynamics and balances is the change from a drained and fertilized peatland to a flooded wetland in only a few years. We conclude that continuous water flow and stable water levels are desired for flooded peatlands to prevent high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate and to utilize the potential for nitrate retention. In degenerated peatlands, flooding should only be regarded as an easy technological solution in order to conserve the peat mineralization, and to form the foundation for the further development of the peatland to a more efficient nutrient retaining system.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and its components, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), were compared between a bog and an abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. Measurements based on the eddy covariance technique from April 2014 to April 2016 were used to examine the influence of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. NEE, GPP and ER at both sites showed pronounced seasonal variation, peaking near the middle growing season. The maximum net CO2 uptake rate of -28.61 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and emission rate of 14.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the pasture were significantly higher than those at the bog (-9.67 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Daytime average GPP was related to photosynthetic photon flux density and air temperature and the nighttime average ER decreased with soil water content, but increased with surface soil temperature for both sites. Annual NEE of the pasture (-128 +/- 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and -124 +/- 56 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16) was considerably larger than that of the bog (-46 +/- 36 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15). GPP of 1086 +/- 141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 982 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 and ER of 957 129 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 858 +/- 112 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 at the pasture were approximately twice the magnitude of the corresponding fluxes at the bog. The difference in GPP between the bog and pasture was mainly related to their different aboveground biomass. Higher ER at the pasture was probably related to its lower water table depth, greater substrate availability and higher autotrophic respiration. Unlike previous findings that managed peat lands are large CO2 emitters, our results suggest that abandoned peatland pastures can function like natural grasslands and sequester considerable amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB Microbes play crucial roles in global carbon cycles, particularly in peatland ecosystems that store vast quantities of carbon. Boreal peatlands are under stress from commercial extraction of peat, drainage for conversion to forestry and agricultural lands, and climate change. In this study, we identify key microbial groups and their ecological functions across peatland depth profiles and provide insight into how environmental changes related to water table may alter microbial communities. We examined the diversity and composition of prokaryotic communities across a microtopographic hummock-hollow gradient using Illumina sequencing. Communities formed a gradient of species and functional groups with depth, with overlap in functional groups at lower layers of hummocks and upper layers of hollows. Yet, overall, we found significantly different prokaryotic communities in hollows than hummocks. Surfaces of hummocks were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, methanotrophs and chemoheterotrophs, mid-depths were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and anaerobic nitrate reducers, while lower depths in hollows were typified by anaerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrate reducers and methanogenic archaea. Microbial composition as a function of hydrology and moisture regimes suggests that environmental changes that alter hydrological regimes (e.g., climate change, peatland draining) may alter carbon and nutrient cycling regimes.

AB Rewetting of bogs after peat extraction in eutrophied, agricultural areas often results in mono-species stands of Juncus effusus L. In contrast to typical peat forming vegetation such as Sphagnum, J. effusus is highly productive and supplies large amounts of labile carbon, but it is still unknown how this species affects biogeochemistry and the potential of restored peatlands to store carbon. To study degradation of T. effusus litter of different quality and its effect on peat decomposition, we conducted a full-factorial, anaerobic incubation with dried, C-13 labelled litter (roots and shoots) of fertilized (C/N ratio 19.6, C/P ratio 55.3) and non -fertilized plants (C/N ratio 57.8, C/P ratio 304.5). We furthermore analyzed weakly (fibric) to highly (earthyfied) humified, and acidic Sphagnum-Eriophorum peat from three different rewetted and active peat extraction sites of the temperate, nemoral NW German Plain. Materials were incubated fully water saturated at 15 degrees C for 70 days; peat-only and litter incubations served as controls to the full-factorial re-combination of peat and litter. By this experimental design, we investigated the effect of fertilization on litter degradability, decomposition rates of litter in relation to peat, and the controls on decomposition rates to explain potential priming effects by recombination of fresh organic carbon and refractory peat. Surprisingly, fertilization of J. effusus only insignificantly affected decomposition rates between litter types. Decomposition rates of J. effusus litter were 2-18 times higher than of peat, and spectroscopic analysis of the organic matter confirmed the lability of litter and its leachates in comparison to peat. Decomposition rates were equally controlled (73% variance explained) by availability of terminal electron acceptors and the activity of hydrolyzing enzymes. However, hydrolase activity was strongly negatively correlated (R-2=0.95, P < 0.05) with aromaticity, suggesting an inhibitory effect. Furthermore, upon combination of litter and peat, litter was preferentially decomposed. Litter amendments in general lead to faster depletion of electron acceptors. Thus, in these anaerobic incubations, electron acceptor availability limited a priming effect on the comparably refractory peat, and importantly, input of labile carbon from J. effusus did not compromise the preservation of peat. Instead, rapid exhaustion of electron acceptors may even lead to preservation of this comparably readily decomposable plant litter.

AB Spatiotemporal information on historical peatland drainage is needed to relate past land use to observed changes in catchment hydrology. Comprehensive knowledge of historical development of peatland management is largely unknown at the catchment scale. Aerial photos and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data enlarge the possibilities for identifying past peatland drainage patterns. Here, our objectives are (1) to develop techniques for semiautomatically mapping the location of ditch networks in peat-dominated catchments using aerial photos and LIDAR data, and (2) to generate time series of drainage networks. Our approaches provide open-access techniques to systematically map ditches in peat-dominated catchments through time. We focused on the algorithm in such a way that we can identify the ditch networks from raw aerial images and LIDAR data based on the modification of multiple filters and number of threshold values. Such data are needed to relate spatiotemporal drainage patterns to observed changes in many northern rivers. We demonstrate our approach using data from the Simojoki River catchment (3,160 km2) in northern Finland. The catchment is dominated by forests and peatlands that were almost all drained after 1960. For two representative locations in cultivated peatland (downstream) and peatland forest (upstream) areas of the catchment; we found total ditch length density (km/km2), estimated from aerial images and LIDAR data based on our proposed algorithm, to have varied from 2% to 50% compared with the monitored ditch length available from the National Land survey of Finland (NLSF) in 2018. A different pattern of source variation in ditch network density was observed for whole-catchment estimates and for the available drained-peatland database from Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE). Despite such differences, no significant differences were found using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test with a 0.05 significance level based on the samples of pixel-identified ditches between (1) aerial images and NLSF vector files and (2) LIDAR data and NLSF vector files.

   PEATLANDS; CO2 EXCHANGE; CH4 FLUXES; N2O; TILLAGE; GRASS; FORESTRY
AB Management of peat soils is regionally important as they cover large land areas and have important but conflicting ecosystems services. A recent management trend for drained peatlands is the control of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changes in agricultural practices, peatland restoration or paludiculture. Due to complex antagonistic controls of moisture, water table management can be difficult to use as a method for controlling GHG emissions. Past studies show that there is no obvious relationship between GHG emission rates and crop type, tillage intensity or fertilization rates. For drained peat soils, the best use options can vary from rewetting with reduced emission to efficient short term use to maximize the, profit per amount of greenhouse gas emitted. The GHG accounting should consider the entire life cycle of the peatland and the socio-economic benefits peatlands provide locally. Cultivating energy crops is a viable option especially for wet peat soils with poor drainage, but harvesting remains a challenge due to tractability of wet soils. Paludiculture in lowland floodplains can be a tool to mitigate regional flooding allowing water to be stored on these lands without much harm to crops. This can also increase regional biodiversity providing important habitats for birds and moisture tolerant plant species. However, on many peatlands rewetting is not possible due to their position in the landscape and the associated difficulty to maintain a high stable water table. While the goal of rewetting often is to encourage the return of peat forming plants and the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration, it is not well known if these plants will grow on peat soils that have been altered by the process of drainage and management. Therefore, it is important to consider peat quality and hydrology when choosing management options. Mapping of sites is recommended as a management tool to guide actions. The environmental status and socio-economic importance of the sites should be assessed both for continued cultivation but also for other ecosystem services such as restoration and hydrological functions (flood control). Farmers need advice, tools and training to find the best after-use option. Biofuels might provide a cost-efficient after use option for some sites. Peat extraction followed by rewetting might provide a sustainable option as rewetting is often easier if the peat is removed, starting the peat accumulation from scratch. Also this provides a way to finance the after-use. As impacts of land use are uncertain, new policies should consider multiple benefits and decisions should be based on scientific evidence and field scale observations. The need to further understand the key processes and long term effects of field scale land use manipulations is evident. The recommended actions for peatlands should be based on local condition and socio-economic needs to outline intermediate and long term plans. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a limited understanding of solute transport properties of degraded peat soils as compared to mineral substrates. A lower organic matter (OM) content is often the result of peat degradation and mineralization following artificial drainage. In this study, we aimed at deducing changes in solute transport properties of peat soils differing in OM content. Miscible displacement experiments were conducted on 70 undisturbed soil columns with OM contents ranging from 11 to 86% w/w under saturated steady-state conditions using tritium and bromide as conservative tracers. Measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) were subjected to model analysis using three different approaches: single-porosity model (SPM), mobile-immobile model (MIM), and two-flow region model (TFRM). The results indicated that (i) nonequilibrium solute transport processes are common in peat soils; (ii) the TFRM improved predictions of BTCs with heavy tailing or two peaks; (iii) applied tracers, tritium and bromide, were retarded in peat soils with higher OM content; and (iv) pronounced preferential flow mainly occurred in peat soils with lower OM content. This type of strong preferential flow had a small ratio of measured to fitted pore water velocity and a greater ratio of velocities (v(A)/v(B) > 3.0) in the fast and slow transport region as obtained from the TFRM. We conclude that shallow groundwater resources are more likely to become polluted in drained and degraded fen peats that are used for agricultural purposes.

AB Loss and degradation of wetlands is now one of the most important environmental issues on a global scale. Previous research based on analyses of cartographic materials allow for quantification of changes in wetland area in recent centuries. The results of lithological research of peat cores, reported in this publication, have established that the processes of anthropogenic loss of wetlands can be much older and in the Klodnica valley were initiated in the first millennium BC. As a result of increased mineral sedimentation accompanying soil erosion some peatlands have been fossilized whilst the area of others has been reduced. In total, the surface area of peat-forming wetlands in the bottom of the Klodnica valley decreased by over 60% between the time of the Lusatian Culture settlement and the Middle Ages. Post-peatland habitats are recently used for agricultural or colonized by non-peat forming vegetation. These processes have played a more important role in the degradation of peatland ecosystems than the direct human impact in historic times. Changes in hydrographic networks, land drainage and regulation of water levels in rivers and canals in the last century have contributed to further reducing the wetland areas by almost 50% compared to the 1880s. These processes, however, have mainly affected ephemeral non-peat forming wetlands.

AB Natural peatlands are the world's most area-effective carbon sinks. However, over 90% of German, 40% of European and 10-20% of global peatlands have been degraded and converted into carbon sources, primarily because of agricultural drainage. Against this background, rewetting and more sensible uses of peat soils for agriculture are internationally recognized as effective potential options to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents estimates of the GHG mitigation potential and abatement costs of different peatland management options by using the example of farm models that represent typical farm types in an intensive grassland-use peatland region in southern Germany. Therefore, an optimization model at the farm level that includes the emissions from all relevant sources in the production process is used.
   The current net GHG emissions of the farm models range from 10 to 12.9 tCO(2)e ha(-1) a(-1), of which the peat soil borne emissions make up a noticeable share. The rewetting and conversion of medium-drained grassland into wet grassland lead to considerable reductions of GHG emissions. However, in intensively managed dairy farms, the full emission Mitigation potential of these peatland management options is not realized, because necessary adaptations increase emissions from other sources. Because of its low GHG mitigation potential, the conversion of arable land into medium drained intensive grassland leads to high abatement costs of up to 92(sic)/tCO(2)e, while the abatement costs of the rewetting and conversion into wet grassland range from 5 to 57(sic)/tCO(2)e. The results vary by farm type, intensity of agricultural peatland use to date and the share of peatland area on a farm. This stresses the need for individual farm approaches and impact analyses for planned peatland renaturations. The findings also show that the overall costs to compensate farmer income loss from planned peatland renaturations will be as high as they are for more intensively managed dairy farms, which will be located in and affected in the respective area. The modelling approach presented has the potential to be adapted to the needs of peatland farm systems in other countries of the temperate zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many peatlands have been damaged by human activities like Sphagnum harvesting and draining reflected in reduced peatland areas and ecosystem functioning. Peatlands generally play an important role in global silicon (Si) cycling and maintain huge numbers of testate amoebae (TA). However, there is a lack of knowledge on (i) the quantity of protozoic Si pools (represented by siliceous shells of TA) in peatlands and (ii) how these pools respond to land use changes caused by human influence. In our study, we quantified protozoic Si pools in the Dajiuhu National Wetland Park, China, with a focus on the comparison between peatland and cropland areas (i.e., former peatland drained for agriculture). We found protozoic Si pools to (i) represent an important biogenic silica fraction in peatlands and (ii) significantly differ between peatlands and croplands with soil moisture as a key factor for protozoic Si pool quantity showing a significant decrease of these pools in drained areas (i.e., in croplands). From our results we concluded the decrease of protozoic Si pools due to land-use change to represent another example (apart from the loss of phytogenic Si) for anthropogenic desilication in agricultural biogeosystems in general.

AB The elemental composition and spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids isolated from different sampling media (topsoil, ground and surface water) of a natural fen area (high portion of organic soils) were examined to reveal the effects of land use history. These effects need to be known if dissolved humic substances are to be a major factor in identifying the impact of present and future changes in land use. Dissolved fulvic acids (topsoil, groundwater) from highly degraded peatlands (due to a long-term agricultural use) exhibit lower C/N ratios, higher absorption in the UV spectra, and higher absorption at 1,620 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectra compared with fulvic acids from relatively intact peatlands. These properties illustrate that long-term agricultural use with high inputs results in increased aromatic structures and a further humification of dissolved fulvic acids due to very strong peat decomposition compared with relatively intact peatlands. Synchronous fluorescence spectra also indicate the higher level of aromatic structures within fulvic acids isolated from sites with long-term agricultural use (high peat decomposition) compared with a land use history resulting in a lower peat decomposition. The different sources of fulvic acids in surface water (precipitation, runoff, interflow, groundwater) are the main reason for these effects not being detected in fulvic acids isolated from surface water. Short-term changes in land use characterized by a transition from crop farming to an unimproved grassland were found not to affect the spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids. A humification index deduced from the synchronous fluorescence spectra is proposed. We have strong evidence that dissolved humic substances indicate changes in the environmental conditions (both anthropogenic and natural) of wetlands with a high proportion of organic soils.

AB Peatlands occupy 20% of the land area of Ireland and store over half of soil carbon stocks. Over 80% of these peatlands have been disturbed by human activity such as drainage for peat extraction, afforestation and agriculture. In this study, peat samples were collected from 12 horticultural peat extraction sites in the Irish midlands. The carbon (C), nitrogen (N), hydrogen and sulphur content were determined, and from these, the carbon oxidation state (C-ox) and oxidative ratio (OR) were calculated. The carbon oxidation ratio reflects organic matter synthesis and degradation, and is thus an important parameter in understanding terrestrial carbon cycling, whilst OR represents the molar ratio of oxygen (O-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes associated with net ecosystem exchange. Elemental concentrations and ratios were typical for Irish horticultural peat (e.g. carbon concentrations 54%-57%), though showed site to site variability. C(ox)and OR values varied between -0.22 and -0.11, and 1.04 and 1.07, respectively, and were comparable to United Kingdom peat soils. All values for OR were lower than 1.1, the value commonly used in global CO(2)partitioning studies. Further research should investigate OR values in peatland which has not been studied to date. Across all sites, measures of increased decomposition (i.e. C/N ratios) significantly correlated with increasing OR reflecting more reduced organic matter. This study provides data in temperate peat soils that increases the coverage of C(ox)and OR values and will inform global CO(2)partitioning studies.

AB Reclamation of peat bogs for agriculture changes the physical and chemical characteristics of the peat matrix, for example, drainage and tillage accelerate decomposition, altering peat porosity, pore size distribution, and hydraulic properties. This study investigated changes in near-saturated hydraulic conductivity over time after drainage of peat soil for agricultural use by conducting tension infiltrometer measurements in a mire that has been gradually drained and reclaimed for agriculture during the past 80 years (with fields drained 2, 12, 40, and 80 years before the measurements). At pore water pressure closest to saturation (pressure head -1 cm), hydraulic conductivity in the newest field was approximately nine times larger than that in the oldest field, and a decreasing trend with field age was observed. A similar (but weaker) trend was observed with -3 cm pressure head (approximately four times larger in the newest field in comparison to the oldest), but at -6 cm head, there were no significant differences. These results indicate that peat degradation reduces the amount of millimetre-sized pores in particular. They also indicate that changes in peat macroporosity continue for several decades before a new steady state is reached.

AB The radiocarbon age and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a northern peat-dominated river system was studied and the effects of land-use were compared. Samples were obtained from streams and ditches comprising sub-catchments of the Kiiminki River, Northern Finland. Sample sites included areas of natural mire, areas subjected to moderate disturbance (ditching to enhance forestry), and areas subjected to serious land use change (agriculture and peat excavation). The study employed a 55 day bioassay that measured the biodegradation potential of surface-water DOM. We identified release of modern (mean 6-13 year old) DOM from natural sites, and material aged up to 1,553 years from disturbed sites. The proportion of biodegradable DOC ranged from 4.1 to 17.9 %, and bacterial DOC removal was modelled using twin-pool and reactivity-continuum (beta distribution) approaches. Bacterial growth efficiency ranged from 0.11 to 0.26 between areas of different land use, and these relatively low values reflect the humic-rich DOM released from boreal peatland. Despite the range of land-use types studied, including intensive peatland excavation areas, there was no detectable relationship between the biological lability of DOM and its radiocarbon age.

AB Rewetting of agriculturally used peatlands has been proposed as a measure to stop soil subsidence, conserve peat and rehabilitate ecosystem functioning. Unintended consequences might involve nutrient release and changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance towards CH4-dominated emission. To investigate the risks and benefits of rewetting, we subjected soil columns from drained peat- and clay-covered peatlands to different water level treatments: permanently low, permanently inundated and fluctuating (first inundated, then drained). Surface water and soil pore water chemistry, soil-extractable nutrients and greenhouse gas fluxes were measured throughout the experiment. Permanent inundation released large amounts of nutrients into pore water, especially phosphorus (up to 11.7 mg P-PO4 l(-1)) and ammonium (4.8 mg N-NH4 l(-1)). Phosphorus release was larger in peat than in clay soil, presumably due to the larger pool of iron-bound phosphorus in peat. Furthermore, substantial amounts of phosphorus and potassium were exported from the soil matrix to the surface water, risking the pollution of local species-rich (semi-)aquatic ecosystems. Rewetting of both clay and peat soil reduced CO2 emissions. CH4 emissions increased, but, in contrast to the expectations, the fluxes were relatively low. Calculations showed that rewetting reduced net cumulative GHG emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents.

TI Annual greenhouse gas budget for a bog ecosystem undergoing restoration

AB Many peatlands have been drained and harvested for peat mining, agriculture, and other purposes, which has turned them from carbon (C) sinks into C emitters. Rewetting of disturbed peatlands facilitates their ecological recovery and may help them revert to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting may also cause substantial emissions of the more potent greenhouse gas (GHG) methane (CH4). Our knowledge of the exchange of CO2 and CH4 following rewetting during restoration of disturbed peatlands is currently limited. This study quantifies annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in a disturbed and rewetted area located in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area in Delta, BC, Canada. Burns Bog is recognized as the largest raised bog ecosystem on North America's west coast. Burns Bog was substantially reduced in size and degraded by peat mining and agriculture. Since 2005, the bog has been declared a conservancy area, with restoration efforts focusing on rewetting disturbed ecosystems to recover Sphagnum and suppress fires. Using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, we measured year-round (16 June 2015 to 15 June 2016) turbulent fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from a tower platform in an area rewetted for the last 8 years. The study area, dominated by sedges and Sphagnum, experienced a varying water table position that ranged between 7.7 (inundation) and -26.5 cm from the surface during the study year. The annual CO2 budget of the rewetted area was -179 +/- 26.2 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1) (CO2 sink) and the annual CH4 budget was 17 +/- 1.0 gCH(4-)Cm(-2) yr(-1) (CH4 source). Gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exceeded ecosystem respiration (R-e) during summer months (June-August), causing a net CO2 uptake. In summer, high CH4 emissions (121 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were measured. In winter (December-February), while roughly equal magnitudes of GEP and R-e made the study area CO2 neutral, very low CH4 emissions (9 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were observed. The key environmental factors controlling the seasonality of these exchanges were downwelling photosynthetically active radiation and 5 cm soil temperature. It appears that the high water table caused by ditch blocking suppressed R-e. With low temperatures in winter, CH4 emissions were more suppressed than R-e. Annual net GHG flux from CO2 and CH4 expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq.) during the study period totalled -22 +/- 103.1 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) y(-1) (net CO2 eq. sink) and 1248 +/- 147.6 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) yr(-1) (net CO2 eq. source) by using 100- and 20-year global warming potential values, respectively. Consequently, the ecosystem was almost CO2 eq. neutral during the study period expressed on a 100-year time horizon but was a significant CO2 eq. source on a 20-year time horizon.

AB Hydrophysical properties of peat influence the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration versus runoff, determine water flow and solute transport patterns, and regulate the carbon and nitrogen cycles in peatlands. Compared with mineral soils, our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited, especially of the temporal dynamics of peat properties. A data set of peat subsidence as well as the bulk density (BD) change rate following artificial drainage was assembled from the literature. The collected data cover a time period of up to 272 years of land drainage for forestry and agriculture in boreal and temperate climate zones. The results show that the subsidence rate and BD change rate, and hydrophysical properties of peat can be estimated based on land drainage duration and land use. The most severe shift in pore structure of peat occurs within the first 20 years of land drainage. Peatland drainage reduces macroporosity with pore diameter greater than 50 mu m, but increases the volume of pores <5 mu m. In the long term, peat thickness loss is responsible for more than 80% of water storage loss. In conclusion, the derived functions between subsidence rate, BD change rate, and drainage duration provide a new approach to estimate the hydrophysical properties of peat (pore structure, saturated hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and soil water storage) on a centennial scale. The derived hydrophysical parameter values can be used for long-term hydrological modeling, especially if measured hydraulic parameters of peat are not available.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained and converted to agriculture more than a century ago, and since then has experienced extreme rates of soil subsidence from peat oxidation. To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes. We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CO2 and 3.3 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) of CO2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reflooding formerly drained peatlands has been proposed as a means to reduce losses of organic matter and sequester soil carbon for climate change mitigation, but a renewal of high methane emissions has been reported for these ecosystems, offsetting mitigation potential. Our ability to interpret observed methane fluxes in reflooded peatlands and make predictions about future flux trends is limited due to a lack of detailed studies of methanogenic processes. In this study we investigate methanogenesis in a reflooded agricultural peatland in the Sacramento Delta, California. We use the stable-and radio-carbon isotopic signatures of wetland sediment methane, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance flux observations, and laboratory incubation experiments, to identify which carbon sources and methanogenic production pathways fuel methanogenesis and how these processes are affected by vegetation and seasonality. We found that the old peat contribution to annual methane emissions was large (~30%) compared to intact wetlands, indicating a biogeochemical legacy of drainage. However, fresh carbon and the acetoclastic pathway still accounted for the majority of methanogenesis throughout the year. Although temperature sensitivities for bulk peat methanogenesis were similar between open-water (Q(10) = 2.1) and vegetated (Q(10) = 2.3) soils, methane production from both fresh and old carbon sources showed pronounced seasonality in vegetated zones. We conclude that high methane emissions in restored wetlands constitute a biogeochemical trade-off with contemporary carbon uptake, given that methane efflux is fueled primarily by fresh carbon inputs.

AB For implementation of sustainable land use strategies in Europe tools for evaluating long-term changes of peatland functions are essential. Therefore a semi-quantitative peatland management decision support system for agricultural used peatlands in Europe was developed. It is called Peatland Management Decision Support System (PMDSS). The aim of the tool is to better understand and to forecast long-term processes in peatland ecosystems in order to help scientists, water boards and environmental agencies in decision making about long-term management. PMDSS is based on derived indicators of ecosystem functions of peatlands, which are: harvest of plant products, land use category, mean summer water table (MSWT), nitrogen discharge, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and conservation value of plants. PMDSS is realized as an easy to use spreadsheet program in Excel. The model is one-dimensional and applicable for a site or field, where the input parameters, particularly land use category, vegetation type and MSWT are relatively homogenous. It is running with annual intervals and for a time span of 100 years (vegetation 50 years). Results are presented as values, text and diagrams. PMDSS is accessible via internet.
   PMDSS was applied to sites in several European countries. A case study in the Eider Valley peatland is presented, which is typical for Weichselian landscapes of northwest Germany. The site has a deep peat layer and is mainly influenced by groundwater discharge. It was used as a meadow and pasture during the past centuries and is left abandoned since the mid 1990s. Effects of different land use and water management scenarios onto the development of the site are determined. The scenarios are typical for peatland sites in northwest Germany and northwest Europe. Results are plausible as a rough estimate of magnitude and development trend. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carer lepidacarpa Tausch subsp. lepidocarpa (section Ceratocystis) is a threatened plant growing in Finland only in the Aland Islands. It is restricted to intermediate and flark levels of calcareous rich fens, where it occurs both in mire margin and in mire expanse conditions. A comparison is made with the ecology of C. lepidocarpa subsp.jemtlandica Palmgr. in NE Finland. The vegetation of C. lepidocarpa localities was grouped with TWINSPAN classification analysis and DCA ordination analysis. A distribution map of C. lepidacarpa in Aland is presented. Hybridization with other species in the C. flava complex and especially with C. hostiana is frequent. C. lepidocarpa is sensitive to changes in the water table of the habitat, and it has strongly decreased in Aland because of the drainage of mires for agriculture and forestry. The overgrowth due to cessation of traditional agricultural management (mowing and grazing) is another threat to C. lepidocarpa, at least in mire margin conditions. The localities that remain contain several plants that are threatened in Finland and have a high conservation value.

AB Drained peatlands aremajor sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet the effects of land management and hydrological extremes have been little-studied at spatial scales relevant to agricultural enterprises. We measured fluxes of CO2 using the eddy covariance (EC) technique at two adjacent dairy farms on a drained peatland in Aotearoa New Zealand with remaining peat depths 5.5-8 m. One site (SD) had shallow surface drains and mean water table depth (WTD) -657 mm, while the other site (BD) had deep field border drains and mean WTD -838 mm. Net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) was similar at the two sites when the soils were moist but diverged during late-summer drying, with site BD having 4.56 t C ha(-1) greater CO2 emission than site SD over the four-month dry period. Soil drying reduced gross primary production (GPP) at both sites, while ecosystem respiration (ER) was reduced at site SD but not at site BD. The low dry season respiration rates at site SD contributed to near-zero annual NEP, while higher respiration rates at site BD led to annual CO2 loss of -4.95 +/- 0.59 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Accounting for other imports and exports of carbon, annual net ecosystem carbon balances were -2.23 and -8.47 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) at sites SD and BD, respectively. It is likely that the contrasting dry season respiration rates resulted from differences in soil physical properties affecting soil moisture vertical redistribution and availability to plants and microbes rather than from the relatively small differences in WTD. These differences could be caused by soil physical disturbances during pasture renewal or paddock recontouring, or time since initial drainage. Therefore, improved soil management might provide practical mitigation against excessive CO2 emissions during dry conditions, including droughts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils almost always result in rapid soil degradation and a loss of soil organic matter (SOM). Winter cover crop cultivation and subsequent incorporation and watertable elevation have been considered as potential strategies to improve soil quality and decrease nutrient loss in drained and cultivated peatlands. However, the combined effect of residue incorporation and watertable management on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in these highly productive fen peat soils remains unknown. In the present study, two winter cover crops with contrasting carbon/nitrogen ratios (vetch [Vicia sativa], 45-60; rye [Secale cereale], 13-14) were incorporated into peat soils as green manure (without extra synthetic/organic N addition) at two watertable depths (-50 and -30 cm). Our results showed that fast mineralization of incorporated residues can cause a large pulse of GHG release under favourable environmental conditions. Both vetch and rye incorporation increased CO2 emissions compared with the bare soil treatments due to labile C addition and removal of N constraints. However, the two cover crops had strongly contrasting effects on N2O emissions. Incorporation of low C/N ratio vetch stimulated N2O emissions (average 21.8 +/- 7.3 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)) compared with the bare soil treatments, whereas high C/N ratio rye decreased N2O emissions (average 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)). Raising the watertable slightly reduced CO2 emissions from an average of 1.3 +/- 0.4 (the bare soils) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 g C m(-2) hr(-1) by inhibiting SOM mineralization but significantly increased N2O emissions in the vetch treatments by stimulating denitrification. CH4 fluxes were not affected by watertable depth, and their contribution to total global warming potential was negligible. Therefore, we conclude that high C/N ratio cover crops (e.g., rye) in combination with a raised watertable may represent a viable management option to mitigate GHG fluxes in fen peat soils.

AB Temperate peatlands are regionally important for farming but long-term cultivation, as well as reforestation after intense agricultural use, can have a significant impact on their soil microbial activity and nitrogen cycles. We studied peatlands in the central part of European Russia, which initially was a swamp forest ecosystem with fairly homogeneous properties of woody peat. Different sites in the area were subsequently under different types of land use. We studied 4 sites in order of increasing management intensity: near-pristine swamp forest, a reforested site after 50 years of intensive cultivation and 2 agricultural sites with 50- and 100-year histories of agricultural use. We examined the dynamics of microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N and mineral nitrogen during the growing season (May-November). We conclude that land use type can affect the seasonal dynamics of available and microbial nitrogen by changing the vegetation cover. For peatlands covered with natural vegetation, an important feature of the seasonal dynamics of N is microbial immobilization and storage during winter. High activity of beta-1,4-glucosidase and low activity of peroxidase indicate that microorganisms consume mainly nitrogen and carbon from fresh plant litter, rather than carbon and nitrogen conserved in peat. Long-term peatland agricultural use has led to significant changes in the dynamics of available and microbial nitrogen and carbon during the growing season, and land management has greatly modified the limitations of the activity of micro-organisms from the availability of nitrogen (in the forest) to the availability of carbon (in arable peatland). The changes in peatlands occurred in the first years or decades of their exploitation because we did not find significant differences in any of the indicators between the arable lands used for 50 and > 100 years. We found that natural reforestation for 50 years has not yet fully restored microbial activity; however, for some parameters, this site has characteristics close to those of near-pristine swamp forest.

AB Anthropogenic activity is affecting the global climate through the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) e.g. CO2 and CH4. About a third of anthropogenic GHGs are produced from agriculture, including livestock farming and horticulture. A large proportion of the UK's horticultural farming takes place on drained lowland peatlands, which are a source of significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. This study set out to establish whether taising the water table from the currently used 50 cm to 30 cm could reduce GHGs emissions from agricultural peatlands, while simultaneously maintaining the current levels of horticultural productivity. A factorial design experiment used agricultural peat soil collected from the Norfolk Fens (among the largest of the UK's lowland peatlands under intensive cultivation) to assess the effects of water table levels, elevated CO2, and agricultural production on GHG fluxes and crop productivity of radish, one of the most economically important fenland crops. The results of this study show that a water table of 30 cm can increase the productivity of the radish crop while also reducing soil CO2 emissions but without a resultant loss of CH4 to the atmosphere, under both ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations. Elevated CO2 increased dry shoot biomass, but not bulb biomass nor root biomass, suggesting no immediate advantage of future CO2 levels to horticultural farming on peat soils. Overall, increasing the water table could make an important contribution to global warming mitigation while not having a detrimental impact on crop yield. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Most of the once ecologically valuable and widespread peatlands in Western Europe as well as in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (North-Eastern Germany) have been drained in the course of the intensification of agricultural land use. Peat degradation and mineralisation frequently caused high nitrate-nitrogen (NO3- -N) tosses, white re-wetting may lead to elevated phosphorus concentrations in the Porewater. High concentrations of NO3--N and other solutes in a ditch draining a catchment (85 ha) dominated by degraded peatland under intensive grassland use gave reason to investigate the relationship between the spatial and temporal variability of the shallow groundwater quality on the one hand and soil properties, topography and hydrological dynamics on the other hand. Therefore, in addition to the ditch, three transects of dipwells were sampled and soil samples were taken along the transects at a high spatial resolution. Soil organic carbon C-org and total nitrogen N-t contents varied considerably from 0.8% to 40.9% and 0.08% to 2.87%, respectively. A trend surface analysis (TSA) of these soil properties showed a strong trend depending on the ground elevation and the distance to the adjacent drainage ditch, reflecting both a transition from mineral to organic soils and differences in peat formation and degradation connected to the topography and, consequently, to the depth to the groundwater table. Semivariogram analysis was performed using the normally distributed residuals of the TSA and showed for each transect a strong spatial dependence and short (5-26 m) ranges. If possible, soil sampling in peatlands should be conducted at short distance sampling intervals. The patterns of groundwater solute concentrations were complex. They were spatially and temporally very variable between as welt as within the transects, thus proving that a few groundwater samples are insufficient for a representative characterisation of the peatland status and for an evaluation of possible environmental impacts or potential consequences of re-wetting. Groundwater concentrations ranged from 0 to 65.4 mg l(-1) NO3--N and 0-1.95 mg l(-1) P-t, while during the same period, ditch water concentrations of 0-15.9 mg l(-1) NO3--N and 0.05 to 0.44 mg l(-1) P-t, respectively, were measured. Factor analysis of groundwater concentrations, topographical data, hydrological conditions and soil properties led to the identification of five factors explaining up to 80% of the observed variance of the data: (i) topography and soil chemical properties, (ii) biogeochemical processes, (iii) drainage effects, (iv) climatic effects and (v) dilution effects.

AB Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.)
   Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Fen peatlands represent a globally important carbon (C) store, while also providing highly productive agricultural land. Drainage of these organic soils is required to create conditions suitable for crop growth, but this results in substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One potential GHG mitigation option is to raise the groundwater table to reduce the duration and volume of peat exposure to aerobic conditions. However, the trade-off between maintaining food production and securing ecosystem function under a high water table (WT) presents a serious challenge for both land managers and policy makers. Therefore, we conducted a controlled mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of WT elevation (from similar to 50 cm to similar to 30 cm) under three contrasting scenarios: (i) WT raised throughout the year, (ii) WT raised in the winter only, and (iii) WT raised in the growing season only. We measured GHG emissions, nitrate, ammonium and dissolved organic C concentrations in soil solution, alongside the yield of a commercially important crop (lettuce). Raising the WT throughout the year reduced lettuce yields by 37% and reduced CO2 emissions by 36% without changing the loss rates of N2O or CH4. Raising the WT only in the winter did not significantly reduce crop yield, but still suppressed CO2 emissions during the fallow period (by 30%). Raising the WT only in the growing season reduced root growth and CO2 emissions (by 27%), but had no major effect on lettuce yield. In conclusion, the present study shows that raising the groundwater table in the non-growing season reduced GHG emissions without negatively affecting lettuce yields, and may therefore represent a viable GHG mitigation option for agricultural peatlands.

AB Human land-use activities, especially in the peatlands, are under consideration as the mitigation and lowering of CO2 emissions from land-use practices is needed to address climate change. In Finland, approximately one third of the land surface is covered by peatlands, and around 50% of peatlands are ditched for forestry. Another 3% of peatlands are used for agriculture and approximately 1% for peat extraction. The effects of these different land-use practices, including changes in sediment depositional rates and sediment quality, need to be identified. This study analyzed 51 lakes that were subdivided into two groups: (1) a group of impacted lakes in which peat was recently extracted from the catchments and (2) a reference group consisting of lakes where peat had not been extracted from the basin, but in which other land-use activities had occurred. The overall aim of the study was to investigate if peat extraction caused excessive delivery and deposition of dry and organic matter in lakes that are located in their immediate downstream catchment areas. Differences in sediment accumulation were defined by comparing the overall sediment thickness and recent (post 1986) sedimentation levels to identify if there were differences in the sediment chemical composition or rate of organic matter deposition between groups and to identify possible land-use stressors that could explain the possible differences in sediment chemical assemblages or sedimentation rates. The results show moderate (cm scale) sedimentation rates in both impacted and reference lakes after 1986, while sediment chemical assemblages indicated the erosion and input of mineral soils to all of the studied lakes, rather than the input of organic materials. No statistically significant correlations were observed between selected environmental variables and the recent accumulation rates of carbon and dry matter. Moreover, significant changes in the stressors potentially affecting the chemical assemblages of pre- and post-disturbance sediments were not observed.

AB It is generally known that managed, drained peatlands act as carbon (C) sources. In this study we examined how mitigation through the reduction of the intensity of land management and through rewetting may affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the C balance of intensively managed, drained, agricultural peatlands. Carbon and GHG balances were determined for three peatlands in the western part of the Netherlands from 2005 to 2008 by considering spatial and temporal variability of emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). One area (Oukoop) is an intensively managed grass-on-peatland area, including a dairy farm, with the ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.55 (+/- 0.37) m below the soil surface. The second area (Stein) is an extensively managed grass-on-peatland area, formerly intensively managed, with a dynamic ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.45 (+/- 0.35) m below the soil surface. The third area is a (since 1998) rewetted former agricultural peatland (Horstermeer), close to Oukoop and Stein, with the average annual ground water level at a depth of 0.2 (+/- 0.20) m below the soil surface. During the measurement campaigns we found that both agriculturally managed sites acted as C and GHG sources and the rewetted former agricultural peatland acted as a C and GHG sink. The ecosystem (fields and ditches) total GHG balance, including CO2, CH4 and N2O, amounted to 3.9 (+/- 0.4), 1.3 (+/- 0.5) and -1.7 (+/- 1.8) g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1) for Oukoop, Stein and Horstermeer, respectively. Adding the farm-based emissions to Oukoop and Stein resulted in a total GHG emission of 8.3 (+/- 1.0) and 6.6 (+/- 1.3) gCO(2)-eq m(-2) d(-1), respectively. For Horstermeer the GHG balance remained the same since no farm-based emissions exist. Considering the C balance (uncertainty range 40-60 %), the total C release in Oukoop and Stein is 5270 and 6258 kg Cha(-1) yr(-1), respectively (including ecosystem and management fluxes), and the total C uptake in Horstermeer is 3538 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Water bodies contributed significantly to the terrestrial GHG balance because of a high release of CH4.
   Overall, this study suggests that managed peatlands are large sources of GHGs and C, but, if appropriate measures are taken, they can be turned back into GHG and C sinks within 15 years of abandonment and rewetting. The shift from an intensively managed grass-on-peat area (Oukoop) to an extensively managed one (Stein) reduced the GHG emissions mainly because N2O emission and farm-based CH4 emissions decreased.

AB As soon as peat soil is drained for agricultural production, the peat starts to degrade, which causes emissions to the atmosphere. In countries with large peatland areas, the GHG mitigation potential related to management of these soils is often estimated as the highest amongst the measures available in agriculture. Although the facts are well known, the policies leading to diminished emissions are often difficult to implement. We have analysed the reasons why the mitigation potential is not fully utilized and what could be done better in national implementation of climate policies. Four cases are used to illustrate the necessary steps to reach mitigation targets: determining the amount and properties of peat soils, estimating the potential, costs and feasibility of the mitigation measures, and selecting and implementing the best measures. A common feature for all of the cases was that national and international climate policies have increased the public interest in GHG emissions from peat soils and increased the pressure for mitigation. Basically the same factors restrict the implementation of mitigation measures in all countries with significant peat soil areas. The most important of these is lack of policy coherence, e.g. ignoring climate policies when planning land use or agricultural policies. We conclude that GHG mitigation is achieved only if other policies, especially national regulations and strategies, are in line with climate policies.
   Policy relevance
   Agricultural peat soils could be used to help reach GHG mitigation goals in many countries, but the full potential of mitigation of peat soils is not used. Although peatland cultivation inevitably leads to loss of the whole peat layer and high emissions, there are few incentives or regulation to effectively minimize these losses. This article discusses the possibilities to reduce GHG emissions from agricultural peat soils, with specific emphasis on the barriers of implementing mitigation measures nationally. The lessons learned from the selected cases emphasize the role of all policy makers and their cooperation in planning coherent policies for achieving the goals determined by climate policies.

AB The present investigation was part of a fen restoration project, which deals with the rehabilitation of a deeply drained peat land used for intensive agriculture for more than 200 years, Consequently, the conditions for restoration are unfavorable. The hay of well-developed fen meadows from nature reserves in the region appeared to contain enough viable seeds to act as a source for the development of target communities when spread out on bare peat after topsoil removal. Repeated vegetation analysis showed that a combination of topsoil removal and hay transfer resulted in the establishment of new populations in the target area for 70% of the species of the donor area. Germination conditions of fen species were investigated to determine the optimal combination for stimulating germination rates. Most fen species were found to be dormant, and it was shown that dormancy could be broken with fluctuating light and temperature cycles and stratification pre-treatment.

AB We compared greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and albedo of a pristine boreal bog and an adjacent abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada to estimate the magnitude of radiative forcing (RF) created by agricultural drainage and abandonment. Our results indicated that these anthropogenic activities induced a climate cooling effect (negative RF), with the magnitude of the RF caused by the albedo change comparable to that induced by altered GHGs. Although the albedo-induced RF was positive in winter and negative in summer, the summer effect dominated because of greater solar radiation received. The climate cooling effect of GHGs change was due to an increase in the carbon dioxide sink capacity and a reduction in methane emissions under lower water table levels following agricultural drainage and abandonment. Calculation of sustained-flux global warming/cooling potentials also supported this finding. Our results show that the overall increase in albedo resulting from agricultural drainage and abandonment contributes significantly to the negative RF, strengthening the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes. Therefore, changes in albedo due to altered vegetation coverage and hydrology and GHG fluxes should be considered when assessing the climatic impacts from land-use change in northern peatland.

AB Peatlands have been widely developed for pasture usage through drainage and with the introduction of forage grasses; however, the effects of drainage and plant community change on methane (CH4) emission have not yet been well addressed. In this study, CH4 emissions, environmental factors, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were investigated across a disturbance gradient (i.e., the natural peatlands, the drained peatlands, and an abandoned peatland pasture). Our results show that in addition to temperature and water table, the substrate availability (DOC as a proxy) is also an important regulator of CH4 emission. For example, DOC, peat temperature at 5 cm depth (T-5), and water table depth (WTD) jointly explained 53% of the temporal variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux for the hollows. Also, DOC was observed to be significantly correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux for each land form. After the data were split into wet and dry seasons based on the water table, we observed that the T-5 was the main driver of the CH4 flux during the wet season (R-2 = 0.13), while VVTD replaced it during the dry season (R-2 = 0.23) for the general peatland system (i.e., all plots taken together). For the hummocks, both and WTD together explained 31% of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the wet season, and peat temperature at 20 cm depth explained 16% of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the dry season, while neither T-5 nor WTD was correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux across the whole season. These results imply that the relationships between environmental factors and CH4 flux depend on the water table and land forms. Our results indicate that water table drawdown is the main driver of the CH4 emission decrease at the non-inundated sites, and it explained 72% of the variance in seasonal mean CH4 emission among sites. The drainage ditches of the drained peatlands and the abandoned pasture, in spite of covering only 5% of the land area, contributed 15% and 32% of the CH4 emission of the land use type, respectively, and therefore represent a "hot spot" of CH4 emissions. High CH4 emission rates from the ditches, especially of the abandoned pasture, can be attributed to the higher production and export of DOC as a result of the rigorous vegetation growth. Spatially weighted CH4 emissions from May to October were 1.87 +/- 0.68 g CH4 m(-2) for the natural peatlands, 1.08 +/- 0.35 g CH4 m-2 for the drained peatlands, and 1.40 +/- 0.28 g CH4 m(-2) for the abandoned pasture. Our results suggest that it is critical to measure the CH4 emission from the drainage ditches, where fresher substrate with a higher quality is transferred from the vegetated portion of the drained peatlands, in order to accurately evaluate the effects of agricultural development on the CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands.

AB Rates of methane uptake were measured in incubation studies with intact cores from adjacent fenland peats that have been under arable management and woodland management for at least the past 30 years. On two separate occasions the woodland peat showed greater rates of uptake than the arable peat. These rates ranged from 23.1 to 223.3 mu g CH(4) m(-2) day(-1) for the woodland peat and from 29.6 to 157.6 mu g CH(4) m(-2) day(-1) for the arable peat. When the peats were artificially flooded there was a decrease in the rate of methane oxidation, but neither site showed any net efflux of methane. (15)N isotopic dilution was used to characterise nitrogen cycling within the two peats. Both showed similar rates of gross nitrogen mineralisation (3.58 mg N kg(-1) day(-1), arable peat; 3.54 N kg(-1) day(-1), woodland peat) and ammonium consumption (4.19 arable peat and 4.70 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) woodland peat). There were significant differences in their inorganic ammonium and nitrate pool sizes, and the rate of gross nitrification was significantly higher in the woodland peat (4.90 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)) compared to the arable peat (1.90 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)). These results are discussed in the light of high atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

AB Farming in peatland can produce a commodity well if it follows the right planting calendar. Microclimate conditions in the peatland cannot yet be measured in real-time within a shorter time interval. Pelalawan, a region where most of its farmers use peatland for oil palm cultivation, need guidance on applying the best method of oil palm cultivation, which is possible to improve. This study aims to apply a telemetric based (field monitoring system) real-time climatic data application to monitor the agricultural field (peatland). Climate data and weather - soil sensors were set up in Pelalawan village from August 18 to November 16, 2018. Besides, the advancement of planting calendar determination method is also done for peatland farming with a climatic water balance analysis. The change in peatland farming has been successfully observed and measured. The changes in the climatic environment can be observed continuously within a time interval of 30 minutes. Sun radiation data show a significant fluctuation shift from day to day. It also occurs for rainfall, temperature and humidity data. Climatic data fluctuation can be monitored directly and continuously with a Field Monitoring System (FMS) application. Water balance for paddy and corn is obtained based on Plant Water Need and Effective Rain. The recommended schedule according to water balance analysis (surplus and deficit) is paddy 1 - corn - paddy 2.

AB Natural peat soils serve as important sinks for nutrients, organic components, and water. Peat soils can pose major environmental problems when they are drained for agricultural production, which may change their role in the landscape from a sink to a source. To successfully restore and conserve peat soils, it is important to understand the soil-moisture dynamics and water demand of drained peat soils for different climate and groundwater conditions. For this purpose, we conducted a series of lysimeter experiments with peat soils subject to different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates and upward capillary fluxes in peat soils under grass were measured, while TDR probes and tensiometers were used to monitor the soil-water dynamics in the lysimeter during the growing season. The lysimeter data were simulated using an extended version of HYDRUS-1D to enable ET calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. A physically based approach was tested to predict the canopy resistance as a function of the average pressure head of the soil root zone. The numerical simulations closely followed the observed soil-moisture dynamics in the lysimeter and were consistent with measured differences in ET rates for different groundwater levels. Besides average climate conditions, the effects of extreme dry and wet weather conditions on ET and groundwater recharge during the growing season were evaluated using the calibrated numerical model for different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration rates during dry years depended very much on upward capillary flow from the water table and hence on the soil hydraulic properties. During wet years, however, ET was controlled mostly by the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, and much less by the soil hydraulic properties.

AB Drainage of peat soils for agriculture can lead to large carbon losses due to oxidation of peat. We estimated peat subsidence rates and total carbon losses, due to 40 years of dairy farming on a former peat bog, by measuring the thickness of peat and total carbon of farmland and of an adjacent unmodified peat bog above a marker tephra layer that was deposited about 200 AD. Subsidence rates averaged 3.4 cm yr(-1) (95% confidence interval of 3.2 to 3.5 cm yr(-1)) and carbon loss averaged 3.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (95% confidence interval of 2.5 to 5.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). On average, 63% of the subsidence was due to consolidation, with the remainder (37%) attributed to losses of organic matter due to peat mineralization.

AB Ditches are common in landscapes influenced by agricultural, forestry, and peat mining activities, and their value as corridors remains unassessed. Pond-breeding amphibians can encounter hostile environments when moving between breeding, summering, or hibernation sites, and are likely to benefit from the presence of ditches in the landscape. Within a system consisting of ditch networks in bogs mined for peat in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, I quantified the breeding, survival, and movements of green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota) in drainage ditches and also surveyed peat fields. Frogs rarely ventured on peat fields and most individuals frequented drainage ditches containing water, particularly in late summer. Though frogs did not breed in ditches, their survival rate in ditches was high (88%). Ditches did not hinder frog movements, as frogs moved independently of the current. Results indicate that drainage ditches containing water enable some movements between habitats isolated by peat mining, in contrast to peat surfaces, and suggest they function as amphibian movement corridors. Thus, such drainage ditches may mitigate the effects of peat extraction on amphibian populations. At the very least, these structures provide an alternative to hostile peat surfaces. This study highlights that small-scale corridors are potentially valuable in population dynamics.

AB Sphagnum mosses are often reintroduced for peatland restoration or needed for the initiation of cultivation basins for Sphagnum farming. Finding Sphagnum dominated peatland where plant collection is permitted can be challenging and hampers peatland restoration in some regions. Theoretically, starting from small initial collections in natural areas, Sphagnum could be multiplied at Sphagnum cultivation sites and then be used as donor plant material for restoration. However, it is uncertain whether cultivated Sphagnum possesses the same regeneration capacity as moss fragments originating from natural peatlands. In this study we compared the establishment of Sphagnum mosses and peatland plant diversity on experimental plots that were revegetated with cultivated Sphagnum and Sphagnum originating from natural peatland. We found that reintroducing cultivated Sphagnum carpets of thickness >5 cm and carpets collected from natural peatlands resulted in the same Sphagnum establishment. The cover of vascular plants and the diversity of peatland plants were similar in plots restored using cultivated Sphagnum and plots that were revegetated with plant material collected from natural peatland. If the cultivated plant material is to be used for restoration purposes, the donor site for initiating the Sphagnum cultivation site should contain a high peatland plant diversity.

AB With the increase in the drainage and extraction of peat for horticultural, agricultural and energy purposes worldwide, there is an increased pressure to restore hydrological conditions essential to the re-establishment of Sphagnum mosses and, therefore, carbon sequestration. Measurements of ecosystem CO2 were conducted Lit a recently restored vacuum harvested bog in Eastern Quebec, Canada. The peatland was restored by blocking the drainage networks to return optimal water table positions for the growth of Sphagnum mosses and the spreading of a dense straw mulch layer to reduce evaporative losses and stabilize the surface for the moss re-growth. However, the return Of the moss species is a gradual process and previous studies have suggested that initially the carbon loss from the system actually increase as the mulch decomposes. We examined old and new mulch CO2 production in lab incubations and scaled these results to the ecosystem level in order to determine if mulch decomposition is impeding the net carbon sink function of this peatland. At mean growing season temperatures fresh mulch was observed to release 151.5 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day, while older mulch released 145 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day. Furthermore, under moist conditions the CO2 release increased for all mulches. However, contrary to most assumptions, Q(10) values for all mulches decreased with increasing temperatures and were greater for older mulch than for fresh. Thus, in the short term, the application of a surface straw mulch layer can have significant effects on the carbon balance of a restored peatland. Due to the decomposition of this mulch layer over the first several seasons of restoration, the peatland became a larger source of CO2, despite the increase in production of a re-emerging vegetation layer.

AB This study shows that chemical properties of two restiad species, Empodisma minus and Sporadanthus traversii, may contribute to their success as peat-formers in a climate of the North Island of New Zealand which is not conducive to raised mire development. Unlike Sphagnum, the equivalent northern hemisphere peat-former, restiads possess lignin in their tissues. In addition, the presence of non-lignin polyphenols (including tannins and phenolic acids) in restiads may be an important factor in peat formation due to the allelopathic decay retardation. Patterns of degradation of plant biopolymers have been examined and the pathway of degradation of monocotyledons (loss of non-lignin phenolic fraction, depolymerization via modification of side chains of beta-O-4 lignin, depletion of hemicelluloses) was identified. Trends in chemical change far lignin were not necessarily paralleled by a similar change in the degree of plant structure preservation-an expression of a complex nature of degradation involving the contributions of several processes affecting different classes of biopolymers to different extents. A further finding of this study is that the degree of lignin breakdown, together with proportions of fungal hyphae and petrographic character, indicate that one of the two bogs studied, Moanatuatua, has undergone far more aerobic decay throughout its development than has its climatic and vegetational equivalent, Kopouatai. This is thought to be due to differing water tables in the two sedimentary environments. Moanatuatua developed in a flood plain distant from the sea with a migrating river system, while Kopouatai developed near the sea. A high degree of natural pest decomposition at Moanatuatua most probably precluded any further rapid decay after recent agricultural drainage. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large areas of peatlands have worldwide been drained to facilitate agriculture, which has adverse effects on the environment and the global climate. Agriculture on rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) provides a sustainable alternative to drainage-based agriculture. One form of paludiculture is the cultivation of Sphagnum moss, which can be used as a raw material for horticultural growing media. Under natural conditions, most Sphagnum mosses eligible for paludiculture typically predominate only in nutrient-poor wetland habitats. It is unknown, however, how the prevailing high nutrient levels in rewetted agricultural peatlands interfere with optimal Sphagnum production.
   We therefore studied the effect of enriched nutrient conditions remaining even after top soil removal and further caused by external supply of nutrient-rich irrigation water and (generally) high inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) to habitat biogeochemistry, biomass production and nutrient stoichiometry of introduced Sphagnum palustre and S. papillosum in a rewetted peatland, which was formerly in intensive agricultural use.
   Airborne N was responsible for the major supply of N. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were mainly supplied by irrigation water. The prevailing high nutrient levels (P and K) are a result of nutrient-rich irrigation water from the surroundings. Peat porewater (10 cm below peatmoss surface) CO2 concentrations were high, bicarbonate concentrations low, and the pH was around 4.2.
   Provided that moisture supply is sufficient and dominance of fast-growing, larger graminoids suppressed (in order to avoid outshading of Sphagnum mosses), strikingly very high biomass yields of 6.7 and 6.5 t DW ha(-1) yr(-1) (S, palustre and S. papillosum [including S. fallax biomass], respectively) were obtained despite high N supply and biomass N concentrations. Despite high P and K supply and uptake, N:P and N:K ratios in the Sphagnum capitula were still low. Sphagnum mosses achieved high nutrient sequestration rates of 34 kg N, 17 kg K and 4 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) from May 2013 to May 2014, which shows that the site acted as an active nutrient sink. Nutrient management still needs further improvement to reduce the competitive advantage of fast growing peatmoss species (cf. S. fallax) at the expense of slower growing but preferred peatmosses as horticultural substrate (S. palustre and S. papillosum) to optimize the quality of biomass yields.
   In conclusion, Sphagnum farming is well able to thrive under high N input provided that there is a simultaneous high input of P and K from irrigation water, which facilitates high production rates. Due to the lack of suitable, nutrient poor sites, it seems to be useful to remove the topsoil (mainly P removal) prior to start growing Sphagnum mosses. In addition, bicarbonate concentrations have to stay sufficientlylow to ensure a low pH, CO2 supply from the peat soil should be sufficiently high to prevent C limitation, and graminoids should be mown regularly.

AB A lysimeter method was evaluated for its suitability in gas emission studies by studying the effect of temperature on CO2 emissions (dark respiration) from cultivated peat soils. The study was carried out with organic soils from two locations in Sweden, a typical cultivated fen peat with low pH and high organic matter content (Orke) and a more uncommon fen peat with high pH and low organic matter content (Majnegarden). A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil lysimeters per site. CO2 emission was measured weekly from the vegetated lysimeters and the results were Compared with data from incubation experiments. The CO2 emissions measured in the lysimeter experiment were in the same range as those in other studies and showed a similar increase with temperature as in the incubation experiment. With climatic and drainage conditions being similar in the lysimeter experiment, differences in daytime CO2 emission rates between soils (483 mg +/- 6.9 CO2 m(-2) h(-1) from the Orke soil and 360 +/- 7.5 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) from the MainegArden soil) were presumably due to soil quality differences. Q(10) values of 2.1 and 3.0 were determined in the lysimeter experiment and of 1.9 to 4.5 in the incubation experiment for Orke and Majnegarden respectively. CO2 emission data fitted well to a semi-empirical equation relating CO2 emissions to air temperature. The lysimeter method proved to be well suited for CO2 emission studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands represent the largest natural terrestrial carbon (C) store, however, this C can become destabilized, particularly in response to anthropogenic disturbance or lowering of the water table. Several different paradigms have been proposed to explain the positive or negative relationships of moisture status with C loss rates in peat soils (e.g. 'enzyme latch', 'iron gate'). The relative importance of these regulatory mechanisms and whether they are mutually exclusive, however, remain unknown. To address this, we evaluated the effects of contrasting soil moisture regime and iron concentration on organic matter mineralization in an agriculturally managed lowland fen peat. Our results showed that for the first 50 days of incubation, phenol oxidative activity under saturated conditions (120% water holding capacity; WHC) was lower than that at 65% WHC, but after this period the pattern was reversed. These results suggest that two different mechanisms may control phenol oxidative activity simultaneously, with the dominant controlling factor and final response being dependent on the trade-offs between oxygen and Fe(II) effects. Although Fe(II) addition increased phenol oxidative activity, it suppressed SOC mineralization regardless of the soil moisture content, suggesting that iron can protect soil C from microbial decomposition in lowland peat soils. Our study has implications for understanding the widely divergent bio-geochemical functions of soil moisture on peat soils and emphasizes the influence of oxygen and Fe(II) on phenol oxidative activity and SOC mineralization.

AB Upland ecosystems are recognized for their importance in providing valuable ecosystem services including water storage, water supply and flood attenuation alongside carbon storage and biodiversity. The UK contains 10-15% of the global resource of upland blanket peatlands, the hydrology and ecology of which are highly sensitive to external anthropogenic and climatic forcing. In particular, drainage of these landscapes for agricultural intensification and peat extraction has resulted in often unquantified damage to the peatland hydrology, and little is understood about the spatially distributed impacts of these practices on near-surface wetness. This paper develops new techniques to extract spatial data describing the near-surface wetness and hydrological behaviour of drained blanket peatlands using airborne thermal imaging data and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The relative thermal emissivity (?(r)) of the ground surface is mapped and used as a proxy for near-surface wetness. The results show how moorland drainage and land surface structure have an impact on airborne measurements of thermal emissivity. Specifically, we show that information on land surface structure derived from LiDAR can help normalize signals in thermal emissivity data to improve description of hydrological condition across a test catchment in Exmoor, UK. An in situ field hydrological survey was used to validate these findings. We discuss how such data could be used to describe the spatially distributed nature of near-surface water resources, to optimize catchment management schemes and to deliver improved understanding of the drivers of hydrological change in analogous ecosystems.

AB There is a fortune of the peat resources in Turkey, particularly around Lake Sapanca in Sakarya. There has been increasingly attention to peatlands in technological uses and agricultural applications. The Arifiye peat is a new resource. It needs to be elucidated by characterization of its chemical and physical properties. The objective of this study was to characterize a number of samples collected from fifteen different profiles of the peat (sapric) by measuring cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, humic acid, fulvic acid, organic matter, organic carbon. In addition, the spectroscopic analysis suggested that the functional groups and molecular structure of the Arifiye peat resemble those of peatlands described previously in the literature.

AB Pristine peatlands have generally low nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions but drainage and management practices enhance the microbial processes and associated N2O emissions. It is assumed that leaving peat soils from intensive management, such as agriculture, will decrease their N2O emissions. In this paper we report how the annual N2O emission rates will change when agricultural peat soil is either left abandoned or afforested and also N2O emissions from afforested peat extraction sites. In addition, we evaluated a biogeochemical model (DNDC) with a view to explaining GHG emissions from peat soils under different land uses. The abandoned agricultural peat soils had lower mean annual N2O emissions (5.5 +/- A 5.4 kg N ha(-1)) than the peat soils in active agricultural use in Finland. Surprisingly, N2O emissions from afforested organic agricultural soils (12.8 +/- A 9.4 kg N ha(-1)) were similar to those from organic agricultural soils in active use. These emissions were much higher than those from the forests on nutrient rich peat soils. Abandoned and afforested peat extraction sites emitted more N2O, (2.4 +/- A 2.1 kg N ha(-1)), than the areas under active peat extraction (0.7 +/- A 0.5 kg N ha(-1)). Emissions outside the growing season contributed significantly, 40% on an average, to the annual emissions. The DNDC model overestimated N2O emission rates during the growing season and indicated no emissions during winter. The differences in the N2O emission rates were not associated with the age of the land use change, vegetation characteristics, peat depth or peat bulk density. The highest N2O emissions occurred when the soil C:N ratio was below 20 with a significant variability within the measured C:N range (13-27). Low soil pH, high nitrate availability and water table depth (50-70 cm) were also associated with high N2O emissions. Mineral soil has been added to most of the soils studied here to improve the fertility and this may have an impact on the N2O emissions. We infer from the multi-site dataset presented in this paper that afforestation is not necessarily an efficient way to reduce N2O emissions from drained boreal organic fields.

AB Mapping the spatial and temporal changes of peatland in farming systems is crucial to the study of soil quality and productivity and the modeling of the global carbon cycle (in relation to climate change). This study compiles a contemporary map (2010) of peatland coverage (according to Kyoto protocol) across the cultivated wetlands of Denmark and compares this actual map to a historical 1975 peat coverage map using simple indicator kriging. For the contemporary peatland mapping, extensive soil sampling databases consisting of 42,568 points with 32,817 historical samples and 9,751 contemporary samples were used. These databases contain partly categorical information on parent material (organic [peat, gytje] and mineral [sand, silt and clay]) and partly continuous data (soil organic carbon, in %) reclassified into organic and mineral soils (using 12% soil organic carbon as a cutoff value). In the simple indicator kriging procedure, the values 0 and 1 were assigned to the stationary means of the indicator codes to represent two hypotheses, that is, mineral and organic (peat) soils, respectively. The collected and analyzed contemporary unbiased organic samples (measured on different rectangular grid scales of 250, 275, and 500 m) in addition to some transformed historical organic samples (according to certain decision rules) were used to estimate the recent areal coverage of peat (2010) that was equivalent to 70,176 ha, and this estimate corresponds to an indicator kriging probability of 0.35. Results revealed there has been a total areal coverage loss of 35% (37,786 ha) of the Danish organic cultivated wetlands during a period of 35 years (map 1975 had 107,962-ha coverage of peat). The peat depletion is related to peat mining and agricultural drainage/tillage activities, rather than natural geological processes.

AB New raw materials for transportation fuels need to be introduced, in order to fight against climate change and also to cope with increasing risks of availability and price of oil. Peat has been recognised suitable raw material option for diesel produced by gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The energy content of Finnish peat reserves is remarkable. In this study, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel production and utilisation in Finland was assessed from the life-cycle point of view. In 100 year's time horizon the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel is likely larger than the impact of fossil diesel. The impact can somewhat be lowered by producing peat from the agricultural peatland (strong greenhouse gas emissions from the decaying peatlayer are avoided) with new peat production technique, and utilising the produced biomass from the after-treatment area for diesel also. if diesel production is integrated with pulp and paper mill to achieve energy efficiency benefits and if the electricity demand can be covered by zero emission electricity, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel reduces to the level of fossil diesel when agricultural peatland is used, and is somewhat higher when forestry-drained peatland is used as raw material source.

AB This study examined physiochemical conditions and prokaryotic community structure (the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and mcrA gene abundances and proportions), and evaluated the effect of reed canary grass cultivation and mineral fertilisation on these factors, in the 60 cm thick residual peat layer of experimental plots located on an abandoned peat extraction area. The archaeal proportion was 0.67-39.56% in the prokaryotic community and the methanogens proportion was 0.01-1.77% in the archaeal community. When bacterial abundance was higher in the top 20 cm of peat, the archaea were more abundant in the 20-60 cm layer and methanogens in the 40-60 cm layer of the residual peat. The bacterial abundance was significantly increased, but archaeal abundance was not affected by cultivation. The fertiliser application had a slight effect on peat properties and on archaeal and methanogen abundances in the deeper layer of cultivated peat. The CH4 emission was positively related to mcrA abundance in the 20-60 cm of the bare peat, while in case of reed canary grass cultivation these two parameters were not correlated. Reed canary grass cultivation mitigated CH4 emission, although methanogen abundance remained approximately the same or even increased in different layers of residual peat under cultivated sites over time. This study supports the outlook of using abandoned peat extraction areas to produce reed canary grass for energy purposes as an advisable landuse practice from the perspective of atmospheric impact in peatland-rich Northern Europe.

AB The area of wet grasslands on peat soil in the Netherlands is slowly increasing at the expense of drained, agriculturally used grasslands. This study aimed (i) to assess the contribution of wet grasslands on peat soil to methane (CH(4)) emissions, and (ii) to explain differences among sites and between years in order to improve our understanding of controlling factors. For these purposes, a field study was conducted in the period 1994-1996 in the nature preserve "Nieuwkoopse Plassen", which is a former peat mining and agricultural area. Net CH(4) emissions were measured weekly to monthly with vented closed flux chambers at three representative sites, and at ditches near these sites. Three-years average of CH(4) emissions was 7.9 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) for Drie Berken Zudde, 13.3 for Koole, and 20.4 for Brampjesgat. Ditches near the sites emitted 4.2-22.5 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1). The time-course of CH(4) emissions for all experimental sites and years was fit with a multiple linear regression model with ground water level and soil temperature as independent variables. Lowering or raising the ground water level by 5 cm could decrease or increase CH(4) emissions by 30-50%. Therefore, ground water level management of these grasslands should be done with care.

AB Coastal plains are amongst the most densely populated areas in the world. Many coastal peatlands are drained to create arable land. This is not without consequences; physical compaction of peat and its degradation by oxidation lead to subsidence, and oxidation also leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study complements existing studies by quantifying total land subsidence and associated CO2 respiration over the past millennium in the Dutch coastal peatlands, to gain insight into the consequences of cultivating coastal peatlands over longer timescales. Results show that the peat volume loss was 19.8 km(3), which lowered the Dutch coastal plain by 1.9 m on average, bringing most of it below sea level. At least 66 % of the volume reduction is the result of drainage, and 34 % was caused by the excavation and subsequent combustion of peat. The associated CO2 respiration is equivalent to a global atmospheric CO2 concentration increase of similar to 0.39 ppmv. Cultivation of coastal peatlands can turn a carbon sink into a carbon source. If the path taken by the Dutch would be followed worldwide, there will be double trouble: globally significant carbon emissions and increased flood risk in a globally important human habitat. The effects would be larger than the historic ones because most of the cumulative Dutch subsidence and peat loss was accomplished with much less efficient techniques than those available now.

AB 1. Peat formation is a key carbon sequestration process in the terrestrial biosphere. In temperate fens, peat is mainly formed by below-ground biomass of vascular plants. Nutrient availability in temperate fens is naturally variable, and nowadays increasing due to atmospheric deposition, runoff from agriculture and mineralization of peat caused by drainage. To maintain or restore peat formation, it is important to understand how increased nutrient availability influences the main controls of peat formation, that is, below-ground biomass production and decomposition.
   2. We investigated above- and below-ground biomass production and decomposition of five fen sedges (Carex spp.) grown under 12 different nutrient levels (realized with nitrogen amounts increasing exponentially across levels, with addition of phosphorous and potassium to ensure nitrogen limitation in each nutrient level) in a mesocosm experiment, designed to resemble a gradient of very low to very high nutrient availabilities in temperate fens. In addition, we measured nutrient stoichiometry in the biomass and related this to possible growth limitations and to root decomposition.
   3. Our results indicate that higher biomass production at higher nutrient levels was not offset by an increase in decomposition. Increase of above- and below-ground biomass with higher nutrient levels was species-specific. Decomposition of standardized plant material in mesocosms was not dependent on the species growing in the mesocosms and showed only slight, if any, variation with differing nutrient levels. Decomposition of roots grown under different nutrient levels was mainly correlated with species identity and root lignin:cellulose ratio.
   4. Our study suggests that the Carex spp. potentially peat-forming root biomass, here defined as the root biomass which is not decomposed during one growing season, increases with increasing nutrient levels: higher root biomass production is not counteracted by increasing decomposition during the growing season. Based on this pattern of positive mass balance in five common sedge species with differing growth characteristics, we propose that sedge communities establishing after rewetting have the potential for renewed peat formation regardless of the prevailing trophic level.

AB Drained peatlands contribute to anthropic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), so a better understanding of the underlying processes and identification of mitigation options for agricultural peatlands are urgently required. Peatland soil properties vary greatly and, in combination with drainage, can affect emissions of CO2 both directly and indirectly. Drainage reduces soil water content but increases CO2 production, so it is important to find the optimum drainage level that minimises CO2 emissions without affecting agricultural use. Intact soil cores from nine different sites (topsoil, plus subsoil at four sites) were collected and brought into a controlled laboratory environment. Repeated measurements of CO2 fluxes were performed at increasing soil water suctions corresponding to different drainage levels. Physical and chemical properties of the soils were determined and compared with the CO2 emissions. The soil cores displayed different CO2 emission patterns with increasing soil water suction head. In some cores, emissions increased rapidly to a high level, while in others they remained at lower levels. At a soil water suction head of only 0.5 m of water, the average soil CO2 emissions had already reached a maximum. The soil cores represented peat soils with a wide range of soil properties, e.g. bulk density from 0.17 to 0.47 g cm(-3) and total carbon from 26.3 to 43.5 %, but none of the properties measured was clearly correlated with CO2 emissions.

AB Studies were carried out to identify a method of constructing a peatland evaluation map based on forecasting data of land subsidence of arable peatland in northern Japan. Land subsidence in a district here has become a serious problem due to the increase in the area of upland fields converted from paddy fields. First, we estimated the present rate of land subsidence based on the measurement of land elevation and soil survey, and determined the degree of decomposition of peat in marshlands, windbreak forests and arable lands in the Ishikari peatland in northern Japan. Second, we evaluated the sustainability of arable peatland based on data of actual land subsidence and other parameters, and we compiled an evaluation map of Ishikari peatland using geographical information systems (GIS). Soil type, period of land development, present land use and thickness of top-dressed soil were selected as main factors for the evaluation, and scores of elements of each factor were determined. According to the total scores, sustainability of arable peatland was divided into 3 classes. A land evaluation map of Ishikari peatland in terms of land subsidence was compiled using these classes.

AB Goal-To establish regularity of transformation of drained peat bog soils, also changes in the water duty to floodplains in the process of agricultural use. Determine the ways of their rational use in the conditions of the Left-Bank Forest-Steppe.
   Research methods. General scientific and special, empirical and theoretical, historical - for a retrospective synthesis of scientific achievements of domestic and foreign scientists on the study of the formation of indicators of fertility and productivity of drained soils; analytical - for analysis of conditions and processes of changing fertility indicators; laboratory - for determination of agrochemical and water-physical properties of soil; field - to establish the botanical composition of the grass stand, accumulation of the amount of root and crop residues in the soil, to establish the intensity of mineralization of organic matter and crop productivity; mathematical statistics - to assess the reliability of the research results.
   Many years of experience summarized and scientific estimates of the transformation of drained peat bog soils with long-term agricultural use are presented. It has been established that over 80 years of use of these soils in agricultural production, peat deposits wear amounted to 100 cm (in the early years, an annual decrease in peat depth was 1, 63, subsequent - 1, 45, and the last - 0, 88 cm). Decrease the depth of the peat bed also occurs due to their compaction.
   Qualitative and quantitative changes in peat soils under the influence of drainage and long-term agricultural use we researched. We have established the patterns and directions of soil processes depending on the influence of the duration of development of peat soils. We also identified scientific and methodological approaches to assessing the conditions and factors affecting the formation of fertility and productivity of drained soils. We have analyzed existing approaches to rationalizing nature management, taking into account the characteristics of the economic development of drained lands.
   Regularities and directions of transformation of drained peat bog soils under the influence of long-term agricultural use are justified. We have identified trends in the indicators of fertility and productivity of drained peat bog soils. We have implemented a systematic approach to the spatiotemporal study of the soil potential of drained soils in order to rationalize nature management in the risky farming zone. We also found that the high-productivity use of organogenic soils provides for the functioning of agrophytocenoses from perennial crops with the aim of creating conservation agrolandscapes and improving the ecological balance in the floodplains of small rivers.

AB It is commonly assumed that agricultural peatlands are net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere because of lowered water tables and intensive land management altering the balance of plant productivity and respiration. Yet actual farm-scale fluxes of CO2 have been infrequently quantified. We measured net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) using a permanent and a mobile eddy covariance tower installed over dairy farms with year-round rotational grazing on deep peats in New Zealand. The permanent tower was in place for one year and the mobile tower was deployed for periods of 3-4 weeks at three other farms on peat between spring and autumn. At all sites, grazing cycles caused large variations in pasture biomass and consequent daytime NEE and we accounted for these variations using an index of photosynthesising biomass (phytomass index, Lohila et al., 2004) automatically derived from daily CO2 flux measurements. We estimated annual CO2 loss of 190 gC m(-2)yr(-1) for the permanent site, which is in broad agreement with other agricultural peatland studies. Including other farm-scale exports of C, overall net ecosystem carbon loss estimated for the permanent site was 294 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Accounting for changes in phytomass index, daytime NEE was similar for permanent-mobile site farm pairings, except when there were very large differences in water table depths between farms in autumn. In contrast, night-time respiration losses were almost identical between farms even when water tables were markedly different, suggesting that spatial differences in NEE in these agricultural peatlands are caused by reduced photosynthesis in dry periods, due to plant water stress, rather than increased respiration. Comparisons between permanent and mobile towers appeared a useful approach for determining spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from peat soils. Taken together, our results suggested that the CO2 losses measured at the permanent site were representative of CO2 losses for farmed peats in the Waikato region when the water table was within similar to 0.5 m of the surface. Where water tables were deeper net CO2 losses would be expected to be greater due to reduced pasture photosynthesis and production. Maintaining higher water tables might achieve dual benefits of increasing pasture productivity and reducing CO2 losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elevated suspended sediment (SS) loads released from peatlands after drainage operations and the resulting negative effect on the ecological status of the receiving water bodies have been widely recognized. Understanding the processes controlling erosion and sediment transport within the ditch network forms a prerequisite for adequate sediment control. While numerous experimental studies have been reported in this field, model based assessments are rare. This study presents a modeling approach to investigate sediment transport in a peatland ditch network. The transport model describes bed erosion, rain-induced bank erosion, floc deposition, and consolidation of the bed. Coupled to a distributed hydrological model, sediment transport was simulated in a 5.2 ha forestry-drained peatland catchment for 2 years after ditch cleaning. Comparing simulation results to measured SS concentrations suggested that the loose peat material, produced during excavation, contributed markedly to elevated SS concentrations immediately after ditch cleaning. Both snowmelt and summer rainstorms contributed critically to annual loads. Springtime peat erosion during snowmelt was driven by ditch flow whereas during summer rainfalls, bank erosion by raindrop impact was identified as an important process. Relating modeling results to observed spatial topographic changes in the ditch network was challenging and the results were difficult to verify. Nevertheless, the model has potential to identify risk areas for erosion. The results demonstrate that modeling is effective in separating the importance of different processes and complements pure experimental approaches. Modeling results can aid planning and designing efficient sediment control measures and guide the focus of experimental studies.

AB Since disservices and the finite nature of agriculture on drained peatlands are increasingly recognised, land use options for wet or rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) are recommended as sustainable alternatives. Their economic viability at the farm level, however, is largely unknown. This paper addresses managing reed-dominated (Phragmites australis) vegetation stands with special-purpose tracked machinery in central Europe. Three options of biomass harvest for energetic and material use were investigated. Contribution margin accounting estimated the income left after subtracting variable costs and fixed machinery costs. Stochastic scenario analysis (Monte Carlo method) revealed a wide range of possible outcomes from ca. epsilon -1000 to epsilon 1500 ha(-1) yr(-1). Harvesting summer reed for biogas production is the least profitable option, winter mowing for direct combustion can be cost-efficient, and reed for thatchingis clearly the most profitable. Cumulative probability distributions identified risks of 98%, 18%, and <1% respectively, that revenues for biomass cannot cover harvesting costs. The feasibility and competitiveness of the three harvesting regimes are principally influenced by the availability of mature technology, legal restrictions, the entitlement to agricultural subsidies, a remuneration of external benefits, and the opportunity costs of present farming activities. Therefore, laws and policies determine whether a balanced provision of ecosystem services is hindered or promoted in peatlands used for agriculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were determined by a static chamber technique at eight drained swamp peatland sites, with crop and forest covers. Over a 6-month period (May - October, 1991), CH4 fluxes ranged from -5 to 7 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and were not correlated with either soil temperature or water table position. Integrated seasonal emissions were -0.40 to 0.04 g CH4 m2 over 147 days; the sites with a forest or grass cover were a small sink of CH4 whereas the sites with horticultural crops showed no significant flux. Laboratory incubations showed that the highest CH4 consumption rates (3 to 9 mug CH4 g-1 d-1) occurred in the least disturbed soils. The results, when compared with CH4 fluxes from nearby swamps which have been unaffected by drainage, suggest that drainage of temperate peatlands has reduced emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere by 0. 6 - 1 x 10(12) g CH4 yr-1. CO2 fluxes ranged f rom 0 to 16 g CO2 m-2 d-1 and were correlated with the seasonal pattern of temperature in the upper part of the soil profile. Integrated seasonal fluxes for the sites in which root respiration was an unimportant contribution were 0.6 - 0.8 kg CO2 m-2 over 181 days. Aerobic laboratory incubations revealed CO2 production rates of 0.2 - 1.4 mg CO2 g-1 d-1, an average of 5 times the rate under anaerobic conditions. Using bulk density and loss-on-ignition data, we found that the seasonal CO2 fluxes translate into surface lowering of the peat of about 2 mm yr-1, whereas the commonly observed lowering in these cultivated peatlands is 20 mm yr-1. These data suggest that processes other than direct oxidation, such as shrinkage and aeolian erosion, are the major contributor to the surface lowering of the peat.

AB Past land use change has converted vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, there is a need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and monitored stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i.e. net effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Our results show that over the first five to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests.

AB Hokkaido Island is located in the cool temperate zone, and its climate conditions facilitated the formation of a variety of wetland types, the majority of them peat-forming mires. Most of these remained in a natural state until the early 20th century. However, drainage and subsequent conversion mostly to agricultural land have since destroyed more than 70% of the original wetland ecosystems. This paper (1) provides an overview of mire types, (2) reviews the development process of mires in Hokkaido during the Holocene, (3) analyzes the causes of losses of wetland areas, and (4) gives a summary of the current conservation and management status. Basic mire types that have been described in other parts of the northern hemisphere can also be recognized in Hokkaido, although there are floristic differences, and the frequency and intensity of volcanic impact and tsunamis is higher than in most other regions with abundant mire formation. Mire formation started at various points during the postglacial period; a few mountain mires in southwest Hokkaido date back to the Lateglacial, but most mountain mires formed during the mid to late Holocene. Most lowland mires developed at altitudes below 20 m and were influenced by the Jomon transgression that peaked ca. 6,000 years BP. The largest owland mires started forming after the sea retreated, and many are not older than ca. 3,000 years. In 1996, the total number of wetlands (including peat-forming mires, freshwater marshes, and saltmarshes) greater than 1 ha was 150, with a total area of 59,881 ha. In 1928, when many wetlands were yet undeveloped, their total area was 200,642 ha. Most losses occurred between the 1950s and 1970s, when post-war development economics promoted agriculture and large-scale reclamation projects. Currently, 90.7% of mountain wetlands are public land, while 81.3% of the lowland wetlands are private or in mixed ownership. The ownership condition affects the possibilities for the protection of complete mire complexes especially in the lowlands. For effective conservation of wetland ecosystems it is necessary to include the catchment area in the planning of protected areas.

AB Peatlands worldwide are being threatened by intensive land use and drainage, which leads to soil subsidence. This has consequences for farming, especially on low-gradient cultivated peat-dominated lowlands with high flood risk. In this study, we combined historical soil elevation data and new lidar data to improve the estimation of subsidence and its consequences for lowland river systems. The results showed 202-349 mm subsidence within the last 24 & ndash;51 years, with a mean rate of 5.15 & ndash;9.47 mm y-1 for riparian peatland on the west coast of Finland. The subsidence rate was partly explained by the depth of the organic soil layer (R2 = 0.710, p > 0.05). The results also showed that increasing flooding of cultivated fields is mainly due to soil subsidence, not to increased flooding occurrence in river systems. The area flooded annually was found to increase by 101 & ndash;194 % for the last 24 & ndash;51 years, due to soil subsidence near rivers. Generalization of the results to catchment scale indicated an increase in the annual flood zone of 45 % in cultivated fields in one of two study catchments (Siikajoki river basin). These results demonstrate the value of using historical data to study soil subsidence and confirm that the risk of flooding increases in cultivated organic lowlands due to intensive drainage and subsidence. New management strategies, such as peatland rewetting, restoration, and paludiculture, should be considered in future land use plans to reduce subsidence and provide new income streams for farmers.

AB Canadian peatlands are subject to disturbance and destruction, and drainage for agriculture is responsible for 85% of this degradation Few studies have explicitly addressed the effects of habitat degradation on arthropod diversity in Nearctic peatlands Because higher Diptera (Brachycera) in peatlands are diverse, are an important component of food webs, and exhibit a wide range of ecological requirements, we examined species richness, abundance, and community composition of Brachycera across transects at 1, 6, and 11 m from a collector drainage ditch in Johnville Bog and Forest Park, Quebec In total, 1453 Brachycera were collected, representing 24 families and 166 species Species diversity (based on Simpson's diversity index) and rarefaction-estimated species richness were higher at 6 and 11 m than at 1 m from the ditch, probably because of the homogeneous moss cover and moister conditions at greater distance from the ditch. Species composition also differed between 1 m and other distances, based on cluster analysis, multiresponse permutation procedures analysis, and the presence of five predaceous species that were significant indicator species 1 m from the drainage ditch. Our results suggest that anthropogenic degradation of hydrological conditions may be responsible for the low species richness and high dominance of a few species currently seen at the ditch margin

AB Peatlands provide a setting that is well suited for cranberry agriculture in the Northeastern United States. However, misconceptions exist about the amounts and forms of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) export from cranberry farms. In this study, we report inorganic and organic forms of N and P export from five peatlands cultivated for cranberry production in southeastern, Massachusetts, United States. We then compare N loading rates among cranberry farms in southeastern Massachusetts, row crop farms in the Midwestern United States, and uncultivated peatlands in the United States and United Kingdom. Based on a fluvial mass balance analysis, we find that nonriparian cranberry farms export 2.56 kg of P ha(-1) year(-1)of total P and 12.1 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1)of total N. Total N export from riparian or "flow through" farms is two times higher than nonriparian farms due to less retention of N fertilizer in the vadose zone of riparian farms. Gross total N export from riparian and nonriparian cranberry farms consists of 35% particulate organic N, 26% dissolved organic N, 31% ammonium (NH4+), and 8% nitrate (NO3-). The low proportions of NO3- export (13% of total dissolved N [TDN]) for cranberry farms differ from NO3- export for row crop farms (75% of TDN; p < .001) but not for uncultivated peatlands (17% of TDN; p = .61). Despite being highly modified by fertilizers and artificial drainage, low NO3- export (2.2 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1)) from cranberry farms is consistent with field measurements of rapid N turnover in uncultivated peatlands. This finding suggests that state-funded wetland restoration efforts to restore denitrification in retired cranberry farms may be limited by NO3- rather than soil moisture or organic matter.

AB In Northern, Eastern and Central European countries, peat soils drained for agriculture are a considerable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Since emissions from this source have high mitigation potential, they will likely be a focus of the European Union's future climate goals.
   We describe and compare the similarities and differences in the socioeconomic and ecological business environment that policy makers, planners and farmers are confronted with when developing tailored proposals for low emission land use alternatives on peat land. The analysis is based on interviews with 33 typical farmers cultivating organic soils and on expert group discussions held in six different Northern, Eastern and Central European regions.
   Based on the Social-Ecological System Framework we identify and cluster important variables. Our results show that mainly hard economic variables determine preferred land use alternatives: the productivity of resource systems, the economic value of land and market incentives. Other variables, such as the heterogeneity of users and conflicts among them, are more important with respect to the implementation of alternatives. We point out possibilities to transfer solutions between regions and discuss an institutional framework for European Union, national and regional levels for facilitating implementation potential.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils stimulates soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization, which substantially increases CO(2) emissions from soils. Large uncertainties are associated with this CO(2) flux, and little data are available, especially in Norway. The objective of the present research was to estimate C losses from cultivated peatlands in West Norway by three independent methods: (1) long-term monitoring of subsidence rates, (2) changes in ash contents, and (3) soil CO(2) flux measurements. Subsidence of cultivated peat soils averaged about 2.5 cm year(-1). We estimated that peat loss and compaction were respectively responsible for 38% and 62% of the total subsidence during a 25-year period after drainage. Based on this estimate the corresponding C loss equals 0.80 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The observed increase in mineral concentration of the topsoil of cultivated peat is proportional to their C loss, providing no mineral particles other than lime and fertilizers are added to the soil. Using this novel approach across 11 sites, we estimated a mean C loss of 0.86 kg C m(-2) year(-1). Soil CO(2) flux measurements, corrected for autotrophic respiration, yielded a C loss estimate from cultivated peat soils of 0.60 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The three methods yielded fairly similar estimates of C losses from Norwegian cultivated peatlands. Cultivated peatlands in Norway cover an estimated 63,000 ha. Total annual C losses from peat degradation were estimated to range between 1.8 and 2 million tons CO(2) year(-1), which equals about 3-4% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from Norway.

AB Northeast China contains a large concentration of wetlands, primarily in two prominent types, freshwater marshes on the lowlands plains to the northeast and mountain permafrost peatlands in the north. Both wetlands types are threatened by disturbance, the marshes from agricultural conversion and the peatlands due to climate warming and loss of permafrost. Here we compare two seasons of ecosystem-scale CH4 fluxes measured via eddy covariance for a permafrost peatland in the Da Xing'anling Mountains and a freshwater marsh on the Sanjiang Plain. The objectives were to quantify CH4 fluxes, compare seasonal trends in the flux and determine the dominant environmental and biophysical drivers of the CH4 flux for these two distinct wetland types.
   CH4 fluxes at the marsh had a strong seasonal trend peaking in mid-summer, while the pattern for the peatland was muted. Maximum instantaneous fluxes were 1.34 mu g CH4 m(-2) s(-3). and 9.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) s(-3) at the peatland and marsh, respectively. Total seasonal CH4 emissions for the peatland, 0.38.4.27 g C-CH4 m(-2), were an order of magnitude smaller than those at the marsh, 19.71-21.8 g C-CH4 m(-2). Differences between years were small for both wetlands. We used path analysis to examine environmental and biophysical drivers of the flux and found that soil temperature (average soil temperature between 10 cm to 60 cm depths for the peatland and 10 cm depth for the marsh) was most strongly correlated with seasonal CH4 variability for both wetlands. Secondary influences were thaw depth for the peatland and net ecosystem CO2 exchange for the marsh.
   Given the temperature sensitivity of CH4 flux for both of these wetlands, future climate warming will likely increase CH4 emissions in northeast China, as well, the continued loss of permafrost in the mountain peatlands will likely further contribute to enhanced CH4 emissions.

AB In contrast to the pervasive occurrence of denitrification in soils, anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) is a spatially restricted process that depends on specific ecological conditions. To identify the factors that constrain the distribution and activity of anammox bacteria in terrestrial environments, we investigated four different soil types along a catena with opposing ecological gradients of nitrogen and water content, from an amended pasture to an ombrotrophic bog. Anammox was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) only in the nitrophilic wet meadow and the minerotrophic fen, in soil sections remaining water-saturated for most of the year and whose interstitial water contained inorganic nitrogen. Contrastingly, aerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms were present in all examined samples and outnumbered anammox bacteria usually by at least one order of magnitude. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a relatively high diversity of anammox bacteria with one Ca. Brocadia cluster. Three additional clusters could not be affiliated to known anammox genera, but have been previously detected in other soil systems. Soil incubations using N-15-labeled substrates revealed that anammox processes contributed about <2% to total N-2 formation, leaving nitrification and denitrification as the dominant N-removal mechanism in these soils that represent important buffer zones between agricultural land and ombrotrophic peat bogs.

AB Background: Many minerotrophic fens in Central Europe have undergone similar sequences of land-use transformation. Drained and used as meadows or pastures for decades in the twentieth century, they were abandoned in the 1990s due to changes in agricultural economics. This sequence of land-use change has a severe impact on vegetation and is likely to initiate secondary succession and is possibly leading to an impoverishment in species diversity and to taxonomic homogenisation.
   Aims: We assess the impact of agricultural use and subsequent abandonment on vegetation composition in a percolation fen in north Germany and characterise successional changes and changes in abiotic site conditions.
   Methods: In 2010, we resampled 77 plots of a phytosociological survey from 1967-1970 in a lowland percolation mire complex in the lower Recknitz valley, north-east Germany. These included three characteristic vegetation types of percolation fens. To investigate and quantify vegetation changes we used dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and ecological species indicator values.
   Results: Overall species richness declined only slightly while there was a more pronounced decrease in species richness at the plot level in all recorded vegetation types, resulting in increased beta diversity. Generalist and nitrophilous species increased in abundance, indicating ongoing succession.
   Conclusions: Drainage for agricultural use and subsequent abandonment has long-lasting effects. Altered hydrological and nutrient status of the fen soil has initiated secondary succession. There is indication of an extinction debt that in the future may lead to an impoverishment of species diversity in the area. Conservation of open mesotrophic fen species may thus only be achieved if moderate use is continued and hydrologic conservation measures are applied on wide contiguous areas.

AB The rate of oxidation of peat soils is highly seasonal and varies with temperature and soil moisture content. Large variations in soil moisture content result in wet-dry cycles that can enhance peat degradation. Water-table management plays a crucial role in controlling and damping the effect of these environmental factors. However, maintaining high ditch water levels in fields bounded by ditches does not guarantee a high field groundwater level. The effect of installing subsurface irrigation at different spacings on water table elevation was studied in a low-lying peat grassland. The water table elevation data were compared against values predicted with a water balance model. In addition, greenhouse experiments were carried out on undisturbed soil core samples collected from the peat grassland as well as a low-lying peatland under intensive arable faming to measure CO2 evolution under different water regimes. The field data from the peat grassland suggest that sub-irrigation spacing as low as 10 m is necessary during summer periods to maintain groundwater levels similar to those in the ditches. Over the same period of observation, the difference in water level between the ditches and the non-irrigated fields is as high as 0.7 m. Modelled outputs are in good correlation with the field observations, and demonstrate that simple water balance models can provide an effective tool to study the effect of water management practices and potential changes in subsurface conditions, climate and land use on water-table levels. The measurement of CO2 emission from undisturbed peat soil columns shows that the rate of oxidation of soil organic matter from peat soils is highly seasonal and that drainage exacerbates the rate of peat mineralization.

AB In the last century, most peatlands Were reclaimed for agricultural purposes, which led to peat degradation and to severe subsidence, and thus too wet conditions for crops. In some areas this has therefore led to wide agricultural abandonment. However, studies on the effect of agricultural abandonment as a potential restoration tool are lacking. In this study, the effectiveness and the restoration potential of agricultural abandonment in reducing peat degradation and in improving soil microbial biodiversity were evaluated. The main chemical parameters, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity and soil respiration partitioning were used to assess the long-term effect of 15 years of agricultural abandonment (Aband) in a Mediterranean reclaimed peatland. An intensive maize cultivation (Cult) in the same area was used as a comparison. Multivariate analyses showed that 15 years of agricultural abandonment: did not affect the main soil chemical parameters, except for NH4+ which was lower in the Aband than in the Cult; increased AM fungal root colonization and the diversity in terms of number of families of AM fungi retrieved in roots, but decreased soil AM fungal richness; reduced total soil respiration and its autotrophic component but increased respiration by heterotrophs; determined a lower fluctuation of soil CO2 flux response to air temperature than the Cult. Thus, although some soil quality parameters were significantly improved, 15 years of agricultural abandonment may not lead to an effective restoration. Consequently, alternative and sustainable solutions for the protection and preservation of Mediterranean peatlands need to be developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the background of five palaeogeographical maps between the Marsdiep and the Weser River, and discusses the natural and anthropogenic processes driving the coastal changes during the last part of the Holocene. Before 2500 BC, during the first half of the Holocene, tidal basins were formed in the lower lying Pleistocene valley system as a result of the Holocene sea-level rise. The tidal basins were filled during the second half of the Holocene and on the deposits from the Pleistocene in the hinterland large coastal peat bogs developed. These peat bogs were vulnerable and sensitive to marine ingressions when the peat surface subsided due to drainage, compaction and erosion. During the Subatlantic (450 BC to present), the different ingression systems in the coastal area between Marsdiep and Weser had their own histories in timing and evolution. The ingressions were naturally caused by lateral migration of coastal barrier and tidal-inlet systems or by changes in the natural drainage system in the hinterland. From the Late Iron Age onwards, humans started to be the major cause of ingressions. By reclaiming and cultivating the seaward margins of coastal peat bogs, these areas subsided significantly and were flooded by high storm surges. When coastal areas were embanked during the historical period, the situation for the lower lying peat lands became more dramatic. When the sea dikes breached, the peat land was flooded, leading to casualties and huge material damages and loss of land. Drowning of the peat lands of the Jade and Dollard in the 14th and 15th centuries are examples of such catastrophes.

TI Optimal drainage depth of five cultivated organic soils

LA English
DT Article
ID AIR
AB Optimal drainage depth with regard to crop growth of five cultivated organic soils, including moss peat, fen peat and gyttja soils, was determined in lysimeter experiments in a greenhouse with supplementary investigations in the field and in the laboratory. The variation range in physical and chemical properties of organic soils is much greater than in mineral soils and drainage recommendations have to vary accordingly. Gyttja soils in general are well aerated, due to their permanent crack system, but root growth in the subsoil can be restricted by low pH and toxic levels of soluble aluminium. Water levels should therefore be kept high (40-50 cm under the surface), during periods of high evaporative demand, to avoid shortage of water for plant growth and development of soil water repellence due to dehydration. Moss peats and compacted fen peats often suffer from aeration problems and ground water levels should be kept lower (60-70 cm). On well structured fen peats, with high hydraulic conductivity, ground water levels may be kept slightly higher. At low evaporative demand, during spring operations and at harvest time, ground water levels should be lowered to improve bearing capacity and avoid aeration problems. Low water tables will bring more air into the profile, allow more microbial activity with more nitrogen available for the plants but also induce a faster subsidence rate.

AB Fens are organic sites that require drainage for agricultural use. Lowering the groundwater level leads to trade-offs between economic benefits and environmental impacts (i.e., CO2 and nutrient emissions). To identify management options that are both environmentally and economically sustainable, a propaedeutic systematic analysis of the costs, income and profit of different land use and management systems on fenlands is necessary. This study provides an overview of the profitability, labor demand and comparative advantages of feasible management systems on German fenlands. Twenty management practices in four land use systems are analyzed. The results indicate that most management systems are profitable only with subsidies and payments for ecosystem services. In addition to sales revenue, these payments are indispensable to promote peat-saving agricultural practices on fenlands. Regarding the labor aspect, intensive management systems caused an increase in working hours per hectare, which may positively affect employment in rural areas. The calculations obtained in this study can be used as a basis for estimations of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs when management systems are associated with GHG emission values.

AB The Florida Everglades is a patterned peatland formed from sawgrass and other aquatic plant material that has accumulated over millennia. This peatland was initially drained in the late 1800s for agricultural and urban development and has been highly modified by the construction of canals and levees. Restoration plans include providing additional surface water flow which should help to prevent further peat loss by oxidation and encourage the accretion of peat that has been lost through drainage and peat fires. But how much peat has been lost? We know that about 50 % of the original surface area is gone; but what about the driver of ecological processes, the soil? Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, we compared predrainage and current peat volumes using historical and recent datasets, spatially-referenced soil bulk density values and carbon content to determine peat mass and carbon mass for each Everglades region. Given the uncertainties in the datasets, this analysis should be viewed as providing rough order-of-magnitude values. Our calculations indicate that the current Everglades contains less than 24 % of the original peat volume, 17 % of its mass and 19 % of its carbon.

AB The large boreal peatland ecosystems sequester carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere due to a low oxygen pressure in waterlogged peat. Consequently they are sinks for CO(2) and strong emitters of CH(4). Drainage and cultivation of peatlands allows oxygen to enter the soil, which initiates decomposition of the stored organic material, and in turn CO(2) and N(2)O emissions increase while CH(4) emissions decrease. Compared to undrained pear, draining of organic soils for agricultural purposes increases the emissions of greenhouse gases (CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O) by roughly it CO(2) equivalents/ha per year. Although farmed organic soils in most European countries represent a minor part of the total agricultural area, these soils contribute significantly to national greenhouse gas budgets. Consequently, farmed organic soils are potential targets for policy makers in search of socially acceptable and economically cost-efficient measures to mitigate climate gas emissions from agriculture. Despite a scarcity of knowledge about greenhouse gas emissions from these soils, this paper addresses the emissions and possible control of the three greenhouse gases by different managements of organic soils. More precise information is needed regarding the present trace gas fluxes from these soils, as well as predictions of future emissions under alternative management regimes, before any definite policies can be devised.

AB Sphagnum farming provides a sustainable wet land use alternative for drained peatland agriculture. Since 2011 Sphagnum has been cultivated on formerly drained bog grassland at Hankhauser Moor in north-west Germany. The site has been rewetted and is equipped with an automatic irrigation system which controls the inflow and outflow of water. We used measurements and models to determine the amount of irrigation water needed to keep the water table just below the Sphagnum surface throughout the year. In winter there was a water surplus, whereas in spring and summer evapotranspiration exceeded precipitation, creating a water deficit. Next to evapotranspiration, horizontal seepage was a major cause of water loss. Modelling indicated that the amount of irrigation required to make up the water deficit in the dry hydrological year 2013 (November 2012 to October 2013) amounted to 359 mm (3,588 m(3) ha(-1)). To compensate for the average water deficit over the 20year period 1993-2013, 160 mm of water would be needed annually (i.e. 1,600 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)), but the maximum water deficit accumulated during that period was much higher, at 6,363 m(3) ha(-1). In relative terms, both evapotranspiration and seepage losses will decrease with increasing size of the rewetted area because drained surroundings enhance water losses from the wetter Sphagnum farming site, both as evapotranspiration due to advection (oasis effect) and as horizontal seepage due to steepening of hydraulic gradients. For successful Sphagnum farming the water demand must be considered and an appropriate water supply must be guaranteed.

AB Agricultural peatlands are essential for a myriad of ecosystem functions and play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle through C sequestration. Management of these agricultural peatlands takes place at different spatial scales, ranging from local to landscape management, and drivers of soil microbial community structure and function may be scale-dependent. Effective management for an optimal biogeochemical functioning thus requires knowledge of the drivers on soil microbial community structure and functioning, as well as the spatial scales upon which they are influenced. During two field campaigns, we examined the importance of different drivers (i.e., soil characteristics, nutrient management, vegetation composition) at two spatial scales (local vs. landscape) for, respectively, the soil microbial community structure (determined by PLFA) and soil microbial community functional capacity (as assessed by CLPP) in agricultural peatlands. First, we show by an analysis of PLFA profiles that the total microbial biomass changes with soil moisture and relative C:P nutrient availability. Secondly, we showed that soil communities are controlled by a distinct set of drivers at the local, as opposed to landscape, scale. Community structure was found to be markedly different between areas, in contrast to community function which showed high variability within areas. We further found that microbial structure appears to be controlled more at a landscape scale by nutrient-related variables, whereas microbial functional capacity is driven locally through plant community feedbacks. Optimal management strategies within such peatlands should therefore consider the scale-dependent action of soil microbial community drivers, for example by first optimizing microbial structure at the landscape scale by targeted areal management, and then optimizing soil microbial function by local vegetation management.

AB Sphagnum biomass is a promising material that could be used as a substitute for peat in growing media and can be sustainably produced by converting existing drainage-based peatland agriculture into wet, climate-friendly agriculture (paludiculture). Our study focuses on yield maximization of Sphagnum as a crop.
   We tested the effects of three water level regimes and of phosphorus or potassium fertilization on the growth of four Sphagnum species (S. papillosum, S. palustre, S. fimbriatum, S. fallax). To simulate field conditions in Central and Western Europe we carried out a glasshouse experiment under nitrogen-saturated conditions.
   A constant high water table (remaining at 2 cm below capitulum during growth) led to highest productivity for all tested species. Water table fluctuations between 2 and 9 cm below capitulum during growth and a water level 2 cm below capitulum at the start but falling relatively during plant growth led to significantly lower productivity. Fertilization had no effect on Sphagnum growth under conditions with high atmospheric deposition such as in NW Germany (38 kg N, 0.3 kg P, 7.6 kg K center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)).
   Large-scale maximization of Sphagnum yields requires precise water management, with water tables just below the capitula and rising with Sphagnum growth. The nutrient load in large areas of Central and Western Europe from atmospheric deposition and irrigation water is high but, with an optimal water supply, does not hamper Sphagnum growth, at least not of regional provenances of Sphagnum.

AB Concomitant with farmland development in the Ishikari Peatland of northern Japan, deterioration of water chemistry has become increasingly evident at mire pools there. Using spatial analysis methods with a geographic information system and a statistical methodology, this study examined the effects of agricultural land use on the pool water chemistry. A water chemistry survey of several pools showed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended-solid concentrations were remarkably higher than those in pools that had been undisturbed or less-disturbed by land-use development. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to summarize water chemistry variables. Correlation analysis was conducted between the principal component (PC) scores and land-use variables to clarify land-use effects. Results of the PCA showed that the water chemistry variances were accounted for by the first two PCs: PC1 included farmland subsurface drainage containing nitrogen, specifically nitrate, and mineral ions; PC2 included farmland surface drainage containing soil particles and ammonium nitrogen. These PC scores were also affected by the number of inflow ditches and the total area of farmland located within the drainage catchment of inflow ditches leading to the pools. Results suggest that farmland subsurface and surface drainage water flowing into the pools degraded the water chemistry. The extent of the effects of drainage water depended on agricultural practices such as fertilizer application and paddy-field puddling (i.e., mechanical homogenization of water-saturated soil). Accordingly, water chemistry of the study pools was affected by agricultural practices and by the amount of farmland in the drainage basin, engendering eutrophication, and the deterioration of water chemistry. Therefore, preservation of water chemistry necessitates changes in agricultural practices, such as improving fertilizer application methods, along with measures related to land-use planning such as changing the drainage ditches' flow direction.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of carbon (C) within the global terrestrial biosphere. Drainage and cultivation of peat soils lead to rapid soil degradation and C losses, and this may worsen under warming as the soils are no longer protected by anaerobic conditions. To predict the rates of soil C loss and design effective mitigation strategies, it is important to understand what controls organic matter mineralization in these soils. Using the 0-10 cm soil depth of thick and thin (degraded) agricultural peat soils, we investigated the fate of low molecular weight organic substrates (LMWOS) and how the microbial biomass consuming these substrates responded to temperature. We incubated the soils under increasing temperatures (4, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C) for 72 h. Either C-14-labelled glucose or amino acids were added to the soils and their speed of breakdown, partitioning into anabolic/catabolic processes and microbial C use efficiency (CUE) were determined. The total (CO2)-C-14 loss from soil increased significantly with increasing temperature during 72-h incubation, regardless of peat layer thickness. Warming altered the dynamics of LMWOS mineralization by changing C allocation and the turnover rate of different microbial C pools. The half-life of LMWOS decreased more than 50% when temperature increased from 4 to 30 degrees C for both substrates. CUE was always higher for thin than thick peat soil and both declined by 0.002-0.005 degrees C-1 with increasing temperature. Thin peat decreased substrate C allocation into the fast cycling C pool compared to the thick peat, but had no overall effect on pool turnover rate. Our work suggests that climate warming will accelerate C mineralization and soil loss in drained peat soils, with larger effects expected in thick peat soil. This study provides an important initial step in characterizing the response of the microbial utilization of labile C to temperature change and soil degradation in cultivated peatlands.

AB This paper presents a new concept for the restoration of an agricultural landscape. The combination of water purification and peatland restoration was tested in a degraded fen area in southern Germany. For this purpose, Typha angustifolia L. and T. latifolia L. were cultivated in constructed wetlands. The wetlands were provided with drainage water from an agricultural watershed. The system presented here seems well suited to fulfil the important functional objectives for peatland restoration. First, a water regime typical of fenland was re-established and second, the Typha stands showed a high phytomass production. Consequently the function of the peatland as a sink in the nutrient cycle may be reactivated. Preliminary results for vegetation monitoring, water quality and gas flux measurements are briefly presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fertilization in agricultural peatlands accelerates nutrient cycling and creates a potential risk to nearby natural peatlands. Here, using undisturbed peatlands as reference, we studied soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and the key enzymes for nutrient cycling at 0-50 cm soil depth in agricultural, nearby disturbed peatlands in a temperate fen in Northeast China. Agricultural intervention significantly increased total P in agricultural and disturbed peatlands, and decreased soil organic carbon content and total N in surface soil of agricultural peatlands, however total N significantly accumulated at 20-30 cm soil both in agricultural and disturbed peatlands (p < 0.05). Both N-acetyl-13-glucosaminidase and phosphatase significantly declined in agricultural peatlands, while only phosphatase decreased in disturbed peatlands (p < 0.05), and linear regression models showed strong effects of changes of soil nutrient levels on enzyme activities. The ratios of 13-D-glucosidase to N-acetyl-13-glucosaminidase and phosphatase markedly increased in agricultural peatlands and showed higher ratios in deeper soil of disturbed peatlands, suggesting relatively higher microbial demand for carbon. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that variations of enzyme activity and stoichiometry can be used to reveal agricultural disturbance, and further redundancy analysis identified that total P and SOC explained 38.3% and 8.3% of the variance. Overall, our findings show that microbial enzymatic activity and stoichiometry can be effective and sensitive indicators of agricultural intervention and nutrient changes in peatlands, which implies that they can be used in monitoring of future fertilization management strategies aimed at fostering more sustainable agriculture.

AB In 2013, a pilot experimental field of about 15 ha was set up within the basin of Lake Massaciuccoli (Tuscany, Italy) in order to compare different management strategies-a paludicultural system (PCS), a constructed wetland system (CWS), a nearly-natural wetland system (NWS)-for peatland restoration after almost a century of drainage-based agricultural use (CS). After five years, changes in peat soil quality were investigated from a chemical, biochemical, and ecoenzymatic perspective. The soil in CS was mainly characterized by oxidant conditions, higher content of overall microbial activity, low levels of easily available phosphorus for vegetation, and medium total carbon content ranging from 25.0% to 30.7%. In PCS, the levels of total carbon and the content of bioavailable P were higher, while the oxidant conditions were lower compared to the other systems. As expected, the soils in CWS and NWS were characterized by the most reduced conditions and by the highest levels of arylsulphatase activity. It was noteworthy that soils in the NWS systems were characterized by the highest level of nonavailable P. Outputs from ecoenzymatic activity confirmed the physico-chemical and biochemical results.

DT Article
DE Beaver (Castor fiber); mire ontogenesis; prehistoric clearance;

ID HOLOCENE
AB Excavation of the relict stratigraphy of a drained, agriculturally reclaimed mire in Lancashire, northwest England, has revealed evidence for prehistoric (i.e., c. 820-520 cal. sc) beaver activity in the form of gnawed timber stratified in the, basal sediments. The lowest horizons of the peat deposits contained the intact root systems of a dense hazel wood, indicating that the mire probably owed its origins to the rapid flooding of a relatively dry landscape. The exact cause of this inundation remains uncertain, although beaver damming is a strong candidate. The possibility that beaver activity is implicated in the flooding of the site is potentially of great significance both pataeoecologically and archaeologically. The site may represent the first recorded example in British prehistory of a non-human animal playing a role in inducing mire development. It also adds weight to the possibility that some small-scale woodland clearances identified in British pollen diagrams (which have been attributed to anthropogenic activity) may be due to the effects of beaver.

AB Organic soils are the most important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water. To date, most studies have focused on natural and re -wetted peatlands, but in Central Europe a large proportion of organic soils are drained and under agricultural use. Furthermore, measures such as deep ploughing or sand addition have been conducted to improve trafficability and have resulted in topsoil horizons consisting of a peat -sand mixture. Very little is known about DOC losses" from such soils. Moreover, peat soils frequently feature both mobile zones, characterised by active water and solute transport, and immobile zones, which.exchange solutes with the mobile zone by diffusion. Surprisingly, however, the effects of this dual porosity on DOC transport have not yet been explored. This study investigated the physicochemical controls on DOC concentrations in a peat -sand mixture by means of a saturated column experiment with undisturbed columns. The soil came from a former bog in northern Germany where peat layers remaining after peat extraction were mixed with the underlying mineral soil by ploughing. Three pumping rates and two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) were applied. The transport properties of the soil were obtained by analysing breakthrough curves of potassium bromide using the transport model STANMOD, which is based on the two -region non -equilibrium concept. The results of the column study were compared to DOC concentrations measured bi-weekly for two years at the field site from where the columns were taken. Despite a similar texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the fraction of the mobile zone in the columns varied between 51% and 100% of total porosity. Thus even heavily degraded organic soils mixed with sand still showed a dual porosity comparable to degraded peat soils. Percolating the columns with the high EC solution caused low pH values, probably due to ion exchange and cation bridging. The combination of high EC and low pH greatly decreased DOC concentrations at the outlet of the columns. DOC concentrations decreased and fluxes increased as the pumping rates increased. Taking pore water velocity in the mobile zone into account could help to explain the differences between the columns. Overall, transport of DOC did not seem to be limited by production of DOC, but by rate -limited exchange processes. In contrast to the column experiment, field concentrations of DOC were much higher and were not related to pH, but increased with higher electrical conductivity. These higher concentrations could be explained by low pore water velocities and the slightly higher SOC content in the field. This first experiment on DOC transport in peat -sand mixtures taking the dual -porosity nature of organic soils into account clearly demonstrated the importance of pore water velocity and thus the residence time for DOC concentrations. While hydrochemical conditions are frequently addressed in laboratory studies, there is a need for improved understanding of their interaction with hydrology and soil physical properties, especially when attempting to interpret DOC data on different spatial and temporal scales.(C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB About a quarter of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture, forestry and other land use. Few studies of afforested drained peatlands have measured exchanges of all three major greenhouse gases (GHG) at a given site, leading to uncertainty in estimated GHG budgets. Thus, we measured forest floor exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at a well-drained afforested peatland in southern Sweden. The CO2 emissions (76000 kg ha(-1) a(-1); SE 6000) were large compared with previous measurements at similar sites, which may have been partly due to a measurement technique that did not underestimate the flux. A net CH4 uptake of 4.4 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.41) and a net N2O emission of 2.7 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.23) were found, which agreed well with published models relating fluxes to stand biomass (CH4 models) or soil C:N ratio (N2O models).

AB Drained agricultural peat soils are potential hot spots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the biogeochemical basis for distinctively large emissions is still unclear. Incubation experiments with acidic bog peat, using nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), synthetic iron monosulfide (FeS), and ground natural pyrite (FeS2), suggested that heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate and nitrite was a major potential source of N2O in the peat soil. Neither FeS nor FeS2 amendment affected N2O production and therefore high production potentials of N2O were not a result of interactions between N oxyanions and iron sulfides, such as chemolithoautotrophic pyrite oxidation.

AB Reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) is a suitable energy crop for cultivation in northern peatlands. However, the atmospheric impact of RCG cultivation as influenced by harvest frequency and fertilization is not clear. Here, we compared the biomass yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for RCG cultivation in peatlands affected by cutting frequency and fertilizer managements. The managements included one-cut (OC) and two-cut (TC) systems that were either fertilized (TC-F) or unfertilized (TC-U) after the first cut in summer. Biomass yield of OC, TC-F and TC-U were 12, 16 and 11 Mg dry biomass per hectare per year, respectively. GHG fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured with closed chamber techniques in the period between first and second (final) harvest of the TC managements, i.e. from 15 June to 23 September 2011. In the GHG monitoring period of 100 days, all systems were net sources of CO2 corresponding to 64 +/- 3, 217 +/- 15 and 50 +/- 23 g CO2-C m(-2) (mean +/- standard error, n = 3) from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively. In the same period, emissions of N2O from TC-F were ten times higher as compared to OC and TC-U. Emissions of CH4 were negligible from all systems. The TC systems could not improve the GHG balance during cultivation (271, 663 and 210 g CO(2)e-C m(-2) emissions from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively), but in a broader GHG life cycle perspective, the increased biomass yield by TC-F could replace more fossil fuel and offset at least some of the higher emissions from the system.

AB We applied a N-15 dilution technique called Integrated Total Nitrogen Input (ITNI) to quantify annual atmospheric N input into a peatland surrounded by intensive agricultural practices over a 2-year period. Grass species and grass growth effects on atmospheric N deposition were investigated using Lolium multiflorum and Eriophorum vaginatum and different levels of added N resulting in increased biomass production. Plant biomass production was positively correlated with atmospheric N uptake (up to 102.7mg N pot(-1)) when using Lolium multiflorum. In contrast, atmospheric N deposition to Eriophorum vaginatum did not show a clear dependency to produced biomass and ranged from 81.9 to 138.2mgNpot(-1). Both species revealed a relationship between atmospheric N input and total biomass N contents. Airborne N deposition varied from about 24 to 55kgNha(-1)yr(-1). Partitioning of airborne N within the monitor system differed such that most of the deposited N was found in roots of Eriophorum vaginatum while the highest share was allocated in aboveground biomass of Lolium multiflorum. Compared to other approaches determining atmospheric N deposition, ITNI showed highest airborne N input and an up to fivefold exceedance of the ecosystem-specific critical load of 5-10kgNha(-1)yr(-1).

AB This study evaluated the effects of harvesting managements with two-cuts (2C) and three-cuts (3C) per year for subsequent specific methane yield (SMY) and methane yield per hectare (MYPH) of festulolium and tall fescue cultivated on a riparian fen peatland in a block-designed field experiment (n=3). For the 2C managements, three timings of the first cut were implemented corresponding to growth stages of pre-heading (2C-early), inflorescence emergence (2C-mid), and flowering (2C-late). Anaerobic digestion batch assays with biomass samples were run for 68 days, showing that 90% of total methane (CH4) was produced within 38 days. Specific methane yield ranged from 315 to 464NLCH(4)kg(-1) volatile solids (mean, 393NL). On average, SMY of the final cut biomass was 13% lower than the first cut biomass. Methane yield per hectare ranged from 5277 to 6963Nm(3)CH(4)ha(-1) (mean, 6265Nm(3)) and was predominantly influenced by biomass yield since SMY only deviated modestly in relation to harvest management (crop maturity). Methane yield per hectare of festulolium under 3C and 2C-late management were significantly higher than 2C-early and 2C-mid managements, whereas the harvesting managements did not influence MYPH of tall fescue. The levels of SMY and MYPH in the present study represented high-end of reported values due to a combination of high activity of the biogas inoculum and a high productivity of festulolium and tall fescue at the riparian fen peatland.

AB Paludiculture, and in particular the cultivation of perennial grasses as biomass feedstock for green biorefineries, may be an economic and environmentally sustainable option for agricultural peatlands in temperate regions. However, the optimal biomass quality for protein extraction from flood-tolerant grasses is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to define the combined effect of harvest and fertilization frequency, with one to five annual cuts, on protein yield and extractability for the grasses tall fescue (TF) and reed canary grass (RCG), cultivated on an agricultural fen peatland in Denmark.The content of protein fractions was determined according to the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). We assessed protein extractability by lab-scale biorefinery techniques using a screw-press followed by acid precipitation of true protein. The two methods were compared to correlate potential extractable protein yields with actual biorefinery outputs. We found the highest annual biomass and crude protein (CP) yields in the two cut treatments, with 13.4 and 15.6 t dry matter (DM) ha(-1) year(-1), containing 2.9-3.4 t CP ha(-1) year(-1) for TF and RCG, respectively. The highest neutral-extractable (fractions B-1 and B-2) true protein yields of 1.1 and 1.5 t ha(-1) year(-1) were found in the two cut treatments, representing 39% (TF) - 45% (RCG) of total CP. Using biorefining techniques, we were able to precipitate up to 2.2 t DM ha(-1) year(-1) of protein concentrate, containing up to 39% CP. Significant correlations between methods were found, with a distinct relationship between CNCPS fractions B-1 + B-2 and CP yield of the protein concentrate, indicating the suitability of the CNCPS as an indicator for extractable protein yields. Biomass and CP yields were not significantly improved beyond two annual cuts. However, timing and harvest frequencies significantly affected plant maturity and consequently extractable CP contents and protein concentrate yields. We conclude that TF and RCG are promising feedstocks for green biorefineries due to high biomass, extractable CP, and protein concentrate yields, and highlight the potential of flood-tolerant grasses, cultivated on wet agricultural peatlands, for an enhanced valorisation beyond the common utilisation for bioenergy.

AB Wetland buffer zones (WBZs) are riparian areas that form a transition between terrestrial and aquatic environments and are well-known to remove agricultural water pollutants such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). This review attempts to merge and compare data on the nutrient load, nutrient loss and nutrient removal and/or retention from multiple studies of various WBZs termed as riparian mineral soil wetlands, groundwatercharged peatlands (i.e. fens) and floodplains. Two different soil types ('organic' and 'mineral'), four different main water sources ('groundwater', 'precipitation', 'surface runoff/drain discharge', and 'river inundation') and three different vegetation classes ('arboraceous', 'herbaceous' and 'aerenchymous') were considered separately for data analysis. The studied WBZs are situated within the temperate and continental climatic regions that are commonly found in northern-central Europe, northern USA and Canada. Surprisingly, only weak differences for the nutrient removal/retention capability were found if the three WBZ types were directly compared. The results of our study reveal that for example the nitrate retention efficiency of organic soils (53 +/- 28%; mean +/- sd) is only slightly higher than that of mineral soils (50 +/- 32%). Variance in load had a stronger influence than soil type on the N retention inWBZs. However, organic soils in fens tend to be sources of dissolved organic N and soluble reactive P, particularly when the fens have become degraded due to drainage and past agricultural usage. The detailed consideration of water sources indicated that average nitrate removal efficiencies were highest for ground water (76 +/- 25%) and lowest for river water (35 +/- 24%). No significant pattern for P retention emerged; however, the highest absolute removal appeared if the P source was river water. The harvesting of vegetation will minimise potential P loss from rewetted WBZs and plant biomass yield may promote circular economy value chains and provide compensation to land owners for restored land now unsuitable for conventional farming.

ID EXTRACTION; DYNAMICS; RELEASE
AB The cultivation of fen peat soils (Eutric Histosols) for agricultural purposes, started in Europe about 250 years ago, resulting in decreased soil fertility, increased oxidation of peat and corresponding greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere, nutrient transfer to aquatic ecosystems and losses in total area of the former native wetlands. To prevent these negative environmental effects set-aside programs and rewetting measures were promoted in recent years. Literature results and practical experiences showed that large scale rewetting of intensively used agricultural Histosols may result in mobilisation of phosphorus (P), its transport to adjacent surface waters and an accelerated eutrophication. The paper summarises results from an international European Community sponsored research project and demonstrates how results obtained at different scales and from different scientific disciplines were compiled to derive a strategy to carry out rewetting measures. Based on this findings a simple decision support system (DSS) for a hydrologically sensitive area in the Droemling catchment in north-eastern Germany was developed and since 2005 practically used to prevent freshwater resources from non point P pollution.

AB In natural coastal wetlands, high supplies of marine sulfate suppress methanogenesis. Coastal wetlands are, however, often subject to disturbance by diking and drainage for agricultural use and can turn to potent methane sources when rewetted for remediation. This suggests that preceding land use measures can suspend the sulfate-related methane suppressing mechanisms. Here, we unravel the hydrological relocation and biogeochemical S and C transformation processes that induced high methane emissions in a disturbed and rewetted peatland despite former brackish impact. The underlying processes were investigated along a transect of increasing distance to the coastline using a combination of concentration patterns, stable isotope partitioning, and analysis of the microbial community structure. We found that diking and freshwater rewetting caused a distinct freshening and an efficient depletion of the brackish sulfate reservoir by dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR). Despite some legacy effects of brackish impact expressed as high amounts of sedimentary S and elevated electrical conductivities, contemporary metabolic processes operated mainly under sulfate-limited conditions. This opened up favorable conditions for the establishment of a prospering methanogenic community in the top 30-40 cm of peat, the structure and physiology of which resemble those of terrestrial organic-rich environments. Locally, high amounts of sulfate persisted in deeper peat layers through the inhibition of DSR, probably by competitive electron acceptors of terrestrial origin, for example Fe(III). However, as sulfate occurred only in peat layers below 30-40 cm, it did not interfere with high methane emissions on an ecosystem scale. Our results indicate that the climate effect of disturbed and remediated coastal wetlands cannot simply be derived by analogy with their natural counterparts. From a greenhouse gas perspective, the re-exposure of diked wetlands to natural coastal dynamics would literally open up the floodgates for a replenishment of the marine sulfate pool and therefore constitute an efficient measure to reduce methane emissions.

AB Fen plants cultivated on wet peatlands might be an environmentally friendly alternative biogas substrate to maize and grass grown on drained peatlands. This study demonstrates that if Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis, and Phalaris arundinacea were harvested in mid-June, then their specific biogas yields (SBY) reached values of up to 581 L-N kg(-1) volatile solids (VS), which is similar to the SBY of grass, but lower than the SBY, of 670 L-N kg(-1) VS, for maize. Mixtures with equal or more than 10% T. latifolia or 40% P. arundinacea (VS-base) exhibited a reduced SBY compared to 100% maize silage in a batch-test. From the composition of the substrates, it remains unclear why fen plants degraded that poorly. However, during the semi-continuous long-term experiment, this effect led to an accumulation of non-degraded material, which destabilized the degradation process at loading rates above 3 kg VS m(-3) d(-1). Destabilization became apparent with substantial increases in the viscosity of the fermenter content, enrichment of acids and a worsened methane formation. Our findings suggest that only small proportions of maize could be replaced by fen plants as substrate for biogas plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are recognized as important carbon stores; despite this, many have been drained for agricultural improvement. Drainage has been shown to lower water tables and alter vegetation composition, modifying primary productivity and decomposition, potentially initiating peat loss. To quantify CO2 fluxes across whole landscapes, it is vital to understand how vegetation composition and CO2 fluxes vary spatially in response to the pattern of drainage features. However, Molinia caerulea-dominated peatlands are poorly understood despite their widespread extent.
   Photosynthesis (P-G600) and ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) were modelled (12 degrees C, 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), greenness excess index of 60) using empirically derived parameters based on closed-chamber measurements collected over a growing season. Partitioned below-ground fluxes were also collected. Plots were arranged 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 the distance between adjacent ditches in two catchments located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   Water table depths were deepest closest to the ditch and non-significantly (p = 0.197) shallower further away. Non-Molinia species coverage and the Simpson diversity index significantly decreased with water table depth (p < 0.024) and increased non-significantly (p < 0.083) away from the ditch. No CO2 fluxes showed significant spatial distribution in response to drainage ditches, arguably due to insignificant spatial distribution of water tables and vegetation composition. Whilst R-Eco showed no significant spatial variation, P-G600 varied significantly between sites (p = 0.012), thereby controlling the spatial distribution of net ecosystem exchange between sites. As P-G600 significantly co-varied with water table depths (p = 0.034), determining the spatial distribution of water table depths may enable CO2 fluxes to be estimated across M. caerulea-dominated landscapes.

AB The drainage of peatlands for their agricultural use leads to huge emissions of greenhouse gases. One sustainable alternative is the cultivation of peat mosses after rewetting ('Sphagnum farming'). Environmental parameters of such artificial systems may differ from those of natural Sphagnum ecosystems which host a rich fungal community. We studied the fungal community at a 4 ha Sphagnum fanning field site in Northwestern Germany and compared it with that of natural Sphagnum ecosystems. Additionally, we asked if any fungi occur with potentially negative consequences for the commercial production and/or use of Sphagnum biomass. Samples were collected every 3 months within 1 year. High-throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS2 barcode was used to obtain a comprehensive community profile of the fungi. The dominant taxa in the fungal community of the Sphagnum farming field site were all commonly reported from natural Sphagnum ecosystems. While the taxonomic composition showed clear differences between seasons, a stable functional community profile was identified across seasons. Additionally, nutrient supply seems to affect composition of fungal community. Despite a rather high abundance of bryophyte parasites, and the occurrence of both Sphagnum-species-specific and general plant pathogens, their impact on the productivity and usage of Sphagnum biomass as raw material for growing media was considered to be low.

TI Effect of Cement Additive and Curing Period on Some Engineering

ID STRENGTH
AB Peat soil is characterized by its high content of decomposed organic matter. Majority of areas occupied by peatland have been developed for agriculture sectors such as pineapple cultivation and oil palm. Due to its geotechnical drawback characteristics such as highly compressibility and low shear strength, peat soil is classified as problematic soils and unstable for engineering structures. Lack of suitable and expensive price of lands, peatland will be an alternative option for future development. Prior to construction works, stabilization of peat soil should be performed to enhance its engineering characteristics. This paper presents the effect of cement and curing period on engineering properties of the cement-treated peat soil. Some engineering variables were examined including the compaction behaviour, permeability and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). The Atterberg limit test was also carried out to examine the influence of cement addition on peat soil. The cement-treated peat soils were prepared by adding varying amount of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) ranging between 0% and 40% of dry weight of peat soil. In order to examine the effect of curing, the treated samples were dried at room temperature for three and seven days while for UCS tests samples were extended to 28 days prior to testings. The results showed that the liquid limit of treated soil decreased with the increase of cement content. Maximum dry density (MDD) increased while optimum moisture content (OMC) dropped with the increase in cement content. Permeability of treated soil decreased from 6.2x10(-4) to 2.4x10(-4) ms(-1) as cement content increase from 0% to 40%. In contrast, the UCS tests indicated an increase in uncompressive strength with the increase in cement contents and curing period. The liquid limit and permeability were also altered as curing periods were extended from three to seven days. This study concluded that geotechnical properties of peat soil can be stabilized using ordinary cement and by modification of the curing periods.

DT Review
DE POCOSIN; PINE PLANTATIONS; FOREST MANAGEMENT; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION;
   DRAINMOD MODELING; PEAT MINING; AGRICULTURE
AB Land development activities such as agriculture, clear cutting, peat mining, and the planting of forest plantations on wetlands can affect the hydrologic behavior of these ecosystems by affecting their water storage and release patterns on the landscape. The effects of these development activities on hydrologic fluxes in peatlands (Typic Medisaprists) were compared to the effects of forest management practices in North Carolina using a field-tested hydrologic simulation model (DRAINMOD). Simulations revealed that natural peat-based (Histosol) pocosin systems lose 66% (80 cm) of the 123 cm of average annual rainfall by evapotranspiration (ET) and 34% (42 cm/yr) via annual runoff. Annual runoff values were 63 cm/yr for peat mining areas, 48 cm/yr for cleared peatlands, 46 cm/yr for peatlands converted to agriculture and 34 cm/yr for pine plantations, once the forest canopy is closed. Thus, these wetland alterations, except for forestry, significantly increased runoff and decreased ET compared to the natural ecosystem. Forest pine plantation management decreased runoff and increased ET. A case study of the effects of forest management practices was reviewed for a 15-year-old drained loblolly pine plantation growing on fine sandy loam soils (Thermic Typic umbraquults) in the coastal plains of North Carolina. Forestry activities such as thinning (i.e., reduced leaf area index by 50%) decreased ET and canopy interception and nearly doubled drainage loss (38 cm/yr to 60 cm/ yr). Commonly applied forest practices, such as drainage, increased the average number of flow events with flows > 5 mm/day to 86 days per year from 26 days per year under natural conditions.

AB Environmental archives such as peat bogs, sediments, corals, trees, polar ice, plant material from herbarium collections, and human tissue material have greatly helped to assess both ancient and recent atmospheric lead deposition and its sources on a regional and global scale. In Europe detectable atmospheric lead pollution began as early as 6000 years ago due to enhanced soil dust and agricultural activities, as studies of peat bugs reveal. Increased lead emissions during ancient Greek and Roman times have been recorded and identified in many longterm archives such as lake sediments in Sweden, ice cores in Greenland, and peat bogs in Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. For the period since the Industrial Revolution, other archives such as corals, trees, and herbarium collections provide similar chronologies of atmospheric lead pollution, with periods of enhanced lead deposition occurring at the turn of the century and since 1950. The main sources have been industry, including coal burning. ferrous and nonferrous smelting, and open waste incineration until c.1950 and leaded gasoline use since 1950, The greatest lead emissions to the atmosphere all over Europe occurred between 1950 and 1980 due to traffic exhaust. A marked drop in atmospheric lead fluxes found in most archives since the 1980s has been attributed to the phasing out of leaded gasoline. The isotope ratios of lead in the various archives show qualitatively similar temporal changes, for example, the immediate response to the introduction and phasing out of leaded gasoline. Isotope studies largely confirm source assessments based on lead emission inventories and allow the contributions of various anthropogenic sources to be calculated.

AB Cultivation of bioenergy crops has been suggested as a promising option for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from arable organic soils (Histosols). Here, we report the annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes of CO2 as measured with a dynamic closed chamber method at a drained fen peatland grown with reed canary grass (RCG) and spring barley (SB) in a plot experiment (n=3 for each cropping system). The CO2 flux was partitioned into gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (R-E). For the data analysis, simple yet useful GP and R-E models were developed which introduce plot-scale ratio vegetation index as an active vegetation proxy. The GP model captures the effect of temperature and vegetation status, and the R-E model estimates the proportion of foliar biomass dependent respiration (R-fb) in the total R-E. Annual R-E was 1887 +/- 7 (mean +/- standard error, n=3) and 1288 +/- 19g CO2-Cm-2 in RCG and SB plots, respectively, with R-fb accounting for 32 and 22% respectively. Total estimated annual GP was -1818 +/- 42 and -1329 +/- 66g CO2-Cm-2 in RCG and SB plots leading to a NEE of 69 +/- 36g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) in RCG plots (i.e., a weak net source) and -41 +/- 47g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) in SB plots (i.e., a weak net sink). Standard errors related to spatial variation were small (as shown above), but more significant uncertainties were related to the modelling approach for establishment of annual budgets. In conclusion, the bioenergy cropping system was not more favourable than the food cropping system when looking at the atmospheric CO2 emissions during cultivation. However, in a broader GHG life-cycle perspective, the lower fertilizer N input and the higher biomass yield in bioenergy cropping systems could be beneficial.

AB A transect of profiles from the Bratamossen bog near the village of Axlarp, in the province of Smaland, southern Sweden, was investigated with respect to magnetic properties, human-impact pollen indicators and loss on ignition.  The bog is situated close to an area with clearance cairns, an indication of abandoned arable fields.  There are also graves from the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age close to the bog.  A variety of analytical methods were used to reconstruct the land-use history of this area since c.6000 C-14 years BP.  While pollen analysis was used to detect changes in vegetation, the magnetic analyses reflected how the soils in the landscape were affected by these changes.  The pollen analysis showed that the area became deforested and that forest vegetation was succeeded by pasture and arable land.  Magnetic analyses indicated soil erosion as a consequence of agricultural activity.  The conventional technique of determining the minerogenic content by loss on ignition yielded no valuable information.

TI Peat-based emissions in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Peat-based emissions are reported under three different reporting sectors in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory: Agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Energy. Peat-based emissions comprise together around one third of the total reported net greenhouse gas emissions in Finland when also sinks and emissions from LULUCF sector are included. Most of the emissions come from the combustion of peat for energy but emissions from the agricultural use of peatlands and drained forest soils are also of importance. The IPCC (Intergovemmental Panel on Climate Change) provides the basic guidelines for the inventory calculations. However, the use of national methods and emission factors is encouraged. Introducing new country-specific methods or emission factors in the inventory calculations requires transparent documentation of the input parameters and the process how emission factors, parameters and models are derived. Here we describe the national system for estimating peat-based emissions for the greenhouse gas inventory, and the methods that are used in deriving the emission estimates, as well as possibilities to use new national emission factors for improving the estimates.

AB Following the recent international agreements on climate action, there is an urgent need to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Wet cultivation of peatlands (paludiculture) can combine low GHG emissions with productive use of the land, but methods for identifying suitable areas at regional and local scales are lacking. In this study we present a spatial assessment tool for two paludiculture species, namely Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia. This tool is built in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and is designed to perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cultivation potential of land that is currently used for agriculture or peat extraction, within a defined geographical area. It uses a graded assessment process with a plot based analysis. A case study application shows that the tool can deliver first estimates of the potential cultivation area, but further research is needed to enhance its flexibility and scope of application. In its present form it may be used as a decision support instrument for specific sites.

AB Peatland restoration has been attracting increasing attention and implementation since large areas of peatlands in China have been degraded or reclaimed to cropland in recent decades. However, the length of time for cultivated peatland to be restored to natural climax level in terms of vegetation remained unknown. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the characteristics of hydrology, plant community, and soil in abandoned 0-, 2-, 15-, and 30-year-old paddy lands and a natural peatland. The results showed a long-term rise in water level after restoration. Similarity indexes between restored sites and natural peatland also increased with the extension of restoration time. During the first three years after abandonment, weeds grew vigorously and almost overtook the entire experimental site. However, the plant community was dominated by a Carex schmidtii-Phragmites australis-Thelypteris palustris community, where similarity increased to 64% and vegetation succession approached a natural climax community after 15 years of restoration. Compared with the paddy field, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic matter (TOM) in the soil at 0-30 cm depth and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm showed no significant change after 2 years of restoration. In the 15-year restoration site, however, TN and TOM at 0-30 cm increased by 108% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.01), and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm decreased by 40% compared with the paddy field (P < 0.05), and the values were already similar to the 30-year site and the natural peatland. Those findings indicate that the cultivated peatland could be restored effectively through natural succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Iron cycling in wetlands is important because it plays an important role in interactions among wetland soils/sediments, plants and microorganisms. The seasonal variation of iron (Fe) distributed in two freshwater peatland ecosystems dominated by Calamagrostis angustifolia (CA) and Carex lasiocarpa (CL), was observed in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The compartmentalization of the Fe cycle including storage in the atmosphere, litter, soil, and above- and below ground plant material was determined. The results showed that the Fe input from rain was 0.06 g m(-2) a(-1), and the total Fe mass in the peatland ecosystem was 5.18 x 10(3) for CA and 1.40 x 10(3) g m(-2) for CL. The major Fe pools were soils (98.6% and 97.1% for CA and CL, respectively). The Fe fluxes between each compartment resulted in the increase of the belowground Fe pool and decrease of the litter Fe pool currently both for CA and CL. CL has greater uptake coefficient (0.024) and cycle coefficient (0.034), but smaller use coefficient (0.58) than that of CA (0.02, 0.006, and 0.77, respectively). Peatland conversion for agriculture affected the former natural Fe cycle processes and mass balance to a certain extent in long term, because the Fe assimilated by soybean and rice are less than that of CA and CL, and cannot return to soils from harvesting. Drainage and ditch excavation for agricultural conversion caused considerable Fe loss via aqueous movement, so that Fe was likely lost and transported downstream by these ditch networks.

AB Drained and cultivated fen peats represent some of the world's most productive soils, however, they are susceptible to degradation and typically exhibit high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. We hypothesised that GHG losses from these soils could be reduced by manipulating water table depth, tillage regime, crop residue application or horticultural fleece cover. Using intact soil columns from a horticultural peatland, emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were monitored over a six-month period, using a closed-chamber method. Concurrent measurements of soil properties allowed identification of the key controls on GHG emissions. Raising the water table to the soil surface provided the strongest reduction in global warming potential (GWP(100); 25 +/- 6 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), compared to a free-draining control (80 +/- 1 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), but this effect was partially negated by an emission pulse when the water table was subsequently lowered. The highest emissions occurred when the water table was maintained 15 cm below the surface (168 +/- 11 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), as this stimulated N2O loss. Placement of horticultural fleece over the soil surface during spring had no significant effect on GWP100, but prolonged fleece application exacerbated GHG emissions. Leaving lettuce crop residues on the surface increased soil GWP(100) (105 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)) in comparison to when residues were incorporated into the soil (85 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), however, there was no evidence that this promoted positive priming of native soil organic matter (SOM). For maximum abatement potential, mitigation measures should be applied during the growing season, when GHG emissions are greatest. Our results also suggest that introduction of zero or minimum-till practices may not reduce GHG emissions. Maintaining a high water table was the only option that reliably reduced GHG emissions, however, this option is impractical to implement within current horticultural systems. We conclude that alternative strategies or a major change in land use (e.g., conversion from horticulture/arable to wetland) should be explored as a means of preserving these soils for future generations.

AB This study compared the efficiency of geostatistical digital soil mapping (DSM) with conventional soil mapping (CSM) for updating soil class and property maps of a cultivated peatland in the Netherlands. For digital soil class mapping, the generalized linear geostatistical model was used. Digital mapping of the soil organic matter (SOM) content and peat thickness was done by universal kriging. The conventional soil class map was created by free survey, while the property maps were created with the representative profile description (RPD) and map unit means (MUM) methods. For each method, we computed the effort invested in the mapping in terms of the sampling and cost densities. The accuracies of the created soil maps were estimated from independent probability sample data. The results showed that for DSM, the cost density could be reduced by a factor of three compared with CSM without compromising accuracy. The map purity of both maps was around 55%. For conventional soil property mapping, the MUM maps were more accurate than the RPD maps. For SOM, CSM-MUM (RAISE 7.5%) performed better than DSM (RMSE 12.1%), although accuracy differences were not significant. For peat thickness, DSM (RMSE 23.3 cm) performed slightly better than CSM-MUM (RMSE 24.9 cm). Despite the differences in accuracy being small, the digital soil property maps were produced more efficiently. The cost density was a factor of 3.5 smaller. We conclude that for updating conventional soil maps in the Dutch peatlands, geostatistical DSM can be more efficient, although not necessarily more accurate, than CSM.

AB Inputs of surface waters high in chloride and sulphate increased the availability of nutrients in fen peatlands. This `internal eutrophication' was demonstrated with test plants (`phytometers') and through water and soil analysis. Three experiments are presented in which the level of chloride and/or sulphate was increased to 3 mmol(c) l(-1). In experiment 1 chloride levels were increased from 0.5 to 3 mmol(c) l(-1) as CaCl2 or NaCl. In experiment 2 and 3 similar increased levels for chloride and sulphate (3 mmol(c) l(-1); as NaCl and Na2SO4) were used. The following results were found:
   (i) No differences in soil total-N and total-P were found before and after the treatments in any of the three experiments.
   (ii) Experiment 1 showed a significant increase in Bio-Available P (BAP) in pots planted with Anthoxanthum odoratum as well as in bare pots for the NaCl and CaCl2 treatments. The plants in these treatments had taken up much more P.
   (iii) Experiment 2 showed an increase in soil BAP after treatment with chloride and sulphate in pots planted with Anthoxanthum odoratum. The chloride treatment had no effect on plant biomass, whereas the sulphate treatment resulted in a reduction in root biomass and root N and P content. The shoots showed an increase in P content in the sulphate and chloride treatments, while N content remained the same.
   (iv) In experiment 3, treatments with chloride and sulphate led to significantly increased biomass and P uptake of Anthoxanthum odoratum. Again, no effects on N uptake were found.
   These experiments provide evidence for distinctly increased availability of phosphate in peat soils when these come into contact with water with even moderately increased sulphate or chloride levels. Surface water originating from the Rhine river, which is enriched in chloride and sulphate, is often supplied to fen reserves in The Netherlands, to compensate for water losses due to agricultural drainage in the region. The results of this study show that phosphate availability to the vegetation may rise drastically, with detrimental effects on the species density and the occurrence of rare species in the vegetation. Hence, supply of this water should be avoided.

AB In this study, a process-based model (RCG-C) was developed, parameterized and calibrated for studying the annual and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a cutaway peatland (Linnansuo, eastern Finland) cultivated with a perennial bioenergy crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L., RCG). Based on a number of prior studies and an environmentally controlled experiment, RCG-C emphasized several key processes beyond the generality of previous diplotelmic models for pristine peatlands. These processes included the effects of management (e.g., drainage, peat extraction, tilling, harvesting and fertilization) on the soil hydrology and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, the influence of climatic factors on photosynthesis and the phenological cycle and phenological and soil-moisture controls on biomass production and canopy development. The model was validated based on continuous measurements of meteorological parameters, energy and CO2 fluxes (eddy covariance system) performed at the site from 2005 to 2010, including variation associated with both wet and dry years. The results showed that the model captured the seasonal and annual trends of the latent heat flux and NEE during the six-year period. Moreover, the simulated values for the total C sink capacity, accumulation of rhizome biomass and peat formation from RCG obtained during the six-year period also agreed well with the field measurements. Based on the FINADAPT climate scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the potential increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and air temperature (Ta) could be the main forces driving the changes in NEE. The model simulation suggested that the effects of Ta tend to offset those of Ca and lead to a decrease in the total C sink capacity of the site during the main rotation period (4-15th year of cultivation). This decrease tends to become more intensive toward the end of the 21st century. During the period from 2060 to 2099, the total CO2 sink capacity could decrease by 79% during the main rotation period at the Linnansuo site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rewetting agricultural peatland abates carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, but the resulting waterlogged anaerobic soil condition may create hotspots of methane (CH4) emissions. In this study, we measured CH4 emissions from side-by-side replicated plots in an agricultural fen cultivated with reed canary grass under a control and two experimental rewetting (i.e., paludiculture) conditions as either continuously flooded to soil surface or semi-flooded where water from the flooded plots intruded from sub-surface. Fluxes were measured for two successive years at 1-2 week intervals (total 59 measurement dates) using static chambers. Annual emissions were estimated by trapezoidal linear interpolation of the measured fluxes between the measurement dates. Two-year time-weighted average ground water tables (GWT) in the flooded, semi-flooded and control plots were 1, 3 and 9 cm below soil surface, respectively. The annual average emissions from flooded plots were 82 and 116 g CH4 m(-2 )yr(-1) in Year 1 and 2, respectively, which were significantly higher than the emissions from semi-flooded plots (35 and 69 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 2, respectively) and from control plots (3 and 9 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 2, respectively). Overall, the results showed that the GWT in paludiculture should be maintained few cm below soil surface during high temperature periods to prevent risks of high CH4 emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

SO PLOS ONE

ID THALIANA; GROWTH; TRANSCRIPTION; CONSERVATION; SOIL; COMPOSTS
AB Experimental research involving Arabidopsis thaliana often involves the quantification of phenotypic traits during cultivation on compost or other growing media. Many commercially-available growing media contain peat, but peat extraction is not sustainable due to its very slow rate of formation. Moreover, peat extraction reduces peatland biodiversity and releases stored carbon and methane into the atmosphere. Here, we compared the experimental performance of Arabidopsis on peat-based and several types of commercially-available peat-free growing media (variously formed from coir, composted bark, wood-fibre, and domestic compost), to provide guidance for reducing peat use in plant sciences research with Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis biomass accumulation and seed yield were reduced by cultivation on several types of peat-free growing media. Arabidopsis performed extremely poorly on coir alone, presumably because this medium was completely nitrate-free. Some peatfree growing media were more susceptible to fungal contamination. We found that autoclaving of control (peat-based) growing media had no effect upon any physiological parameters that we examined, compared with non-autoclaved control growing media, under our experimental conditions. Overall, we conclude that Arabidopsis performs best when cultivated on peat-based growing media because seed yield was almost always reduced when peat-free media were used. This may be because standard laboratory protocols and growth conditions for Arabidopsis are optimized for peat-based media. However, during the vegetative growth phase several phenotypic traits were comparable between plants cultivated on peat-based and some peat-free media, suggesting that under certain circumstances peat-free media can be suitable for phenotypic analysis of Arabidopsis.

AB Base cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and metals (Al, Fe, Mn) were measured in peatlands of the northern and central Everglades to (i) determine the extent and degree of elemental enrichment of the peat caused by agricultural drainage and (ii) assess the relationship between cattail (Typha latifolia L.) encroachment into sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) communities and elemental (cations, metals, P) enrichment of the peat. Soil Ca, Mg, and Na (0-10 cm) decreased, and Al and Fe increased from north to south through the northern and central Everglades. Ln particular, nutrient-enriched (P) areas of northern WCA 2A had higher concentrations and accumulation rates of Ca, Mg, and Na than areas to the south. A detailed investigation along a P enrichment gradient in northern WCA 2A revealed a gradient of Ca and Na enrichment extending 1.6 to 3.4 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, the source of agricultural drainage to WCA 2A. Rates of Ca (35 g/m(2) per yr) and Na (1.5-3.2 g/m(2) per yr) accumulation were 2 to 10 times greater 1.6 km below the Hillsboro canal than in areas 3.4 to 10.7 km downstream. Correlation analysis revealed that macrophyte species composition along the enrichment gradient was highly correlated with soil P (0-24 cm) but not with soil Na or Ca. The percent frequency of cattail (r = 0.74) and other species (r = 0.66) was positively correlated while sawgrass (r = -0.83) was inversely correlated with soil P content. These findings suggest that cattail encroachment into sawgrass communities Is favored by enrichment of the peat with P loadings from agricultural drainage pumped into northern WCA 2A.

AB Hyalospheniids are among the most common and conspicuous testate amoebae in high-latitude peatlands and forest humus. These testate amoebae were widely studied as bioindicators and are increasingly used as models in microbial biogeography. However, data on their diversity and ecology are still very unevenly distributed geographically: notably, data are lacking for low-latitude peatlands. We describe here a new species, Nebela jiuhuensis, from peatlands near the Middle Yangtze River reach of south-central China with characteristic morphology. The test ( shell) has hollow horn-like lateral extensions also found in N. saccifera, N. equicalceus (= N. hippocrepis), and N. ansata, three large species restricted mostly to Sphagnum peatlands of Eastern North America. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase ( COI) data confirm that N. jiuhuensis is closely related to the morphologically very similar North American species N. saccifera and more distantly to N. ansata within the N. penardiana group. These species are all found in wet mosses growing in poor fens. Earlier reports of morphologically similar specimens found in South Korea peatlands suggest that N. jiuhuensis may be distributed in comparable peatlands in Eastern Asia ( China and Korea). The discovery of such a conspicuous new species in Chinese peatlands suggests that many new testate amoebae species are yet to be discovered, including potential regional endemics. Furthermore, human activities ( e. g., drainage, agriculture, and pollution) have reduced the known habitat of N. jiuhuensis, which can thus be considered as locally endangered. We, therefore, suggest that this very conspicuous micro-organism with a probably limited geographical distribution and specific habitat requirement should be considered as a flagship species for microbial biogeography as well as local environmental conservation and management.

AB This study measured the effects of land use on organic matter released to surface waters in a boreal peat catchment using radiocarbon dating of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC), DOC concentration, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition, and optical measurements. Undisturbed sites invariably released modern DOC and POC (<20 years old), and seasonal forcing had little impact on the age distribution. Released of pre-1950 carbon was detected at peat extraction, agricultural and peat extraction areas throughout the seasons. Convention; mean DOC ages reached 3,100 (+/- 122) years before collection. On average, DOC concentrations were up to 38% higher at impacted sites compared to natural areas, but there was no significant effect of land use on surface water DOC concentrations. the study indicated that the extent of land use impacts is not necessarily detectible through changes in DOC concentration alone. Radiocarbon dating was essential to show that leaching of old soil organic matter at modified sites had replaced, rather than supplemented, the modern DOM that is usually released from pristine peatlands. Relationships between the specific fluorescence intensity of DOM and its radiocarbon age were identified, indicating that optical technique may provide a method for the detection of changes in DOM age.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) inventories are important tools for studying the effects of land-use and climate change and evaluating climate-change policies. A detailed inventory of SOC in the agricultural soils of the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg was therefore prepared based on the highest-resolution geo-referenced soil, land-use, and climate data (BUK200 inventory). In order to estimate the quality of different approaches, C inventories of the region were also prepared based on data from the National Inventory Report (UBA, 2003) and by applying the IPCC (1997) method to the two data sets. Finally, the BUK200 inventory was used to estimate potentials of no-tillage agriculture (NT) and peatland restoration to contribute to C sequestration and greenhouse-gas (GHG)-emission mitigation since both measures are discussed in this context. Scenario assumptions were change to NT on 40% of the cropland and restoration of 50% of cultivated peatlands within 20 years.
   On average, grasslands contained 9.5 kg C m(-2) to 0.3 m depth as compared to only 6.0 kg C m(-2) under cropland, indicating strong land-use effects. The SOC content depended strongly on waterlogging and elevation, thus reflecting reduced C mineralization under aquic moisture regimes and low temperatures. Comparison of the BUK200 inventory with the approach used for UBA (2003) showed high inconsistencies due to map resolution and SOC contents, whereas the IPCC method led to fairly good agreements. Results on the simulated effects of NT and peatland restoration suggested that 5%-14% of total agricultural GHG emissions could be abated with NT whereas peat restoration appeared to have a minor mitigation potential (0.2%-2.7%) because the total area of cultivated organic soils was too small to have larger impact.

AB After drainage of natural boreal peatlands, the decomposition of organic matter increases and peat soil may turn into a net source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission is known to decrease. Afforestation is a potential mitigation strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emission from organic agricultural soils. A static chamber technique was used to evaluate the fluxes of CH4, N2O and CO2 from three boreal organic agricultural soils in western Finland, afforested 1, 6 or 23 years before this study. The mean emissions of CH4 and N2O during the growing seasons did not correlate with the age of the tree stand. All sites were sources of N2O. The highest daily N2O emission during the growing season, measured in the oldest site, was as high as 29 mg N2O m(-2)d(-1). In general, organic agricultural soils are sinks for methane. Here, the oldest site acted as a small sink for methane, whereas the two youngest afforested organic soils were sources for methane with maximum emission rates (up to 154 mg m(-2)d(-1)) similar to those reported for minerogenous natural peatlands. Soil respiration rates decreased with the age of the forest. The high soil respiration in the younger sites, probably resulted from the high biomass production of herbs, could create soil anaerobiosis and increase methane production. Our results show that afforestation of agricultural peat soils does not abruptly terminate the N2O emissions during the first two decades, and afforestation can even enhance methane emission for a few years. The carbon accumulation in the developing tree stand can partly compensate the carbon loss from soil.

AB Combining peatland rewetting with biomass cropping (paludiculture) is one strategy to remove nutrientsurpluses from soil/water and stimulate peat-forming vegetation. This approach was tested in the Mas-saciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy), a coastal floodplain artificially drained for agricultural purposessince 1930, where land reclamation and continuous cropping have contributed to considerable peatdegradation and water eutrophication due to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. An experimentaltrial was established in spring 2012 with three perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRG) (Phragmites aus-tralis, Miscanthus X giganteus, Arundo donax) and two woody species managed as short-rotation coppice(SRC) (Salix alba Dimitrios, Populus X canadensis Oudenberg), aimed to provide biomass for variousbioenergy supply chains. A conventionally cultivated annual crop (maize) was the control. The aim of thisstudy was to compare the sustainability of the proposed paludiculture systems to that of conventionalannual crops on the basis of yield and nutrient-removal capability. This two-year field study evaluatedyields, nutrient concentrations and uptake (N and P) of the crops. Over the two years, A. donax had thehighest mean biomass yield (35 Mg ha(-1)), N uptake (367 kg ha(-1)), and P uptake (54 kg ha(-1)). SRCs hadthe lowest nutrient uptake in both years. Among grasses, the highest N concentration was recorded inA. donax leaves in 2013 (N: 2.41%), while P concentration was greater in S. alba branches (P: 0.39%). Theaverage aboveground biomass of maize was 17.5 Mg ha(-1), while the nutrient uptakes were equal to 194and 27 kg ha(-1)for N and P, respectively.
   Thus, the performances of paludiculture systems were generally encouraging and could represent animportant alternative for restoring and managing former drained peatlands in a suitable product chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flux gradient, eddy covariance and relaxed eddy accumulation methods were applied to measure CH4 and N2O emissions from peatlands and arable land respectively. Measurements of N2O emission by eddy covariance using tunable diode laser spectroscopy provided fluxes ranging from 2 to 60 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1) with a mean value of 22 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1) from 320 h of continuous measurements.
   Fluxes of CH4 measured above peatland in Caithness (U.K.) during May and June 1993 by eddy covariance and relaxed eddy accumulation methods were in the range 70 to 120 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with means of 14.7 mu.mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 22.7 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) respectively.
   Emissions of CH4 from peatland changed with mater table depth and soil temperature; increasing from 25 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) at 5% pool area to 50 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with 30% within the flux footprint occupied by pools. A temperature response of 4.9 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) degrees C-1 in the range 6-12 degrees C was also observed.
   The close similarity in average CH4 emission fluxes reported for wetlands in Caithness, Hudson Bay and Alaska in the range 11 to 40 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) suggests that earlier estimates of CH4 emission from high latitude wetlands were too large or that the area of high latitudes contributing to CH4 emission has been seriously underestimated.

AB Re-naturalisation was investigated in 2012 on a peat bog (Pachiterric Histosol) with a non-removed peat layer at the former Radviliskis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture in the site of the long-term field experiment, which had been completed 12 years ago. Peat samples were taken from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers in 3 field replicates. Chemical analyses were carried out at the Chemical Research Laboratory of Institute of Agriculture, LRCAF. The previously differently used peat soil contained different stocks of organic carbon (SOC). SOC stocks in the soil occupied with grassland were greater than those in peat soil previously not used for agriculture. The largest stock of MHA was in former unfertilised perennial grasses (0-30 cm)- 78.67% compared with other treatments. MHA content increased with increasing depth. The lower stability of carbon compounds in 0-30 cm layer was determined in the peat previously un-used for agricultural purposes, which had the highest relative share (40.9%) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), characterized by the highest lability. We concluded that the most efficient way to conserve and sustain organic carbon in peat is to grow perennial grasses under non-intensive management system.

AB While peatland has long been exploited for agricultural activities, these make it vulnerable to fires, which emit pollutants into the atmosphere and adversely affect air quality. The aim of this study was thus to determine the main composition of air pollutants from peat soil combustion. The main parameters of the related gas pollutants, e.g., SO2, NO2, CO, O-3 and PM10, and their components, such as anions, cations, heavy metals and levoglucosan, have been determined. The gas concentration was determined using the colorimetric method after the air had been assimilated into absorbing solutions. The PM10 concentration was established using a low volume air sampler equipped with weighted filter paper. The anion concentration of PM10 was analyzed using ion chromatography, while the cation and heavy metal concentrations were ascertained using inductively couple plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Moreover, the concentration of levoglucosan was determined using the Anthrone-Sulfuric Colorimetric method. The results show that the dominant gas from the emission of burning peat soil was CO (13850-20610 mu g/m(3)) followed by NO2 (608- 831 mu g/m(3)), SO2 (113-367 mu g/ m3) and O-3 (76-156 mu g/m(3)). A high PM10 concentration was released from 1 h peat soil combustion with a range of 778- 3444 mu g/m(3). The composition of heavy metals in PM10 shows the sequence of Zn > Al > Fe > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni > Cd. The sequence of anion and cation concentrations in PM10 was NO3- > SO42- > Na+ > Cl- > Ca2+ > K+ > F- > Mg2+. Levoglucosan was found to be a good indicator for peat combustion at a range of 1.44-3.90 mu mol/m(3). This research shows that the emission of peat soil fires produces various amounts of air pollutants that affect the environment and chemical reactions in the atmosphere.

AB Around 800 AD the peatlands around Amstelland were drained by two rivers. The 'northern' Amstel discharged surplus water directly into Lake Almere, which from the 12th century onwards was enlarged to form the Sudersee (in Dutch: Zuiderzee). The 'southern' Amstel was a near-abandoned westernmost arm of the River Vecht discharging the poorly drained borderland around the river Vecht into Lake Almere/the Sudersee. As part of the reclamation of peatlands associated with agricultural activities between the end of the 10th and the mid-13th centuries, the rivers were connected via a canal, thus creating the river Amstel, as it is known today.

ID LANDER
AB Peatland conservation is a political issue which has recently gained considerable political attention at the German state level due to Germany's climate policy objectives. The study analyses which objectives the five federal states where peatlands play an important role - Bavaria, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein - pursue with regard to moor protection and, using party-political and functionalist approaches, explains how differences in political and technical protection objectives can be explained. Based on document analyses and expert interviews, it is shown that all states currently attach great importance to moor protection, especially due to its relevance for climate protection. While the political differences can be explained mainly by the participation of the Bundnis 90/Grune party in state governments, it is shown that current moor protection policies, for which paludicultures are of major importance, are hampered by cooperative federalism. Hence, a considerable gap exists between the claims and reality regarding moor protection. Nevertheless, current discussions about the new CAP funding period offer an opportunity structure to enable more effective peatland conservation at state level in the future.

AB To date there is still a lack of reliable data on greenhouse gas emissions from drained fens needed to determine the climatic relevance of land use and land use change on peatlands and to supply the National Inventory Report for the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In this study we present the results of monthly-based multiyear measurements of CO2, N2O and CH4 flux rates in two drained agriculturally used fen ecosystems in NW Germany (cropland and grassland) over a period of 4.5 y using transparent and opaque closed chambers. CO2 exchange was modelled at high resolution with temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The measured and modelled values fit very well (R-2 >= 0.93). Annual GHG and Global Warming Potential (GWP) balances were determined. Net CO2 emissions at the cropland and grassland sites were similarly high, taking into account changes in management; net ecosystem C balance amounted to about 4.0 to 5.0 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). Emissions of N2O and CH4 were low at both sites. The mean GWP balance for a time frame of 100 y (GWP100) amounted to about 17.0 to 19.0 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) y(-1). The unexpectedly low greenhouse gas emissions from the cropland site are attributed to the high water table and a change in crop management. The change from corn for silage to corn-cob mix lead transiently to rather small greenhouse gas emissions. The study confirms the need for multiyear measurements taking climatic and management variation into account.

AB Drained agricultural peat soils are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) but also small sinks for methane (CH4). Leaving these soils without any cultivation practice could be an option to mitigate GHG emissions. To test this hypothesis, we measured, over a three year period, net CO2 exchange and fluxes of CH4 for five agricultural peat soils that had been abandoned for 20-30 years. Annually, the sites were either small net sinks or sources of CO2 and CH4 (-7.8 to 530 g CO2-C m(-2) and -0.41 to 1.8 g CH4 m(-2)). Including N2O emissions from our previous study, the net (CH4 + CO2 + N2O) emissions as CO2 equivalents were lower than in cultivated peat soils and were lowest in the wet year. Therefore, high GHG emissions from these soils could be avoided if the water table is maintained close to the soil surface when photosynthesis is favoured over respiration.

AB Human-induced groundwaterlevellowering in the Holocenecoastal-deltaic plain of the Netherlands causes oxidation of peat organic matter, resulting in land subsidence and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the distribution of the remaining peat organic matter is presented, to quantify the potential of this area to further subsidence and CO2 emissions by oxidation. Hereto, we established relations between dry mass ratios of organic matter and sediment in peat formed in different environmental settings. This was combined with a high-resolution 3D geological model of the subsurface of the Netherlands to map the proportions of organic matter, clastic sediment and void space in peat.
   The 3D model indicates that c. 15 km(3) of Holocene peat is embedded in the coastal-deltaic plain subsurface, of which c. 1.5 km(3) consists of organic matter, 0.4 km(3) of sediment, and 13.1 km(3) of void space. During future human-induced oxidation, this peat has a volumetric loss potential of 14.6 km(3), responsible for locally 0.4-6.0 m of subsidence, and a CO2 emission of 2.0 Gton.
   The 3D modelling revealed that the amount of peat organic matter varies considerably between regions. Especially the subsurface of urban areas overlying back-barrier peat were identified as hot-spots accommodating the highest quantities of peat organic matter. The peat in agricultural areas contains less organic matter but is more prone to oxidation than peat underlying urban areas, because in the latter settings anthropogenic brought-up soil restricts oxidation. Future mitigation strategies should therefore focus on restricting peat oxidation in the agricultural areas of the coastal-deltaic plain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paludiculture, the cultivation of crops on wet or rewetted agricultural peatlands, sustainably integrates productive land use with the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Paludiculture crops thrive under waterlogged conditions that stimulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from soil and water and convert serious drainage-induced carbon (C) losses to C sequestration. Nutrient uptake by paludicrops can prevent mobilisation after rewetting and provide opportunities for purification of nutrient-rich water. Uncertainty remains, however, if and to what extent N loading and a subsequent increase in biomass productivity affect nutrient cycling as well as emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, we use mesocosms with rewetted peat to investigate the effect of different N sources in surface water on biomass production of Typha latifolia, a typical paludiculture crop, and the emissions of CH4 and N2O. Organic (Azolla filiculoides; urea) or mineral (KNO3 ; NH4NO) N was supplied either a single time (steady state) or repeatedly (pulse) to simulate a total surface water load of 150 kg N ha(-1) . We found that N stimulated aboveground and belowground biomass production and nutrient uptake by T. latifolia. These effects were absent in Azolla treatments. Whereas after two months CH4 emissions arose to substantial amounts (> 10 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in unvegetated mesocosms loaded with organic N, they remained very low (< 1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in vegetated mesocosms, despite the labile C pool in the extensive belowground biomass and organic N loading. Overall, N2O emissions were close to zero and were only detected episodically after NO(3)(- )loading, irrespective of plant presence. Our findings support that T. latifolia as a paludicrop effectively removes various forms of N and P when harvested, and strongly mitigates CH4 emission after the rewetting of agricultural peat soils compared to unvegetated conditions.

AB The CO2 released in soil respiration is formed from organic matter which differs in age and stability, ranging from soluble root exudates to more persistent plant remains. The contribution of roots, a relatively fast component of soil cycling, was studied in three experiments. (1) Willows were grown in a greenhouse and CO2 fluxes from the substrate soil (milled peat) and from control peat were measured. (2) CO2 fluxes from various peatland sites were measured at control points and points where the roots were severed from the plants. (3) CO2 fluxes in cultivated grassland established on peatland were measured in grassy subsites and in subsites where the growth of grass was prevented by regular tilling. The root-derived respiration followed the typical annual phenology of the vegetation, being at its maximum in the middle and late summer. All the experiments gave similar results, root-derived respiration accounting for 35-45% of total soil respiration in the middle and late summer at sites with an abundant vegetation. The root-derived respiration from the virgin peatland sites correlated well with the tree biomass, and also partly with the understorey vegetation, but in the drained sites the root effect was greater, even in the presence of less understorey vegetation than at virgin subsites.

AB Organic peat soils have been extensively drained and used for agricultural, horticultural and energy purposes. The management practices of organic soils accelerate decomposition processes resulting generally in loss of carbon. Microbes are the key players in soil carbon cycling. We studied the effects of cultivation of a perennial bioenergy plant (reed canary grass, Phalanx arundinacea) on microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration and microbial communities in an old, previously uncultivated peat soil. The cultivation increased the amount of microbial biomass carbon and microbial respiration in peat mostly in the uppermost 5 cm layer where the impacts of roots and litter are most pronounced. As shown by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the abundance of fungi and gram-negative bacteria increased with cultivation, while the abundance of gram-positive bacteria decreased. The implications of these changes on carbon cycling and carbon storage in peat under reed canary grass are discussed.

AB Liming is a common management practice used to achieve optimum pH for plant growth in agricultural soils. Addition of lime to the soil, however, may Cause CO2 release when the carbonates in lime dissolve in water. Although lime may thereby constitute a significant carbon source, especially under acidic soil conditions, experimental data on the CO2 release are lacking so far. We conducted a split-plot experiment within a cut-away peatland cultivated with a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L) with lime and fertilizer treatments to determine effects of lime on the CO2 emissions from soil and to better understand mechanisms underlying liming effects. Carbon dioxide release was measured over two growing seasons in the field after liming, and complementary laboratory studies were conducted. To differentiate CO2 derived from lime and biotic respiration the delta C-13 of CO2 released was determined and the two-pool mixing model was applied. The results showed that lime may contribute significantly to CO2 release from the soil. In the laboratory, more than 50% of CO2 release was attributable to lime-carbonates during short-term incubation. Lime-derived CO2 emissions were much lower in the field, and were only detected during the first (2-4) months after the application. However, a maximum of 12% of monthly CO2 emissions from the cultivated peatland originated from the lime. Biotic respiration rates were similar in limed and unlimed soils, suggesting that higher pH did not, at least in the short-term, increase carbon losses from cultivated peat soils. Additional fertilization and acidification did not contribute to further CO2 release from the lime. According to our first estimations about one sixth of the lime applied would be released as CO2 from the managed peatland, with all lime-derived emissions occurring during the first year of application (equivalent to about 4.6% of the total annual CO2 losses from the soil in the first year). This suggests that the mass-balance approach as proposed by the IPCC Tier 1 methodology, which assumes that all carbon in lime ends up as CO2 in the atmosphere, overestimates the emissions from lime. Our study further shows that there is a great risk to overestimate heterotrophic microbial activity in limed soils by measuring the CO2 release without separating abiotic and biotic CO2 production.

AB Peatlands export significant amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to freshwaters, but the quantity of DOC reaching marine environments is typically less than the input to the fluvial system due to processing within the water column. Key removal processes include photo-chemical degradation, and heterotrophic bacterial respiration. In this study we examined these processes using C-14-labelled DOC to quantify the extent of DOC breakdown and to determine its fate following irradiation under controlled laboratory conditions. We examined the influence of microbial processes occurring within the water column, the potential role of stream-bed biofilms, and the possible modifying effects of downstream mixing, as DOC in water from the peatland encounters runoff from upland mineral soils ("Mountain"), nutrient-rich runoff from agricultural soils, and seawater in an estuary. Our results demonstrated conservative mixing of DOC from Peatland and Mountain waters but interactive effects when Peatland water was mixed with Agricultural and Estuary waters and exposed to solar radiation. The mixing of Peatland and Agricultural waters led to net DOC production, suggesting that DOC was only partially degraded by solar radiation and that the products of this might have fuelled autotrophic microbial growth in the samples. The mixing of Peatland water with saline estuary water resulted in net DOC loss following irradiation, suggesting a role for sunlight in enhancing the flocculation of DOC to particulate organic carbon (POC) in saline environments.

AB Over the past two decades, great efforts have been made to restore coastal wetlands through the removal of dikes, but challenges remain because the effects of flooding with saline water on water quality are unknown. We collected soil samples from two adjacent coastal fen peatlands, one drained and diked, the other open to the sea and rewetted, aiming at assessing the mobility and export of various compounds. Microcosm experiments with constant flow-through conditions were conducted to determine the effluent concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium (NH4+), and phosphate (PO43-) during saline-fresh water cycles. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was used to adjust salinity (saline water, NaCl concentration of 0.12 mol L-1; fresh water, NaCl concentration of 0.008 mol L-1) and served as a tracer. A model analysis of the obtained chloride (Cl-) and sodium (Na+) breakthrough curves indicated that peat soils have a dual porosity structure. Sodium was retarded in peat soils with a retardation factor of 1.4 +/- 0.2 due to adsorption. The leaching tests revealed that water salinity has a large impact on DOC, NH4+, and PO43- release. The concentrations of DOC in the effluent decreased with increasing water salinity because the combination of high ionic strength (NaCl concentration of 0.12 mol L-1) and low pH (3.5 to 4.5) caused a solubility reduction. On the contrary, saline water enhanced NH4+ release through cation exchange processes. The PO43- concentrations, however, decreased in the effluent with increasing water salinity. Overall, the decommissioning of dikes at coastal wetlands and the flooding of once drained and agriculturally used sites increase the risk that especially nitrogen may be leached at higher rates to the sea.

AB This paper describes the impact of drainage and grassland use on selected soil parameters (e.g. organic carbon content, bulk density) of typical fen soils in Northeast Germany and, hence, their influence on grassland productivity. A broad investigation of site conditions has been realized at 23 grassland fields concerning soil properties, vegetation attributes and groundwater dynamics. Collectively selected fields represent characteristic types of grassland management and stages of moorsh-forming process. Concerning the entire sample, site conditions of agriculturally used peatlands vary strongly. Based on that complex data-set, the importance of defined potential impact factors on grassland production is tested and expressed in a linear regression model. Annual yield of the 2011 growing season, as a quantitative parameter of grassland productivity, does not indicate any correlation to site-specific conditions or cultivation strategy. In contrast, energy content as a qualitative measure varies strongly in relation to defined environmental parameters. Model performance is indicated with an adjusted R-square of 0.89 while the main impact factors are annual use frequency, mean summer water table (MSWT), maximum groundwater drawdown (GWmax), and organic carbon content (Corg).

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (E-N2O) from drained peat soils used for pastoral agriculture have not been measured throughout the year in New Zealand. In response to this research gap, E-N2O was measured fortnightly for 1 year in the Waikato region in a plot that was not grazed or nitrogen (N) fertilised. The time series was variable, the frequency distribution skewed and the fortnightly means correlated. To account for these factors, the data were log(e) transformed and an order 2 autoregressive model used to estimate a mean E-N2O of 4.3gNha(-1)d(-1) and 95% confidence limits of 0.6-29.1gNha(-1)d(-1). There was a statistically significant, inverse relationship between E-N2O and the depth to groundwater. In winter, when rainfall totalled 393mm, E-N2O and soil N content were significantly greater under a rain shelter designed to minimise N loss by leaching, than in an uncovered plot.

AB Assessment of land use related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on larger spatial scales is usually achieved by modelling. Surface flux measurements are expensive and measurement locations too widely scattered to serve as spatially reliable flux estimates. Here we assess CO2 and CH4 fluxes from wetland nature reserves in the Dutch province of Drenthe, using the PEATLAND-VU model. Since surface flux observations in the province are absent and cannot be obtained in a short (<1 year) time frame, we extrapolated model validation from elsewhere to the research area. In this way a cost-effective methodology is developed for landuse-related greenhouse gas emission assessments, which can be applied by local governments at a subnational scale.
   Nature development and restoration in the Netherlands involves usually the restoration of high water tables in former agricultural areas and extensivation or abandonment of agricultural activities. Wet peat soils are known to emit considerable quantities of CH4, while drained agricultural soils emit CO2 from decomposition of the soil organic matter. Therefore, these landuse changes may affect GHG emissions and an assessment of their effects is useful for environmental policy.
   The PEATLAND-VU Model was used to simulate the CH4 and CO2 emissions for the years 2005-2007 and for May/June 2008. Previous field validation of the model elsewhere was checked for local validity with CH4 and CO2 flux measurements in short field campaigns in May/June 2008, at two locations, Visvliet and Balloerveld. These sites represent respectively eutrophic and oligotrophic peat and peaty soils, and showed large differences in fluxes. These flux differences were simulated correctly by the model by adapting the vegetation net primary production and methane oxidation parameters. Next, model simulations were run for eight combinations of vegetation and soil type. Using the simulated fluxes and the areal extent of the soil combinations, a GIS-based upscaling over all nature reserves was made.
   This study shows that river valley floors with mesotrophic and eutrophic peat soils dominate the greenhouse fluxes of the area. CH4 fluxes are high in wet terrain, while the CO2 fluxes are high when water table is lower. The fluxes from oligotrophic peat soils are comparatively low. Nature development can contribute to a decrease of the total greenhouse gas flux from peat soils and to conservation of soil organic matter.

AB Global changes in climate and land use are occurring at an unprecedented rate, often triggering drastic shifts in plant communities. This study aims to reconstruct the changes that occurred over 35 years in the plant communities of temperate bogs subjected to indirect human-induced disturbances. In 2015-17, we resurveyed the vascular flora of 76 plots located in 16 bogs of southern Quebec (Canada) first sampled in 1982. We evaluated changes in species richness, frequency of occurrence and abundance, while considering species shade-tolerance and preferential habitat. We calculated beta diversity as between-site similarities in composition, and evaluated differences between the two surveys using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. We found a significant increase in species richness and beta diversity over the last 35 years associated with major species turnovers, indicating a biotic differentiation of the Sphagnum-bog plant communities. These changes were mostly associated with an increase in the abundance and frequency of shade-tolerant and facultative species, suggesting a global phenomenon of woody encroachment. Because the observed changes occurred in a few decades on sites free of in situ human disturbances, we suggest that they were likely induced by the synergic effect of the agricultural drainage occurring in the surrounding mineral soils, climate warming, and nitrogen atmospheric depositions. We also believe that further changes are to be expected, as the triggering factors persist. Finally, our results highlight the need for increased bog conservation or restauration efforts. Indeed, a rise in beta diversity due to the introduction of nearby terrestrial species could induce biotic homogenization of the bog flora with that of surrounding habitats and ultimately impoverish the regional species pool.

AB The dramatic increase of peat use for agricultural purposes and the consequent depletion of peatlands has resulted in an increasing environmental concern about peat extraction and in a continuous search for sustainable substitutes. In order to find an efficient alternative to peat as substrate component for horticultural industry, a study was accomplished to assess the influence on Lavandula angustifolia Miller potted plants grown in a peat-based substrate amended with increasing amount of conifer wood biochar: 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % (by volume). Higher values of plant height, leaf area, leaves and flowers production were recorded in potted lavenders grown in substrates with a biochar content ranging from 25 % to 75 %; at a visual-quality evaluation no significant differences were observed among substrates on the general aesthetic effect of the plants. The aforesaid five different substrates tested did not significantly affect the leaf dry weight and the root-to-shoot ratio. The biochar amendment of peat-based substrates, even at high rates (75 % or 100 %), did not influence lavender essential oil (EO) quality, its chemical profile and antioxidant activity. The radical scavenging activities of EO and hydro-distilled wastewaters were also detected. Main results from our study seem to suggest that a conifers wood biochar may be efficiently used as substrate alternative to peat to grow Lavandula angustifolia plants for EO production.

In order to quantify the climatic impact of fen soils in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a) rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b) intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c) intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d) arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N2O fluxes showed a significant relation to the amount of nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2-year mean GWP, combined from CO2-C eq. of NEE, CH4 and N2O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3.8, 11.7, 17.7 and 17.3MgCO(2)-C eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.6). Yield-related emissions for the three agricultural sites were 201, 248 and 269 kgCO(2)-C eq. (GJ net energy lactation; NEL) 1 for sites GW, GM and AR, respectively (SE 17, 9, 19). The carbon footprint of agricultural commodities grown on fen soils depended on longterm drainage intensity rather than type of management, but management and climate strongly influenced interannual onsite variability. However, arable forage production revealed a high uncertainty of yield and therefore was an unsuitable land use option. Lowest yield-related GHG emissions were achieved by a three-cut system of productive grassland swards in combination with a high GWL (long-term mean <= 20 cm below the surface).

TI Instruments for climate-friendly peatland use: Peatland protection in
   the Common Agricultural Policy
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB Agriculturally used peatlands play an important role in climate protection. This publication compiles and analyses the experiences and findings of experts, i. e. employees from ministries and administrations of the federal states, on the existing German and European funding programmes and presents recommendations for the future design of funding measures for agricultural peatland protection. Raising water levels to the ground surface remains the most effective way to reduce emissions. This would require farm conversions, divided into three steps (Preparation, area-related, utilisation & product-related) as well as accompanying measures. Successful examples mostly derive from nature conservation-focused rewetting coinciding with the abandonment of land use. The potential for climate protection through rewetting with continued use is primarily impeded by the current lack of eligibility for paludiculture subsidies, lack of prospects for utilisation and economic viability, short funding periods and water scarcities. The implementation of comprehensive instruments is necessary to fully exploit the climate protection potential of organic soils. Long-term support programmes must be developed specifically aimed at organic soil protection and address all three steps with suitable, coordinated instruments. Farmers must be accompanied in every step of conversion, be fully rewarded, and recognised for their contribution to climate protection.

TI The Impact of Map and Data Resolution on the Determination of the
   Agricultural Utilisation of Organic Soils in Germany
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Peatland; Agriculture; Modifiable areal unit problem; Land use intensity
AB Due to its nature, agricultural land use depends on local site characteristics such as production potential, costs and external effects. To assess the relevance of the modifying areal unit problem (MAUP), we investigated as to how a change in the data resolution regarding both soil and land use data influences the results obtained for different land use indicators. For the assessment we use the example of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculturally used organic soils (mainly fens and bogs). Although less than 5 % of the German agricultural area in use is located on organic soils, the drainage of these areas to enable their agricultural utilization causes roughly 37 % of the GHG emissions of the German agricultural sector. The abandonment of the cultivation and rewetting of organic soils would be an effective policy to reduce national GHG emissions. To assess the abatement costs, it is essential to know which commodities, and at what quantities, are actually produced on this land. Furthermore, in order to limit windfall profits, information on the differences of the profitability among farms are needed. However, high-resolution data regarding land use and soil characteristics are often not available, and their generation is costly or the access is strictly limited because of legal constraints. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse how indicators for land use on organic soils respond to changes in the spatial aggregation of the data. In Germany, organic soils are predominantly used for forage cropping. Marked differences between the various regions of Germany are apparent with respect to the dynamics and the intensity of land use. Data resolution mainly impairs the derived extent of agriculturally used peatland and the observed intensity gradient, while its impact on the average value for the investigated set of land-use indicators is generally minor.

AB Subsidence, erosion, and degradation in agricultural peatlands are leading to the disappearance of highly fertile farmland. This study investigated two strategies aimed at extending the lifespan of cultivated peat soils: the application of straw and wood chips to compensate for soil losses and the application of copper (Cu) to slow peat decomposition, based on previous recommendations. Peat soil samples (270 g) were amended with 11 t ha(-1) of biomass materials (14.8 g kg(-1)) and 235.6 mg Cu kg(-1) and incubated in glass jars at constant temperature and water content. Thirty chemical parameters were then monitored over a 56-d period through repeated soil sampling. Discriminant analysis showed that the addition of biomass had the greatest affect on nitrogen (N) availability, immobilizing 7.8 to 12.1 kg of inorganic N per metric ton of incorporated biomass. Considering that peat soils may require from 4 to 40 t biomass ha(-1) yr(-1) to reach carbon equilibrium, the tested biomass materials could immobilize from 34 to 500 kg ha(-1) of N if confirmed at the field scale. This may help capture excess N but may also limit crop growth. Alternatively, slowing decomposition could reduce both biomass requirements and N immobilization. However, the results show that Cu had little effect on parameters linked to organic matter decomposition. Indeed, dissolved organic carbon was decreased by 11% in Cu-treated soils. A longer-term study should be conducted to confirm these observations at the field scale, thus helping to develop conservation strategies suitable for agricultural production.

AB In the central part of the Netherlands, wetland restoration projects involve the rewetting of former agricultural land, where low water levels were artificially maintained (polders). Many of these projects do not result in the expected reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus availability and subsequent re-establishment of a diverse wetland vegetation. The aim of the present study was to investigate which mechanisms are responsible for this lack of success. Thereto, we studied the effect of rewetting of former agricultural grasslands on acidified peat soil (pH = 3.5) on organic matter decomposition, nitrogen cycling and phosphorus availability in the soil for three seasons. To provide an explanation for the observed effects, We Simultaneously studied a set of potentially controlling abiotic soil conditions that were expected to change after rewetting. It was found that rewetting of these grasslands with natural, unpolluted seepage water did not affect nitrogen cycling, but raised decomposition rates and almost doubled phosphorus availability. The main cause of these effects is a raise of soil pH to about 7 due to the hydrochemical composition of the soil pore water after rewetting, which reflects groundwater with high amounts of buffering ions. This effect overruled any reduction in process rates by the lowered soil redox potential. The counterintuitive finding of eutrophication after rewetting with natural and unpolluted water is considered to represent a new form of internal eutrophication, triggered by the restoration of natural site conditions of former agricultural land on acid peat soil.

AB Northern landscapes accumulate carbon in vegetation and soils while rivers transport significant amounts of land-derived carbon to coastal areas. Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990-2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway's four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 +/- A 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m(-2)) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m(-2) year(-1)): tree biomass (40 +/- A 3) > peatlands (19 +/- A 15) > forest soils (9 +/- A 1) a parts per thousand << lakes (2 +/- A 1) > mountains (0.5 +/- A 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (-36 +/- A 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 +/- A 0.1 Tg C year(-1) (3.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and lowest (1.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.

AB Drainage and cultivation have turned peatlands from carbon (C) sinks into hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Raising the water table and planting of winter cover crops are potential strategies to help reduce peat oxidation and re-initiate net C accumulation during the non-cropping period. However, the effects of these practices as well as their interactions on GHG emissions remain unclear. Here, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to elucidate the effect of water table levels (-30 cm and -50 cm) and winter cover crop cultivation (vetch, rye, no plant) on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the winter period (November-April). Soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentrations within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations were monitored. Our results showed that high water table significantly reduced ecosystem respiration, while it had no net effect on N2O and CH4 fluxes. Uptake of available N by the cover crop significantly reduced nitrate in soil solution, thereby lowering the potential for leaching and both direct and indirect N2O emissions. No interactive effects between water table levels and cover crops were detected for any of the measured GHG fluxes. Seasonal variations of GHG fluxes were positively correlated with soil air concentrations at -15 cm and -40 cm depths, which were further regulated by dissolved organic C, nitrate concentration, and anaerobic conditions in the soil. This study suggests that there is great potential to raise water table levels and introduce green cover crops to reduce GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to achieve a complete evaluation of these strategies outside of the growing season, which may provide a significant mitigation benefit in C-rich cultivated peatlands.

AB In Poland, Salix myrsinifolia Salisb. reaches the south-western border of the dense geographical range. Therefore, the number of natural stands of this species is limited. The aims of this study were: to evaluate the content of phenolic glycosides in dark-leaved willow bark taken from natural sites, and to investigate the habitat conditions and natural resources of this species in mid-eastern Poland. In the sites of S. myrsinifolia the annual shoots were taken, and the content of phenolic glycosides in willow bark was determined. The plant communities with the share of this species were characterised, and pH, organic matter, macro- and microelements in soils were determined. The bark of the dark-leaved willow is characterised by a very high content of phenolic glycosides and is considered to be potential natural source of salicylates. The plant communities with share of this species were formed spontaneously on highly transformed calcareous fens where peat was mined and on agriculturally developed peatlands. The number of natural stands is small, and gather from natural habitats is limited. Therefore, this species can be a good source of quality raw material during cultivating.

TI MODES OF OCCURRENCE OF RARE EARTH ELEMENTS IN PEATS OF WEST SIBERIA

DE Peat; West Siberia; rare earth elements; modes of occurrence; conditions

AB The relevance of the study is determined by the necessity to distinguish the origin and to develop the models for accumulation of rare earth elements in peats and coals for forecasting and detecting rare metal mineralization in coalfields. The relevance is caused as well by the necessity of obtaining comprehensive information owing to peat integrated use in agricultural industry.
   The aim of the research is to study the modes of occurrence and to assess the balance of rare earth elements modes of occurrence in peats of Western Siberia; to estimate the role of organic and mineral matter in accumulation of rare earth elements in high-bog and low moor peats, and on this ground to define the nature of lanthanides accumulation in peats.
   Research methods: peat division into group components by the lnstorf method: bitums, water-soluble and hydrolyzable substances, humic and fulvic acids, non-hydrolyzable residue; investigation of rare earth elements content using neutron-activation analysis; REE balance calculation for fractions of group composition; scanning electronic microscopy using a Hitachi S-3400N microscope with energy dispersive spectrometer Bruker XFlash 4010 for studying mineral forms.
   Results. The authors have singled out and studied the group components of peats. It was ascertained that the main mass of the REE in peats is related to the fraction hydrolyzable and water-soluble substances and organic matter. From 40 till 80 % of total content of REE in peat is accounted for the fraction of hydrolyzable and water-soluble substances. 10-30 % of the amount of REE is concentrated in humic acids. Mineral matter in peats plays a minor role in accumulation of lanthanides. In general, not more than 25 % is accounted for mineral substance in the rare earth elements balance in peats. Among the mineral forms of REE in peats phosphates (monazite, xenotime, crandallite) and zircon are dominated. The division of lanthanides in fractions of group compound of peat is noticed. The fraction of water-soluble and hydrolyzable substances is relatively enriched with light rare earths, and humic substances are enriched with heavy rare earths.

AB Detailed, accurate information on soil temperature is crucial for understanding processes leading to solute leaching and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from managed peat soils, but few studies have attempted to study these processes in detail. Drained peat soils have different characteristics from pristine peat. Cultivated peat soils, in particular, have high mineral matter content in the plough layer, due to mineralisation of peat and, sometimes, addition of mineral material. This study examined the effect of mineral matter content on thermal conductivity (lambda) in partially frozen and unfrozen peat samples. Effect of change in temperature from -3 degrees C to - 10 degrees C on thermal conductivity was also estimated. Three existing models for estimating the thermal conductivity of organic soils were assessed for their suitability for cultivated drained peat soils. The thermal conductivity of peat samples with three different levels of mineral matter content was determined, using the single probe method, in the saturated state and when subjected to at least two different matric potentials at five different temperatures ( + 10 degrees C, + 1 degrees C, - 3 degrees C, - 5 degrees C and -10 degrees C). The results showed that X values differed between peat soils depending on mineral matter content, ice content and moisture content. The samples with the highest mineral matter content and bulk density had higher thermal conductivity at positive temperatures and to a lesser extent, at freezing temperatures, when volumetric water content and volume of water-free pores was similar. Most soil samples, especially those with no added mineral soil, were not fully frozen at - 3 degrees C and - 5 degrees C, but this had minor effect on thermal conductivity compared with values measured at -10 degrees C. The Brovka-Rovdan model proved reasonably good at predicting frozen thermal conductivity in sand-enriched peat soils, while the de Vries model proved best at estimating thermal conductivity for unfrozen peat samples. We provide a first estimate of the thermal conductivity of (partially) frozen cultivated peat measured using undisturbed samples. These results can be used to parameterise numerical heat transport models for simulating soil processes and GHG emissions.

AB The paper aims to assess the land use changes and the dynamics of the landscape pattern of the Grojec Valley in the scope of diverse anthropogenic impacts. The study site is located in the border of the Koto Basin and Kujawy Lakeland, Central Poland. This area was originally covered with wetlands. Since the beginning of the 20th century it has been influenced by intensive agricultural use, peat extraction and open-pit mining. The research is based on cartographic materials from 1941, 1981 and 2012. The most relevant finding was that in the first study period (1941-1981) the most common changes in land use (transformation of wetlands into grasslands with shrubs) took place. These were caused mainly by a change in hydrological conditions due to drainage for agricultural use (meadows and pastures) and peat extraction. The study confirmed that these land use changes significantly influenced the landscape structure in each of the analysed parameters (patch density and size, edge, shape and diversity metrics).

AB Peat moss and miscanthus were hydrothermally carbonized (HTC) either individually or co-processed in a different ratio to produce hydrochar. The hydrochar and pelletized hydrochar were then characterized to determine if hydrochar can be used as an alternative to coal to produce bioenergy from existing coal-fired power plants in Ontario that have already been shut down. The properties of carbonized biomass (either hydrochar or pellets) reveal that fuel grade hydrochar can be produced from peat moss or from the blend of peat moss and miscanthus (agricultural biomass/energy crops). Hydrochar either produced from peat moss or from the blend of peat moss and miscanthus was observed to be hydrophobic and porous compared to raw peat moss or raw miscanthus. The combustion indices of carbonized biomass confirmed that it can be combusted or co-combusted to produce bioenergy and can avoid slagging, fouling, and agglomeration problems of the bioenergy industry. The results of this study revealed that HTC is a promising option for producing solid biofuel from undervalued biomass, especially from high moisture biomass. Co-processing of peat moss with rural biomass, a relatively novel idea which can be a potential solution to heat and power for the rural communities/agri-industry that are not connected with national grids and alleviate their waste management problems. In addition, the hydrochar can also be used to run some of the existing coal-fired power plants that have already been shut down in Ontario without interrupting investment and employment.

AB The restoration of peatlands is an important strategy to counteract subsidence and loss of biodiversity. However, responses of important microbial soil processes are poorly understood. We assessed functioning, diversity and spatial organization of methanotrophic communities in drained and rewetted peat meadows with different water table management and agricultural practice. Results show that the methanotrophic diversity was similar between drained and rewetted sites with a remarkable dominance of the genus Methylocystis. Enzyme kinetics depicted no major differences, indicating flexibility in the methane (CH4) concentrations that can be used by the methanotrophic community. Short-term flooding led to temporary elevated CH4 emission but to neither major changes in abundances of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) nor major changes in CH4 consumption kinetics in drained agriculturally used peat meadows. Radiolabeling and autoradiographic imaging of intact soil cores revealed a markedly different spatial arrangement of the CH4 consuming zone in cores exposed to near-atmospheric and elevated CH4. The observed spatial patterns of CH4 consumption in drained peat meadows with and without short-term flooding highlighted the spatial complexity and responsiveness of the CH4 consuming zone upon environmental change. The methanotrophic microbial community is not generally altered and harbors MOB that can cover a large range of CH4 concentrations offered due to water-table fluctuations, effectively mitigating CH4 emissions.

AB Intensive cultivation of fen peat soils (Eutric Histosols) for agricultural purposes, started in Europe about 250 years ago, resulting in decreased soil fertility, increased oxidation of peat and corresponding CO2-emissions to the atmosphere, nutrient transfer to aquatic ecosystems and losses in the total area of the former native wetlands. To prevent these negative environmental effects set-aside programs and rewetting measures were promoted in recent years. Literature results and practical experiences showed that large scale rewetting of intensively used agricultural Histosols may result in the mobilisation of phosphorus (P), its transport to adjacent surface waters and an accelerated eutrophication risk. The paper summarises results from an international European Community sponsored research project and demonstrates how results obtained at different scales and from different scientific disciplines were compiled to derive a strategy to carry out rewetting measures. A decision support system (DSS) for a hydrologically sensitive area in the Droemling catchment in north-eastern Germany was developed and is presented as a tool to regulate rewetting in order to control P release. It is demonstrated that additional laboratory experiments to identify essential processes of P release during rewetting and the site-specific management of the water table, the involvement of specific knowledge and experience of the stakeholders are necessary to develop an applicable DSS. The presented DSS is practically used to prevent freshwater resources from diffuse P pollution.

Ground-dwelling spiders were surveyed in 24 sites across Ireland, with eight sites of each of the following habitat types: improved grassland, wet grassland and peatland. The spiders were sampled using pitfall traps which were located within the major vegetation types present in each site as well as within supplementary habitat features which may add to biodiversity value of the whole site such as hedgerows, flushes and the edges of ditches and streams.
   Each habitat supported distinct spider assemblages that reflect major differences in both environmental conditions and management regime. The improved grasslands had low spider species richness and low variation in assemblage structure which is probably related to the intensive management of this habitat. In this case hedgerows maybe an important aspect of the spider diversity within agricultural landscapes. The peatlands, and to a lesser extent wet grasslands, supported a diverse and specialist spider fauna, including a number of rare species; this may be due to differences in soil moisture and plant architecture. Indicators of biodiversity value identified included wet flushes in the peatlands and low grazing pressure in the wet grasslands. This study suggests that in terms of biodiversity value improved grassland is the preferable habitat for afforestation, because of the poor baseline spider diversity. However, it may be unrealistic to expect land owners to afforest their most productive agricultural land, so the management and habitat indicators identified in this study may be of use for assessing habitat quality among the wet grassland and peatlands to allow sites with lower biodiversity value to be identified.

AB Twenty-four years of soil cultivation resulted in the following wastes of organic matter: 104 t/ha for permanent herbs; 159 t/ha for cereal crops; 168 t/ha for intertilled crops; 131 t/ha for crop rotation; and 110 t/ha for virgin lands. The depth of the pear deposit was reduced by 16.8, 29.5, 31.7, 29.1, and 17.9 cm, respectively. Wastes of soil organic matter were reduced together with the depth of pear under the herbs and increased under the crops. The outstripping effect of drainage and cultivation affected peat water and physical properties. The ash content and compaction of peat were raised significantly, while its water-holding capacity decreased.

TI Filter for penetration resistance correction in cultivated and compacted

DT Article
AB The objective of this study was to design, using field data, a filter to correct the soil penetration resistance (PR) values by considering all the effects (penetration friction component [PFC], varying penetration rate, and shocks) that bias PR interpretation. The data used were collected in cultivated peatlands of Monteregie (Canada) known for their advanced state of compaction. Penetration resistance (standard measurements) and cone resistance (CR) measurements (successive measurements per 10-cm layer) were carried out on four peatlands (five stations per peatland). The filter components, a multi-resolution analysis (AMR), a polynomial model, and a quantification and removal of PFC were identified and were used to design the filter and tested by cross-validation. Our study showed that PFC exists (p value < 5%) and does not depend on the peatland on which the measurements are made. An average filter has therefore been designed for the entire site and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. An application to the data collected in 10 fields on the site made it possible to identify the main soil density profiles existing in Monteregie and to quantify the average PFC characterizing these soils. We noticed that, on average, PFC represents between 18.6 and 41% of the PR value. The combined results of the statistical and physical analyses of the filter made it possible to recommend degrees 2 (D2), 3 (D3), and 5 (D5) of the polynomial model to adjust density profiles of cultivated Histosols when there are no, one, or two compact layers.

AB Extreme summer droughts are expected to occur more often in the future in NW Europe due to climate change. These droughts might accelerate the rate of peat oxidation in drained peat areas, with impacts on soil subsidence, GHG emission and water quality. This study aimed at providing more insight in the oxidation of deep peat layers that had not previously been exposed to air, the so-called secondary decomposition.
   We incubated two types of peat (eutrophic and oligotrophic), sampled from permanently anoxic peat layers from nature reserves and agricultural peat meadows. Peat samples were incubated for thirteen weeks under anoxic conditions, but were exposed to air for one to eight weeks. The production of CO2 and CH4 was quantified as a proxy for decomposition; concentrations of soluble nutrients and phenolic compounds were also measured.
   The results showed that oxygenation led to a steep increase in the rate of decomposition, indicated by higher carbon loss rates during and after oxygenation compared to non-oxygenated samples. Carbon loss rates increased more for eutrophic peat (agricultural area: 352%, nature reserve: 182%) than for oligotrophic peat (83% and 159% respectively). Most peat samples investigated showed higher post-oxygenation CO2 and/or CH4 production compared to the anoxic pre-oxygenation period. This indicates that oxygenation stimulates decomposition, even after anoxic conditions have returned. Contrary to the enzymic latch theory, no effects of oxygenation on the concentrations of soluble or condensed phenolic compounds were detected. Soluble nutrient concentrations did not change due to oxygenation either. Noteworthy is the occurrence of pyrite mineralization and associated acidification in eutrophic peat. Thus, low summer water levels, for example due to climate change, should be avoided in order to limit exceptionally high decomposition rates and associated problems such as increasing subsidence rates, greenhouse gas emission, sulfate release and acidification.

AB Surface water and peat in the northern Everglades have very low natural concentrations of U and are therefore sensitive to the addition of small amounts of U from anthropogenic sources such as fertilizer. Feat samples collected along a nutrient gradient in the northern Everglades have unusually high concentrations of U (> 1 mu g/g, dry basis) and also have a distinctive U-234/U-238 activity ratio (AR). AR values for U-enriched pear fall in the narrow range of AR values for commercial phosphate fertilizer (1.00 +/- 0.05). In contrast,AR values for low-U peal from background sites exceed 1.05. The spatial distribution of anomalous U concentration, and of fertilizer-like AR values in peat, parallel a previously documented pattern of P enrichment. These results strongly suggest that some of the U in nutrient-impacted peatlands is fertilizer-derived. Agricultural drainage water sampled in the northern Everglades has high concentrations of dissolved U (0.3-2.4 mu g/l) compared to surface water from background sites (<0.1 mu g/l). Measured AR values in drainage water (0.949-0.990) are also permissive of a fertilizer origin for the U and are different from AR values in surface water or peat at background sites (AR > 1.05). Synoptic sampling of surface water along drainage canals indicate that Lake Okeechobee, and some drainage from agricultural fields, are sources of dissolved U, whereas wetlands farther downstream act as sinks for U, Historically cultivated agricultural soil has only a marginally elevated (+ 0.2 mu g/g) average concentration of U compared to nearby uncultivated soil and incorporates only 20% of the U from an aqueous solution that was slurried with the soil. In contrast, a Similar experiment with fresh Everglades pear indicated uptake of 90% of the added U, These experiments support the proposed removal of U from agricultural fields and concentration of U in downstream peatlands. The methodology of this study can be used to describe the behavior of fertilizer-derived U in other low-U environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB Soil subsidence of peatlands occurs worldwide due to drainage. The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), located in South Florida, has been drained for agriculture since 1914, with subsidence resulting in shallow soils in certain areas. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of water management strategies on soil oxidation and N release as affected by differences in proximity to the bedrock. Oxidation rates (CO2 efflux), as well as CH4 and N2O emissions, were measured in lysimeters filled with shallow and deep peat subjected to four water treatments. Additionally, NO3-N, NH4-N, soluble organic N, and dissolved organic C were measured in leachate obtained from the collected soils. Average annual emissions from constantly drained soils were 298 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1), with most of the oxidation taking place between June and October. Short flood cycles increased annual oxidation rates compared with constantly drained soils, which had the second highest oxidation rate. Constantly flooded soils had the lowest annual oxidation rates, followed by summer flooded soils. Total N lost in leachate was highest for constantly drained soils, with NO3 being the dominant form. The deep soils had higher losses of soluble N and C, whereas NO3 losses from shallow soils were higher. Soil oxidation rates did not differ depending on proximity to the bedrock. We conclude that strategies that avoid short flooding cycles and include crop rotations that allow flooding during summer can reduce oxidation and N losses in leachate from EAA peats.

ID HERBICIDES
AB Weed control poses a real challenge to agriculture in general, and to agriculture on drained peatlands in particular. An understanding of the interactions between clay minerals and organic molecules has yielded effective preparations of herbicide formulations. In most cases, binding the active ingredient to a suitable organoclay-based platform enhances activity by reducing migration of the herbicide to non-target depths, or by reducing degradation of the active ingredient. In this short communication, a formulation based on an organoclay and the herbicide acetochlor is compared with a commercial formulation. Efficiency was tested in two soils from the Hula Valley: a mineral, clay-based soil (with about 4 % organic matter) and a peat-derived soil with similar to 20 % organic matter. Although the soils were located only two kilometres apart, completely different herbicidal activity was observed. In the mineral soil, the organoclay formulation improved the behaviour of the herbicide and prevented its leaching; whereas in the peat-derived soil, the organoclay and commercial formulations behaved similarly, and were confined to the upper soil layer. In the latter case, the penetration depth of herbicide added in the organoclay formulation might be too shallow, resulting in poor herbicidal activity. The results of this study demonstrate differences that should be considered in weed control in drained peat soils.

AB Agricultural drainage of organic soils has resulted in vast soil subsidence and contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained over a century ago for agriculture and human settlement and has since experienced subsidence rates that are among the highest in the world. It is recognized that drained agriculture in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding may increase methane (CH4) emissions. We conducted a full year of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at two conventional drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture and a corn field) and three flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and two restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Delta. We found that the drained sites were net C and greenhouse gas (GHG) sources, releasing up to 341g Cm(-2)yr(-1) as CO2 and 11.4g Cm(-2)yr(-1) as CH4. Conversely, the restored wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2, sequestering up to 397g Cm(-2)yr(-1). However, they were large sources of CH4, with emissions ranging from 39 to 53g Cm(-2)yr(-1). In terms of the full GHG budget, the restored wetlands could be either GHG sources or sinks. Although the rice paddy was a small atmospheric CO2 sink, when considering harvest and CH4 emissions, it acted as both a C and GHG source. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the restored sites inhibited ecosystem respiration, making them net CO2 sinks. This study suggests that converting drained agricultural peat soils to flooded land-use types can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce GHG emissions.

AB Restoring degraded peat soils presents an attractive, but largely untested, climate change mitigation approach. Drained peat soils used for agriculture can be large greenhouse gas sources. By restoring subsided peat soils to managed, impounded wetlands, significant agricultural emissions are avoided, and soil carbon can be sequestered and protected. Here, we synthesize 36 site-years of continuous carbon dioxide and methane flux data from a mesonetwork of eddy covariance towers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA to compute carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for drained agricultural land uses and compare these to restored deltaic wetlands. We found that restored wetlands effectively sequestered carbon and halted soil carbon loss associated with drained agricultural land uses. Depending on the age and disturbance regime of the restored wetland, many land use conversions from agriculture to restored wetland resulted in emission reductions over a 100-year timescale. With a simple model of radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, we showed that restored wetlands do not begin to accrue greenhouse gas benefits until nearly a half century, and become net sinks from the atmosphere after a century. Due to substantial interannual variability and uncertainty about the multi-decadal successional trajectory of managed, restored wetlands, ongoing ecosystem flux measurements are critical for understanding the long-term impacts of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation.

AB This study was designed to show the effects of harvest time and frequency on biomass nutrient concentrations (total ash, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) as well as total nutrient removal potential by festulolium and tall fescue cultivated on a nutrient-rich fen peatland. The harvest managements included a three-cut (3C) and three two-cut (2C) systems which differed by two-week delays of first cut as: 2C-early, 2C-mid and 2C-late, representing phenological stages of pre-heading, inflorescence emergence, and flowering, respectively. In the study year, the grasses received 80-16-60kg N-P-K ha(-1) in spring and 80-0-100 kg N-P-K ha(-1) after each harvest (except final). Nutrient concentrations and total ash content in the biomass dropped sharply during spring-summer growth. Concentrations of Ca, Mg and Mn were significantly higher in tall fescue biomass during spring-summer growth, but for other nutrients, there were no consistent differences between the two grasses. Total ash in the biomass from 3C managements (1.1 Mg ha(-1)) was similar to 28% higher than in the biomass removed by 2C managements (0.8 Mg ha(-1)). Similarly, mean annual N removal by 3C (315 kg N ha(-1)) was 31% higher than by 2C (240 kg N ha(-1)) managements, but net removals (removed minus applied N) from both managements were similar (75-80 kg ha(-1)). Net P-removal by 3C (37 kg P ha(-1)) was higher than by 2C (26 kg P ha(-1)) managements, whereas total K removals in all managements were close to the applied K amount (i.e., net removals were close to zero). Whereas all crop/management combinations extracted more N and P than applied, the 2C-late approach is recommended since the biomass yield was higher than for the other 2C approaches, and it required less fertilizer and management inputs than the 3C approach.

AB The CoupModel was used to simulate a Norway spruce forest on fertile drained peat over 60 years, from planting in 1951 until 2011, describing abiotic, biotic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O). By calibrating the model against tree ring data a "vegetation fitted" model was obtained by which we were able to describe the fluxes and controlling factors over the 60 years. We discuss some conceptual issues relevant to improving the model in order to better understand peat soil simulations. However, the present model was able to describe the most important ecosystem dynamics such as the plant biomass development and GHG emissions. The GHG fluxes are composed of two important quantities, the spruce forest carbon (C) uptake, 413 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the decomposition of peat soil, 399 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . N2O emissions contribute to the GHG emissions by up to 0.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to 76 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . The 60-year old spruce forest has an accumulated biomass of 16.0 kg C m(-2) (corresponding to 60 kg CO2 m(-2)). However, over this period, 26.4 kg C m(-2) (97 kg CO2 eq m(-2)) has been added to the atmosphere, as both CO2 and N2O originating from the peat soil and, indirectly, from forest thinning products, which we assume have a short lifetime. We conclude that after harvest at an age of 80 years, most of the stored biomass carbon is liable to be released, the system having captured C only temporarily and with a cost of disappeared peat, adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB A lysimeter method using undisturbed soil columns was used to investigate the effect of water table depth and soil properties on soil organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivated peat soils. The study was carried out using cultivated organic soils from two locations in Sweden: Orke, a typical cultivated fen peat with low pH and high organic matter content and Majne-garden, a more uncommon fen peat type with high pH and low organic matter content. Even though carbon and nitrogen contents differ greatly between the sites, carbon and nitrogen density are quite similar. A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil monoliths (50 cm high, 029.5 cm) per site. They were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) after the original vegetation was removed. The lysimeter design allowed the introduction of water at depth so as to maintain a constant water table at either 40 cm or 80 cm below the soil surface. CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from the lysimeters were measured weekly and complemented with incubation experiments with small undisturbed soil cores subjected to different tensions (5, 40. 80 and 600 cm water column). CO(2) emissions were greater from the treatment with the high water table level (40 cm) compared with the low level (80 cm). N(2)O emissions peaked in springtime and CH(4) emissions were very low or negative. Estimated GHG emissions during one year were between 2.70 and 3.55 kg CO(2) equivalents m(-2). The results from the incubation experiment were in agreement with emissions results from the lysimeter experiments. We attribute the observed differences in GHG emissions between the soils to the contrasting dry matter liability and soil physical properties. The properties of the different soil layers will determine the effect of water table regulation. Lowering the water table without exposing new layers with easily decomposable material would have a limited effect on emission rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sphagnum peat is a finite resource that is often used in the horticultural industry as a component in many substrates, especially for greenhouse production of transplants. Because peatlands are being depleted by vast amounts of mining, the horticultural industry is exploring alternative resources to use in substrates. Swine lagoon sludge (SLS) is an attractive option as it may provide nutrients needed to support plant growth, as well as using an agricultural waste product to address the peat shortage. A compost was developed using an in-vessel compost reactor to compost SLS with peanut hulls [15: 85 (by volume) SLS: peanut hull] to produce a swine lagoon compost (SLC). A greenhouse transplant study was conducted with three species: basil (Ocimum basilicum 'Dark Opal'), chives (Allium schoenoprasum), and dill (Anethum graveolens 'Hera') grown in three substrates: SLC, a commercially available organic potting substrate with a nutrient charge (OM), and a commercial peat-based potting substrate with a 2-week nutrient charge (PEAT). The average height for basil, chives, and dill was significantly greater at transplant harvest when produced in the SLC substrate compared with the OM and PEAT. Airspace was greatest for SLC and lowest for OM and PEAT. Although root growth was not measured in this study, more prolific root growth throughout the plug was observed with SLC compared with OM and PEAT possibly because of the greater airspace in SLC. Substrate solution pH did not change substantially over time, whereas electrical conductivity (EC) decreased from 0.24 to 0.14 mS.cm(-1). Both substrate pH and EC were within acceptable ranges for transplant production. SLC provided the physical and chemical requirements for herb transplant production without any additional fertilizers or amendments.

Boreal Env. Res. 18: 109-126.
   We studied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drainage ditches and leaching losses in a boreal cutaway peatland cultivated with reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) for bioenergy. The objectives of the study were to assess to what extent GHG emissions from drainage ditches and leaching of carbon and nutrients via surface drainage contribute to the total losses of carbon and nitrogen from the site. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 were measured with static chamber methods for three years and leaching losses for seven years. On average, the drainage ditches (covering 6% of the study site area) released 10% of the total CH4 emission (0.33 g m(-2) a(-1)), and 1% and 5% of the total N2O and CO2 emissions, respectively. Leaching of total nitrogen and phosphorous were 0.31 and 0.03 g m(-2) a(-1), respectively. Leaching values were lower than those reported for agricultural catchments in general.

AB The aim of the study is to examine if lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) cultivation on cutover peat lands is as profitable as half-hiehbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium x Vaccinium corumbosym) and strawberry (Fragania x ananassa) cultivation on mineral soil. In addition it is examined if, due to land use changes, the abandoned peat excavation areas can be turned into a profitable land resource. Current experiments tested the suitability of a former pine bog area abandoned after peat mining for the cultivation of lowbush blueberry. Wild berry cultivation on those fields is rather a new agricultural branch and growers need efficient producing technologies. As data about the nutrient needs of blueberry on cutover peat fields are still lacking, a fertilizing trial was carried out. In the fertilization study the yield was used as an agrotechnical indicator to evaluate the viability of peat soils usage. A benefit-cost ratio analysis was used to assess the profitability of blueberry cultivation. A questionnaire survey was conducted to gather data on the costs for establishing a plantation, its maintenance, harvesting and marketing costs. It was found that on cutover peat land the fertilized blueberries produced 200 to 535 g berries per plant. The economic analysis showed that the benefit-cost ratio for lowbush blueberry on cutover peat areas was 227 %. The benefit-cost ratio for half-highbush blueberry and strawberry cultivation on the mineral soil was significantly lower at 116% and 43%, respectively. The highest profit came from lowbush blueberry and was 6.299 FUR ha(-1), whereas the lowest was for strawberry at 2, 117 FUR ha(-1) from cultivation on mineral soil. The profit from half-highbush blueberry cultivation on mineral soil was 4,855 FUR ha(-1). Finally, it can be concluded that lowbush blueberry cultivation allows to put cutover peat lands into use, and lowbush blueberry production on those areas is economically profitable.

TI Methane and Nitrous Oxide Production From Agricultural Peat Soils in

SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Histosols; methane; nitrous oxide; functional genes; suction head;
   ground water level
AB Greenhouse gas emissions from drained agricultural peatlands contribute significantly to global warming. In a laboratory study using intact cores of peat soil from eight different sites in Sweden, factors controlling the emission of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were examined. Soil properties, and the abundance of the total microbial community (16S rRNA gene abundance), and genes encoding for functions controlling N2O emissions (bacterial and archaeal amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII) were analyzed and compared against measured greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions were measured at different drainage levels, i.e., higher soil water suction values, since drainage is an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. The results showed that N2O and CH4 emissions were generally low, except for N2O emissions at near water-saturated conditions, for which three soils displayed high values and large variations in fluxes. Relationships between N2O emissions and soil properties were mainly linked to soil pH, with higher emissions at lower pH. However, specific assemblages of nitrogen cycling guilds that included nosZII, typically present in non-denitrifying N2O reducers, were detected in soils with low N2O emissions. Overall, these results indicate that both pH and biotic controls determine net N2O fluxes.

DE Groundwater level; pipe drainage; soil respiration
AB Reed canary grass (RCG) can be a suitable energy crop on abandoned agricultural peatland as it can be harvested for more than 10 years without re-establishment, and nutrient recycling to rhizomes lowers the fertilizer demand. A field near Mala in Sweden was restored by improving drainage and sowing RCG in 2010. In the first growing season, CO2 emissions from the soil were lower and groundwater level and soil water content higher for the RCG field than for a nearby unrestored field. Possible reasons were peat compaction by agricultural machinery in the restored field and higher transpiration and respiration from vegetation in the unrestored field. In the second growing season, the groundwater level was raised in some restored plots and CO2 emissions and RCG growth were found to be unaffected by this practice.

AB The growing demand for agricultural products has been leading to an expansion and intensification of agriculture around the world. More and more unused land is currently reclaimed in the regions of the former Soviet Union. Driven by climate change, the Western Siberian grain belt might, in a long-term, even expand into the drained peatland areas to the North. It is crucial to study the consequences of this land-use change with respect to the carbon cycling as this is still a major knowledge gap.
   We present for the first time data on the atmosphere-ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and methane of an arable field and a neighboring unused grassland on peat soil in Western Siberia. Eddy covariance measurements were performed over one vegetation period. No directed methane fluxes were found due to an effective drainage of the study sites. The carbon dioxide fluxes appeared to be of high relevance for the global carbon and greenhouse gas cycles. They showed very site-specific patterns resulting from the development of vegetation: the persistent plants of the grassland were able to start photosynthesizing soon after snow melt, while the absence of vegetation on the managed field lead to a phase of emissions until the oat plants started to grow in June. The uptake peak of the oat field is much later than that of the grassland, but larger due to a rapid plant growth. Budgeting the whole measurement period, the grassland served as a carbon sink, whereas the oat field was identified to be a carbon source. The conversion from non-used grasslands on peat soil to cultivated fields in Western Siberia is therefore considered to have a positive feedback on climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent (1964-1989) rates of peat accretion and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and organic carbon (C) accumulation were measured in Everglades soils to characterize the effects of altered hydroperiod and nutrient regimes on the nutrient storage capacity of the Everglades ecosystem. Peat accretion was related to hydroperiod and phosphorus loading. Accretion rates were highest in areas of extended hydroperiod (2.8-3.2 mm/yr) and/or phosphorus enrichment (4.0 mm/yr) and lowest in areas of reduced hydroperiod (1.6-2.0 mm/yr). Rates of accumulation of nitrogen were 3.8-11.6 g-m-2.yr-1 (chiBAR = 8.2 g.M-2-yr-1) and those of organic C were 54-161 g-m-2.yr-1 (chiBAR = 104 g.M-2.yr-1). Accumulation rates of N and organic C were primarily a function of peat accretion rates. Phosphorus accumulation was controlled by both peat accretion and increased soil P content. Soil P concentrations (1248 mug/g) in an area receiving N and P enriched agricultural runoff were 2-3 times higher than P levels at unenriched locations (432-764 mug/g). As a result, rates of P accumulation at this site (0.46 g.m-2.yr-1) were 2-8 times greater compared to unenriched Everglades soils (0.06-0.23 g.m-2-yr-1). Inputs of P (0.53 g.M-2. yr-1) and N (15.5 g.m-2-yr-1) to the nutrient-enriched area of Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A (via rainfall and surface flow) were nine and twelve times higher than inputs to the unenriched part of WCA 2A. As a result, the efficiency of P removal was lower at the enriched site (87%) than at the unenriched location (100%). Nitrogen removal efficiencies also were lower in the enriched area (75%) as compared to the unenriched area, where N accumulation in peat was 290-450% of the input. The difference in N storage efficiencies between the two sites may reflect differences in N fixation and denitrification in nutrient-enriched and unenriched Everglades peatlands. Our findings suggest that nutrient-enriched agricultural drainage has contributed to increased rates of peat accretion and phosphorus accumulation in areas of the northern Everglades that have been receiving agricultural drainage for the past 25-30 yr. The affected area has functioned effectively as a phosphorus sink, primarily due to increased organic P storage. However, the effects of nutrient loading, especially P, on the long-term stability of the Everglades ecosystem and on the long-term P storage potential of Everglades peats are poorly understood and are currently under investigation.

AB Better insight in the possible range of future N2O emissions can help to construct mitigation and adaptation strategies and to adapt land use planning and management to climate objectives. The Dutch fen meadow landscape is a hotspot of N2O emission due to high nitrogen inputs combined with moist peat soils due to land use change. Socio-economic developments in the area are expected to have major impacts on N2O emission. The goals of this study are to estimate changes in N2O emissions for the period 2006-2040 under three different scenarios for the Dutch fen meadow landscape (rural production, rural fragmentation, and rural multifunctionality) and to quantify the share of different emission sources. Three scenarios were constructed and quantified based on the Story-And-Simulation approach. The rural production and the rural fragmentation scenarios are characterized by globalization and a market-oriented economy; in the rural production scenario dairy farming has a strong competitive position in the study region, while under the rural fragmentation scenario agriculture is declining. Under the rural multifunctionality scenario, the global context is characterized by regionalization and stronger regulation toward environmental issues. The N2O emission decreased between 2006 and 2040 under all scenarios. Under the rural production scenario, the N2O emission decreased by 7%. Due to measures to limit peat mineralization and policies to reduce agricultural emissions, the rural multifunctionality scenario showed the largest decrease in N2O emissions (44%). Under the rural fragmentation scenario, in which the dairy farming sector is diminished, the emission decreased by 33%. Compared to other uncertainties involved in N2O emission estimates, the uncertainty due to possible future land use change is relatively large and assuming a constant emission with time is therefore not appropriate.

AB Agriculture is a significant source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHG mitigation through agri-environmental programmes could be important in achieving emission reduction targets under the 2015 UN climate agreement. This study uses the principal-agent model to examine a peatland retirement programme to reduce agricultural emissions in Norway. The focus is on the role of the government's private information in programme design. Two cases are examined. First, optimal contracts are derived when farmers have private information about the costs of implementing peat land retirement, but the government reveals its information on the resulting public benefits through differentiated contracts. This corresponds to the standard targeting strategy with one-sided information asymmetry. In the second case, an informed principal model developed by Maskin and Tirole in a 1990 study is employed to address bilateral information asymmetry. Using the informed principal model, the government offers the same menu of contracts to farmers in order not to disclose information on the public benefits from land retirement. Empirical results show that the government can achieve a higher payoff by using a pooling offer.

AB Land-use changes have contributed to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Conversion from natural peatlands to agricultural land has led to widespread subsidence of the peat surface caused by soil compaction and mineralization. To study the net ecosystem exchange of carbon (C) and the contribution of respiration to peat subsidence, eddy covariance measurements were made over pasture on a well-developed, drained peat soil from 22 May 2002 to 21 May 2003. The depth to the water table fluctuated between 0.02 m in winter 2002 to 0.75 m during late summer and early autumn 2003. Peat soil moisture content varied between 0.6 and 0.7 m(3) m(-3) until the water table dropped below 0.5 m, when moisture content reached 0.38 m(3) m(-3). Neither depth to water table nor soil moisture was found to have an effect on the rate of night-time respiration (ranging from 0.4-8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in winter and summer, respectively). Most of the variance in night-time respiration was explained by changes in the 0.1 m soil temperature (r(2)=0.93). The highest values for daytime net ecosystem exchange were measured in September 2002, with a maximum of -17.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Grazing events and soil moisture deficiencies during a short period in summer reduced net CO2 exchange. To establish an annual C balance for this ecosystem, non-linear regression was used to model missing data. Annually integrated (CO2) C exchange for this peat-pasture ecosystem was 45 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). After including other C exchanges (methane emissions from cows and production of milk), the net annual C loss was 1061 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB Sphagnum cultivation on harvested peatlands to meet wetland restoration objectives could be an economically feasible activity since cultivated Sphagnum has potential horticultural applications. We compared the characteristics of cultivated Sphagnum from Shippagan (Canada) with those of non-cultivated Sphagnum products from Chile, New Zealand and Canada, and assessed its potential as a perlite and vermiculite substitute in horticultural peat-based substrates. Shippagan cultivated Sphagnum was shorter than the Chilean and New Zealand products with which it was compared, yet more similar to them than to the Canadian product currently on the market. Laboratory tests on physical properties and greenhouse growth trials indicated that 50-100 % of the perlite or vermiculite of a peat-based substrate can be successfully replaced with cultivated Sphagnum. Non-sieved coarsely shredded Sphagnum or the large (>6.3 mm) fragments of sieved coarsely shredded Sphagnum best replicated the aeration provided by perlite and vermiculite in the substrates that were tested. Decomposition tests and comparisons of changes in physical properties of substrates containing Sphagnum after six weeks of growth trials indicated that Sphagnum degradation leading to reduced substrate performance is not likely to be an issue. Therefore, cultivated Sphagnum has great potential as a substitute for perlite and vermiculite.

AB Cultivated organic soils can be a major source of GHG emissions in countries with high coverage of peat soils. Targeting mitigation measures based on mapping of cultivated organic soils would reduce these emissions and increase sustainability of agriculture. Different georeferenced datasets were combined to study the area trend and describe current agricultural use of organic soils. The area was also mapped regionally into classes based on intensity of cultivation and organic layer depth, and an example allocation of potential mitigation measures was made at the country scale. The area and proportion of cultivated organic soils have increased in Finland since 1990 but the clearance rate has decreased in recent years. More than half of the area retains a peat layer deeper than 0.6 m indicating long-lasting mitigation potential with measures capable of slowing peat decomposition. Sixty-five percent of the cultivated organic soil area was not considered a priority area for radical management changes, for various reasons, but there are 85,000ha of field with more realistic potential for GHG mitigation. The mapping method was found to be a practical tool for depicting the GHG mitigation potential of cultivated organic soils. Significant reductions in agricultural GHG emissions can be expected with implementation of the suggested mitigation measures.

AB The paper deals with the structure of insect communities and insect biodiversity conservation in the Alpine wetland of Pian Gembro (Italy). For over a century, the wetland was subjected to diversified peat harvesting procedures, to agricultural exploitation and recently, to a superimposed diversified intermediate management regime (DIMR) aiming at plant species and plant diversity conservation. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether the DIMR is likewise effective for insect biodiversity conservation.
   Pitfall traps, sweep and collections of visually observed insects yielded 997 individuals representing 141 species from 11 insect families. The rank-frequency curve for bog insects was relatively steep indicating a low evenness due to the high abundance of low ranking species. The curve for insects collected in the surroundings was less steep pointing to a relatively high evenness due to a lower abundance of low ranking species. In both the bog and the surroundings the Shannon diversity index was generally highest at intermediate levels of disturbance. These results indicate that the DIMR strategies implemented for plant biodiversity conservation is also appropriate to conserve insect species biodiversity. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the boreal zone, large areas of natural mires have been drained and used for agriculture, resulting in net carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions and increased nitrous oxide emissions but decreased methane emissions. However, due to structural changes in agriculture, a substantial area of cropland on organic soil has been afforested. In order to estimate the carbon balance of afforested organic-soil cropland, we measured CO, and water vapour (H 20) fluxes during year above a Scots pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris) in the middle-boreal zone, using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method. We observed CO2 uptake by the Scots pine stand from late April to mid-October with a daily average net uptake from May to the beginning of October. However, there were also periods of daily net efflux. High ecosystem respiration rates continued throughout the winter (mean winter respiration 0.036 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). As an annual average, the 30-year-old pine stand was a small source of CO2 (+50 g m(-2) a(-1)) to the atmosphere, showing that the CO2 sequestration into the ecosystem was able to compensate for most of the carbon that was released by heterotrophic respiration from the drained soil.

AB Zooplankton are an essential component of healthy functioning lake and wetland ecosystems. Despite this, zooplankton communities within constructed treatment wetlands (CTWs) in agricultural landscapes remain unstudied. Taxa richness, total abundances and community composition were evaluated for zooplankton assemblages from three habitat types (lakes, CTWs and drainage ditches) within five intensive agricultural peat lake catchments in New Zealand. Relationships to water quality, physicochemical and biotic habitat variables were examined. Zooplankton were dominated by cladocerans, copepods, ostracods and rotifer taxa, representing a range of communities typical of lake and pond habitats. CTWs supported species otherwise absent from lake and drain habitats, increasing the overall biodiversity of the highly-modified peat lake catchments. Taxa richness of CTWs was higher than that of drains, and a few CTWs had greater diversity than several lakes. The morphological variables area and depth contributed to the greatest differences between habitats, followed by pH, inorganic nitrogen, conductivity and temperature. Correspondingly, zooplankton communities were significantly influenced by habitat area, depth and pH, as well as ammonium, phosphate, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and macrophyte cover. Opportunities were explored for refining CTW designs to enhance zooplankton biodiversity and potentially improve treatment efficiency through increasing the complexity and diversity of CTW habitat niches.

AB The temporal and spatial variations in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission estimates in wetlands impede our ability to predict and upscale total emissions; thus, a scalar parameter is needed to predict GHG emissions. We investigated the importance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the prediction of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in rewetted agricultural peatlands, positing that both CH4 and N2O production are explained by the quantity and turnover of SOC. Field CH4 and N2O fluxes, along with other edaphic and environmental variables, were monitored in rewetted peatlands with a range of SOC (6%, 11%, and 23%) that were recently converted from row crops to flooded rice cultivation to reverse soil subsidence. Nitrogen (N) fertilization reduced annual CH4 emission by 77.2% in the 6% C field, but this effect was not found in other fields. Annual N2O emissions were not affected by N fertilization and averaged 8.9, 5.2, and 1.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the 6%, 11%, and 23% C fields, respectively. SOC was the dominant factor controlling both CH4 and N2O emissions. The annual emission for both CH4 and N2O was accurately described by a decaying power regression with increasing SOC contents (R-2>0.49). This relationship was also observed after splitting total annual emission of CH4 and N2O into growing and fallow seasons. Nitrogen fertilization and the seasonality in CH4 and N2O emissions did not change the relationships. The inverse correlation between SOC and CH4 and N2O emissions was likely caused by different chemical composition of SOC in various soils. Our results suggest that SOC can be a potential proxy to predict CH4 and N2O emissions in rewetted peatlands to better define GHG predictions of wetland restoration efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Small shallow lakes are a characteristic feature of blanket bog habitats. The biotic assemblages of these lakes can be particularly species rich, especially in terms of the aquatic invertebrate fauna. Despite their potential conservation value, relatively little is known about their physico-chemical or biological characteristics in northern Europe in comparison to other freshwater habitats, and their undisturbed reference conditions are still unknown in Ireland. We surveyed upland and lowland blanket bog lakes, across both sedimentary (sandstone) and igneous (granite) geologies, to compare baseline physico-chemical and biological conditions for blanket bog lakes in western Ireland. A comprehensive data set of water chemistry, Chydoridae, littoral macroinvertebrates and aquatic macrophyte taxa were collected from all lakes over a twelve-month period beginning in March 2009. The main difference in lake hydrochemistry was that the lowland lakes, situated at lower altitude and in closer proximity to the coast than the upland lakes, had significantly higher conductivity and major ion (sodium [Na], chloride [Cl], magnesium [Mg], potassium [K] and sulphate [SO4]) concentrations because of the greater influence of atmospheric (sea spray) deposition. The upland lakes were also significantly cooler and had higher concentrations of total phosphorus (TP). Differences were also evident between the upland and lowland lakes in the chydorid, littoral macroinvertebrate and macrophyte communities, primarily caused by marine-driven hydrochemical variation and differences in benthic substrate. The chemical effect of marine deposition appeared to have a much greater impact on lake hydrochemistry and biology than either underlying geology or altitude. This is the first study of its kind to be carried out on blanket bog lakes in Ireland. More information is needed on the biology of such lakes, together with research on anthropogenic drivers of biotic communities, if significant loss of biodiversity associated with agriculture, peat extraction, burning, wind farm developments and conifer afforestation is to be prevented.

AB Peatlands are complex ecosystems driven by many physical, chemical, and biological processes. Peat soils have a significant impact on water quality, ecosystem productivity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the extent of peatlands is decreasing across the world, mainly because of anthropogenic activities such as drainage for agriculture or groundwater abstractions in underlying aquifers. Potential changes in precipitation and temperature in the future are likely to apply additional pressure to wetland. In this context, a methodology for assessing and comparing the respective impacts of groundwater abstraction and climate change on a groundwater-fed wetland (135 km(2)) located in Northwest France, is presented. A groundwater model was developed, using flexible boundary conditions to represent surface-subsurface interactions which allowed examination of the extent of the wetland areas. This variable parameter is highly important for land management and is usually not considered in impact studies. The model was coupled with recharge estimation, groundwater abstraction scenarios, and climate change scenarios downscaled from 14 GCMs corresponding to the A1B greenhouse gas (GHG) scenario over the periods 1961-2000 and 2081-2100. Results show that climate change is expected to have an important impact and reduce the surface of wetlands by 5.3-13.6%. In comparison, the impact of groundwater abstraction (100% increase in the expected scenarios) would lead to a maximum decrease of 3.7%.

AB The effect of different densities of Lumbricus rubellus on the nematode community was studied in a field experiment. The stand, a cultivated meadow on peat-muck soil developed from moderately decomposed alder peat, was located on drained fens in the central basin of the Biebrza valley in the north-eastern part of Poland. Samples were taken from soil isolators into which 0, 2, 4 or 6 earthworms were previously introduced. The abundance and trophic structure of the nematode fauna in the different treatments were compared 30, 60, 90 and 120 d after the introduction of L. rubellus. The effect of L rubellus on soil nematodes was most pronounced at the beginning of the experiment. Thirty days after introduction of L. rubellus, the total number of nematodes in all trials with earthworms was significantly lower than in the control, and nematode numbers decreased with increasing L. rubellus density. On later sampling dates, the results were less clear and 120 d after introduction of L. rubellus no significant effect on the total number of nematodes was observed in the treatments. The abundance of the bacterial-, fungal- and plant-feeding nematodes in the treatments with earthworms was lower than in the control 30 d after introduction of L. rubellus, but significant differences were found only in the case of bacterial feeders.

The estimations indicate that more than half of the carbon released as carbon dioxide during fossil-fuel combustion (c. 16 Mton C per year) is currently accumulating in terrestrial ecosystems, mainly in the form of forest biomass (c. 9 Mton C per year).  Cultivated organic soils release c. 1-2 Mton C per year to the atmosphere, while peat and the sediments of lakes and coastal waters accumulate c. 4 Mton C per year.

AB The tree islands of the Everglades are considered to be biodiversity "hotspots", where the majority of terrestrial species of the Everglades are found. Drainage for agricultural and urban development in the early 1900s has had a severe impact, converting many of them into "ghost tree islands" which have lost most of their woody vegetation and much of their altitude (elevation). A survey conducted in 1973 on one of the prominent ghost tree islands, named "Dineen Island", provides insights into the past. We compared the results of the 1973 survey with those of a survey conducted in 2009, in order to examine changes in Dineen Island that had taken place over 36 years and to provide information about general trends in the Everglades. Peat loss at Dineen Island was roughly 4 mm yr(-1). This subsidence, as a consequence of peat loss, has been accompanied by losses in nitrogen and phosphorus of 234 and 2.5 metric tons (4.5 and 0.05 metric tons per hectare), respectively. As many of the Everglades tree islands have been lost from the landscape due to historical water management practices, quantifying nutrient losses from this ecosystem may be useful in helping to predict non-anthropogenic nutrient biogeochemistry shifts in Everglades oligotrophy.

AB Long-term sugarcane cultivation may alter nutrient distribution in the soil profile and contribute to deficiencies. The objective of this study was to determine how sugarcane cultivation altered nutrient stratification in peatlands. Soil pH decreased with depth for uncultivated soils but remained constant at 6.9 for sugarcane soils. Long-term fertilization did not result in accumulation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Sugarcane soils had 74, 72, and 94% more zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) than uncultivated soils 0-30 cm deep, indicating micronutrient fertilization rates were greater than their removal in harvested biomass. Total iron (Fe) concentrations were lower in sugarcane than uncultivated soils, indicating Fe removal in biomass exceeded fertilization rates. Macronutrient fertilization rates for sugarcane did not result in accumulation in soil, indicating close agreement with crop needs, while overapplication of most micronutrients, except Fe, occurred. Because of minimal environmental hazards associated with micronutrients, changes in their application rates may not be warranted.

AB Water retention curves are essential for the parameterization of soil water models such as HYDRUS. Although hydraulic parameters are known for a large number of mineral and natural organic soils, our knowledge on the hydraulic behavior of cultivated Histosols is rather limited. The objective of this study was to derive characteristic water retention curves for a large cultivated peatland with lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L.) and vegetable farming in southern Quebec, Canada. A comparison showed that the van Genuchten model fits better to the water retention data obtained with a Tempe pressure cell experiment than the Groenevelt-Grant model in terms of residual sum of squares; however, the difference in performance was quite small due to the high number of iterations used for fitting. Finally, an agglomerative cluster analysis of 85 peat samples allowed us to define two distinct water retention curves, where the first water retention curve described samples of relatively shallow (< 150 cm) Histosols with an organic content < 0.89 and a bulk density > 0.3 g cm(-3), and the second curve characterized samples of the deepest ( depth 150-230 cm) Histosols with an organic content of up to 0.97 and a bulk density > 0.3 g cm(-3), which are the soils that suffered a more dramatic transformation as a result of agriculture. This characterization allows for a multitude of applications, including parameterization of the HYDRUS model for soil water movement, and presents an essential tool for the optimization of water management in cultivated peatlands.

AB Drained organic soils are among the most risky soil types as far as their greenhouse gas emissions are considered. Reed canary grass (RCG) is a potential bioenergy crop in the boreal region, but the atmospheric impact of its cultivation is unknown. The fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured from an abandoned peat extraction site (an organic soil) cultivated with RCG using static chamber and snow gradient techniques. The fluxes were measured also at an adjacent site which is under active peat extraction and it is devoid of any vegetation (BP site). The 4-year average annual N2O emissions were low being 0.1 and 0.01 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) at the RCG and BP sites, respectively. The corresponding mean annual CH4 emissions from the RCG and BP sites were also low (0.4 g and 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1)). These results highlight for the first time that there are organic soils where cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops is possible with low N2O and CH4 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Permanent grasslands constitute the most widespread land use type for agriculturally managed peatlands in Europe. They are typically significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of drainage-induced peat decomposition, but quantitative data are still scarce. This study presents an in-depth analysis of CO2 flux variability at the site (n=3) and plot scale (n=9) for different Danish permanent grasslands on peat. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and ecosystem respiration were monitored over one year with closed dynamic chambers. The first part of the data analysis consisted of a detailed evaluation of the flux dataset to gain insight into the potential effects of fast fluctuations in the wind and light intensity on the plot scale CO2 flux. In the second part of the analysis, gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were modeled on the field and plot scale with candidate sets of simple light and temperature response models commonly applied in ecological studies. The detailed flux dataset analysis revealed that upward concave flux curves, which are not explainable by diffusion theory, can either be the result of a fan-induced increase in headspace turbulence, or of a photosynthesis overshoot into shaded or darkened chamber measurement periods. Instead of discarding such measurements from the dataset, this study proposes the use of linear flux calculation as a way to obtain less biased flux rate estimates. For the carbon balance modeling, it could be shown that annual NEE estimates for a site differ (0.2-0.3 kg CO2 m(-2)) between different models available for gap-filling CO2 flux time series even when the models were equally suitable according to statistical evaluation. Overall, all plots showed significant carbon losses over the course of a year (1.5-5.6 kg CO2 m(-2), including harvested aboveground biomass); however, it was not possible to relate spatial differences in the CO2 flux dynamics between and within the study sites to certain peat properties or management types due to high uncertainties in the annual estimates.

AB The agricultural sector has potentially a significant role in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Besides providing public goods, GHG reduction offers farmers new alternatives for income generation. This is especially interesting in marginal agricultural areas, e.g., in less-favoured areas (LFA) of the European Union (EU), where significant GHG reduction potential coincides with low productivity in the production of agricultural commodities.
   In this study, the effects of peatland cultivation restrictions were evaluated, where the objective was to decrease GHG fluxes deriving from agricultural production. The regional role of peatlands in GHG reduction and agricultural production is also evaluated. Ceasing the agricultural use of peatlands altogether could decrease Finnish agricultural sector carbon effluents by up to 10% according to a dynamic regional sector model of the Finnish agriculture (DREMFIA). Accompanying decreases in national and even in regional agricultural incomes do not appear drastic, but locally, in some municipalities and on individual farms they may be devastating. In an alternative scenario, where perennial grass production is allowed to continue and only cultivation of annual crops is forbidden, the (negative) income effects are very low. The most notable result is that significant GHG reductions can be reached with little decrease in national agricultural incomes.
   The two forms of restrictions were tested in two alternative agricultural policy settings: Agenda 2000 and the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform agreed in Luxembourg on 26th June 2003. These two agricultural policy alternatives are connected with both of the aforementioned climate policy alternatives and resulting scenarios are evaluated in the simulation. The simulation provides the second main result, which says that it is not so much the climate policy which determines aggregate agricultural production and income, but rather it is the general agricultural policy framework setting the stage.

AB We examined the P sorption characteristics of northern Everglades peat soils along a eutrophication gradient to understand the P retention efficiency of the soils. The amount of phosphate adsorbed on the soils ce, and the zero equilibrium phosphate concentration supported by the soils (EPCo) exhibited a linear decrease with distance from the inflow structures supplying agricultural drainage (r(2) = 0.74 and 0.71, respectively; P < 0.05; n = 18). Values of Q and EPCo for the enriched soils are an order of magnitude higher than for unenriched soils, Estimated Q values of the soils compare well with the exchangeable P fraction determined by KCl and HCO3 extraction. Comparison of soil EPCo and pore water PO4-P values with the surface water PO4-P concentrations suggests that soils may serve as an additional internal source of P to the overlying water column in nutrient-enriched areas. Linear phosphate adsorption coefficient (K) of the alkaline Everglades soils is higher than that of acidic pocosin bog peat soils of North Carolina but lower than wetland soils and sediments with a high mineral content. Phosphorus sorption characteristics of the Everglade soils are most likely regulated by CaCO3.

AB Wetlands of the western boreal forest are poorly studied. In the last decade (1990-2000) there were approximately 1810 northern hemisphere scientific papers published addressing boreal wetlands, tundra, taiga, or bogs. We explore the extent of understanding and impacts of six major agents of change affecting forested wetlands of the boreal zone: (1) commercial forestry, (2) petroleum extraction, (3) mining (bitumen, coal, peat, ore, and diamonds), (4) agriculture, (5) climate change, and (6) hydrologic alteration. Finally, we address the social context, costs, and recommendations for wetland maintenance.

AB Drainage and land-use are key factors that trigger CO2 emissions from cultivated organic soils. Drainage enhances aeration, and land-use might affect peat decomposition due to the input of fresh organic matter (FOM). The effect of FOM addition on peat decomposition of agriculturally used organic soils has seldom been quantified experimentally. In this study, we i) incubated soil samples taken from three adjacent former peatland sites that were chained and managed as cropland, perennial grassland and forest, respectively, and measured CO2 release over 16 months at 20 degrees C. In a second experiment, ii) we incubated soil samples from the same three sites with and without adding corn straw as FOM (2% w/w) at 20 degrees C over three weeks. The C-13 and C-14 signatures of soil organic carbon (SOC) and emitted CO2 enabled us to apportion the amount of decomposed corn, as well as to estimate relative effects of corn addition on the decomposition of SOC from old peat (SOCold) and from young soil organic carbon (SOCyoung). In the first experiment, samples lost between 0.03 and 0.09 mg CO2-C mg SOC-1 in the order forest > grassland > cropland. The higher C-14 values of the emitted CO2 vs. that of SOC indicated that SOCyoung was more easily decomposable. FOM addition induced negative (- 14.8 +/- 5.2%), positive (+ 14.9 +/- 4.6%) and neutral priming (- 14.2 +/- 30.0%) of SOC decomposition in the forest, grassland and cropland samples, respectively. Most importantly, we fmd that the relative contribution of SOCold to the overall CO2 release consistently decreased after FOM application, whereas decomposition of SOCyoung was rather stimulated. The latter finding is in line with previous studies on intact peat. Our results show that young and old C pools in managed organic soils respond differently to the addition of fresh plant residues, and FOM addition can effectively reduce the decomposition of old peat. Hitherto negative priming was never reported for agriculturally used organic soils and it might be caused by the overall poor decomposability of old peat.

AB 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Serratula tinctoria L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.
   2. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway. It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States, and from the lowland Mediterranean zone.
   3. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded.
   4. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a hormone that regulates insect development.
   5. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year(-1). The species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient availability and lack of management.
   6. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and, conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland, heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes.

AB The paper presents the results of a study of the effective scattering surface (ESS) of agricultural lands in reclaimed peat bogs in Ryazan' Meshchera in various periods of observation. An experimental radar survey was carried out in Spring-Summer 1986-7 using an aircraft side-looking radar at wavelength 2.5 cm. In the processing of the radar survey material the water surface of inland lakes was used as a reference. Invariant calibration characteristics were obtained for five dates of survey and numerical estimates of the relative ESS were compared for different agricultural objects (bare soils, pasture, cereal and tilled crops).

AB Properties of suspended particulate matter play a vital role in transport processes, but information from boreal lowland river systems with high organic loads is limited. This study analysed data from 2years of sampling at 30 locations in Finland (204 samples in total) using suspended particulate matter samplers to determine effective and absolute particle size and organic fractions. Mean d(50) value was 22 and 49 mu m for absolute and effective particle size, respectively. The organic fraction content ranged from 2.1% to 36% (mean 9.6%), highlighting the importance of particle organic matter for suspended particulate matter flux in the region. The results indicated that the suspended particulate matter particle size distribution and load in the study region is dominated by composite particles. There were considerable spatial and temporal variations in transport of organic fractions, effective particle size and degree of aggregation (range 1.5-93%). Headwaters and, in particular, late summer and spring flood conditions with flow peaks produced the largest composite particles, whereas agriculture-dominated sites produced smaller but more tightly compacted particles. Organic plant fibres appeared to play a vital role in floc formation in peat-covered catchments, whereas in agriculture-dominated catchments, land use-derived aggregates dominated the composition. This study provides empirical evidence of the importance of effective particle size measurement in understanding the dynamics of suspended particulate matters in boreal lowland river systems.

AB The results of 25 years of observations (1992-2017) on 20 permanent key plots (PKP), founded near Priladozhskaya educational-scientific field station of St. Petersburg University (150 km North of St. Petersburg) are analyzed. The PKP are located in the landscape of North-Western Ladoga Region, in the most typical landscape sites: on the tops and slopes of selga (ridges composed of Archean and lower Proterozoic granitoids and treated by glacier), terraces on lacustrine clays and loam, peat bogs of various types, etc. When locating the PKP, typical plant communities were chosen (pine, spruce, mixed and small-leaved forests, pine woodlands, overgrown meadows) and the most characteristic impacts (forest fires, selective cuttings, windfalls, recent use in agriculture, drainage, and others). The most dynamic landscape in the North-Western Ladoga Region are terraces on lacustrine clay and loam, for a long time used in agriculture. Currently, processes of overgrowing realized at a 7 landscape-dynamic trajectories are taking place. In other landscape sites, changes of a long-term state are initiated mainly by fires and windfall, and subsequent processes of forest regeneration. In addition, the change of tree species in forests can occur when small-leaved trees reach their maximal biological age. The landscape sites of upper slopes of ridges and drained peat bogs with a predominance of pine forests in the absence of catastrophic impacts are the most stable.

   CO2 FLUXES; MINERAL FERTILIZATION; PHYSICAL FERTILITY
AB The drainage and cultivation of fen peatlands create complex small-scale mosaics of soils with extremely variable soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and groundwater levels (GWLs). To date, the significance of such sites as sources or sinks for greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 is still unclear, especially if the sites are used for cropland. As individual control factors such as GWL fail to account for this complexity, holistic approaches combining gas fluxes with the underlying processes are required to understand the carbon (C) gas exchange of drained fens. It can be assumed that the stocks of SOC and N located above the variable GWL - defined as dynamic C and N stocks - play a key role in the regulation of the plant- and microbially mediated CO2 fluxes in these soils and, inversely, for CH4. To test this assumption, the present study analysed the C gas exchange (gross primary production - GPP; ecosystem respiration - R-eco; net ecosystem exchange - NEE; CH4) of maize using manual chambers for 4 years. The study sites were located near Paulinenaue, Germany, where we selected three soil types representing the full gradient of GWL and SOC stocks (0-1 m) of the landscape: (a) Haplic Arenosol (AR; 8 kg C m(-2)); (b) Mollic Gleysol (GL; 38 kg C m(-2)); and (c) Hemic Histosol (HS; 87 kg C m(-2)). Daily GWL data were used to calculate dynamic SOC (SOCdyn) and N (N-dyn) stocks.
   Average annual NEE differed considerably among sites, ranging from 47 +/- 30 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in AR to -305 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in GL and -127 +/- 212 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in HS. While static SOC and N stocks showed no significant effect on C fluxes, SOCdyn and N-dyn and their interaction with GWL strongly influenced the C gas exchange, particularly NEE and the GPP : R-eco ratio. Moreover, based on nonlinear regression analysis, 86% of NEE variability was explained by GWL and SOCdyn. The observed high relevance of dynamic SOC and N stocks in the aerobic zone for plant and soil gas exchange likely originates from the effects of GWL-dependent N availability on C formation and transformation processes in the plant-soil system, which promote CO2 input via GPP more than CO2 emission via R-eco.
   The process-oriented approach of dynamic C and N stocks is a promising, potentially generalisable method for system-oriented investigations of the C gas exchange of groundwater-influenced soils and could be expanded to other nutrients and soil characteristics. However, in order to assess the climate impact of arable sites on drained peatlands, it is always necessary to consider the entire range of groundwater-influenced mineral and organic soils and their respective areal extent within the soil landscape.

AB The drainage of peatland areas for peat extraction, agriculture or bioenergy requires affordable, simple and reliable treatment methods that can purify waters rich in particulates and dissolved organic carbon. This work focused on the optimisation of chemical purification process for the direct dosage of solid metal salt coagulants. It investigated process requirements of solid coagulants and the influence of water quality, temperature and process parameters on their performance. This is the first attempt to provide information on specific process requirements of solid coagulants. Three solid inorganic coagulants were evaluated: aluminium sulphate, ferric sulphate and ferric aluminium sulphate. Pre-dissolved aluminium and ferric sulphate were also tested with the objective of identifying the effects of in-line coagulant dissolution on purification performance. It was determined that the pre-dissolution of the coagulants had a significant effect on coagulant performance and process requirements. Highest purification levels achieved by solid coagulants, even at 30% higher dosages, were generally lower (5%-30%) than those achieved by pre-dissolved coagulants. Furthermore, the mixing requirements of coagulants pre-dissolved prior to addition differed substantially from those of solid coagulants. The pH of the water samples being purified had a major influence on coagulant dosage and purification efficiency. Ferric sulphate (70 mg/L) was found to be the best performing solid coagulant achieving the following load removals: suspended solids (59%-88%), total organic carbon (56%-62%), total phosphorus (87%-90%), phosphate phosphorus (85%-92%) and total nitrogen (33%-44%). The results show that the use of solid coagulants is a viable option for the treatment of peatland-derived runoff water if solid coagulant-specific process requirements, such as mixing and settling time, are considered.

AB Using both historic records and CORINE land cover maps, we assessed the impact of land cover change on the stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Republic of Ireland from 1851 to 2000. We identified ten principal land cover classes: arable land, forest, grassland, heterogeneous agricultural areas/other, nonvegetated semi-natural areas, peatland, suburban, urban, water bodies, and wetland. For each land cover class, the SOC stock was estimated as the product of SOC density and land cover area. These were summed to calculate a national SOC budget for the Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's 6.94 million hectares of land have undergone considerable change over the past 150 years. The most striking feature is the decrease in arable land from 1.44 million ha in 1851 to 0.55 million ha in 2000. Over the same time period, forested land increased by 0.53 million ha. As of 2000, agricultural lands including arable land (7.85%), grassland (54.33%), and the heterogeneous agricultural areas/other class (7.91%) account for 70.09% of Irish land cover. We estimate that the SOC stock in the Republic of Ireland, to 1 m depth, has increased from 1,391 Tg in 1851 to 1,469 Tg in 2000 despite soil loss due to urbanization. This increase is largely due to the increase of forested land with its higher SOC stocks when compared to agricultural lands. Peatlands contain a disproportionate quantity of the SOC stock. Although peatlands only occupy 17.36% of the land area, as of 2000, they represented 36% of the SOC stock (to 1 m depth).

AB The microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) was studied in three Finnish boreal estuaries with contrasting land use patterns (Kiiminkijoki - natural forest and peatland; Kyronjoki - agricultural; Karjaanjoki - mixed/urban). Bioassays of 12-18 d long durations were used in 3 seasons at in situ temperatures. Besides the bulk parameters, a suite of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality parameters were also investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM and the molecular weight of DOM. Bioavailable DOC and DON pools varied significantly between the estuaries, from 7.9 to 10.6% and from 5.5 to 21.9 %, respectively. DOM originating from the catchment dominated by natural forests and peatlands (Kiiminkijoki) had the lowest DOC and DON degradation rates, as well as the lowest proportions of biodegradable DOC and DON. A greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment increased the bioavailability of DON, but not the bioavailability of DOC (Kyronjoki). Additionally, DOM quality varied significantly between the estuaries, and DOM originating from the agricultural Kyronjoki catchment sustained higher DOC and DON degradation rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) compared to those of the natural forest and peat dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment. The quality of DOM, indicated by differences in CDOM, fluorescent DOM and molecular weight, varied between estuaries with differing land use and was concluded to be major driver of BGE of these systems and thereafter to the microbial CO2 fluxes from the estuaries. The differences in BGE resulted in a 5-fold difference in the calculated daily bacterial CO2 emissions between the study's estuaries due to bacterial activity, ranging from 40 kg C d(-1) in the Karjaanjoki estuary to 200 kg C d(-1) in the Kyronjoki estuary. Lower DOC : DON ratios, smaller molecular weight and higher CDOM absorption spectral slope values of DOM resulted in higher proportion of the initial DOC and DON being transferred to microbial growth and therefore to the pelagic food web. The pristine, peatland and forest-dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment had the lowest BGE, and therefore proportionally highest CO2 fluxes.

DE Cultivated peatlands; Drainage; WTL; CO2 CH4; BASGRA-BGC model
AB Cultivated peatlands under drainage practices contribute significant carbon losses from agricultural sector in the Nordic countries. In this research, we developed the BASGRA-BGC model coupled with hydrological, soil carbon decomposition and methane modules to simulate the dynamic of water table level (WTL), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions for cultivated peatlands. The field measurements from four experimental sites in Finland, Denmark and Norway were used to validate the predictive skills of this novel model under different WTL management practices, climatic conditions and soil properties. Compared with daily observations, the model performed well in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error; 0.06-0.11 m, 1.22-2.43 gC/m(2)/day, and 0.002-0.330 kgC/ha/day for WTL, CO2 and CH4, respectively), NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error; 10.3-18.3%, 13.0-18.6%, 15.3-21.9%) and Pearson's r (Pearson correlation coefficient; 0.60-0.91, 0.76-0.88, 0.33-0.80). The daily/ seasonal variabilities were therefore captured and the aggregated results corresponded well with annual estimations. We further provided an example on the model's potential use in improving the WTL management to mitigate CO2 and CH4 emissions while maintaining grass production. At all study sites, the simulatedWTLs and carbon decomposition rates showed a significant negative correlation. Therefore, controlling WTL could effectively reduce carbon losses. However, given the highly diverse carbon decomposition rates within individual WTLs, adding indicators (e.g. soil moisture and peat quality) would improve our capacity to assess the effectiveness of specific mitigation practices such as WTL control and rewetting.

AB A study was made of the effect of soil and crop type on the soil and total ecosystem respiration rates in agricultural soils in southern Finland. The main interest was to compare the soil respiration rates in peat and two different mineral soils growing barley, grass and potato. Respiration measurements were conducted during the growing season with (1) a closed-dynamic ecosystem respiration chamber, in which combined plant and soil respiration was measured and ( 2) a closed-dynamic soil respiration chamber which measured only the soil and root-derived respiration. A semi-empirical model including separate functions for the soil and plant respiration components was used for the total ecosystem respiration (TER), and the resulting soil respiration parameters for different soil and crop types were compared. Both methods showed that the soil respiration in the peat soil was 2-3 times as high as that in the mineral soils, varying from 0.11 to 0.36 mg (CO2) m(-2) s(-1) in the peat soil and from 0.02 to 0.17 mg (CO2) m(-2) s(-1) in the mineral soils. The difference between the soil types was mainly attributed to the soil organic C content, which in the uppermost 20 cm of the peat soil was 24 kg m(-2), being about 4 times as high as that in the mineral soils. Depending on the measurement method, the soil respiration in the sandy soil was slightly higher than or similar to that in the clay soil. In each soil type, the soil respiration was highest on the grass plots. Higher soil respiration parameter values (R-s0, describing the soil respiration at a soil temperature of 10degreesC, and obtained by modelling) were found on the barley than on the potato plots. The difference was explained by the different cultivation history of the plots, as the potato plots had lain fallow during the preceding summer. The total ecosystem respiration followed the seasonal evolution in the leaf area and measured photosynthetic flux rates. The 2-3-fold peat soil respiration term as compared to mineral soil indicates that the cultivated peat soil ecosystem is a strong net CO2 source.

The effect of nutrient export from the catchments on the lake water chemistry was studied. The biggest loading of nutrients (N,P) to the lake was in the cold period and the main source of nutrients was the agricultural area. The chemistry of the lake water did not change greatly during the year. Only a slow increase in organic nitrogen and phosphorus was observed in this study.

AB Despite the importance of water purification to society, it is one of the more difficultwetland ecosystem services to quantify. It remains an issue in ecosystem service assessments where rapid estimates are needed, and poor-quality indicators are overused. We attempted to quantify the water purification service of South African palmiet wetlands (valley-bottom peatlands highly threatened by agriculture). First, we used an instantaneous catchment-scale mass balance sampling approach, which compared the fate of various water quality parameters over degraded and pristine sections of palmiet wetlands. We found that pristine palmiet wetlands acted as a sink for water, major cations, anions, dissolved silicon and nutrients, though there was relatively high variation in these trends. There are important limitations to this catchment-scale approach, including the fact that at this large scale there aremultiple mechanisms (internal wetland processes as well as external inputs) at work that are impossible to untangle with limited data. Therefore, secondly, we performed a small field-scale field survey of a wetland fragment to corroborate the catchment-scale results. There was a reasonable level of agreement between the results of the two techniques. We conclude that it appears possible to estimate the water purification function of these valley-bottom wetlands using this catchment-scale approach.

TI Correction of a Large-Scale Soil Map with the Use of the New
   Classification System of Russian Soils
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB A large-scale soil map of one of the farms in the south of Karelia has been analyzed. This map was initially compiled in 1979 on the basis of the official Classification and Diagnostics of Soils of the Soviet Union (1977). We have corrected it with the use of the new Classification and Diagnostics of Russian Soils. Both the names of the map units and the particular delineations on the map have been changed. These changes are related to differences in the principles of soil diagnostics in the old and new classification systems and to real changes in the soil cover that have taken place after the map's compilation. In particular, large areas of peat bogs have been drained, and the cultivated peat soils have been subjected to accelerated mineralization. Surface planing works after digging drainage channels have also changed the soil cover pattern. The revised large-scale soil map developed on the basis of the new classification system gives more adequate information about the real soil cover.

AB Organic matter in the terrestrial biosphere has a fundamental role in moderating the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere. One important property of organic matter is its oxidative ratio (OR); that is, the ratio of moles O-2 released per mole CO2 sequestered through photosynthesis, that is, the lower the OR, less O-2 is released per mole of CO2 fixed. In global assessments of CO2 partitioning, the failure to account for changes in OR could lead to an underestimate of terrestrial carbon sequestration. It is known that OR can vary between environments and management, but what other factors could be playing a role in controlling OR? This study measured the OR of a range of peat (Histosols) and mineral soils (Inceptisols) under similar management from across the United Kingdom to investigate how OR varies within and between material types. The study shows that OR values varied significantly between material types (median peat OR=1.10, median vegetation OR=1.03 and median mineral soil OR=1.14), and they also varied between study sites. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in OR with peat depth. Given the results from this study, we can suggest that future sampling strategies should include sampling of the major carbon pools (i.e. vegetation, litter and soil) and that, as a first approximation, OR can be examined on the basis of these carbon pools alone. The values measured in the study give a new residence time-weighted global OR estimate for the terrestrial biosphere (<mml:msubsup>ORterraglobal</mml:msubsup>) of 1.056 +/- 0.02.

AB Effects of agricultural land-use and land-use change on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools play an important role in the mitigation of the global greenhouse effect. To estimate these effects, baseline SOC data for individual regions or countries are needed. The aim of this study was to quantify current SOC stocks in Swiss agricultural soils, to identify meaningful predictors for SOC, and to estimate historical SOC losses. SOC stocks in mineral soils were estimated from combined georeferenced data for land-use, topography, and profile data (n = 544) from Soil Surveys. Mean SOC density in the layer 0-20 cm ranged between 40.6 +/- 8.9 t ha(-1) (+/-95% confidence interval (CI)) for arable land and 50.7 +/- 12.2 t ha(-1) for favourable permanent grassland, and in the layer 0-100 cm front 62.9 +/- 15.2 t ha(-1) for Unfavourable grassland to 117.4 +/- 29.8 t ha(-1) for temporary Grasslands (leys). SOC stocks in organic soils were quantified separately for intact and cultivated peatlands using data from peatland inventories and Current SOC densities calculated from average peat decay rates. Organic soils account for less than 3% of the total area but store about 28% (47.2 +/- 7.3 Mt) of the total SOC stock of 170 +/- 17 Mt. Land-use type, clay content, and altitude (serving as a climate proxy for grassland soils at higher altitudes) were identified as main SOC predictors in mineral soils. Clay content explained up to 44% of the variability in SOC concentrations in the fine earth of arable soils, but was not significantly related to SOC in grassland soils at higher altitudes. SOC concentration under permanent grassland increases linearly with altitude, but because soil depth and stone content limit carbon storage in alpine grassland soils, no relationship was found between altitude and SOC stock. A preliminary estimate suggested that about 16% of the national SOC stock has been lost historically due to peatland cultivation, urbanisation, and deforestation. It seems unlikely that future changes in agricultural practices could compensate for this historical SOC loss in Swiss agricultural soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although estimates of the annual methane (CH4) flux from agriculturally managed peatlands exist, knowledge of controls over the variation of CH4 at different time-scales is limited due to the lack of high temporal-resolution data. Here we present CH4 fluxes measured from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique at an abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada. The goals of the study were to identify the controls on the seasonal variations in CH4 flux and to quantify the annual CH4 flux. The seasonal variation in daily CH4 flux was not strong in the two study years, however a few periods of pronounced emissions occurred in the late growing season. The daily average CH4 flux was small relative to other studies, ranging from -4.1 to 9.9 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 2014-15 and from -7.1 to 12.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 2015-16. Stepwise multiple regression was used to investigate controls on CH4 flux and this analysis found shifting controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season. During the early growing season CH4 flux was closely related to carbon dioxide fixation rates, suggesting substrate availability was the main control. The peak growing season CH4 flux was principally controlled by the CH4 oxidation in 2014, where the CH4 flux decreased and increased with soil temperature at 50 cm and soil water content at 10 cm, but a contrasting temperature-CH4 relation was found in 2015. The late growing season CH4 flux was found to be regulated by the variation in water table level and air temperature in 2014. The annual CH4 emission was near zero in both study years (0.36 +/- 0.30 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 0.13 +/- 0.38 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16), but fell within the range of CH4 emissions reported for agriculturally managed peatlands elsewhere.

TI Conserving birdlife of peruvian highland bogs: Effects of patch-size and

ID WETLANDS
AB Aims: Bogs (locally named "bofedales") constitute a key habitat for conserving birds associated with the wet meadows and ponds on the huge expanses of dry bunch-grass steppes ("puna") of the Andes. Despite this, the factors shaping bird numbers and species richness in this habitat have not been studied. This paper examines the bird communities in a set of bogs distributed in two Peruvian localities during the wet (February) and dry (September) season. It evaluates the effects of bog size and some habitat features (grazing intensity, presence of small watercourses, vegetation cover, etc.) on abundance and species richness of bird communities.
   Location: Two Peruvian localities above 4,000 in (humid mountains near Cusco, and and uplands near Arequipa).
   Methods: Given that bogs tended to be long and narrow (mean width: 59 in, range 10 - 200 in), birds were counted along three parallel, simultaneous transects covering the full area of bogs. Independent variables evaluated were the size (ha), altitude (in above sea level), slope (0-90 degrees), presence/absence of small permanent watercourses and cover (%) of water, meadows and cushion-like Yareta shrubs in each study bog. Grazing intensity was estimated by counting the number of faecal pellet groups (of alpacas and other livestock) inside a one-metre-wide band transect.
   Results: Results support the view that bogs operate as local "hotspots" for birds, as they maintain species associated with different habitats, such as rivers and lakes (Anas flavirostris, Anas specularoides. etc). wet meadows (Vanellus resplendens, Chloephaga melanoptera, Cinclodes fuscus, Lessonia oreas, etc.) or bunch-grass steppes (Metriopelia aymara, Thinocorus orbignyianus, etc.). Bird species richness and numbers were positively correlated with bog size and, after controlling for this effect, species richness increased in those and upland bogs crossed by small watercourses during the dry period. This supports the key role of water availability on the bird communities of these steppes. No effect of grazing intensity and other habitat features were recorded.
   Conclusions: From a conservation perspective, bog size and the presence of permanent watercourses seem to be two focal criteria for prioritizing relevant bogs for protection and can also be used as key guidelines for evaluating the pervasive effects of the reduction and alteration of bogs by public works (roads), agricultural encroachment or draining.

AB While iron (Fe) has been proposed to constrain dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export by forming precipitation (Fe-OC) in peatlands, uncertainties remain about the potential interactions between Fe and nitrogen. Such interactions are important for Fe and carbon exports as they can dissolve the Fe-OC through Fe reduction. Here we studied the reduction of ferrihydrite-OC (Fh-OC) following incubation with microbes from agricultural and natural peatlands under differing nitrogen availability, with high-throughput sequencing to identify microbial mechanisms. Our results showed that in agricultural peatlands, high nitrogen levels (100 mg kg(-1)) modified the composition and abundance of iron-reducing bacteria, increasing reduction rates of Fh-OC (0.09-0.20 kg Fe day(-1) ha(-1)) above the low N treatments (< 100 mg kg(-1)) (p < 0.05). However, reduction rates of Fh-OC and iron-reducing community in natural peatlands were far less affected. Our findings suggest that N-induced microbial reduction of Fe-OC may create the potential for greater Fe and carbon exports from agricultural peatlands to aquatic systems.

AB Organic soils are an excellent substrate for commercial lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) farming; however, drainage accelerates oxidation of the surface layer and reduces the water holding capacity, which is often lethal for crops that are sensitive to water stress. In this case study, we analyzed 942 peat samples from a large cultivated peatland complex (18.7 km(2)) in southern Quebec, Canada, and demonstrated from spatial and temporal patterns that agriculture resulted in a compacted layer below the root zone. We grouped the samples based on the year in which the corresponding fields were created on the previously undisturbed peatland (cutoff years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and discovered that bulk density has continued to increase, partly due to the overburden pressure, while organic matter has continued to decline since the fields were reclaimed and drained in phases between 1955 and 2006. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in the upper 20 cm was remarkably lower on fields older than 10 yr (p = 0.0973 for Wilcoxon rank test), with more samples having a Ks < 2.0 x 10(-3) yr. Soil water available capacity (SWAC) was between approximately 5 and 33 cm on fields reclaimed after 2000, while samples from fields reclaimed before 2000 had a lower SWAC between 2 and 23 cm (groups discernable at p = 0.0203). It is possible, however, that the greatest rate of change in Ks and SWAC occurred within even a year of reclamation. The results of this study call for active measures to reduce organic soil degradation such as reducing tillage and on-field traffic or following a crop rotation scheme.

AB Extensive drainage of UK lowland peat soils for agricultural production is considered a major contribution to the rate of degradation and the loss of peat resources. Microbial oxidation resulting from drainage accelerates decay rates of organic matter and the release of CO2 to the atmosphere and contributes to severe subsidence. We examined the effect of soil moisture, temperature and nutrient amendment on soil CO2 respiration rates from a low-lying peat grassland and a low-lying peatland under intensive arable farming in the UK. Soil samples were obtained from three different depths and equilibrated at a range of moisture contents under four prescribed soil water potentials (-0.1 to -10 m). The samples were incubated in the laboratory and the influence of temperature (10, 22 and 30 degrees C) and N addition (C/N ratio of 10:1, 5:1 and 2.5:1) on peat respiration was measured. In addition, field soil samples were analysed to determine the microbial community structure using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis technique. Respiration ranged from 0.8 to 15.0 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1) at 10 degrees C and from 4.0 to 9.9 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C for different peats. Q(10) value between 22 and 30 degrees C ranged from 0.9 to 8.2. In contrast, Q(10) value between 10 and 22 degrees C varied from 0.2 to 2.2 suggesting, in some cases, an increase in respiration rate with decreasing temperature. Generally, temperature had a greater effect on the soils respiratory activity than the moisture content in drier pears, however soil moisture was determined to be the dominant parameter at higher moisture content. At high moisture content, the respiration rates at 10 degrees C exceeded those at 22 and 30 degrees C in four of the soils. Respiration varied with the degree of peat degradation and soil moisture content. Variations in soil moisture content did not always have a significant effect on CO2 emission in the humified surface pears but at higher soil moisture the CO2-C mineralisation rate of deeper, more fibrous peat horizons was higher at 10 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. Metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) ranged from 3.6 to 10.2 mg CO2-C h(-1) g biomass-C-1 in surface horizons and from 5.6 to 12.3 mg CO2-C h(-1) g biomass-C-1 in more fibrous pears, suggesting less available organic carbon at depth. N additions increased CO2-C mineralisation, with the maximum rate of respiration occurring at pressure potentials between -0.5 and -1 m. Peat samples at field moisture content were also analysed to determine phenotypic microbial community structure using PLFA analysis. This indicated that, microbial community structure varied between drained surface and saturated subsurface horizons. However, there was no difference in the microbial community structure between horizons when subjected to greater drainage. The effects of temperature and moisture on respiration found in deeper horizons and the phenotypic microbial community structure suggest that psychrophilic microbes predominate and that minimal drainage optimises their oxidation of peat.

AB Organic soils are a main source of direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas (GHG). Observed N2O emissions from organic soils are highly variable in space and time, which causes high uncertainties in national emission inventories. Those uncertainties could be reduced when relating the upscaling process to a priori-identified key drivers by using available N2O observations from plot scale in empirical approaches. We used the empirical fuzzy modelling approach MODE to identify main drivers for N2O and utilize them to predict the spatial emission pattern of European organic soils. We conducted a meta-study with a total amount of 659 annual N2O measurements, which was used to derive separate models for different land use types. We applied our models to available, spatially explicit input driver maps to upscale N2O emissions at European level and compared the inventory with recently published IPCC emission factors. The final statistical models explained up to 60% of the N2O variance. Our study results showed that cropland and grasslands emitted the highest N2O fluxes 0.98 +/- 1.08 and 0.58 +/- 1.03 gN(2)O-N m(-2) a(-1), respectively. High fluxes from cropland sites were mainly controlled by low soil pH value and deep-drained ground-water tables. Grassland hotspot emissions were strongly related to high amount of N-fertilizer inputs and warmer winter temperatures. In contrast, N2O fluxes from natural peatlands were predominantly low (0.07 +/- 0.27 gN(2)O-N m(-2) a(-1)) and we found no relationship with the tested drivers. The total inventory for direct N2O emissions from organic soils in Europe amount up to 149.5 GgN(2)O-N a(-1), which also included fluxes from forest and peat extraction sites and exceeds the inventory calculated by IPCC emission factors of 87.4 GgN(2)O-N a(-1). N2O emissions from organic soils represent up to 13% of total European N2O emissions reported in the European Union (EU) greenhouse gas inventory of 2011 from only 7% of the EU area. Thereby the model demonstrated that the major part (85 %) of the inventory is induced by anthropogenic management, which shows the significant reduction potential by rewetting and extensification of agriculturally used peat soils.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions were compared for an intensively and extensively managed agricultural area on peat soils in the Netherlands to evaluate the effect of reduced management on the CH4 balance. Chamber measurements (photoacoustic methods) for CH4 were performed for a period of three years in the contributing landscape elements in the research sites. Various factors influencing CH4 emissions were evaluated and temperature of water and soil was found to be the main driver in both sites. For upscaling of CH4 fluxes to landscape scale, regression models were used which were specific for each of the contributing landforms. Ditches and bordering edges were emission hotspots and emitted together between 60% and 70% of the total terrestrial CH4 emissions. Annual terrestrial CH4 fluxes were estimated to be 203 (+/- 48%), 162 (+/- 60%) and 146 (+/- 60%) kg CH4 ha(-1) and 157 (+/- 63%), 180 (+/- 54%) and 163 (+/- 59%) kg CH4 ha(-1) in the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, for 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. About 70% of the CH4 was emitted in the summer period. Farm based emissions caused per year an additional 257 kg CH4 ha(-1) and 172 kg CH4 ha(-1) for the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, respectively. To further evaluate the effect of agricultural activity on the CH4 balance, the annual CH4 fluxes of the two managed sites were also compared to the emissions of a natural peat site with no management and high ground water levels. By comparing the terrestrial and additional farm based emissions of the three sites, we finally concluded that transformation of intensively managed agricultural land to nature development will lead to an increase in terrestrial CH4 emission, but will not by definition lead to a significant increase in CH4 emission when farm based emissions are included.

AB [1] We report on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements conducted with the eddy covariance method over agricultural peat soil in the 2-year period between October 2000 and October 2002. In 2001, spring barley and undersown grass were sown on the site. After the barley harvest, the perennial forage grass was left to grow, so that in 2002 the field was growing grass. A higher maximum net CO2 uptake was observed for barley than for grass during the height of the summer, peaking at about -1.0 and - 0.75 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The maximum nighttime total ecosystem respiration was measured in July and was similar for both crops, about 0.35 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). During the growing season the field acted as a daily CO2 sink for only 40 days in barley versus 84 days in grass. In the winter the average carbon dioxide efflux varied from 15.6 to 16.5 mug CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The annual NEE of the agricultural peat soil growing barley and grass was 771 +/- 104 and 290 +/- 91 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. The longer net CO2 uptake period was the main reason for the lower annual NEE for grass; however, owing to the higher amount of grass biomass produced the net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated as the sum of NEE and removed biomass, was slightly larger for grass (452 g C m(-2)) than for barley (336 g C m(-2)). These results show that the organic peat is still undergoing rapid decomposition after more than 100 years of cultivation activity. In addition, switching from an annual to a perennial crop did not turn the field into a CO2 sink, at least during a 1-year period.

AB Peat soils comprise a large part of the western and northern Netherlands. Drainage for agriculture has caused increased soil aeration which has stimulated decomposition and, hence, soil subsidence, currently amounting to 1-2 cm/yr. River water is supplied to these peat areas in summer to prevent drying out of the peat soils. Saltwater intrusion and evaporation make this surface water slightly brackish during drought periods. In addition, brackish seepage can surface more easily during such dry periods. We performed an incubation experiment in which the effects of salinization on aerobic decomposition and mineralization of shallow peat samples and anaerobic decomposition and mineralization of deep peat samples were studied. We considered four different types of peat samples: peat sampled in agricultural peat meadows and in nature reserves, originally formed under either eutrophic or oligotrophic conditions. The aerobic decomposition was approximately reduced by 50% after salinization, whereas the anaerobic decomposition rates remained unchanged. Remarkably, the response to salinization did not differ between the peat types and land uses. Ammonium concentrations increased while nitrate concentrations decreased after salinization, probably as a result of reduced nitrification. Especially in the oligotrophic peat, ammonium concentrations increased substantially. Phosphate concentrations increased, possibly caused by changes in desorption and adsorption processes due to higher ion concentrations. DOC concentrations decreased in the brackish samples due to precipitation. Furthermore, the eutrophic peat samples showed increasing sulfate concentrations, both in oxic and anoxic incubations, which was attributed to pyrite oxidation. Independently of salinization, nitrification rates were higher in the agricultural, fertilized, peat soils. In conclusion, while salinization might reduce subsidence rates, it will have adverse effects on water quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Loss of organic matter from cultivated peat soils is a threat to farmers, due to the surface subsidence associated with organic matter loss, and to the atmosphere, due to CO2 and N2O emissions from the soil. In a three-year field experiment (2015-2017) on a drained, cultivated fen peat in southern Sweden, we tested whether reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) perform better on peat soils than the commonly grown timothy grass (Phleurn pratense L.), without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In the experiment, we compared yield, nutrient uptake, penetration resistance and loss of organic matter measured as greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O and CH4). Yield of timothy was significantly lower than that of reed canary grass and tall fescue in 2016, and lower than that of reed canary grass in 2017. Yield level increased over time, with total dry matter yield in 2017 of 11.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for timothy, 13.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for tall fescue and 14.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for reed canary grass. Total removal of all macronutrients in 2016 was higher in reed canary grass and tall fescue than in timothy. For nitrogen (N), reed canary grass removed a total of 173 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), tall fescue 169 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and timothy 121 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), while the fertilisation rate was only 50 kg N ha(-1). There were no differences in trafficability, measured as penetration resistance. Measurements of greenhouse gas emissions in the snow-free season in 2016 and 2017 using manual dark chambers (CO2, N2O and CH4) and in 2016 automatic dark chambers (CO2) revealed only small differences in CO2 emissions between the treatments. The N2O emissions were also low and CH4 emissions were very low and in general negative. The estimated carbon capture efficiency (ratio of C in aboveground biomass plus roots to emitted CO2-C measured by the automatic chambers) for the growing season (May-October) in 2016 was lowest for timothy (0.61) and higher for reed canary grass and tall fescue (0.70 and 0.70, respectively). Reed canary grass and tall fescue are thus promising alternatives to timothy on peat soils regarding yield, nutrient removal and carbon capture efficiency.

AB Increasing areas of altered wetland are being restored by re-flooding the soil. Evidence in the literature indicates that this practice can induce the redox-mediated release of soil nutrients, thereby increasing the risk of diffuse water pollution. However, for the sake of improving wedand management decisions, there is a need for more detailed studies of the underlying relationship between the hydrological and redox dynamics that explain this risk; this is particularly the case in agricultural peatlands that are commonly targeted for the creation of lowland wet grassland. A 12-month field study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between hydrological fluctuations and soil redox potential (Eh) in a nutrient-rich peat field (32 g N kg(-1) and 1100 mg P kg(-1) in the surface 0-30 cm soil) that had been restored as lowland wet grassland from intensive arable production. Field tensiometers were installed at the 30-, 60- and 90-cm soil depths, and Pt electrodes at the 10-, 30-, 60- and 90-cm depths, for daily logging of soil water tension and Eh, respectively. The values for soil water tension displayed a strong negative relationship (P < 0.001) with monthly dip well observations of water table height. Calculations of soil water potential from the logged tension values were used, therefore, to provide a detailed profile of field water level and, together with precipitation data, explained some of the variation in Eh. For example, during the summer, alternating periods of aerobism (Eh > 330 mV) in the surface, 0-10 cm layer of peat coincided with intense precipitation events. Redox potential throughout the 30-100 cm profile also fluctuated seasonally; indeed, at all depths Eh displayed a strong, negative relationship (P < 0.001) with water table height over the 12-month study period. However, Eh throughout the 30-100 cm profile remained relatively low (< 230 mV), indicating permanently reduced conditions that are associated with denitrification and reductive dissolution of Fe-bound P. The implications of these processes in the N- and P-rich peat for wetland plant diversity and water quality are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Drainage ditches are a common aquatic habitat in the lowland agricultural landscape of north-western Europe. The invertebrate fauna of these waters is poorly known compared with that of the semi-natural wetland fragments found in this region. While most wetlands are designated as nature reserves, drainage ditches are generally viewed purely as hydrological infrastructure in support of agriculture.
   2. To assess the conservation value for aquatic invertebrates of these man-made habitats compared with that of wetland fragments, the taxonomic composition and life-history characteristics of invertebrate assemblages inhabiting nine small lakes and nine ditches in peatlands in the Netherlands were compared, as well as the environmental characteristics potentially influencing assemblage structure.
   3. Although ditches comprised a smaller water volume, contained less diverse vegetation, displayed larger fluctuations in nutrient concentrations and were regularly managed, the total number of invertebrate taxa recorded per taxonomic group was comparable with that in small lakes, as was the number of nationally uncommon to very rare taxa.
   4. Similarity in life-history characteristics between the two water-body types was high, except that a higher proportion of atmospheric air breathers was found in ditches, and more plant miners and collectorfilterers in small lakes.
   5. On a regional scale, a relatively high inter-ditch taxon dissimilarity was observed, resulting in total diversity estimates for ditches exceeding those of small lakes.
   6. This study showed that drainage ditches can be a significant habitat type for aquatic invertebrates. In the Netherlands, water bodies in peatland agricultural areas can contain a diverse invertebrate fauna, similar to that of water bodies in nearby nature reserves.

AB The contents of lignin extracted by a mixture of dioxane, water, and hydrochloric acid was determined in peat-forming plants (moss, herbaceous, and woody) corresponding to types of peat, cultivated and virgin peat soils, and stubby barley residues. The balance experiments in the field and in the laboratory over 12-36 months showed that, upon the decomposition of the peat-forming plants, the part of lignin available for microorganisms was humified and mineralized, while the unavailable part accumulated in the peat. A close correlation was revealed between the lignin content in the peat-forming plants and the humic acid concentration in the peat. Upon agricultural use, the lignin content in the plow horizons of the peat soils did not change if the degree of the peat decomposition was identical to that in the virgin soils or if it was higher by 2-2.5% if the peat decomposition rate increased.

TI EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AND CULTIVATION ON PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES OF PEAT
   SOILS IN NEW-ZEALAND
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MINNESOTA
AB The effect of development and cultivation on the physical properties of two peat soils formed from restiad/sedge and sphagnum peat and developed for agriculture in the Hauraki Plains, New Zealand is reported by comparing physical properties of the plough layer (0-15 cm) and the relatively unaffected underlying peat (15-40 cm). Drainage and cultivation reduced soil moisture content, increased bulk density and reduced organic matter content. Bulk density was correlated with organic matter content only for the plough layer and indicates that bulk density alone is not a good indicator of decomposition in weakly decomposed peat soils in this region. Moisture retention curves indicated that a large amount of the water in the soil could not be removed at high suctions (up to 65% of the water was retained at suctions of 1500 kPa) and may cause moisture stress for plants, particulary in the plough layer of sphagnum peat, despite the high water content of the soil. This has important implications for maintaining a water table which maintains an adequate available water content for plants in the unsaturated zone immediately above the water table.
   Hydraulic conductivity differed between peat types in both the plough layer and the underlying peat. The presence of a root layer at 35-40 cm in the restiad/sedge peat was considered to substantially influence the readings and has important implications for drainage design in the soil.
   A simple method for measuring shrinkage in peat soils which involves coating natural clods in a saran resin is presented. A shrinkage curve indicated that shrinkage in peat is directly related to the gravimetric water content and does not contain zones of residual or structural shrinkage which are often associated with mineral soils. It is suggested, therefore, that a simple linear model based upon normal shrinkage will successfully predict volume changes associated with drainage of peat soils for agriculture.

The sorption of methane and nitrous oxide is studied. Emissions of greenhouse gases from peat soils of different degrees of cultivation are estimated. The highest methane emission is revealed in the uncultivated peat soil (the control variant). The maximum rate of organic matter mineralization as estimated by the intensity of the carbon dioxide emission is seen in the agrogenic peat soil cultivated for 30 years. The maximum denitrification activity is revealed in the buried cultivated peat soil. The main product of the denitrification processes in all the studied soils is represented by molecular nitrogen.

Peat was mined from the Klejniki deposit, (Hajnowka municipality, Podlaskie province) in the north-eastern part of Poland. It was found that peat can be used for power generation, in the air-dry moisture condition. Peat parameters are similar to lignite. It can also be suitable for the production of horticultural substrates and incorporated into soil as a component for improving physical and chemical properties. The examined peat fulfills the requirements of for agricultural applications.

AB Organic soils comprise a large yet fragile carbon (C) store in the global C cycle. Drainage, necessary for agriculture and forestry, triggers rapid decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), typically increasing in the order forest < grassland < cropland. However, there is also large variation in decomposition due to differences in hydrological conditions, climate and specific management. Here we studied the role of SOM composition on peat decomposability in a variety of differently managed drained organic soils. We collected a total of 560 samples from 21 organic cropland, grassland and forest soils in Switzerland, monitored their CO2 emission rates in lab incubation experiments over 6 months at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) and related them to various soil characteristics, including bulk density, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and elemental ratios (C = N, H / C and O / C). CO2 release ranged from 6 to 195 mg CO(2-)Cg(-1) SOC at 10 degrees C and from 12 to 423 mg g(-1) at 20 degrees C. This variation occurring under controlled conditions suggests that besides soil water regime, weather and management, SOM composition may be an underestimated factor that determines CO2 fluxes measured in field experiments. However, correlations between the investigated chemical SOM characteristics and CO2 emissions were weak. The latter also did not show a dependence on land-use type, although peat under forest was decomposed the least. High CO2 emissions in some topsoils were probably related to the accrual of labile crop residues. A comparison with published CO2 rates from incubated mineral soils indicated no difference in SOM decomposability between these soil classes, suggesting that accumulation of recent, labile plant materials that presumably account for most of the evolved CO2 is not systematically different between mineral and organic soils. In our data set, temperature sensitivity of decomposition (Q(10) on average 2.57 +/- 0.05) was the same for all land uses but lowest below 60 cm in croplands and grasslands. This, in turn, indicates a relative accumulation of recalcitrant peat in topsoils.

AB The sorption of three herbicides (alachlor, atrazine and linuron) on samples from six peats of progressive degree of maturity (fibric, hemic or sapric types) and soil samples (dryland agricultural Calcic Luvisol amended with the peats) was determined. The extent of the sorption was examined in terms of peat maturity (up to 220 analytical descriptors of the peat material). In most cases, a sorption enhancement effect was observed in the peat-soil system compared with the sum of the sorption in peat and soil alone, i.e., a positive interaction leading to an increase in soil matrix reactive sites. The analytical characteristics of humic and bitumen peat subfractions were useful in forecasting sorption performance. This was the case for high molecular weight hydrophobic fractions, the extent of the alkyl domain in humic substances and oxygen-containing groups. Correspondence analysis illustrated how different characteristics of the peats played a distinct role in sorption in the herbicide-peat system or in the soil-peat-herbicide system. In the former system, there was a relevant bearing of parameters indicating low peat maturity, whereas in the second the sorption was mainly explained by peat colloidal properties, including the concentration and base saturation of oxygen-containing functional groups.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Drainage, required for agriculture, aerates these organic soils and triggers rapid peat decomposition. In turn, cultivation of organic soils is also accompanied by input of young organic carbon (YOC) from plant residues. The extent to which YOC inputs compensate for oxidative peat loss is unknown. Furthermore, the lability of YOC in organic soils introduced by cultivation has never been examined. Here we studied the amount and lability of YOC in two adjacent drained organic soils by a combined C-13 and C-14 approach. Soils haVe been under intensive arable use for several decades and were both cultivated, inter alia, with corn, a C4 plant. In 1995, one soil was converted from annual cropping to permanent cultivation with Miscanthus x giganteus, another C4 plant, while the other was converted to permanent C3 grassland in 2009. Using delta C-13 signatures, we analysed the fractions of C4 derived carbon in the soil and in CO2, during one month of soil incubation. This enabled us i) to estimate C4-C accumulation in both soils, and ii) to assess the lability of C4-C carbon that accumulated either at least five years prior to sampling (current grassland soil) or until sampling (current Miscanthus soil). The fraction of C4-C derived SOC in the Miscanthus soil was 0.19 +/- 0.024 in the top 30 cm, corresponding to an accumulation rate of 1.6 +/- 0.2 t C4-C ha-(1) yr(-1). This accumulation rate is in the range of rates found for fertile mineral soils cultivated with Miscanthus. Yet, this C4-C accumulation rate is below average C-losses of agriculturally used organic soils. The grassland soil contained a smaller fraction of 0.08 +/- 0.002 C4-C in SOC. The rates of total CO2 emitted from the two soils did not differ, but the fraction of CO2 derived from C4-C was significantly higher in the Miscanthus soil (0.53 0.05) than in the grassland (0.29 0.04) soil. Hence, in both soils YOC was more labile than bulk SOC. The ratio between the fraction of decomposing C4-C and C4-C in SOC was the same for both soils indicating a similar lability of currently accumulated and aged C4-C. In both soils, the 14C age of emitted CO2 was younger than that of SOC, confirming an increased lability of YOC over old SOC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands globally are highly threatened by agriculture, and damage associated with it, such as invasion by alien species and the impacts of fertilizers and pesticides. South African palmiet wetlands make an interesting case study to investigate this, as they are valuable valley-bottom, peat-forming systems, highly threatened by agricultural development. Currently most agriculture in these palmiet wetlands is marginal (low agricultural productivity) due to the challenges of farming a system that experiences severe floods and erodes rapidly, forming gullies, when wetland vegetation is disturbed. The current situation seems to be a lose-lose situation for nature and society. We aimed to assess this conflict between water-related services and agriculture objectively by comparing provision of fifteen ecosystem services by degraded and pristine sections of three palmiet wetlands using a rapid ecosystem service assessment tool (WET-Ecoservices). To validate this technique, we compared results to those obtained from examining three key ecosystem service complexes in slightly more detail. We found that pristine palmiet wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services to society, which are currently being compromised for private, marginal agricultural gain. These pristine wetlands sequester between 21 and 41 g.m(-2) of carbon per year, have nitrogen and phosphorus uptake efficiencies of 62-85% and 16-89% respectively, and provide about 16 times more flood attenuation relative to degraded ones. The full impact of degradation on wetland ecosystem services was not entirely captured by the rapid ecosystem service assessment tool: WET-Ecoservices. We suggest some adaptations to this tool for the valley-bottom wetland hydro-geomorphic unit. Overall, these wetlands have high potential for incorporation into a Payments for Ecosystem Services scheme, due to the ecosystem services provided and their position above important municipal dams. We recommend collaboration between private landowners struggling with marginal agriculture, and decision makers in cities dealing with water shortages and debt to ensure the most efficient and judicious use of these palmiet wetland ecosystem services.

TI Cultivating the climate: socio-economic prospects and consequences of
   climate-friendly peat land management in Germany
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Agricultural peat land use; Reduction of greenhouse gases; Farm survey;
   Economic consequences
AB About 30% of the world's soil carbon is stored in peat soils. Peat land's functional principle of carbon storage greatly depends on management strategies. Therefore, agricultural peat land use becomes a focal point of interest in the current debate on climate protection. Agricultural management demands a drawdown of the water-level that causes degradation of the soils, as well as trace-gas emissions which have a negative impact on greenhouse-gas balance. Climate-friendly peat land management strategies, however, demand enhanced groundwater tables and decreased land-use intensity. Against this background, we analyse ways of re-organising agricultural peat land use within a case study located in Germany, where intensive peat land use accounts for 2.3-5.1% of the country's overall greenhouse-gas emission. The study takes place in six regions which represent all possible socio-economic and natural conditions with regard to the range of existing peat land types, range of management and cultivation types, as well as the range of land-use intensity. To analyse potentials and effects of re-organising peat land use, stakeholder workshops and extensive farm surveys were carried out. The results indicate that reservations exist as regards a re-organisation of peat land management. Financial compensation for farmers appears necessary. The results also show that the potential of rearrangement throughout the regions varies significantly, mainly according to the existing level of interconnection and cooperation between local stakeholders, the technical feasibility of restoration and water logging and the level of agricultural profitability of peat land cultivation with regard to income, capital commitment and the share of affected peat land area.

AB A paludicultural experiment was conducted in the Massaciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, IT) to test this restoration strategy to reduce water eutrophication and subsidence phenomena of peat soils. The species tested were three perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRGs), Arundo donax, Miscanthus xgiganteus, Phragmites australis, and two woody crops managed as short-rotation coppice (SRC), Populus x canadensis 'Oudemberg' and Salix alba 'Dimitrios', each of these species promising high productivity under wet conditions. The study aimed to test the combustibility of their harvested biomass as a function of crop age and harvest date. Parameters important for combustion and exhaust gas emissions were analyzed: ash content, concentration of chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and sodium (Na). Results indicated that the SRC crops appeared the most suitable for combustion. A general improvement in biomass quality with crop age was found for all crops tested, showing a significantly lower concentration of critical elements (Cl, N, S) and ash content in the 3rd year after planting. The biomass quality of PRGs was not significantly improved by a delayed harvest in February, as successfully practiced in northern Europe. In general, although concentrations of the most important critical elements were higher than expected for all crops, the calculated higher heating values were promising. Combustibility performances could be improved by finding an optimal mixture of SRC and PRG biomass. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The escalating demand of shallot has forced the increase of domestic production, including through extension of harvest area by utilization of arable land on peatland. This study was aimed to analyze genetic profile of shallot adapted in peatland areas using SSR markers. Twenty-one shallot genotypes were tested in the field and eighteen primers dispersed throughout the genome was applied to analyze genetic diversity of the peatland-adapted shallots. Phenotypic evaluation revealed that shallot yield potential ranged from 6.66 to 14.21 t/ha. Of these, seven shallot clones (11 NA, 1111 TA, 12 NA, 12 NC, 20 NA and 22 N) had good yield potential and comparable with those of five released shallot varieties. Nine out of 12 shallot clones were moderately resistant to Alternaria porii. Clustering analysis showed that shallot genotypes were clustered into two main groups, Clustered I and II which consisted of 13 and 8 genotypes, respectively. The closest genetic relatedness was observed between 8NC and 8NA (0.85), while the farthest ones was between 11NA and Kramat2 (0.51). This result implies that cross combination between 11NA and Kramat2 is valuable and suitable for breeding programs aimed at improving shallot potential yield in the future.

AB Drainage of peatlands affects the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Organic soils used for agriculture contribute a large proportion of anthropogenic GHG emissions, and on-farm mitigation options are important. This field study investigated whether choice of a cropping system can be used to mitigate emissions of N2O and influence CH4 fluxes from cultivated organic and carbon-rich soils during the growing season. Ten different sites in southern Sweden representing peat soils, peaty marl and gyttja clay, with a range of different soil properties, were used for on-site measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. The fluxes during the growing season from soils under two different crops grown in the same field and same environmental conditions were monitored. Crop intensities varied from grasslands to intensive potato cultivation. The results showed no difference in median seasonal N2O emissions between the two crops compared. Median seasonal emissions ranged from 0 to 919 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1), with peaks on individual sampling occasions of up to 3317 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1). Nitrous oxide emissions differed widely between sites, indicating that soil properties are a regulating factor. However, pH was the only soil factor that correlated with N2O emissions (negative exponential correlation). The type of crop grown on the soil did not influence CH4 fluxes. Median seasonal CH4 flux from the different sites ranged from uptake of 36 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) to release of 4.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1). From our results, it was concluded that farmers cannot mitigate N2O emissions during the growing season or influence CH4 fluxes by changing the cropping system in the field.

AB This paper presents the result of palynological research of peat relicts, found in the Westerkoggepolder (North-Holland, The Netherlands). In general, such relicts of peat in the actual landscape point to an extensive peat cover in the past that disappeared due to land reclamation and agricultural management. Improvement of the drainage in historical time resulted in shrinkage and bio-oxidation of peat. This caused a land surface lowering of at least 3 m and a transformation of Histosols in original peat deposits into eluvial clay covers with Mollic Gleysols. Similar processes occur in other regions in the world were people settled in areas with histosols and reclaimed land for food production. The last relicts of the former peat cover are valuable parts of the national soil archives and deserve the status of geoheritage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB This article shows that peatland cultivation was, in in initial phase from the Mos to the 1930s, an important catalyst for the adoption of fertilizers in Sweden. The most important agency promoting this development was the Mosskulturforeningen, the Swedish Peatland Cultivation Association, established in 1886. Through its scientific work, sponsorship of field trails, and dissemination of knowledge, the Mosskulturforeningen resulted in fertilizers being made available over a large geographical area and gaining acceptance amongst farmers. The take up of fertilizers involved not only the adoption of new techniques but also new ways of thinking.

AB Adsorption of lead from an aqueous solution by both agricultural peat moss and soil has been measured. The results may be described by a Langmuir isotherm model. Adsorption isotherms fitted the ''H'' type described in the Giles classification. Saturation adsorption was reached at equilibrium lead concentrations > 3000 mg/L for peat, compared with similar to 250 mg/L for soil. Calculation of the isotherm parameters showed the maximum lead adsorption to be 150 mg lead/g of peat. This compared with only 12.64 mg/g of lead for soil alone.
   Several tests were carried out to evaluate the lead binding capacity of peat in a spiked soil sample. Results from leaching tests (Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, TCLP, at pH 2.9) on soil-peat mixtures confirmed the excellent metal binding capacity of peat in the samples tested. The amount of lead leached from a soil sample, spiked with 1840 mg/kg of water-soluble lead, decreased with increasing amounts of peat loading. Total fixation was achieved at a peat loading of 20%.

AB In addition to traditional sources, drained peat soils have been found to be a significant source of nitrogen in Estonia. As a result, supplementary measures are required to improve water quality in rivers. Modelling is a widespread method to select means for improving water quality. At present, modelling of nitrogen in rivers has been concentrated on the influence of agricultural activity. However, drained peat can increase nitrogen concentrations even without fertilization and farming activities. This investigation describes the attempt to model water quality in the watershed with a large share of drained peat soils. The results showed a good alignment between measured and modelled nitrate concentrations using the MACRO and the SOILN for MACRO models. Some measures to improve water quality were tested using these models.

AB Throughout the world many extensive wetlands, such as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California (hereafter, the Delta), have been drained for agriculture, resulting ill land-surface subsidence of peat soils. The purpose of this project was to study the in situ effects of wetland drainage oil the remaining peat in the Delta. Peat cores were retrieved from four drained, farmed islands and four relatively undisturbed, marsh islands. Core samples were analyzed for bulk density and percent organic Carbon. Macrofossils ill the peat were dated using radiocarbon age determination. The peat from the Canned islands is highly distinct from marsh island peat. Bulk density of peat From the farmed islands is generally greater than that of the marsh islands at a given organic carbon content. Oil the farmed islands. increased bulk density, which is, an indication of compaction, decreases with depth within the unoxidized peat zone, whereas, oil the marsh islands, bulk density is generally constant with depth except near the surface. Approximately 55-80% of the original peat layer oil the farmed islands has been lost due to land-surface subsidence. For the center regions of the farmed islands, this translates into an estimated loss of between 2900-5700 metric tons of organic carbon/hectare. most of the intact peal just below the currently farmed soil layer is over 4000 years old. Peat loss Will continue as long as the artificial water table oil the farmed islands is held below the land surface.

AB Stream and wetland-landscape patterns in watersheds that drain active-cranberry bogs, abandoned-cranberry bogs, and forest land with no history of cranberry agriculture were compared at three different levels of detail. Stream-pattern variables included drainage density, sinuosity, and the number, density, and length of ditches. Landscape-pattern measures included wetland-patch structure (the size, shape, and number of wetland patches) and cover-type composition. The results of the stream-pattern analysis indicated that the effect of past and present cranberry agriculture on stream-drainage patterns was limited primarily to the occurrence of ditches. A greater number, density, median length, and total length of ditches were observed in cranberry and abandoned-bog basins compared to forest basins. Drainage density and sinuosity of the remaining non-ditched stream segments did not differ between basin types. Excluding areas of active-cranberry bogs where the native vegetation was removed, there was no significant difference in the relative number, size, shape, and composition of the remaining vegetation-cover types between the three basin types. The exact type and extent of vegetation removed to establish bogs in the active and abandoned basins are not known, but based on soil type and vegetation class associations, it was estimated that the largest losses were of pitch pine lowlands and cedar swamps.

AB We tested an isotope method based on C-13 pulse-chase labelling for determining the fractional contribution of soil microbial respiration to overall soil respiration in an organic soil (cutaway peatland, eastern Finland), cultivated with the bioenergy crop, reed canary grass. The plants were exposed to (CO2)-C-13 for five hours and the label was thereafter determined in CO2 derived from the soil root system. A two-pool isotope mixing model was used to separate sources of respiration. The isotopic approach showed that a minimum of 50% of the total CO2 originated from soil-microbial respiration. Even though the method uses undisturbed soil plant systems, it has limitations concerning the experimental determination of the true isotopic signal of all components contributing to autotrophic respiration. A trenching experiment which was comparatively conducted resulted in a 71% fractional contribution of soil-microbial respiration. This value was likely overestimated. Further studies are needed to evaluate critically the output from these two partitioning approaches.

AB Due to geochemical processes, peat soils often have elevated concentrations of trace elements, which are gradually released following drainage for agriculture. Our objectives were to use incubation temperatures to vary microbial activity in two metalliferous peats (M7 acidic peat and M3 neutral peat) from the Elba, New York region, and to use periodic leaching to assess the extent of trace element release from these soils. Dried soils were mixed with glass beads to maintain aeration, moistened, and incubated at 4, 16, 28, and 37degreesC in 10-cm-diameter x 8-cm-tall columns. Five incubation-leaching cycles were performed, each consisting of 7.3 d of incubation (28 d for the final cycle) followed by 16 h of leaching with synthetic acid rain at 2.5 mm h(-1). Microbial activity was determined initially and after the final leaching by measuring C mineralization following glucose stimulation. Cumulative respiration results were ranked 28 > 16 > 4 > 37degreesC, with M7 acidic peat respiration values greater than M3 neutral peat at each temperature. Initial leachate pH levels were between 2 and 4, with acidification less pronounced and shorter-lived for the M3 peat. Leachate S, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NO3-N, and trace elements declined with successive leachings (rebounding slightly in the final M3 leachate), with concentrations typically greater in the M7 leachate. Elemental losses followed the same general ranking (28 > 16 > 4 > 37degreesC); losses at 28degreesC were 15 to 22% for As, Cd, Ni, and Zn from the M7 peat; losses from M3 were comparable only for Cu (1%) and Ni (19%). The correlation of respiration with S, DOC, and trace elements losses indicates that microbial processes mediated the release of trace elements in both peat soils. Neutral M3 peat pH levels limited losses of most analytes.

AB The policy and practice of ecological restoration and conservation in China obtained some remarkable results. For example, Sphagnum moss growing on abandoned farmland, which was peatland before agricultural use, has rapidly expanded the wetland area in SW China. Microorganisms such as testate amoebae are sensitive to environmental change and thus have been widely used as ecological indicators in various habitats. We analyzed differently aged Sphagnum growing plots on a Sphagnum growing farmland and natural Sphagnum plots in SW China to examine how Sphagnum-dwelling testate amoeba communities and corresponding protozoic silicon (Si) pools respond to ecological restoration practice. We found that abundance, taxon richness, and diversity of testate amoebae were higher in Sphagnum growing farmland plots compared to natural Sphagnum plots. Protozoic Si pools showed an increase with Sphagnum growing time representing increased Si accumulation by idiosomic testate amoeba shells. However, protozoic Si pools were negatively correlated with taxon richness and diversity of testate amoebae. Our results showed that (i) natural Sphagnum plots were not characterized by the expected higher biodiversity of testate amoebae compared to Sphagnum growing plots and (ii) consequently protozoic Si pool quantity in natural Sphagnum plots was less driven by biodiversity of testate amoebae than expected. We concluded our results to underline the value of (i) environmental restoration policy in general and (ii) testate amoeba communities and corresponding protozoic Si pools for Si cycling in restoration areas of peatlands in particular. Based on our results, we recommend a sustainable cultivation of Sphagnum moss and an additional establishment of protected areas, where no Sphagnum harvesting occurs. These protected Sphagnum areas might represent hot spots of undisturbed testate amoeba communities and corresponding protozoic Si pools and thus of microbial Si cycling.

TI Actinomycetal complexes in drained peat soils of the taiga zone upon
   pyrogenic succession
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The number and diversity of actinomycetes in peat soils vary in dependence on the stage of pyrogenic succession. In the cultivated peat soil, the number of actinomycetes after fires decreases by three-four times, mainly at the expense of acidophilic and neutrophilic groups. An increase in the number of mycelial prokaryotes (at the expense of alkaliphilic forms) is seen on the fifth year of functioning of the pyrogenic peat soil. The species diversity of streptomycetes in peat soils also decreases after fires. An increase in the range of streptomycetal species at the expense of neutrophilic and alkaliphilic forms takes place on the fifth year of the pyrogenic succession. Parameters of the actinomycetal complex-the population density, species composition, and ecological features-are the criteria whose changes allow us to judge the state of peat soils in the course of their pyrogenic succession.

AB The urbanised peat-rich coastal-deltaic plain of the Netherlands is severely subsiding due to human-induced phreatic groundwater level lowering, as this causes peat layers to compress and oxidise. To determine the potential susceptibility of this area to future subsidence by peat compression and oxidation, the effects of lowering present-day phreatic groundwater levels were quantitatively evaluated using a subsidence model. Input were a 3D geological subsurface voxel-model, modelled phreatic groundwater levels, and functions for peat compression and oxidation. Phreatic groundwater levels were lowered by 0.25 and 0.5 m, and the resulting peat compression and oxidation over periods of 15 and 30 years were determined. The model area comprised the major cities Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and their surrounding agricultural lands.
   The results revealed that for these scenarios agricultural areas may subside between 0.3 and 0.8 m; potential subsidence in Amsterdam and Rotterdam is considerably lower, less than 0.4m. This is due to the presence of several metres thick anthropogenic brought-up soils overlying the peat below the urban areas, which has already compressed the peat to a depth below groundwater level, and thus minimises further compression and oxidation. In agricultural areas peat is often situated near the surface, and is therefore highly compressible and prone to oxidation. The averaged subsidence rates for the scenarios range between 7 and 13 mm a(-1), which is corresponds to present-day rates of subsidence in the peat areas of the Netherlands. These results contrast with the trend of coastal-deltaic subsidence in other deltas, with cities subsiding faster than agricultural areas. This difference is explained by the driver of subsidence: in other deltas, subsidence of urban areas is mainly due to deep aquifer extraction, whereas in the Netherlands subsidence is due to phreatic groundwater level lowering.

AB Peat is a highly contentious input in agriculture. Replacing or reducing peat by substitution with lignocellulosic biomass processed into fibre by twin-screw-extrusion could contribute to more sustainable agriculture with regard to horticultural production. Therefore, plant wastes including pruning from Olea europaea L. and Vitis spp. L., residues from perennial herbs like Salvia spp. L., Populus spp. L. and forest biomass were processed to fibre for peat replacement with a biomass extruder. The water-holding-capacity (WHC), particle-size-distribution and other physical fibre characteristics were determined and compared to peat. The specific energy demand during extrusion was measured for aperture settings from 6-40 mm. No fibre reached the 82% WHC of peat. At the setting of 20 mm of all materials investigated, Salvia performed best with a WHC of 53% and moderate specific energy demand (167 kWh t(DM)(-1)) followed by Olea europaea with a WHC of 43% and a low energy demand (93 kWh t(DM)(-1)). For Populus, opening the aperture from 20-40 mm decreased energy demand by 41% and WHC by 27%. The drying of biomass for storage and remoistening during extrusion increased the specific energy demand. Despite a lower WHC than peat, all investigated materials are suitable to replace peat in growing media regarding their physical properties.

ID ORGANIC SOILS; INVENTORY; FINLAND
AB Digitised maps of Quaternary deposits, (40)K radiation data and Integrated Agricultural Control System databases (IACS) were used in a GIS analysis to estimate the distribution and land use of agricultural peat and gyttja soils in Sweden. The total area of agricultural land (cropland and pastures) in Sweden was estimated at 3,496,665 ha and 8.6% of this area (301,489 ha) was classified as agricultural peat and gyttja soils, with 202,383 ha of deep peat, 50,191 ha of shallow peat and 48,915 ha of gyttja soils. Using detailed information on crop distribution from agricultural databases, it was possible to estimate the Cultivation intensity (land use) of the agricultural land. One-quarter of the agricultural area of peat soils was intensively cultivated with annual crops and the remaining area was extensively used, dominated by managed grasslands and pastures. There was great variation in cultivation intensity between areas, from 50% annual crops down to 10%. The gyttja soils were in general more intensively cultivated than the peat soils. The improved estimates of acreage and cultivation intensity of agricultural peat soils were used to calculate annual greenhouse gas emissions from subsidence data. The total carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from Swedish agricultural peat soils in 2003 were estimated to be between 3100 Gg CO(2) and 4600 Gg CO(2), which is similar to or lower than previously reported values. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) were estimated at 3.2 Gg N(2)O in 2003. Estimated combined total emissions Of CO(2) and N(2)O from agricultural peat soils in Sweden in 2003 amounted to 4000-5600 Gg CO(2)-equivalents, which Corresponds to approximately 6-8% of the total emissions of all greenhouse gases reported by Sweden (excluding the sink for land use, land use change and forestry - LULUCF). Agricultural peat soils represent a minor fraction of the agricultural land in Sweden but still have a significant effect on total national greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is an important part of the cultural heritage and economy of Southeastern Massachusetts, yet water quality concerns and wetland protection laws challenge its commercial production. Here, we report inputs and outputs of water, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) for a 2.12-ha cranberry bed over a 2-year period from 2013 to 2015. Water-budget analysis indicated that precipitation contributed 40%, floodwater 37%, irrigation 15%, and groundwater 8% of water inputs to the cranberry bed. Minor annual variation in surface water discharge (similar to 90mmyear(-1) or 3%) contrasted with large decreases in net (= outputs - inputs) nutrient export, from 16.2 to 9.1kgNha(-1)year(-1) for total (dissolved+suspended particulate) nitrogen (TN) and from 3.34 to 1.47kgPha(-1)year(-1) for total phosphorus (TP) between Years 1 and 2. Annual variation in net TN and TP export was tied to decreases in spring and summer nutrient export and controlled by the combined effects of fertilizer management, soil biogeochemistry, and hydrology. The relatively high spring TN export in Year 1 was associated with coincident increases in soil temperature and rainfall. A second factor was the timing of fertilizer application, which occurred 1day prior to a major summer storm (i.e., third largest daily rainfall since 1926) and was responsible for up to 15% and 9% of the Year 1 TN and TP export, respectively. Nutrient budgets, which balanced water and fertilizer inputs with water, fruit, and vegetative outputs, were consistent with the burial of 21.6kgNha(-1)year(-1) and 7.27kgPha(-1)year(-1). Field measurements indicated that burial would increase TN and TP in the shallow (0-5cm) rooting zone by 14% and 6%, respectively, which seemed plausible based on the relatively young age of the bed (4-5years) and new root growth patterns in Vaccinium plants.

AB A high number (from tens of thousands to millions of CFU/g of soil) of actinomycetes and a high diversity of genera were found in typical peat and agropeat soils. Agricultural use increases the number and diversity of the actinomycete complexes of the peat soils. In the peat soils, the actinomycete complex is represented by eight genera: Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Streptosporangium, Actinomadura, Microbispora, Saccharopolyspora, Saccharomonospora, and Microtetraspora. A considerable share of sporangial forms in the actinomycete complex of the peat soils not characteristic of the zonal soils was revealed. The number of actinomycetes that develop under aerobic conditions is smaller by 10-100 times than that of aerobic forms in the peat soils. Among the soil actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Streptosporangium, Actinomadura, Microbispora, and Microtetraspora, the microaerophilic forms were found; among the Saccharopolyspora and Saccharomonospora, no microaerophilic representatives were revealed.

TI The formation of profile in drained peaty soils under agricultural use
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Drainage and agricultural use of peaty soils result in the compaction of peat, an increase in its ash content, decrease in its water-retaining capacity, and peat exhaustion. The duration of these processes depends on depletion the original thickness of the peat deposit and the management practices. A decrease in thickness of the peat deposit approximating the thickness of the arable layer, as well as the growth of tilled crops, can accelerate these processes; the use of lands for meadows inhibits them. As the underlying horizon becomes depleted in organic matter, the profile of peaty soils incorporates mineral layers. On these soils, the yield of cereals increases, and the yield of perennial grasses decreases. In order to increase the grass yield, the depth of the groundwater table should be regulated, and additional nitrogen fertilizers should be applied.

AB Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) agriculture is rapidly expanding and requires large areas of land in the tropics to meet the global demand for palm oil products. Land cover conversion of peat swamp forest to oil palm (large- and small-scale oil palm production) is likely to have negative impacts on microhabitat conditions. This study assessed the impact of peat swamp forest conversion to oil palm plantation on microclimate conditions and soil characteristics. The measurement of microclimate (air temperature, wind speed, light intensity and relative humidity) and soil characteristics (soil surface temperature, soil pH, soil moisture, and ground cover vegetation temperature) were compared at a peat swamp forest, smallholdings and a large-scale plantation. Results showed that the peat swamp forest was 1.5-2.3 degrees C cooler with significantly greater relative humidity, lower light intensities and wind speed compared to the smallholdings and large-scale plantations. Soil characteristics were also significantly different between the peat swamp forest and both types of oil palm plantations with lower soil pH, soil and ground cover vegetation surface temperatures and greater soil moisture in the peat swamp forest. These results suggest that peat swamp forests have greater ecosystem benefits compared to oil palm plantations with smallholdings agricultural approach as a promising management practice to improve microhabitat conditions. Our findings also justify the conservation of remaining peat swamp forest as it provides a refuge from harsh microclimatic conditions that characterize large plantations and smallholdings.

AB Total mercury (TotHg) and methyl mercury (McHg) concentrations were studied in runoff from eight small (0.02-1.3 km(2)) boreal forest catchments (mineral soil and peatland) during 1990-1995. Runoff waters were extremely humic (TOC 7-70 mg l(-1)). TotHg concentrations varied between 0.84 and 24 ng l(-1) and MeHg between 0.03 and 3.8 ng l(-1). TotHg fluxes from catchments ranged from 0.92 to 1.8 g km(-2) a(-1), and MeHg fluxes from 0.03 to 0.33 g km(-2) a(-1). TotHg concentrations and output fluxes measured in runoff water from small forest catchments in Finland were comparable with those measured in other boreal regions. By contrast, MeHg concentrations were generally higher. Estimates for MeHg output fluxes in this study were comparable at sites with forests and wetlands in Sweden and North America, but clearly higher than those measured at upland or agricultural sites in other studies. Peatland catchments released more MeHg than pure mineral soil or mineral soil catchments with minor area of peatland. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large wetland drainage project was initiated in 1912 near the town of Seney, Michigan, U.S.A. This project included the construction of a series of ditches through a large peatland to drain the land for agricultural use. The largest of these ditches was the 35 km long Walsh Ditch. Much of the drained wetland affected by the Walsh Ditch is now managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of Seney National Wildlife Refuge. Between 2002-2003, nine large earthen ditch plugs were installed along a 4.5 km section of the ditch in an attempt to restore the hydrological and ecological integrity of the approximately 1400 ha of wetlands and streams. This study explores the effects that the ditch plugs had on the hydrology and vegetation structure of the adjacent landscape 8y later. Plot level measurements (707 m(2) plots) of hydrology and vegetation, combined with an analysis of land cover change using aerial imagery, indicated that the ditch plugs had been successful in altering the hydrology and vegetation over portions of the area. Mortality of upland tree species more typical of xeric conditions and colonization by typical wetland species indicated that these sites should continue to develop into wetland ecosystems. Land cover change analysis showed an increase in wetland area of 152 ha. The areas of change were concentrated near the plugged ditch and near a large anthropogenic pool.

AB This study aimed to clarify the distribution trend of sapric peat soils in Japanese agricultural fields from the view point of drainage and landform conditions using the Geographic Information System (GIS). To this end, the environmental conditions in the distribution area of organic soils were divided by combining existing GIS databases of environmental factors that consist of groundwater level, drainage condition, landform classification, and grain size of sediment. In order to evaluate the contribution of these environmental factors to the distribution trend of sapric peat soils, we applied quantification method type II to construct the discrimination model that enables the differentiation of the distribution area of sapric and non-sapric peat soils. In the case of organic soils without mineral surface cover, our discrimination model clearly suggests that sapric peat soils tend to be distributed under good drainage condition on floodplains, and with coarse sediments. This indicates that the effect of drainage conditions on peat decomposition is determined by landform condition. On the other hand, in the case of the land covered with mineral soils on the surface, sapric peat soil distribution was not well estimated. Determining the relationships between the distribution trend of sapric peat soils and the environmental factors by analyzing the existing GIS database is a new application. This was achieved by the combination of GIS and quantification method type II, which contributes to the description of the peat decomposition process from the viewpoint of geographical conditions.

AB The conventional organic growing medium used for anthurium (Anthurium andraeanum) production is peat. Quality peat, however, is costly and is a non-renewable natural resource. The current study compared the suitability of using charred and composted organic agricultural wastes (OAW) vs. sphagnum peat as components of various growth media for the ornamental plant, anthurium (A. andraeanum 'Pink Lady'). Ten different media were prepared from composted corn cobs (C), charred corn cobs (CC), charred garden waste (CG), and Pindstrup (TM) sphagnum peat moss (P) in various proportions. The media contained [on a % (v/v) basis]: C (100%), CC (100%), CG (100%), C (70%) + CG (30%), CC (70%) + CG (30%), C (35%) + CG (15%) + P (50%), CC (50%) + P (50%), CC (35%) + CG (15%) + P (50%), C (50%) + P (50%), or P (100%) as a control. After 15 months in a greenhouse, the growth and flowering of transplanted anthurium plants were optimal using P, CC+P, or CC+CG+P. These results indicate that mixing charred OAW with peat could provide a suitable medium for anthurium production, thereby reducing the need for peat and converting agricultural waste material into useful products.

AB Due to agricultural activities and increased water extraction, ground water levels have generally decreased in large parts of the peaty lowlands in the Netherlands. As a result (iron containing) seepage has decreased in many regions while alkaline river Rhine water, rich in sulphates and poor in iron, has been used to compensate for the shortage of water. This has resulted in increased alkalinity and organic sediment breakdown. Increased sulphate reduction leads to iron sulphide precipitation and internal alkalinity generation. As a result of these processes phosphate and ammonium levels in sediment pore water have increased strongly. Release of these nutrients to the water layer has resulted in internal eutrophication of the peatland ecosystems. Further, iron levels have decreased strongly due to decreased seepage and iron sulphide precipitation. As a result sulphide accumulates in sediment pore water and reaches toxic levels. Furthermore, decreased iron levels appear to be correlated with increased phosphate levels in sediment pore water. The strong decline of aquatic macrophytes in many minerotrophic peatlands in non agricultural regions in the Netherlands can probably be attributed to internal eutrophication, internal intoxication and iron limitation, resulting from changed hydrological situations i.e. decreased see page and inlet of river Rhine type water.

AB An understanding of P transformations in altered wetlands has mainly developed from temperate and humid regions with neutral to acidic soils. Little is known regarding downstream water quality impact of P transformations in semiarid wetlands that undergone repeated cycles of drying and rewetting. The P geochemistry was studied using the Hedley fractionation scheme in the altered peat soils of the Hula Valley, Israel. The peat soils were sampled according to the peat depth and redox potential characteristics. The mean total P concentration (P-t) in the surface peat horizons (1190 +/- 300 mg kg(-1)) was significantly higher than in the anaerobic (E-H < - 220 mV) peat layers (650 +/- 260 mg kg-1). The concentrations of P in all fractions except the most labile P were significantly higher in the aerobic (E-H = 400 mV) peat layers. The predominant extractable fractions in the surface peat horizons were Ca-P extracted by 1 M HCl (21-60% of P-t), Iron-P extracted by 0.5 M NaOH (11-41% of P-t), and residual P extracted by H2SO4 (20-40% of P-t). The source of the Ca in the Ca-P fraction was mainly from gypsum dissolution following the rewetting cycles. The results clearly showed that the drainage of these wetlands facilitated rapid organic matter (OM) oxidation, release of organically bound metals and P followed by sesquioxides and gypsum precipitation. These geochemical transformations enhanced the P-t concentration per mass of altered peat soil and changed the P distribution among the different pools. Most of the P is currently associated with Fe oxides and hydroxides and/or coprecipitated with Ca.

AB In western Finland, acid leaching to watercourses is mainly due to drainage of acid sulphate (AS) soils. This study examined how different land-use and land-cover types affect water acidity in the northwestern coastal region of Finland, which has abundant drained AS soils and peatlands. Sampling conducted in different hydrological conditions in studied river basins revealed two different catchment types: catchments dominated by drained forested peatlands and catchments used by agriculture. Low pH and high electric conductivity (EC) were typical in rivers affected by agriculture. In rivers dominated by forested peatlands and wetlands, EC was considerably lower. During spring and autumn high runoff events, water quality was poor and showed large spatial variation. Thus it is important to ensure that in river basin status assessment, sampling is carried out in different hydrological situations and in also water from some tributaries is sampled.

AB The fractional and group composition of organic matter in peat soils of long-term agricultural experiments at the Polesie, Minsk, Ivantsevich, and Sarny experimental stations was studied. It is shown that the group composition of organic matter in reclaimed peat soils mainly depends on the geobotanic nature of peat and varies slightly during agricultural use. On the contrary, the fractional composition of humic acids changes considerably. Soils are enriched with a biochemically stable fraction extracted with sodium pyrophosphate and are depleted of a biochemically less stable fraction additionally extracted with alkali.

AB Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. the cranberry of the Ericaceae family is cultivated mostly on high peat bogs. In Poland exist a good climatical conditions and considerable acreage of acid soils for cranberry growing. Cranberries can be consumed solely after processing, mostly as juice and sauce. Cranberries are beneficial for the human organism because they are a good source of vitamin A, B(1), B(2), B(6) and C, flavonoides, organic acids and other substances. Experiments on investigation of 6 cultivars of the American large fruited cranberries were begun in 2004 at the research plantation of Department of Genetics and Horticultural Plant Breeding in Felin, near Lublin. Seedlings were planted out at spacings of 50x50 cm in specialy prepared beds filled with sphagnum peat. During the experiments the following indices were evaluated: growth rhythm, length of horizontal shoots, number of vertical shoots per 1 m(2), number of flowers and berries per 1 m(2) in 4 fold replications, weight of 100 berries and vitality of pollen. Over two years cultivars 'Pilgrim' and 'Cropper' had the highest yield (average 662 g and 611 g per 1 m(2), respectively). 'Stankavich' had the lowest yields of all 6 cultivars (average 95.5 g). 'Pilgrim' and 'Cropper' had the largest fruit size (average 1.55 g and 1.51 g, respectively), 'Stankavich' the smallest (ay. 0.57 g), and 'Le Munion', Nr 20 and 'Stevens' were intermediate in fruit size. Interaction clone x year proved to be important in the case of such characteristics as: annual increment of shoots, number of flowers per 1 m(2), number of berries per 1 m(2) and weight of berries. The number of grains with alieve cytoplasm was the greatest in 'Cropper' and 'Pilgrim' cultivars.

AB The solution of a number of the tasks directed on optimization of processes of complex processing of peat for needs of industries and agricultural production includes technologies of regulation of an exit of valuable group components one of which are peat humic acids (HA). The analysis of the methods directed on increase in extent of extraction of humic acids presented in article showed the most optimum way of temperature impact on a feed stock as a result of which there is a change of structure and properties of the modified HA. By a complex of physical and chemical methods it is established that the preliminary thermolysis of peat is method of modification of structure of HA leading to removal of unstable side structural fragments in a macromolecule and to increase in a share of nuclear part.

AB Mixtures of peat and substrate clays are commonly used as growth media for horticultural plant production. A quality protocol for substrate clays defines a threshold value of active manganese (Mn-act = sum of exchangeable and easily reducible Mn) in substrate clays of < 500 mgkg(-1) to prevent toxic reactions of plants. This threshold value was tested in experiments with peat-clay blends under various growth conditions, and nutrient solution experiments were additionally conducted to investigate the effects of silicic acid and dissolved organic matter on the occurrence of Mn toxicity. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and hydrangea (Hydrangea macrophylla) plants were cultivated in different peat-clay substrates and in peat under different moisture and pH levels. The clays varied in their Mn-act content from 4-2354 mgkg(-1). The results of the substrate experiments reveal that a threshold value for Mn in substrate clays is not justified, as plants grown in all peat-clay substrates did not develop any Mn toxicity even at high substrate moisture or low pH conditions which are known to increase the Mn availability. The extraction of active Mn did not well reflect the Mn concentrations in plant dry matter and substrate solution. As plants tolerated high Mn concentrations in the substrate solution compared to the nutrient solution without toxicity symptoms, the influence of silicic acid and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on Mn toxicity was characterized in a nutrient-solution experiment. Manganese toxicity was clearly diminished by silicic acid application, but not by DOM. The former effect probably explains the tolerance of bean plants in peat substrates where high silicon concentrations in the substrate solution were observed. Peat-clay blends even provided up to five times more silicon to plants than pure peat.

AB The impacts of weed control, ash fertilization and their interaction were tested for the afforestation of former agricultural peat-based soil with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in northern Finland in a factorial arrangement of four treatments. Weed control with herbicides was carried out in July 1 and 2 years from planting, and wood ash (5 Mg ha(-1)) was applied in the spring of the 2nd year. Various vegetation, tree growth and nutrient assessments were made over the 21-year study period. Weed control decreased the weed cover by 36-56 percentage points, vegetation height by 4-26 cm and thus shading of seedlings by vegetation for at least 4 years after planting. For the same period, ash fertilization increased vegetation height by 6-15 cm and shading of seedlings. Weed control reduced seedling mortality by 27 percentage points in 21 years, but ash fertilization had no significant effect. Ash fertilization increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, but its effect declined, and severe K-deficiency was recorded 21 years after planting. Up to the 9th year, weed control had a greater influence on growth than fertilization. Later the significance of fertilization increased due to an aggravated K-deficiency. Stand volume at year 21 for the untreated control plots was 8 m3 ha(-1). Weed control and fertilization increased stand volume by 20 and 35 m(3)ha(-1), with a combined effect of 55 m(3)ha(-1). The effects of weed control and fertilization were additive and no significant interactions were found. Due to severe K-deficiencies, re-fertilization of all treatments would be necessary for the continued survival and growth of Scots pine.

AB The increasing environmental concerns about the use of peat as a non-renewable resource in growing substrates has led to the search for alternative materials. The aim of the present work was to develop a circular chain system model based on the "on farm" production of green compost in nursery from residues of pruning of woody plants and of grass mowing to replace peat in the composition of potting mixes. Composting process, carried out in a nursery located in Central Italy, was evaluated by the analysis of the succession of microbial communities and monitoring of temperature. The potential of green nursery compost in the replacement of different percentages of peat in potting mixes used for the cultivation of olive pot-plants was assessed by the estimation of the nitrogen mineralization potential and the detection of olive tree growth parameters. Results showed that initial mesophilic phase of composting occurred within three weeks followed by the thermophilic phase, which lasted for about 26 weeks and then by the second mesophilic phase. The potential of N mineralization varied with decreasing amount of peat present in the substrate. Plants cultivated in mixes obtained with reduced percentage of peat showed a regular development of growth parameters (plant height and stem diameter) during the whole cultivation cycle. Our results show that the widespread production and use of this renewable resource can provide the partial substitution of peat in potting mixes with the potential to consistently reduce the economic and environmental costs of nursery industry.

AB Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising method to process high moisture biomass into biofuel/biomaterial. The environmental benefits of biomass depend on the processing methods and its end-use. Although life cycle assessment (LCA) of HTC of wet biomass has been conducted, co-processing of peat moss with agricultural biomass (miscanthus) is yet to be reported. This study evaluates the environmental performance of hydrothermally carbonized biomass (peat moss, miscanthus, and a blend of the two) used for energy (S-3, S-5, S-7) or soil amendment (S-2, S-4, S-6, S-8) and compared with untreated biomass (peat moss left on-site: S-1; peat moss used for soil amendment: S 2 ) to determine the most viable pathway of biomass. Hydrochar produced from miscanthus had a lower global warming potential (GWP) compared with the hydrochar from peat moss or their blend; however, other impact categories were observed to be greater. The environmental impacts from the life cycle of biomass depend on their life cycle pathways. The highest GWP was observed in the case of peat moss used for horticulture application (S 2 ) followed by S-3, S-5, S-4, S-6, S-7, S-8 and S-1. Hydrochar used in soil amendment was more environmentally benign than the energy application, but the benefits were dependent on the decomposition rate of biomass. Additionally, HTC process required a considerable amount of water even it can process high moisture biomass. Renewable energy and agricultural policy may be needed to encourage hydrochar use/production/integration into soil amendment and energy application in rural communities.

AB This paper presents a landscape-ecological analysis of Ladoga Region, a 30 000 km(2) territory around Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe. The Region includes the contact zone between the crystalline bedrock of Baltic Shield and the sedimentary rocks of the East European plain, and the transition from Boreonemoral to Southern Boreal (Taiga) forest vegetation; it is characterized by abundance of lakes. The Region is divided into 17 discrete landscape areas that are classified in 6 groups.
   The author uses the landscape-dynamical approach to the analysis of recent (from 2-3 to 40-50 yr) environmental changes in the region, caused by human activities: forest felling, fires, peat excavation, agriculture, recreational development etc. The following processes are observed: vegetation successions after clearcutting and selective logging, effects of forest fires on the spreading and conservation of pine forests; consequences of peatland drainage; landscape effects of collective farming and gardening; forest succession from pine and deciduous tree dominance towards spruce dominance (observable in all landscape regions); natural vegetation succession on former Finnish arable lands (two types of scenarios: forest succession or development of sedge meadows).

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB Annual mobilization of soil nitrogen in peat soils varies from 60-120 to 300-350 kg/ha. The need in nitric fertilizers varies from very high to low when compared with the need in phosphorous and potassium fertilizers. In some cases, the lowest rates of nitrogen are required. During the initial stages of cultivation and agricultural development of peat soils, the reserves of soil nitrogen may play the main role in nutrition of plants. After 35-50 years of cultivation, natural reserves of nitrogen in peat soils decrease significantly, and the role of nitric fertilizers rises. At present, there is a great need in nitric fertilizers, and it will increase in the future.

AB Biological system, named as biobed, is used for eliminating point source pesticide contamination during filling and cleaning of spraying equipment. In original biobed used in some European countries, biomixture contains straw (50%), soil (25%) and peat (25%). In this study, agricultural wastes (corn, peanut and cotton) was used in biomixture instead of peat due to high cost and difficulty in obtaining it in Turkey. Agricultural wastes and their ratios were used for determination of absorption and degradation of acetamiprid active ingredient in this study. Results from biomixtures of agricultural wastes and their ratios were compared to original biobed according to 50% and 90% disappearance time in biomixtures of acetamiprid. The agricultural wastes should be 50% as an alternative to peat. The most important conclusion which can be derived from this study is that agricultural wastes (50%) such as wheat straw, corn stalk, corn cob, cotton straw and peanut rind can be used instead of peat (25%) in biomixture. It can be derived from this study that the agricultural wastes should be used at a ratio of 50% instead of peat, which is 25% in original biobed.

AB The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of two substrate mixtures and arbuscular mycorrhyzae (AM) on the vegetative growth of Troyer citrange. Troyer citrange seeds, inoculated or not with G. intraradices Schenck & Smith were sown in plastic trays containing a substrate mixture of silica sand plus perlite plus Sphagnum peat (3:2:1; v/v/v). Sixty days after sowing the seedlings were transferred to black polyethylene bags containing either the sowing substrate or sedge black peat plus Sphagnum peat (1:1; v/v). AM increased vegetative growth of Troyer citrange independently of the growing media The differences in vegetative growth between mycorrhyzal and nonmycorrhyzal seedlings were greater when cultivated in sedge black peat plus Sphagnum peat, which is an indication that this mixture, although with high levels of organic matter does not inhibit AM. Moreover, this treatment resulted in bigger trunk diameter of the seedlings that possibly could have positive effects on the anticipation of grafting time.

AB Sediment surface samples (0-2 cm) from 66 sites, and longer cores (up to 540 cm) from 9 sites in the estuary of the river Kyronjoki, Western Finland, were analysed for organic content, P, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn.  One core was dated on the basis of annual laminations.
   Chemical analyses of the cores showed that organic matter and heavy metal content have increased in recent decades.  The heavy metal content was clearly lower than in areas polluted by industry.  The sedimentation rate in the delta increased between the 1930s and 1950.  It decreased in the 1960s, and has been below 1930s levels since 1970.  The sedimentation rates of organic matter were fairly stable all through the period measured, even though the organic content increased.
   The increase in organic matter and the heavy metal content of the sediment in recent decades is evidently due to the increased intensity of agriculture, forestry and peat harvesting in the drainage basin.  Drainage of peatlands in particular has increased erosion and the organic sediment load of the river.  Reservoir building after 1970 has decreased the sedimentation rates in the delta.

TI COMPACTIBILITY OF CULTIVATED SPHAGNUM PEAT MATERIAL AND ITS INFLUENCE ON
   HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS
SO SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Deformation-stress-moisture relationships of cultivated sphagnum peat materials were studied in the laboratory using the Ottawa Texture Measuring System, an apparatus developed by Agriculture Canada. Impact of compaction on hydrologic characteristics was also investigated to determine the maximum stress which may be applied in the field during seed-bed preparation without limiting aeration for crop production. The study revealed that the compactibility of peat is relatively unaffected by moisture content at compactive pressure less-than-or-equal-to 13 kPa. However, under higher compactive pressure, the peat reaction was very similar to that of mineral soils, in which the compactibility increases with increasing moisture content until it reaches a maximum bulk density at saturation. The deformation-stress-moisture content relationships may be expressed by a simple third order polynomial equation. In response to compaction, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the peat material reduced more than three orders of magnitude as bulk density increased from 0.1 to 0.25 g/cm3. A major increase in moisture retentivity was found in the compacted peat. Changes in hydrologic characteristics are primarily attributed to the reduction in large pores. Based on this information, it is concluded that compactive pressure exceeding 50 kPa may cause adverse effects on soil aeration.

AB The effects of ash and commercial fertilizers on the foliar nutrient concentrations and stand growth of Scots pine were studied in four field experiments established on former cultivated peat soils. The aims were to compare ash types (wood, peat and coal ash), study the effects of ash treatment (pelletization), compare ash fertilization with commercial fertilizers, and to study the interaction between ash fertilization and weed control. Foliar samples were collected 1-3 years and 7-8 years after fertilization.
   In the unfertilized plots, the foliar nitrogen and phosphor-us concentrations were fairly high, while those of potassium were low in all the experiments. The boron levels were low in three out of the four experiments. Application of either loose or pelletized wood ash, as well as of commercial fertilizers, increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, and thus successfully remedied the existing nutrient imbalances and deficiencies. Since phosphorus deficiencies are rarely encountered on field afforestation sites, poor-quality wood ash with low phosphorus concentration could be used. Peat ash containing phosphorus, but only small amounts of potassium and boron, was not found to be very suitable for soil amelioration in connection with field afforestation. Coal ash, containing only small amounts of potassium, was a good source of boron for pine even when used in small amounts, and thus it can be used in cases where boron deficiencies alone are encountered. Wood ash significantly increased the height growth of Scots pines in two of the experiments, but peat ash and coal ash had no statistically significant effect. Wood ash increased the number of healthy seedlings. Vegetation control decreased seedling mortality by 24%, increased the growth of pine and decreased the proportion of trees damaged by elk and by deciduous trees.

AB In terms of agricultural use, peat soils have weak structure, high water content, insufficient soil aeration and poor thermal properties resulting in suboptimal physical properties and yields of grass. During the period 1978 - 1995, a long-term field trial was conducted on highly decomposed peat soil in order to investigate the impact of adding mineral materials to improve soil characteristics and increase grass yield. Shell sand or moraine soil (200, 400 or 800 m(3) ha(-1)) was incorporated into peat soil. Generally, addition of both shell sand and moraine soil improved the physical properties of the soil and grass production. During the first nine years, shell sand ( 400 m 3 ha(-1)) was the most efficient. Thereafter, moraine soil ( 400 and 800 m(3) ha(-1)) seemed most beneficial. This study indicates that additions of shell sand or moraine soil to peat are appropriate methods to improve and conserve the physical properties and cropping potential of these vulnerable soils.

AB Phosphorus (P) accumulation in drained agricultural lowlands causes a risk for P pollution to the aquatic environment following wetland restoration. While extensive knowledge is available on P sorption and desorption from anaerobic soils, very limited information is available on the interacting influence of soil geochemistry and local scale active flow volume. Combining batch incubation experiments and continuous column discharge experiments, we investigated iron (Fe) reduction and P release from 10 anoxic Fe-dominated (oxalate extractable Fe (Fe-ox) from similar to 5500 to 50,000 mg kg(-1)) lowland peat soils (TOC from 5 to 39%) with a gradient in Fe:P molar ratio (molar ratio between bicarbonate dithionite extractable Fe and P (Fe-BD:P-BD) from 3 to 112) and degree of non-equilibrium (preferential) flow. Short-term batch incubation experiments (21 days) indicated that concurrent Fe and P release was controlled by reductive Fe(III) dissolution, and was well predicted from the soil FeBD:PBD molar ratio. Continuous convective column discharge with oxygen-free deionised water at 1 mm h(-1) for 10 effluent pore volumes resulted in highly variable in situ redox potential (Eh from 200 to 300 mV), effluent Fe(II) concentrations (23 to 2000 mu M) and effluent dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations (< 6.5 to 316 mu M). Effluent P forms changed from dominantly particular P/dissolved organic P (PP/DOP) to dominantly DRP as Eh decreased in all soils. Total phosphorus (TP) release rates during convective discharge (3-66 mu mol kg(-1) day(-1)) were negatively non-linearly correlated with the soil Fe-BD:P-BD molar ratio, which explained 71-73% of the variability, and with Fe-BD:P-BD of 10 as a critical threshold ratio. Fe and P release rates from batch experiments were poorly correlated with convective discharge Fe and P release rates, indicating the overall influence of soil structure. Diffusion was found to be the rate-limiting step for P release after prolonged leaching. Although the soil Fe-BD:P-BD molar ratio turned out as a key explanatory parameter in predicting P release rates following rewetting of these peat soils, the results did indicate the influence of preferential flow in decreasing P release rates. Although, sufficient available P is present for leaching in the initial phase after rewetting P enriched lowland soils, we do expect that soils with pronounced preferential flow will become more rapidly exhausted in available P, and hence limit P release after prolonged discharge.

AB Sphagnum peat is an abundant resource in the Quebec bored zone and can be used to improve water retention in sandy soils of low productivity. Our objective was to select a peat application rate suitable for growing potato (Solanum tuberosum L. 'Superior') and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Chapais') on a ferro-humic podzol. The experiment was conducted in Mistassini, Quebec, from 1994 to 1997. Organic matter content (OMC) of a Parent loamy sand was 2.7-2.9% initially. Feat was applied to small plots in a 2-yr potato and 2-yr barley rotation at rates of 0 (control), 29, 48 and 68 t ha(-1) on a dry weight basis. A cupric fertilizer trial (0 vs. 2.2 kg Cu ha(-1)) was combined with the, peal: treatments. A yearly potato-barley rotation was also established in a nearby field receiving 25 t peat ha(-1). The arable layer of pest-amended soils was stratified into a 5.3- to 14.8-cm thick upper layer (A(1)) down to the limit of peat incorporation, and an underlying layer (A(2)), averaging 15 cm in thickness, keeping the original soil properties. The highest tuber yield, but reduced tuber specific gravity,were obtained with the 48 t ha(-1) treatment compared with the control and the 29 t ha(-1) treatments. Feat rates excceeding 29 t ha(-1) reduced yield and quality of the barley crop. The Cu concentration in barley and potato diagnostic tissues decreased as peat rate increased. Copper was needed to counteract the detrimental effects of peat amendments on maturation, yield and quality of barley. At field scale, pear increased the lower limit of soil water content for starting irrigation from 0.12 m(3) m(-3) in the control to 0.15 m(3) m(-3) in the peat-amended soil. Irrigation rate should be augmented at each passage, and frequency of waterings diminished, in peat-amended soils compared with the control, due to increased water storage capacity. Feat improved the productivity of the sandy soil up to 4-5% OMC, but could induce Cu shortage in barley.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH

DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL SOILS
AB The effect on compressibility of incorporating peat into four remoulded Trinidadian agricultural soils was investigated over a range of stresses from 0 to 1000 kPa using a compression machine. Air-dry peat was applied at four levels (0, 4, 8 and 12% by mass) to the soils (two sandy loams, clay loam and clay) and tested at three moisture contents close to the Proctor optimum moisture content of the soils. Compression curves (bulk density versus log applied stress) for each soil at the moisture levels tested were almost linear and parallel over the range of stresses from about 100 to 1000 kPa.
   Mean values of dry bulk density declined significantly at 0.001 level with increasing peat content from 1.23 to 0.87 Mg m(-3). Mean bulk density values increased significantly at 0.001 level with increasing applied stress and moisture content and declined with increasing clay content. Significant interaction effects were observed between soil type and peat content and between peat content and moisture content. Feat incorporation resulted in greater soil compression, but the increases were less evident in clay than in sandy loam soils. Soil compression refers to the decrease in soil volume with the application of external load. The compression index, C (slope of the dry bulk density versus log applied stress relationship), increased significantly at 0.05 level from 0.21 Mg/m(3) in one sandy loam soil to 0.38 Mg/m(3) in the clay soil. While the C value did not differ significantly with increasing peat content in the sandy loams and the clay loam, it decreased significantly at 0.01 level in the clay soil. An equation expressing C as a function of initial soil bulk density before compression and a strain parameter was developed in order to explain the variation of C in the soils tested. A method is described that can be adopted to quantify the effect of peat on soil compressibility.

AB In agriculturally used peat land areas, surface water quality standards for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are frequently exceeded, but it is unclear to what extent agriculture is responsible for nutrient loading of the surface water. We quantified the contribution of different sources to the N and P loading of a ditch draining a grassland on peat soil (Terric Histosol) used for dairy fanning in the Netherlands. Measurements were performed on N and P discharge at the end of the ditch, supply of N and P via inlet water, mineralization of soil organic matter, slush application, composition of the soil solution, and on N losses through denitrification in the ditch for 2 years (September 2000 to September 2002). Discharge rates at the end of the ditch were 32 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and 4.7 kg P ha(-1) y(-1). For N, 43 to 50% of the discharge was accounted for by applications of fertilizers, manure and cattle droppings, 17 to 31% by mineralization of soil organic matter, 8 to 27% by nutrient-rich deeper peat layers, 8 to 9% by atmospheric deposition and 3 to 4% by inlet water. For P, these numbers were 10 to 48% for applications of fertilizers, manure and cattle droppings, 2 to 14% mineralization of soil organic matter, 33 to 82% nutrient-rich peat layers and 5 to 6% inlet water. The results of this paper demonstrate that nutrient loading of surface water in peat land areas involves several sources of nutrients, and therefore, reducing one source to reduce nutrient inputs to surface water is likely to result in modest effectiveness.

AB Transport of particulate pollutants in fluvial systems can contribute greatly to total loads. Understanding transport mechanics under different hydrological conditions is key in successful load estimation. This study analysed trace elements and physico-chemical parameters in time-integrated suspended sediment samples, together with dissolved and total concentrations of pollutants, along two agriculture- and peatland-dominated boreal river systems. The samples were taken in a spatially and temporally comprehensive sampling programme during the ice-free seasons of 2010 and 2011. The hydrochemistry and transport of particle-bound elements in the rivers were strongly linked to intense land use and acid sulphate soils in the catchment area, with arable, pasture and peat areas in particular being main diffuse sources. There were significant seasonal and temporal variations in dissolved and particulate fluxes, but spatial variations were small. Continuous measurements of EC, turbidity and discharge proved to be an accurate indicator of dissolved and particulate fluxes. Overall, the results show that transport of particle-bound elements makes a major contribution to total transport fluxes in agriculture-dominated boreal rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Specified mixtures of peat with bark and peat with straw were burned in a lab-scale entrained flow reactor that simulates conditions in the superheater region of a conventional biomass-fired boiler. The deposition rates were recorded on an air-cooled probe that was inserted into the reactor at the outlet. For both mixtures, the deposition behaviour followed a non-linear pattern, which suggests that physico-chemical interaction between the types of ash has taken place. Peat seems to act as a cleansing agent in all mixtures with straw, while it acts as a cleansing agent in mixtures with bark only up to a share of 50 wt% bark. Between 50 and 100 wt% bark, it seems that peat adds to the deposition. The results indicate that it is possible to burn up to 30 wt% bark (renewable biofuel and pulp mill waste) and up to 70 wt% straw (renewable biofuel and agricultural waste) in mixtures with peat (CO2-neutral fossil fuel) without encountering increased deposition rates.

AB Peat alternatives are being developed using materials such as agroindustry compost. The aim of this work was to study whether an agroindustrial compost could be used as substitute for peat in a floating system for cultivating baby leaf red lettuce. For this, two different experiments were carried out over two growing cycles (summer and autumn) in the same greenhouse at the same time. The first experiment compared the two organic substrates (peat and compost) and the second involved a suppressive bioassay using both substrates inoculated with Pythium irregulare. The results showed that compost increased the percentage of seed germination and the quality of baby leaf red lettuce by reducing nitrate accumulation and increasing the antioxidant capacity and vitamin C content of leaves compared with peat. Furthermore, under P. irregulare pressure plants grown in compost showed less incidence of the disease (a higher percentage of plant survival) and produced higher yields. It is concluded that the agroindustrial compost used in this study shows promise as an alternative to peat for use as organic substrate in a sustainable soilless production system for baby leaf red lettuce, since it is not only able to control the effect of P. irregulare, but also improve the yield and quality of the product.

AB Peat is considered the conventional growing medium in most soilless culture systems. The high cost of peat and the urgent need of agricultural wastes recycling encouraged the scientists and soilless culture users to search for an alternative growth medium where optimal growth conditions are achieved and help in the safe disposal of wastes. In the current study, peanut shell (PS) and corn wastes (CW) were used as growing media in comparison to peat moss (PM). The tested organic wastes and peat moss were examined with sand at three mixing ratios (1:1 "M-1", 1:2 "M-2" and 1:3 "M-3" raw material: washed sand, respectively). Red radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) plant were cultivated in 5 kg pots filled with the instigated growing media. Most of the recoded growth parameters were found in PS and PM growing media, while the lowest ones were found in CW. PS medium contained available N and P higher by 141 and 29% above the PM media. Although the peat moss gave the highest values in the measured growth characteristics, its high price decreased the net profit. The highest net profit value was obtained from PSM(2)followed by PSM(1)and PSM3. According to the obtained results, the characteristics of the growth media derived from peanut shell qualify them for use in the production of red radish in soilless culture systems.

AB This study presents the first annual estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of contrasting Danish agricultural peatlands. Studies were done at eight sites representing permanent grasslands (PG) and rotational (RT) arable soils cropped to barley, potato or forage grasses in three geo-regional settings. Using an advanced flux-chamber technique, NEE was derived from modelling of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) with temperature and photosynthetically active radiation as driving variables. At PG (n = 3) and RT (n = 5) sites, NEE (mean +/- standard error, SE) was 5.1 +/- 0.9 and 8.6 +/- 2.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, but with the overall lowest value observed for potato cropping (3.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). This was partly attributed to a short-duration vegetation period and drying of the soil especially in potato ridges. NECB, derived from NEE and C-removal in harvested biomass, was equivalent to 8.4 +/- 1.0 and 11.5 +/- 2.0 Mg C ha(-1) for the PG and RT land-use types, respectively. Means were not significantly different, P = 0.214, and were comparable to a wider range of high-end emission factors for managed organic soils in boreal and temperate climate zones. It was stressed that evaluation of emission factors should explicitly differentiate between data representing net C balance from a soil perspective and CO2-C balance from an atmospheric perspective. Modelling of inter-annual variability in NEE for three selected sites during a 21-year meteorological period indicated a range of 18-67% (coefficients of variation). Yet, the robustness of these estimates and their importance for the derived emission factors needs to be substantiated experimentally. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the research was to study the effect of different fertilizers on the productivity and fruit composition of lowbush blueberry (Vaccinum angustifolium flit.) cultivated in abandoned peat pits. The experiment was established in 2000 with two-year-old seedlings on cutover peat field in North Estonia (59' 9'N and 25 degrees 19'E). The soil type in the experimental area was Fibric-Dystric Histosol and the cutover peat layer was more than 1.0 vi thick. Total yield, fruit weight, fruit tit ratable acidity, soluble solids, ascorbic acid and anthocyanin content were determined. The effect of fertilization on the ascorbic acid content was different in 2004-2005. Liming increased fruit anthocyanin content in both years when nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were applied at the rate of 0.8, 2.0 and 7.2 g m(-1), respectively. Application of the same fertilizer rate without liming, produced sweeter fruits. Thus, research results indicated that fertilization of lowbush blueberries on cutover peat fields is necessary and in order to get high quality yield, the right fertilization rate is important.

AB Partitioning soil respiration (SR) into its components, heterotrophic and rhizospheric respiration, is an important step for understanding and modelling carbon (C) cycling in organic soils. However, no partitioning studies on afforested organic soil croplands exist. We separated soil respiration originating from the decomposition of peat (SRP), and aboveground litter (SRL) and root respiration (SRR) in six afforested organic soil croplands in Finland with varying tree species and stand ages using the trenching method. Across the sites temporal variation in SR was primarily related to changes in soil surface temperature (-5 cm), which explained 71-96% of variation in SR rates. Decomposition of peat and litter was not related to changes in water table level, whereas a minor increase in root respiration was observed with the increase in water table depth. Temperature sensitivity of SR varied between the different respiration components: SRp was less sensitive to changes in soil surface temperature than SRL or SRR. Factors explaining spatial variation in SR differed between different respiration components. Annual SRp correlated positively with peat ash content while that of SRL was found to correlate positively with the amount of litter on the forest floor, separately for each tree species. Root respiration correlated positively with the biomass of ground vegetation. From the total soil respiration peat decomposition comprised a major share of 42%; the proportion of autotrophic respiration being 41% and aboveground litter 17%. Afforestation lowered peat decomposition rates. Nevertheless the effect of agricultural history can be seen in peat properties for decades and due to high peat decomposition rates these soils still loose carbon to the atmosphere.

AB The analysis of experimental materials obtained in various regions of Russia and Belarus suggests that the thawing depth of plowed peat soils depends on the sum of mean daily air temperatures after the snow melting. The effect of other factors, including the latitudinal position of particular places, the water-physical properties of soils, and their geomorphic position on slopes of different aspects, is concealed by the major role of the heat flux from the atmosphere. The suggested exponential equation to describe this dependence can be applied for prediction of the thawing depth of arable peat soils in the European part of Russia and in West Siberia.

AB Spring phenophases such as the beginning of leaf unfolding, measured in the Irish gardens of the International Phenological Garden (IPG) network, indicate an earlier spring occurrence hence a longer growing season. However, these measurements are limited to selected species of trees at a few point locations in the southern half of the country. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology, based on satellite remote sensing, to measure the vegetation start of season (SOS) across the whole island of Ireland on an annual basis, complementary to existing ground-based methods.
   The SOS metric was extracted for each year in a 7-year time series of 10-day composited, 1.2 km reduced resolution MERIS Global Vegetation Index (MGVI) data from 2003 to 2009, based on curve fitting, using the time series analysis software, TIMESAT. Spatio-temporal variability in the SOS was detected across the island on an annual basis and highlighted in a series of anomaly images showing variation from the 7-year mean SOS. The 2006 SOS was late across the island while there were strong geographical gradients to the SOS anomalies in 2009 when it occurred later in the south and earlier in the north. There was a mix of early and late anomaly values throughout the country in the other years.
   Qualitatively, the spatial patterns in the timing of the SOS were related to the distribution of landcover types as indicated by the CORINE Land Cover map (CLC). Three statistically separable groups of CLC classes were derived from differences in the SOS, namely agricultural and forest land cover types, peat bogs, and natural and semi-natural vegetation types. These groups demonstrated that vegetation in cultivated areas like pastures has a significantly earlier SOS than in areas of unmanaged vegetation such as peat bogs. An initial climate analysis indicated that an anomalously cold winter and spring in 2005/2006 delayed the 2006 SOS countrywide; while a cold winter followed by a mild spring in 2009 caused considerable spatial variability in the 2009 SOS across the country, ranging from later SOS in the south to early SOS in the north.
   This study has demonstrated the utility of 10-day MGVI composites for derivation of an SOS metric which can be used as an indicator of spatial variability in vegetation seasonality and has highlighted how SOS varies according to landcover type. The availability of longer time series in the future will allow more focused studies on the sensitivity of the SOS metric to changes in climate as well as short term weather events.

AB In Europe, agriculture on managed peat wetlands is often a balance between maximising farming production, whether hay harvest or cattle production or both, and a desire to maintain a threatened ecological landscape with its flora and fauna. Because of the large amount of carbon stored in peat soils, the management of peat wetlands to minimise the production of atmospheric greenhouse gases is also now a priority. Eddy correlation and allied radiation and soil physics measurements were made continuously over several years at a wetland meadow peat site that is subject to a water level management scheme, at Tadham Moor in the Somerset Levels and Moors, UK. These measurements provided estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and, through established models, estimates of Gross Photosynthetic Production (GPP), and separate soil and plant respiration. A relationship between depth to the water table and soil respiration was established that showed increasing ecosystem respiration with increasing depth to the water table. Annual results are presented for 2002, which also incorporate harvest and cattle carbon gains and losses. In 2002, the site had a significant loss of soil carbon of 59 gC m(-2) y(-1) compared to the historical long-term carbon uptake of natural peat-lands. However, it is shown that the current implementation of the management scheme is ineffective in maintaining the prescribed water levels in the ditches. A consequence of this is that desired water levels in the field are not achieved. Controlling the management scheme for in-field water levels (rather than channel levels) is shown to decrease markedly the annual soil respiration and hence help to maintain the current soil carbon stocks without affecting the current farming practice.

   FREEZE-THAW; CH4; AGRICULTURE; GRASSLAND; CROPS; CO2
AB Agricultural peat soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions of N2O were measured from field plots of grass, barley, potatoes and fallow on a peat field in northern Finland during 2000-2002 and in southern Finland in 1999-2002. In the north the mean annual fluxes of N2O (with their standard errors) during 2 years were 4.0 (+/-1.2), 13 (+/-3.0) and 4.4 (+/-0.8) kg N ha(-1) from the plots of grass, barley and fallow, respectively. In the north there were no significant thaw periods in the middle of winter. As a result, the thawing in the spring did not induce especially large N2O emissions. Emissions of N2O were larger in the south than in the north. In the southern peat field the mean annual fluxes during 3 years were 7.3 (+/-1.2), 15 (+/-2.6), 10 (+/-1.9) and 25 (+/-6.9) kg N2O-N ha(-1) for grass, barley, potato and fallow plots, respectively. Here, the largest single episodes of emission occurred during the spring thaw each year, following winter thaw events. An emission factor of 10.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) for the N2O emission from the decomposition of the peat results from these data if the effect of fertilization according to the IPCC default emission factor is omitted. The direct effect of adding N as fertilizer on N2O emissions was of minor importance. On average, 52% of the annual N2O flux entered the atmosphere outside the cropping season (October-April) in the north and 55% in the south. The larger N2O fluxes from the peat soil in the south might be due to the more humified status of the peat, more rapid mineralization and weather with more cycles of freezing and thawing in the winter.

AB 1. Soil acidification is prerequisite for the reconstruction of lowland heath communities dominated by Calluna vulgaris on land that has been cultivated intensively. Naturally occurring sulphidic peat from a coastal basin deposit was investigated as a potential soil modifier. Its total S and Fe contents confirmed the presence of pyrite (FeS2).
   2. In a lysimeter experiment, the surface pH of peat dropped rapidly from 6.5 to 2.5 as pyrite oxidized to produce sulphuric acid. It increased only slightly in the following 5 years. The pH of leachate from the lysimeters dropped to c. 2.0, rising to c. 3.0 over 5 years. Large pulses of soluble iron and sulphate were released from the lysimeters, peaking in the first winter; the Fe discharge fell to background levels after 2 years but SO42- concentrations were still elevated after 5 years. Calluna vulgaris seeds were not able to germinate and survive on the raw peat, even with irrigation. Some seedlings became established on the control agricultural soil but succumbed rapidly to competition from arable weeds.
   3. In a second experiment, we amended the surface 15 cm of agricultural soil with peat and compared its properties with bracken litter. The peat sample acidified less, but both peat and bracken incorporation resulted in surface acidification. Neither acidity nor Fe was released in leachates, although the expected pulse of SO42- was discharged from treatments involving pear. Calluna vulgaris seedlings established well on peat mixtures and responded to initial weed control and irrigation treatments. However, after 1 year, competition from Trifolium repens, Agrostis gigantea and Agrostis capillaris had extinguished the C, vulgaris populations, except on the bracken litter mixture where some seedlings persisted for a further 2 years. Weed roots had grown through all the surface layers and exploited the underlying arable soil.
   4, The weed seed bank is a major obstacle to heathland reconstruction on arable soil. Pyritic peat has potential as a soil amendment to lower pH and fertility and improve water retention, but it would be needed in greater proportions and to greater depths than used here in order to reduce weed competitiveness. Its use would release large amounts of mobile sulphate into the soil, potentially an issue for groundwater protection; the evidence suggests that the soluble iron and acidity released would not penetrate to a great depth in the profile.

AB A genetically engineered Pseudomonas fluorescens C5t strain was introduced as a mixture of cells and nonsterile peat into 300 g of nonsterile agricultural sandy loam soil contained in 1-L flask microcosms.  A freshly prepared P. fluorescens and peat mixture exhibited markedly higher respiratory activity and survival over a 28-day period than a similar mixture which was aged 1 week at 20-degrees-C prior to being inoculated into soil.  The soil microcosm used in this study allowed the rapid assessment of both respiratory activity and bacterial survival.  These findings may be important when developing an appropriate system to deliver a bacterial strain into the soil environment.

AB The Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola was once a common breeding bird in mesotrophic fen mires all over Central and Western Europe. In the last century large parts of its habitat have been destroyed by wetland drainage and agricultural intensification. Besides protecting the remaining breeding habitats, it is of great importance to preserve suitable migration stopover habitats and wintering grounds to avert the extinction of the species.
   We determined home-range size and the use of vegetation associations of Aquatic Warblers on the wintering grounds in a flooded plain north of the Djoudj National Park in Senegal. Individual birds (11) were caught in mist nets and equipped with radio transmitters. Locations were assessed by radiotelemetry and a compositional analysis was conducted to determine which vegetation types were preferred within home ranges.
   Similar to their behaviour on the breeding grounds, the Aquatic Warblers showed no territorial behaviour in their winter quarters. They used home ranges that averaged 4 ha in size, which they shared with conspecifics and other warblers. The home ranges overlapped 54% on average, with a maximum of 90% in an area used by four individuals. The vegetation structure of the wintering habitat is similar to breeding grounds and stopover sites of the species. Preferential vegetation had 80% to 100% cover and consisted of 60 to 90 cm high stands of Oryza longistaminata, Scirpus maritimus or Eleocharis mutata. Most birds stayed more often near the edge of open water, probably for foraging. A constant inundation seems essential, because Aquatic Warblers never occurred in desiccated parts of the study site.

The need in nitric fertilizers varies from very high to low when compared with the need in and potassium fertilizers. In some cases, the lowest rates of nitrogen are required, During the initial stages of cultivation and agricultural development of peat soils, the reserves of soil nitrogen may play the main role in nutrition of plants. After 35-50 years of cultivation, natural reserves of nitrogen in peat soils decrease significantly, acid the role of nitric fertilizers increases. At present, there is a great need in nitric fertilizers, and it will increase in the future.

AB Water draining from the Everglades marshes of southern Florida contains high concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON), and in some locations, P (DOP). These dissolved organic nutrients carry over 90% of the N and organic C, and about 25% of the P exported downstream in the Everglades. Our objectives were to describe the most important aspects of the origin and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Everglades, and to describe the processes controlling its concentration and export. Concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients are influenced by local plant production, decomposition, and sorption equilibrium with peat. The drained peat soils of the Everglades Agricultural Area and the more productive marshes of the northern Everglades produce some of the highest concentrations of DOC and DON in the Everglades watershed. In portions of the marshes of the northern Everglades, P enrichment was correlated with higher local DOC and DON concentrations and greater production of soluble plant matter. Microbial degradation of Everglades DOM was very slow; less than 10% of the DOC was lost after 6 months of incubation in the laboratory and supplements of inorganic nutrients failed to speed the decomposition. Exposure to solar radiation increased the subsequent decay rate of the remaining DOC (25% in 6 mo.). Solar radiation alone mineralized 20.5% of the DOC, 7% of the DON, and degraded about 50% of the humic substances over 21 days in sterile porewater samples and thus degraded DOM faster than microbial degradation. The humic substances appeared to inhibit biodegradation of the other fractions of the DOC since hydrophilic organic acids decomposed faster when isolated from the humic substances. The fate of DOC and DON is closely linked as indicated by a generally narrow range of C/N ratios. In contrast, high concentrations of DOP were associated with P enrichment (at least in pore water). The DOC was composed of about 50% humic substances, 33% hydrophilic acids, and 15% hydrophilic neutral substances, typical of DOC from other environments, despite the fact that it originates from a neutral to slightly alkaline peatland. Despite high exports of DON (3.9 g m(-2) y(-1) from one area), the marshes of the northern Everglades are a sink for DON on a landscape scale. The agricultural fields of the Everglades Agricultural Area, however, exported net quantities of DON. High concentrations of DOC desorbed from the agricultural soils when water with no DOC was added. Sorption experiments indicated that high concentrations of dissolved organic matter flowing into the marshes from the Everglades Agricultural Area could suppress the further desorption of additional soluble organic matter through physicochemical mechanisms. While biological factors, plant production and microbial decomposition are important in producing potentially soluble organic nutrients, physicochemical sorption equilibria, hydrology, and degradation by solar radiation are also likely to control the export of this material on the landscape scale.

AB NO3, Mn, Fe, and SO4 act as terminal electron acceptors (TEAs), modifying mineralization pathways and coupling biogeochemical cycles. Although single TEA concentrations and fluxes have been intensively studied, the factors regulating the simultaneous fluxes and molar ratios of TEAs are poorly elucidated. We studied the mean concentrations, exports, and molar ratios of TEAs from 27 boreal catchments differing in land cover (percentage of agricultural land, peatland, forest, and built-up area) during the years 2000-2011. TEA exports and molar ratios were strongly controlled by land cover and only a little by atmospheric deposition. Fields produced the highest export of TEAs, particularly NO3. Peatland was linked to low NO3 and SO4, but high Fe exports. NO3, Mn, and Fe exports from forests were low, SO4 having proportionally the highest export. Together, the percentages of field and peatland predicted 93, 80, 75, and 67% of the variation in the export of NO3, Mn, Fe, and SO4, respectively. The variable export of TEAs having different availability and physical behavior may create different premises for anaerobic mineralization in downstream systems, which adds a new dimension to the link between terrestrial system, land use, and environmental problems, such as eutrophication and climate change.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are highly variable in time, with high peak emissions lasting a few days to several weeks and low background emissions. This temporal variability is poorly understood which hampers the simulation of daily N2O emissions. In structured soils, like clay and peat, aggregates hamper the diffusion of oxygen, which leads to anaerobic microsites in the soil, favourable for denitrification. Diffusion of N2O out of the aggregates is also hampered, which leads to delayed emissions and increased reduction of N2O to N-2. In this model simulation study we investigate the effect of aggregates in soils on the N2O emissions. We present a parameterization to simulate the effects of aggregates on N2O production by denitrification and on N2O reduction. The parameterization is based on the mobile-immobile model concept. It was implemented in a field-scale hydrological-biogeochemical model combination. We compared the simulated fluxes with observed fluxes from a fertilized and drained peat soil under grass.
   The results of this study show that aggregates strongly affect the simulated N2O emissions: peak emissions are lower, whereas the background emissions are slightly higher. Including the effect of aggregates caused a 40% decrease in the simulated annual emissions relative to the simulations without accounting for the effects of aggregates. The new parameterization significantly improved the model performance regarding simulation of observed daily N2O fluxes; r(2) and RMSE improved from 0.11 and 198 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) to 0.41 and 40 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Our analyses of the model results show that aggregates have a larger impact on the reduction than on the production of N2O. Reduction of N2O is more sensitive to changes in the drivers than production of N2O and is in that sense the key to understanding N2O emissions from denitrification. The effects of changing environmental conditions on reduction of N2O relative to N2O production strongly depend on the NO3 content of the soil. More anaerobic conditions have hardly any effect on the ratio of production to reduction if NO3 is abundant, but will decrease this ratio if NO3 is limiting. In the first case the emissions will increase, whereas in the second case the emissions will decrease. This study suggests that the current knowledge of the hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes may be sufficient to understand the observed N2O fluxes from a fertilized clayey peatland. Further research is needed to test how aggregates affect the N2O fluxes from other soils or soils with different fertilization regimes.

AB The market of pellet fuels has undergone drastic changes in Europe in recent years. Traditional raw materials have become inaccessible due to unavailability or dramatic increases in prices. It is possible to use other feasible raw materials for pellet production. However, novel raw materials can have disadvantages with respect to usability and emissions, and these issues need to be considered before such raw materials are taken into wide-scale production. Such factors are especially important in small-scale pellet combustion. Fine particle and gaseous emissions from 21 pellet fuels of various raw materials were studied in a residential pellet boiler. These fuels represented a wide range of stem wood, bark, and forest residues from different tree species, as well as peat, agricultural biomass, and different mixtures of these. Fuel characteristics, fine particle mass (PM,) emissions, number emissions, number size distribution, PM, chemical composition, and the main gaseous emissions were measured. The smallest PM, emissions were measured from peat pellets, followed by wood-peat pellets and woody biomass pellets containing only small amounts of bark. Peat also reduced the PM, and CO emissions when blended with woody biomass pellets. Pellets containing bark produced clearly higher PM, emissions due to the higher content of ash-forming elements, such as potassium, chlorine, and sodium, in the fuels. The highest PM, emissions were seen with straw pellets. Linear correlations were found between emissions and fuel characteristics: fuel K content, fuel K+Na+Cl content, and fuel (Na+K)*2Cl/S molar ratio being the most important parameters. The results show that biomass raw materials significantly affect particle emissions in combustion. The addition of peat to biomass can result in lower particle emissions but higher emissions of SO2 and HCl.

AB The study presents the microbiological and biochemical characterisation of peat substrates supplemented with composts manufactured from sewage sludge, maize, lupine and wheat straw under cultivation of garden verbena. At three successive plant developmental stages, substrate samples were collected and subsequently analysed microbiologically and biochemically.
   The performed microbiological analyses involved determination, using the Koch plate method, of total numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and molds.
   The experimental substrates were also subjected to biochemical analyses which involved spectrophotometric determination of levels of dehydrogenase activity.
   In addition, the following plant morphological analyses were performed: plant height, shoot number and length, number of buds, inflorescences and leaf greenness index (SPAD).
   It was found that the plants cultivated on peat substrate, with addition of various composts, grew properly and their appearance did not differ from plants grown on a traditional peat substrate. It was further found that the addition of some composts (especially K3 made up of sewage sludge, rape straw and sawdust) to the peat made it possible to obtain higher plants, and stimulated the development of inflorescence buds.
   On the other hand, majority of the employed composts failed to exert a stimulatory effect on the greenness index of plants, or the number of developed inflorescences.
   It was observed that, irrespective of the kind and dose, the applied composts following their addition into peat contributed most to the stimulation of actinomycetes, molds development and dehydrogenases' activity, but to a lesser degree, the development of heterotrophic bacteria. Among major factors determining substrate enzymatic activity as well as changes in numbers of the investigated microorganisms were substrate pH value as well as the developmental phase of garden verbena.

ID MOISTURE; DENSITY
AB Thermal conductivity and diffusivity were measured in the field and the laboratory with a portable thermal properties sensor and probe (KD2, Decagon Devices, Inc.) for twelve major agricultural soils in Trinidad. These parameters were measured because they are required for the design of underground cables and for agronomic practice. The effect of incorporating peat into four of the agricultural soils on thermal conductivity and diffusivity was further investigated over a range of stresses from 0 to 1000 kPa using a compression machine. Air-dry peat was applied at four levels (0%, 4%, 8%, and 12% by mass) to the four soils (two sandy loams, a clay loam, and clay) and tested at three moisture contents by mass, namely, 5% below Proctor optimum for maximum compaction, optimum, and 5% above optimum. Bulk densities achieved during soil compression were computed to assist in the interpretation of the results. The thermal conductivity measured in the field ranged from 0.90 to 1.55 W m(-1) degrees C-1 and were within 0.1 W m(-1) degrees C-1 of the values measured in the laboratory for the individual soils. Mean thermal conductivity during laboratory measurements declined significantly from 1.21 to 0.97 W m(-1) degrees C-1, and mean thermal diffusivity declined from 0.25 to 0.19 mm(2) s(-1) as the peat content increased from 0% to 12% by mass. Mean thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased significantly with increasing applied stress and moisture level at the 0.001 level and declined, in most cases, with increasing clay content. The effect of peat incorporation in decreasing soil thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity is diminished at low soil moisture and bulk density. Thermal conductivity, and diffusivity were significantly (p = 0.001) and linearly related to each other Two significant (p = 0.001) linear equations developed to relate each thermal property to bulk density suggest that unique relationships may exist between the two thermal properties and bulk density A multiple linear regression equation was further developed from the experimental data to be utilized as a first estimation of bulk density. The results from this study contribute to the greater understanding of how peat affects thermal conductivity and diffusivity

AB In this study, agriculture biomass was used to remove dissolved organic matter from peat swamp runoff. The functional groups and morphological properties of 6 tropical agriculture biomasses (coconut husk, rice husk, empty fruit bunch, sago hampers, saw dust and banana trunk) in their raw and citric acid-treated states were examined. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra showed that various biomasses were typically characterised with lignocellulosic compounds. The spectra analysis further demonstrated that citric acid treatment resulted in the dissolution of lignin and hemicelluloses to various extents where carboxyl groups were also introduced. These changes hypothetically suggest improved adsorption ability. Treatment of peat swamp runoff with various untreated biomasses showed no adsorption. With the modified biomass, adsorption was evidenced, with rice husk illustrating the highest removal efficiency of 60% to 65%.The biosorbent can be used in the water treatment process especially for treating water with a high dissolved organic matter content. The spent sorbent can be subsequently applied as a soil conditioner as the dissolved organic fraction, commonly known as humic matter, possesses important agricultural value.

AB The impact of experimentally intensified summer drought and precipitation on N2O and NO turnover and fluxes was investigated in a minerotrophic fen over a 2-year period. On three treatment plots, drought was induced for 6 and 10 weeks by means of roofs and drainage and decreased water table levels by 0.1-0.3 m compared with three nonmanipulated control plots. When averaged over the three treatment plots, both N2O and NO emission showed only little response to the drought. On the single plot scale, however, a clear impact of the treatment on N2O and NO fluxes could be identified. On the plot with the weakest water table reduction hardly any response could be observed, while on the plot with the greatest drainage effect, N2O and NO fluxes increased by 530% and 270%, respectively. Rewetting reduced NO emissions to background levels (0.05-0.15 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), but heavily enhanced N2O emission (18-36 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) for several days in the plots with largest water table reduction. These peaks contributed up to 40% to the cumulative N2O fluxes and were caused by rapid N2O production according to isotope abundance data. According to N2O concentrations and isotope abundance analysis N2O was mostly produced at depths between 0.3 and 0.5 m. During water table reduction net N2O production in 0.1 m depth steadily increased in the most effectively dried plot from 2 up to 44 pmol cm(-3) day(-1). Rewetting immediately increased net N2O production in the topsoil of the drought plots, showing rates of 18-174 pmol cm(-3) day(-1). This study demonstrates that drought and rewetting can temporarily increase N2O emission to levels that have to date only been reported from nutrient rich and degraded fens that have been drained for agricultural purposes.

The hydrolysates were prepared using high-pressure treatment at 185-degrees-C, without the addition of acid. The growth of the yeast was studied as a function of the pH, temperature, culture time, and agitation speed. The best conditions for the growth of the yeast were: a pH of 7, a temperature of 18-degrees-C, 5-d culture time, and 200-rpm agitation. Under those conditions, P. rhodozyma produced a concentration of 1279.82 mug carotenoids g-1 dry yeast, which compares well with other previously reported results.

AB Methods used to estimate the CO2 emission from soil commonly measure the total CO2 flux. To be able to quantify the net CO2 emission from cultivated peat soils there is a need to distinguish between soil organic matter-derived CO2 respiration and plant-derived respiration. In this investigation we used the root exclusion method to separate the plant-derived respiration from total CO2 emission. The plant-derived contribution was estimated to be between 27 and 63% of total CO2 emission depending on soil type and season. We also found a relationship between soil temperature, biomass growth and CO2 efflux, which can be used to estimate plant-derived respiration. Due to the priming effect the root exclusion method is less reliable late in the season.

TI Late Holocene coastal-plain evolution of the Netherlands: the role of

AB This paper demonstrates the decisive role of natural preconditions on the formation of large late Holocene sea ingressions in peaty coastal plains along the North Sea's southern shores. Geological and archaeological evidence shows that these sea ingressions (expansion of new tidal systems) were mainly caused by land subsidence, which occurred due to intensified agricultural use of artificially drained peatlands since the Late Iron Age (250-12 BC). This made the coastal plain sensitive to storm-surge ingression through weak spots, e.g., at the location of existing creeks, in the coastline.
   Using The Netherlands as a case study, we show that natural preconditions (i.e., the geological setting at the time of ingression) played a key role in the pacing and extent of tidal area expansion. Ingressive tidal systems eventually reached most far inland in coastal segments with wide peaty back-barrier plains. In contrast, sea ingression formation was hampered in coastal segments with well-developed natural ingression-protecting geomorphic features (e.g., beach-barriers, supratidal levees). Feedback mechanisms, such as additional peat subsidence by loading of sediment imported into the new tidal area, caused further tidal volume increase and created accommodation space for tidal deposits. These combined effects caused irreversible sea ingression over large areas that consequently became unsuitable for habitation for many centuries.
   Improved understanding of such sea-ingression mechanisms and their facilitating conditions are essential for the assessment of the sensitivity of many densely populated coastal plains, which experience major human-induced subsidence, eventually leading to coastal plain drowning.

AB In a model experiment, the transformation of microbial complexes of cultivated saprotrophic bacteria and yeasts during freezing-thawing was studied in various natural substrates that are used to create soil constructions for urban landscaping and for growing herbaceous plants. The number of saprotrophic bacteria and yeasts depended both on the type of substrate and on temperature changes during freezing-thawing. At the stage of freezing of peat and soil (arable horizon) to 0 and -5 degrees C and at the subsequent stage of thawing to 0 degrees C, a significant increase in yeast number was registered. The maximum number of yeasts in soil and peat was 5.1 log (CFU/g). In contrast to the number of yeasts, number of saprotrophic bacteria in soil and peat was characterized by a sharp decrease when the substrate temperature was negative and peaked at 19-22 and 10 degrees C, respectively. The maximum bacterial number in soil and peat was 7.5 and 8.0 log (CFU/g), respectively. In sand, number of both saprotrophic bacteria and yeasts did not depend on the temperature and was 5.0 log (CFU/g) for bacteria and 3.4 log(CFU/g) for yeasts at all stages of the freezing-thawing cycles. In total, 15 saprotrophic bacterial species and 29 yeast species were isolated from different components of soil constructions. At the maximum temperature of freezing in the cycles (-5 degrees C), three bacterial species with psychrophilic properties (Flavobacterium psychrophilum) and the ability to form endospores resistant to various adverse effects (Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium) were isolated from soil and peat. Among the yeasts isolated from soil and peat at negative temperature and also having psychrophilic properties were Candida sake, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rh. mucilaginosa, and Solicoccozyma terricola. Bacteria with psychrophilic properties, F. psychrophilum and Pseudomonas fluorescens, as well as two species of bacilli, Bacillus subtilis and B. megaterium were revealed in sand at negative temperatures. Only one yeast species, Debaryomyces hansenii, capable of surviving stress conditions in the form of ascospores, was isolated from sand at -5 degrees C. The effect of short-term temperature drops on the microbial communities' number and diversity dynamics in soil constructions in a model experiment showed that specialized soil constructions were able to "tolerate" short-term temperature stress drops typical of the spring and autumn period, restoring the number of initial populations after cessation of the negative impacts. This also indicates development of the soil constructions in the process of functioning, rather than their rapid degradation.

AB Water passing through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta contains elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane (THM) precursor relative to upstream waters from the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River. Drainage from agricultural peat soils has been identified as one of the major sources of DOC and THM precursor. A series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate abiotic and biotic effects on the quantity and the nature of DOC and THM precursors produced from oxidized surface and reduced subsurface soils in the Delta. For abiotic effects, DOC was extracted from both soils with synthetic solutions containing a range of salinity (0-4dS/m) and sodicity (0 to infinity). The results showed that an increase in salinity significantly decreased the concentration of DOC in the soil-water from both soils but increased its aromaticity, as indicated by specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA). For biotic effects, peat soils were incubated over a range of temperatures (10degreesC, 20degreesC and 30degreesC) and soil moisture contents (0.3-10g water/g soil). After 8 weeks of incubation, only extracted DOC from flooded conditions and flooded and non-flooded cycles showed an increase in DOC. These findings indicate that neither salinity nor sodicity is the major factor for DOC production, but both can affect the solubility and mobility of DOC in the Delta soils. We believe wetting processes in oxidized peat soils produce significant amounts of DOC found in agricultural drainage discharged into the Delta waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The direct and indirect effects of iron on the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are reviewed. In addition to the mining of Fe enriched ores, intensified forestry, peat production and agricultural draining have increased the load of iron in many river ecosystems. The effects of iron on aquatic animals and their habitats are mainly indirect, although the direct toxic effects of Fe2+ are also important in some lotic habitats receiving Fe-enriched effluents in cold seasons, in particular. Ferric hydroxide and Fe-humus precipitates, on both biological and other surfaces, indirectly effect lotic organisms by disturbing the normal metabolism and osmoregulation, and by changing the structure and quality of benthic habitats and food resources. The combined direct and indirect effects of iron contamination decrease the species diversity and abundance of periphyton, benthic invertebrates and fishes. Sorption and co-precipitation of metals by Fe-oxides decrease the bioavailability and toxicity of water-borne metals, but may increase the dietary supply of metals and lead to toxic effects along the food chain. At the cellular level, Fe functions both as a detoxification mechanism, as well as a cell degeneration agent by inducing the formation of hydroxyl free radicals. More research is needed on the factors that affect the environmental fate and ecotoxicological impacts of iron on river ecosystems. As the flux of iron is heavily affected by seasonally varying physical, chemical and biological processes, its impact on ecosystems should be studied on multiple spatial, and temporal scales and at different levels of biological organisation.

The study results demonstrated a direct effect of the substrate on the yield quantity and quality of strawberry fruits. Cultivar 'Albion' proved to have the highest yield under conditions of hydroponic cultivation. A higher yield as well as increased contents of extract, sugars, organic acids, polyphenols, and anthocyanins were found in fruits from plants cultivated in the peat-coconut substrate (50: 50). A different observation was made for vitamin C content, the highest content of which was determined in fruits of cultivar 'Polka' cultivated in the substrate containing 80% of peat and 20% of coconut.

AB We have reconstructed the altitudinal position of the upper forest line (UFL) during the last 6000 years. This boundary between montane forest and paramo (tropical alpine grasslands) has important ecological and societal relevance. It is suggested that human-induced fires and deforestation during the long occupation history of the Central Valley of Ecuador have caused a downslope shift of the UFL and have given way to a downslope expansion of paramo vegetation. More recently, montane forests and lower paramo have been replaced to a large extent by agricultural land. Pollen analysis of a 90 cm long sediment core G15-II from a small mire at 3400 m elevation, 200 m below the actual UFL in Guandera Biological Reserve (0 degrees 36' N, 77 degrees 42'E), shows the altitudinal position of the UFL during seven discrete intervals: (1) from 7150 to 6240 cal. yr BP the UFL was at c. 3100-3200 m and climatic conditions were cool; (2) from 6240 to 5320 cal. yr BP the UFL shifted to c. 3600 m and upper montane rainforest (UMRF) surrounded the mire; (3) from 5320 to 2160 cal. yr BP the UFL was at 3600-3650 m elevation and montane forest consisted mainly of Hedyosmum, Weinmannia, Melastomataceae, Ilex, Scrophulariaceae and Symplocos; (4) from 2160 to 910 cal. yr BP the UFL shifted downslope to 3350 m and the mire was located in the lowermost paramo; (5) from 910 to 520 cal. yr BP cooler climatic conditions prevailed and the UFL was at 3250-3300 m; (6) since c. 520 cal. yr BP the UFL has shifted upslope to 3600 m. During this period presence of agricultural weeds (Rumex) and evidence of draining and disturbance of the mire indicate that agricultural activities expanded and almost reached the reserve area; (7) during the last 150 cal. yr disturbance increased. We conclude that during the last 6000 years the UFL reached a maximum altitude of 3650 to 3700 m, indicating that paramo grasslands above this elevation represent a natural ecosystem. Under the Kyoto Protocol-driven reforestation activities, trees should be planted up to a maximum of 3700 m. Planting trees (exotic species in particular) above 3700 m would contribute to the degradation of the natural ecosystem.

AB The development of the spatial N export and retention model N_EXRET for large river basins is presented, utilizing remote-sensing-based land use and forest classification. Export coefficients describing the contribution from agriculture, forestry and peat harvesting were estimated based on empirical studies. Representativeness of forest treatment coefficients have been evaluated by use of data from a small, well-documented test catchment. Simulation results from the application of the model to the Oulujoki river basin (22 840 km(2)) are discussed. Model estimated N fluxes were compared with measured N fluxes in separate points of the river basin. Based on source apportionment, agriculture contributes 17% of the total export, varying between 8% in the uppermost subbasin and 38% in the lowermost subbasin close to the sea. Forestry contributes almost as much, 16%, with less pronounced variation (11-24%) between the different subbasins. In the separate subbasins, 7-37% of the incoming gross N export was retained. Based on mass balances and sensitivity analyses, retention was estimated to be in the range of 5-10 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) in lakes and 0-1 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) in peatlands. The model results were validated by testing to data from the 3 closely situated river basins. However, further testing is needed in river basins where land use and deposition patterns differ clearly from these northern basins.

AB In this work, the activity concentrations (radioactivity) and distributions of natural radionuclides in peat moss samples were investigated. The measurements were performed using HP-Ge detector and XRD technique. The samples represent six types of soils. The concentrations of radionuclides of(238)U,Ra-226,Th-232 and(40)K are ranged from 17.14 to 130.83, 13.19 to 26.09, 5.33 to 25.2 and 143.26 to 600.31 Bq center dot kg(-1)(dry weight), respectively, for the different samples. This work also highlights that no correlation has been observed between radionuclides present in the samples, which in turn reflects the random method behind the preparation of the samples. The obtained results from the XRD analysis were in good agreement with radiometry measurements. The safety of peat moss uses was limited for certain agricultural crops due to the presence of high percent of sulphur in some types of soil. The radon concentration calculated using the empirical formula is more accurate than those obtained from the manual measurements and significant values were expected to emanate from the samples under investigation.

AB Recent rates of peat accretion (as determined by Cs-137) and N, P, organic C, Ca and Na accumulation were measured along a 10 km eutrophication gradient in the northern Everglades area of Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA 2A) that has received agricultural drainage from the Hillsboro canal for the past 25-30 yrs. Rates of peat accretion were highest at sampling locations closest to the Hillsboro canal, 1.6 km downstream, (5.67 +/- 0.50 mm/yr) and decreased to 2.01 +/- 0.31 mm/yr at distances of 7.1 to 10.7 km downstream. Phosphorus and Na accumulation were a function of both peat accretion and soil P and Na concentrations. The concentration and accumulation of P in peat deposited in the past 26 years was highest near the Hillsboro canal (1478 +/- 67 mug/g, 0.66 +/- 0.06 g/m2/yr) and decreased to 560 +/- 20 mug/g and 0.10 +/- 0.02 g/M2/yr at distances of 8.8 to 10.7 km downstream. Like phosphorus, the concentration and rate of Na accumulation was highest near the Hillsboro canal (3205 +/- 1021 mug/g, 1.48 +/- 0.53 g/m2/yr). Although sodium enrichment of the peat was limited to 1.6 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, increased rates of Na accumulation penetrated 5.2 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, the extent of the area of enhanced peat accretion.
   In contrast to P and Na, there was no difference in the concentration of soil organic C, N and Ca along the eutrophication gradient. However, there was a gradient of organic C, N and Ca accumulation corresponding to the area of enhanced peat accretion. The highest rates occurred 1.6 km south of the Hillsboro canal (212 +/- 5 g organic C/M2/yr, 14.1 +/- 0.4 g N/m2/yr, 22.1 +/- 5.2 g Ca/m2/yr). Accumulation of organic C, N and Ca at distances of 7.1-10.7 km downstream averaged 87 +/- 11, 6.3 +/- 0.7 and 6.5 +/- 0.9 g/m2/yr, respectively.
   The areal extent of enhanced peat accretion and organic C, N, Ca and Na accumulation encompasses approximately 7700 ha of the northern part of WCA 2A. The area of enhanced P accumulation is larger, covering 11,500 ha or 26% of the total area of WCA 2A. The 11,500 ha area has functioned as a sink for P for the past 25-30 yr removing 74% (49.3 MT/yr) of the 67 MT/yr that enters via agricultural drainage and rainfall: Moreover, P accumulation along the gradient was related to mean (1989-1990) surface water P concentration, decreasing as surface water P decreases. These findings suggest that P accumulation is dependent on the P concentration in the water column and that decreasing P loadings per unit area result in less P storage per unit area. The potential long-term equilibrium of the 11,500 ha area as a sink for P is based on a mean annual loading of 67 metric tons P/yr. Input rates exceeding this loading rate could result in an expansion of the 11,500 ha area until a new equilibrium size is reached.

TI Land subsidence in drained peat areas of the Province of Friesland, The

DE hydrogeology; land subsidence; organic materials; pumping; surface water
AB The Holocene pear areas in the Province of Friesland consisting of peat and clay deposits are used extensively for agriculture and are drained by maintaining a low surface water level in polder ditches. Considerable rates of land subsidence (1 to 12mm/year) result from processes such as soil shrinkage, consolidation and peat oxidation, the last named being the major contributor.
   In the Province of Friesland studies of the future effects of continuous long-term land subsidence have been made as part of the hydrological masterplan. For these studies the Geological Survey of The Netherlands (RGD) has compiled maps showing the estimated subsidence over a 50-year period for three scenarios of freeboard (difference in elevation between surface water level and the ground surface). Data sources consist of recent ground surface levels measured for the construction of utility lines, to be used for the transport of water, gas or sewage, earlier topographical maps, historical surface water level records and soil profiles.
   Maximum estimates for rates of subsidence for peat with and without clay cover have been established by evaluation of the data with subsequent subsidence process analysis for various situations of drainage, duration of drainage, soil and hydrological conditions. Three maps showing the estimated land subsidence over a 50-year period for freeboards of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 m have been compiled using a two-dimensional Geographical Information System (2D-GIS), coupled with the RGD database, and have been presented in 1 km(2) grids. A comprehensive map of estimated land subsidence is being compiled by the Province, taking into account the actual freeboards at each location. The presented study forms a new approach to the estimation of future land subsidence in peat areas on a regional scale.

AB Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima cv. 'Premium Red') as an ornamental pot plant is widely grown in peat-based substrates with high phosphorus (P) fertilization. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the P demand of poinsettia according to its P depletion ability during the growth stages by using a mechanistic simulation model. For this purpose, rooted poinsettia cuttings were grown in the medium with 80: 20 (V:V %) peat+mineral component (generally called as clay) and treated with different P levels of zero, 10, 35, 100, and 170 mg P [L substrate](-1). The yield and quality performance of the plants were evaluated thoroughly. Also, depletion of P around the root surface and the effect of buffering power on the depletion profile were assessed by means of mechanistic simulation model. The results showed that, in peat-based substrates, P was transported to the root surface mainly by mass-flow. The simulation approach also revealed that the well supplied plants cultivated in the peat-substrates needed a higher concentration gradient (30-50 mu M) to drive the necessary flux and that the amount of plant available P (C-s) was limiting at later growth stages. The optimum yield and quality of poinsettia was obtained at the P application rate of 35 mg L-1 substrate, with C-s of 11-12 and 15-16 mg [L substrate](-1) at planting and 53 days after planting. It was concluded that, to ensure a sufficiently high concentration gradient, P had to be supplemented by frequent fertigation at later growth stages, but not at the early growing stage.

AB Ireland reported the highest non-compliance with respect to total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) in drinking water across the 27 European Union Member States for the year 2010. We carried out a GIS-based investigation of the links between geographical parameters and catchment land-uses with TFHMs concentrations in Irish drinking water. A high risk catchment map was created using peat presence, rainfall (>1400 mm) and slope (<5%) and overlain with a map comprising the national dataset of routinely monitored TTHM concentrations. It appeared evident from the map that the presence of peat, rainfall and slope could be used to identify catchments at high risk to TTHM exceedances. Furthermore, statistical analyses highlighted that the presence of peat soil with agricultural land was a significant driver of TTHM exceedances for all treatment types. PARAFAC analysis from three case studies identified a fluorophore indicative of reprocessed humic natural organic matter as the dominant component following treatment at the three sites. Case studies also indicated that (1) chloroform contributed to the majority of the TTHMs in the drinking water supplies and (2) the supply networks contributed to about 30141:1 of TTHMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is emerging concern over the impact of extreme events such as heavy rainfall on the quality of water entering the drinking water supply from aboveground sources, as such events are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency in response to climate change. We compared the impact of rainfall events on streamwater quality in four contrasting upland (peatland and mineral soil) and lowland agricultural catchments used to supply drinking water in France (Brittany) and the United Kingdom (North Wales) by analyzing water samples collected before, during, and after specific events. At all four streams, heavy rainfall led to a considerable rise in organic matter concentration ranging from 48 to 158%. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quality, as determined using specific ultraviolet absorbance, changed consistently at all sites during rainfall events, with a greater proportion of aromatic and higher molecular weight compounds following the onset of rainfall. However, the change in DOC quality and quantity did not significantly alter the trihalomethane formation potential. We observed small increases in trihalomethane (THM) generation only at the Welsh peatland and agricultural sites and a small decrease at the Brittany agricultural site. The proportion of brominated THMs in chlorinated waters was positively correlated with bromide/DOC ratio in raw waters for all sites and hydrological conditions. These results provide a first indication of the potential implications for surface-based drinking water resources resulting from expected future increases in rainfall event intensity and extension of dry periods with climate changes.

AB The objective of this study was to test the effects of selected peat growth substrates (Agro CS, Gramoflor and Durpeta) and inoculation with commercial ectomycorrhizal inocula (Ectovit and Mycorrhizaroots) on growth, ectomycorrhiza formation, needle nutrients concentration and several physiological parameters of two-years-old containerized Norway spruce seedlings cultivated under standard nursery conditions. The selected substrates differed in origin, composition and nutrient content: Agro CS and Gramoflor were mixtures of various peat types and components with added nutrients, while Durpeta was non-enriched pure peat. Growth parameters of seedlings cultivated in enriched substrates were significantly higher than those grown on the non-enriched substrate. Significant interactions were found between substrate and inoculation treatments. Inoculation with Ectovit stimulated seedling growth in non-enriched substrate but had no effect on seedling parameters in the enriched substrates, and a negative effect on aboveground biomass in Gramoflor. Mycorrhizaroots inoculum significantly decreased shoot to root dry weight ratio, but had no other effect on seedling development. ECM colonization rate of seedlings ranged from 73 to 80%, with no significant effects of the ECM inoculum or growth substrate. DNA analysis revealed a low species diversity of ECM fungi on seedling roots, with a pronounced dominance of the soil-borne ECM species Thelephora terrestris Fr. Chemical analysis of needles and measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence showed similar trends as seedling growth. Values of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and needle N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations were higher in both enriched substrates. Ectovit increased (though not significantly) chlorophyll a fluorescence in needles as compared to Mycorrhizaroots- and non-inoculated seedlings, as well as nutrient-uptake (mainly K) in the non-enriched substrate. Our results suggest the importance of the origin and composition of peat-based substrates on the development of container-grown Norway spruce seedlings, while the observed positive effect of the commercial ECM inoculum Ectovit was more probably caused by its physical and chemical properties rather than by its efficiency in promoting ECM fungi symbiosis. The enriched substrates tested appear to be suitable for production of spruce seedlings of acceptable size for outplanting within two growing seasons.

AB The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to identify the potential environmental impact of dredged sediments used as growing media for food crops. The dredged sediments used came from Livorno port and were previously phytoremediated. For the assay, strawberry plants (Fragaria x ananassa Duch vr. 'San Andreas') were used. The plants were cultivated on three different substrates (100% peat, 100% dredged sediment and 50% mix peat/sediment) to identify the real impact of the culture media on the growing process. LCA was calculated and analyzed according to ISO 14040:2006 by SimaPro software. ReCipe Midpoint (E) V1.13/Europe Recipe E method was applied. One kilogram of produced strawberry, for each crop media tested, was defined as the functional unit. Eighteen impact categories were selected where Marine Eutrophication (ME), Human Toxicity (HT) and Freshwater Ecotoxicity (FET) were identified as relevant impact categories. The LCA results showed an increase in the environmental impact of strawberry cultivation using 100% sediment against 100% peat, due to the decrease in fruit production caused by the sediment. Nevertheless, the decrease in the environmental impact and the fruit production increase identified when the sediment is used mixed (<50%) with other substrates. The appropriate use of these substrates would be justified within the context of the circular economy.

AB 1. We have limited knowledge of the effects of land use in general and of drainage ditching in particular on macrophyte communities in lakes. I quantified catchment land use, including drainage ditching, as well as water quality and the number of macrophyte species in 17 Swedish lakes in summer 2005.
   2. Land use within 1 km of the studied lakes was analysed in a geographic information system. The following variables were included: areas of forests, mires, agricultural land and urbanization, length of drainage ditches (classified according to the use of the land they drained), and shortest distance from lake to an urban area. To extract and analyse general trends in the data sets, redundancy analysis was used.
   3. Water quality was explained mainly by three land-use related variables: the lengths of agricultural, forest and mire ditches. The length of agricultural ditches was positively correlated with lake water conductivity, total dissolved solids, Ca, N and total organic carbon (TOC). The lengths of forest and mire ditches were positively correlated with lake water characteristics, especially TOC.
   4. The number of species representing different macrophyte life forms was explained by three environmental variables: conductivity, and lengths of forest and agricultural ditches. The numbers of isoetids, nymphaeids, elodeids and total obligate hydrophytes were negatively correlated with length of forest ditches. In contrast, the number of lemnids and helophytes was positively correlated with conductivity and length of agricultural ditches. Furthermore, the number of isoetids was exponentially related (negatively) to lengths of agricultural and forest ditches, indicating a threshold response to drainage ditch length.
   5. The results suggest that effects on water quality and macrophyte communities result from drainage ditching in the lake catchments rather than from land use itself. Given the total area of drainage-ditched land worldwide (millions of ha in Scandinavia alone), drainage ditching should be considered when evaluating environmental impacts on lake water quality and macrophyte occurrence and when determining reference conditions for catchment land use.

ID MOISTURE; DENSITY
AB The effects of incorporating peat into three Trinidadian agricultural soils before compaction on soil thermal conductivity k was investigated in a laboratory experiment. A factorial experiment was used to study the effect of peat applied at four levels (0%, 4%, 8% and 12% by mass) on maximum thermal conductivity k(max) and the corresponding moisture content on three soils (sandy loam, clay loam and clay) compacted using 5, 15 and 25 Proctor hammer blows. The compaction tests were carried out at different moisture contents ranging from 5% to 55%. Bulk densities achieved during soil compaction were measured to assist in the interpretation of results.
   Results showed that while mean values of k(max) of the soils declined significantly (probabilty P = 0.001) from 1.49 to 1.04 W m(-2) degrees C-1 with increasing peat content, the mean values of the moisture contents at which they occurred increased from 26.1% to 41.7%. While k(max) increased, the corresponding moisture contents decreased with increasing compaction levels. This applied to all soils tested. The clay soil had significantly lower values of thermal conductivities and greater corresponding moisture contents than the clay loam and the sandy loam soils. During soil compaction, thermal conductivity and bulk density behaved in the same manner, except that the maximum bulk density was achieved at lower moisture content than thermal conductivity. There was a significant interaction effect between soil type and peat content on thermal conductivity. There was also a reasonable agreement between the laboratory measured thermal conductivity data and those predicted using the Campbell model. A linear equation developed to relate thermal conductivity to bulk density suggests that a unique relationship may exist between the two parameters, when compacted soils are involved. A multiple linear regression equation was further developed for predicting bulk density from experimental factors. (c) 2006 IAgrE. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We used sedimentary pigments to evaluate algal abundance since 1868 in a relatively unperturbed, oligotrophic northeastern New Brunswick (Canada) estuary and to understand how variations relate to past land transformation or climate factors. Environmental variables included sedimentary pigments (beta-carotene, chlorophyll a, diatoxanthin, fucoxanthin, alloxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, lutein-zeaxanthin, and chlorophyll b), climate variability (precipitation, temperature during the months of April, May, June, July, August) and land-based activities (relative land surface area occupied by hay, oats, wheat, barley, peat extraction). A sediment core was taken downstream of the Pokemouche Estuary in 2010 and sectioned into 2-cm slices whose ages spanned the interval 1868-2010, determined by 210 Pb dating. Most pigments showed a marked peak in the 1920s, around the time of most widespread agricultural activities, and declined thereafter at the same time that peat extraction increased. Relative land surface area occupied by oat crops was a statistically significant environmental variable that accounted for 40 % of algal community variability (p = 0.009 by redundancy analysis). Correlation analysis suggests that expansion of non-industrial agriculture was associated with increased abundance of algal photoautotrophs in the 1920s, possibly via soil nutrient leaching. In contrast, expansion of mechanized peat extraction since the 1940s was associated with declining abundance of photoautotrophs, possibly a consequence of turbidity or color-induced light limitation, and increasing abundance of groups known to include mixotrophic algae. Overall, long-term changes in algal abundance were better correlated with land transformation variables than with climate variables. Even though resource extraction activities (agriculture, peat mining) historically involved relatively small areas of this coastal catchment (<10 %), algal abundance seems to have fluctuated in response to changes in flux of land-derived matter.

AB Major common production activities on organic soils require drainage, which results in the loss of important ecosystem services such as carbon storage. This paper provides an overview of the farming situation on organic soils in a western region of Switzerland characterized by intensive vegetable farming and therefore by high opportunity costs of adopting sustainable practices on these soils. Based on a review of the academic and grey literature and interviews with regional experts, we find that the main challenges to a change in management practices include the profitability of the current land use, the difficult economic environment of farmers, the cultural background associated with the region, and the absence of systematic data on soil properties. We provide a comparative overview of policy options that could promote sustainable use of organic soils, and present the diverse economic, environmental, and social implications of potential future scenarios of the development on these soils, namely pursuing the current land use versus adopting peat-preserving land use. Based on a basic economic analysis, we find that considering the carbon benefits of preserving the soils, current offsetting-carbon policies cannot compensate the opportunity cost of switching land use on organic soils used for intensive vegetable farming. With the price of carbon offsetting options, only up to the half of the opportunity cost would be covered. We therefore stress the need for a long-term vision of the management decision on these soils and for eliciting society's willingness to invest in preserving organic soils.

AB We summed estimates of the carbon balance of forests, grasslands, arable lands and peatlands to obtain country-specific estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance during the 1990s. Forests and grasslands were a net sink for carbon, whereas croplands were carbon sources in all European countries. Hence, countries dominated by arable lands tended to be losing carbon from their terrestrial ecosystems, whereas forest-dominated countries tended to be sequestering carbon. In some countries, draining and extraction of peatlands caused substantial reductions in the net carbon balance.
   Net terrestrial carbon balances were typically an order of magnitude smaller than the fossil fuel-related carbon emissions. Exceptions to this overall picture were countries where population density and industrialization are small. It is, however, of utmost importance to acknowledge that the typically small net carbon balance represents the small difference between two large but opposing fluxes: uptake by forests and grasslands and losses from arable lands and peatlands. This suggests that relatively small changes in either or both of these large component fluxes could induce large effects on the net total, indicating that mitigation schemes should not be discarded a priori.
   In the absence of carbon-oriented land management, the current net carbon uptake is bound to decline soon. Protecting it will require actions at three levels; a) maintaining the current sink activity of forests, b) altered agricultural management practices to reduce the emissions from arable soils or turn into carbon sinks and c) protecting current large reservoirs (wetlands and old forests), since carbon is lost more rapidly than sequestered.

AB Vertical distribution of nematodes down to a depth of 50 cm nas studied in a peat meadow soil in north-eastern part of Poland. The abundance and generic composition of nematode fauna in five soil layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 end 40-50 cm) were analysed. It was found that total numbers of nematodes and their generic diversity decreased with increasing soil depth. Out of all nematodes, 65% (in May) and 72% (in September) were found down to a depth of 20 cm. The proportion of nematodes in the deepest studied soil layer (40-50 cm) was the lon;est, about 9% in spring samples and only 1.3% in autumn samples. Nematode fauna of the studied site was represented by 43 genera from 27 families. The most common genera in both sampling occasions were Acrobeloides, Aglenchus, Cephalobus, Filenchus, Helicotylenchus, Rotylenchus and Rhabdolaimus. Considerable differences in vertical distribution of some genera were also found. An attempt was made to use some soil characteristics of the studied site in interpretation of the results.

AB Traditional laboratory methods for acquiring soil information remain important for assessing key soil properties, soil functions and ecosystem services over space and time. Infrared spectroscopic modeling can link and massively scale up these methods for many soil characteristics in a cost-effective and timely manner. In Switzerland, only 10 % to 15 % of agricultural soils have been mapped sufficiently to serve spatial decision support systems, presenting an urgent need for rapid quantitative soil characterization. The current Swiss soil spectral library (SSL; n = 4374) in the mid-infrared range includes soil samples from the Biodiversity Monitoring Program (BDM), arranged in a regularly spaced grid across Switzerland, and temporally resolved data from the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network (NABO). Given that less than 2 % of the samples in the SSL originate from organic soils, we aimed to develop both an efficient calibration sampling scheme and accurate modeling strategy to estimate the soil carbon (SC) contents of heterogeneous samples between 0 and 2 m depth from 26 locations within two drained peatland regions (School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences (HAFL) data set; n = 116). The focus was on minimizing the need for new reference analyses by efficiently mining the spectral information of the SSL.
   We used partial least square regressions (PLSRs), together with five repetitions of a location-grouped, 10-fold cross-validation, to predict SC ranging from 1 % to 52 % in the local HAFL data set. We compared the validation performance of different calibration schemes involving local models (1), models using the entire SSL combined with local samples (2), commonly referred to as spiking, and subsets of local and SSL samples optimized for the peatland target sites using the resampling local (RS-LOCAL) algorithm (3). Using local and RS-LOCAL calibrations with at least five local samples, we achieved similar validation results for predictions of SC up to 52 % (R-2 = 0.93 to 0.97; bias = -0.07 to 1.65; root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.71 % to 3.89 % total carbon; ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 3.38 to 4.86; and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 4.93 to 7.09). However, calibrations using RS-LOCAL only required five or 10 local samples for very accurate models (RMSE = 3.16 % and 2.71 % total carbon, respectively), while purely local calibrations required 50 samples for similarly accurate results (RMSE < 3 % total carbon). Of the three approaches, the entire SSL spiked with local samples for model calibration led to validations with the lowest performance in terms of R-2, bias, RMSE, RPD and RPIQ. Hence, we show that a simple and comprehensible modeling approach, using RS-LOCAL together with a SSL, is an efficient and accurate strategy when using infrared spectroscopy. It decreases field and laboratory work, the bias of SSL spiking approaches and the uncertainty of local models. If adequately mined, the information in the SSL is sufficient to predict SC in new and independent study regions, even if the local soil characteristics are very different from the ones in the SSL. This will help to efficiently scale up the acquisition of quantitative soil information over space and time.

AB Human activities have enhanced the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from organic soils. Drained peat soils may turn into a source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission may generally decrease after drainage. Agricultural use, including ploughing, fertilization and irrigation, further enhances the decomposition of peat, and CO2 and N2O emissions. Cultivated organic soils are therefore significant sources of CO2 and N2O. In this paper we report greenhouse gas emissions from cultivated organic soils, and from abandoned organic agricultural soils, i.e. from organic soils where cultivation practices have ceased. We found that CO2 and N2O emissions from abandoned organic cropland soils do not generally decrease with time after agricultural practices have ceased, whereas CH4 fluxes from the atmosphere into the soil may gradually increase after leaving cultivation.

AB Significant quantities of paper waste (PW) have been accumulated in recent years and the reuse/recycling of PW is required due to environmental concerns. In the present study, printed PW was used as a peat (P) substitute in growing medium for theBrassicaseedlings production, considering recycling, sustainable agriculture, and partly peat replacement. Seeds of cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage were seeded in growing media made of 0-10-30-50% PW. The addition of PW improved the growing media pH and mineral content, reduced the media aeration, and affected seed emergence. The PW decreased plant growth and the effects were more pronounced at 50% PW. The PW >= 30% decreased stomatal conductance, while chlorophyll fluorescence and content of chlorophylls decreased with high PW ratio, negatively affecting the plant physiology. The PW decreased plant sodium and iron and increased potassium, calcium, magnesium, and copper content. The PW increased antioxidant activity to a certain degree for cauliflower and cabbage and resulted in no change for broccoli, while polyphenols increased in cabbage seedlings. The addition of PW did not cause cellular damage as both lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide production remained at low levels, maintaining low levels on the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase) metabolism. The present study shows that low PW content can partially replace peat forBrassicaseedling production under a sustainable agriculture and environmentally friendly scheme.

AB Wetland restoration has been conducted worldwide due to the important ecological functions provided by wetlands. However, the global patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) change following wetland restoration are not clear, which has limited the efficacy of the management of restored wetlands. In this study, we synthesized the results from 41 studies and carried out a meta-analysis to examine the SOC dynamics following wetland restoration and the underlying mechanisms. The SOC of restored wetlands was 13.8% (p = 0.017) higher than that of cultivated wetlands and 29.2% (p < 0.001) lower than that of natural wetlands. Wetland restoration facilitated SOC sequestration under certain conditions, including when the wetlands were restored via water supplementation, had seasonal hydrology in their natural status (before cultivation), were peatlands, occurred under a temperate climate, were restored for 6 to 10 years, or had been cultivated no longer than 15 years before restoration. Meanwhile, some conditions had negative effects on SOC sequestration, including wetlands under a tropical climate, those restored using a plantation approach, and those with a tidal hydrology after restoration. Model selection analysis suggested that the hydrological conditions of cultivated wetlands, soil depth, vegetation type, peat condition and restored age were important influential factors affecting SOC after wetland restoration, with the first 2 being the most important influential factors. Our results indicate that wetland restoration is inefficient in terms of SOC recovery and that wetland restoration to recover SOC is urgently needed and should be conducted more appropriately. The results of this study provide theoretical support for wetland management with the aim of SOC sequestration.

AB The impact of ancient fertilization practices on the biogeochemistry of arable soils on the remote Scottish island of Hirta, St Kilda was investigated. The island was relatively unusual in that the inhabitants exploited seabird colonies for food, enabling high population densities to be sustained on a limited, and naturally poor, soil resource. A few other Scottish islands, the Faeroes and some Icelandic Islands, had similar cultural dependence on seabirds. Fertilization with human and animal waste streams (mainly peat ash and bird carcases) on Hirta over millennia has led to over-deepened, nutrient-rich soils (plaggen). This project set out to examine if this high rate of fertilization had adversely impacted the soil, and if so, to determine which waste streams were responsible. Arable soils were considerably elevated in Pb and Zn compared to non-arable soils. Using Pb isotope signatures and analysis of the waste streams, it was determined that this pollution came from peat and turf ash (Pb and Zn) and from bird carcases (Zn). This was also confirmed by C-13 and N-15 analysis of the profiles which showed that soil organic matter was highly enriched in marine-derived C and N compared to non-arable soils. The pollution of such a remote island may be typical of other 'bird culture' islands, and peat ash contamination of marginal arable soils at high latitudes may be widespread in terms of geographical area, but less intense at specific locations due to lower population densities than on Hirta.

AB The stability of global soil carbon ( C) represents a major uncertainty in forecasting future climate change. In the UK, substantial soil C losses have been reported, while at the same time dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland waters have increased, suggesting that soil C stocks may be destabilising in response to climate change. To investigate the link between soil carbon and DOC at a range of sites, soil organic matter, soilwater and streamwater DOC were analysed for radiocarbon (C-14). DOC exported from C-rich landscapes appears younger than the soil C itself, much of it comprising C assimilated post-1950s. DOC from more intensively managed, C-poor soils is older, in some cases > 100 years. Results appear consistent with soil C destabilisation in farmed landscapes, but not in peatlands. Reported C losses may to a significant extent be explained by mechanisms other than climate change, e. g. recovery from acidification in peatlands, and agricultural intensification in managed systems.

AB Acid organic soils drained for agriculture are hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Previous studies have indicated that water table (WT) depth and nitrogen (N) availability are important environmental controls, however, little is known about pathways leading to N2O emission. We investigated a raised bog drained for agriculture (pH 4.6 to 5.5) with, respectively, rotational grass and a potato crop in the experimental year and subplots with and without N fertilisation. The emissions and isotopic composition of N2O were monitored during spring and autumn periods with significant changes in WT depth, and in the availability of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrous oxide emissions were determined at 6-h intervals using eight automated chambers interfaced with a laser instrument for N2O isotopomer analysis. A threshold of 600 ppb N2O (final concentration) was adopted to stabilise estimates of site preference (SP) and delta N-15(bulk) of emitted N2O against the background of N2O in ambient air. Nitrous oxide emissions varied consistently with land use, slope position and time of day and year, but with little effect of N fertilisation. Isotopic signatures of N2O from the grassland site could not be investigated due to generally low emissions. In the potato field, in total 255 and 266 flux measurements exceeded the 600 ppb threshold in unfertilised and fertilised subplots, respectively. Both N2O emissions and isotopic signatures responded to WT dynamics, individual rain events, and soil N availability. Across eight individual periods, the delta N-15(bulk) of N2O emitted from the soil varied between - 55 and + 18 parts per thousand, while site preference (SP) varied between - 4 and + 25 parts per thousand. The first and the last period (shoulder seasons) were both N limited, and here isotopic signatures of N2O were similar and distinctly different from signatures in mid-season periods with mineral N accumulation. Nitrifier denitrification and chemodenitrification were proposed as potential pathways to N2O production in shoulder seasons, whereas in mid-season periods the isotopic signatures could be associated with either ammonia oxidation or fungal denitrication (late spring), or with bacterial denitrification (early autumn). The interpretation of isotopic signatures of N2O was confounded by the possible effect of N2O reduction. The study provides evidence that both sources and pathways of N2O emissions from managed organic soil vary dynamically with WT changes and N availability.

AB Mid-late Holocene pollen evidence from the Ispani-II Sphagnum bog in lowland Western Georgia shows that 4500 years ago Castanea (chestnut)-dominated woods rapidly declined to be replaced by alder swamps and, later, during the first millennium be, by open, marshy landscapes in which fire played a prominent part. Around 1900 years ago, Sphagnum blanket bog encroached on the marshes and dense Fagus-Carpinus (beech-hornbeam) forest enveloped the surrounding land. This vegetation remained until the mid-twentieth century, when forests were clear-felled and marshes were drained for large-scale, mechanized agriculture. Previous studies have emphasized climate's governing role in setting the course of Holocene vegetation development in lowland Western Georgia, but our results provide little support for this hypothesis. To a much greater degree, episodes of coastal subsidence, sea-level rise and human impact have shaped the vegetation history of coastal Western Caucasus.

AB Biobeds have been used in northern Europe for minimizing point source contamination of water resources by pesticides. However, little is known regarding their use in southern Europe where edaphoclimatic conditions and agriculture practices significantly differ. A first step toward their adaptation in southern Europe is the use of low-cost and easily available substrates as biomixture components. This study investigated the possibility of replacing peat with agricultural composts in the biomixture. Five composts from local substrates including olive leaves, cotton crop residues, cotton seeds, spent mushroom substrate, and commercial sea wrack were mixed with topsoil and straw (1:1:2). Degradation of a mixture of pesticides (dimethoate, indoxacarb, buprofezin, terbuthylazine, metribuzin, metalaxyl-M, iprodione, azoxystrobin) at two dose rates was tested in the compost biomixtures (BX), in corresponding peat biomixtures (OBX), and in soil. Adsorption-desorption of selected pesticides were also studied. Pesticide residues were determined by gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detector, except indoxacarb, which was determined with a microelectron capture detector. Overall, BX degraded the studied pesticides at rates markedly higher than those observed in soil and OBX, in which the slowest degradation rates were evident. Overall, the olive leaf compost biomixture showed the highest degradation capacity. Adsorption studies showed that OBX and BX had higher adsorption affinity compared to soil. Desorption experiments revealed that pesticide adsorption in biomixtures was not entirely reversible. The results suggest that substitution of peat with local composts will lead to optimization of the biobed system for use in Mediterranean countries.

AB We present the generalised linear geostatistical model (GLGM) for soil type mapping and investigate if spatial prediction with this model results in a soil map of greater accuracy than a map obtained using a non-spatial model, i.e. a model that ignores spatial dependence in the soil type variable. The GLGM is central to the framework of model-based geostatistics. We adopted a pragmatic approach in which the five soil types in a cultivated peatland were separately modelled with a binomial logit-linear GLGM. Prediction with soil type-specific GLGMs resulted in five binomial probabilities at each prediction location, which were standardised to multinomial probabilities by selecting the soil type with maximal probability. A soil map was created from the predicted probabilities. In addition, two non-spatial models were used to map soil type. These were the multinomial logit model and the generalised linear model for Bernoulli-distributed data. Validation with independent probability sample data showed that use of a spatial model for digital soil type mapping did not result in more accurate predictions than those with the non-spatial models.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on soil moisture, N2O fluxes, and biomass production of Phleum pratense were studied in the laboratory. Farmed peat and sandy soil mesocosms sown with P. pratense were fertilized with a commercial fertilizer. In peat soil 10 g N m(-2) of commercial fertilizer were added and in sandy soil 15 g N m(-2). In both experiments, soil moisture was regulated with deionized water; 18 mesocosms were tended to keep equally moist, and the other 18 were watered with equal amounts of water. Nine mesocosms from both watering treatments were grown under ambient (360 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentration and the remaining nine under doubled (720 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2. N2O efflux was monitored using a closed chamber technique and a gas chromatograph. The elevated supply of CO2 increased production of above- and belowground biomass, soil moisture and N2O fluxes, but decreased the total N content in the aboveground biomass, especially for the sandy soil. In similar water levels, N2O efflux from the sandy soil was the same magnitude as that from the peat soil. In addition to moisture, N availability was the main limiting factor for N2O production, but C availability also seemed to regulate the denitrification activity. In addition to an increase in C availability the increase in the N2O efflux under the raised CO2 concentration also required a simultaneous increase in soil moisture.

AB The Hula Decision Support System (HDSS) is designed to aid Hula site operators in managing groundwater levels in the Hula Lake region of Israel. Groundwater levels are managed by controlling water levels by using adjustable dams in a grid of drainage canals and by the timing and intensity of irrigation. Water levels in the canals are controlled by a set of hydraulic structures. Groundwater levels are to be maintained within a specified range to minimize decomposition and subsidence of the peat soils, ensure year-round green cover of the area, and avoid saturation conditions in the crop root zone, thereby allowing farmers to continue cultivation of their fields. The management module for the HDSS performs optimization with the following two objectives: (1) minimize deviation from the specified groundwater target level, and (2) minimize supply of water from the Jordan River to the Hula drainage canals (water quantity is limited). The second objective is achieved indirectly in the HDSS by determining the dam settings and irrigation quantity and timing over a period of eight weeks and then solving again whenever conditions change. The results are checked by simulation using MODFLOW within the GMS modeling package. The procedure is demonstrated and analyzed.

DE socio-environmental coevolution; technology; unintended consequences;

AB This paper uses a case study on the evolution of the Rhine river delta to illustrate the coevolution of the environment, the technology used to exploit it, and the institutions governing it. Three strands are interwoven:
   (1) Achieving equilibrium between protecting and utilizing land is difficult. In this area, as a result of exploitation, agriculture on fertile peat is succeeded by stock raising on infertile peat, peat extraction, inundation, and drainage to regain fertile soil.
   (2) In the dynamic between collective and individual action that accompanies these changes, individuals beget institutions and institutions beget individuals.
   (3) New technologies are invented, helping overcome challenges posed by the natural environment. Their unexpected consequences undermine the solutions found, leading to new technologies, etc.
   The ultimate cause is the interaction between human cognition and action. Our cognition is limited in the number of dimensions it can simultaneously handle, and our action (directly or indirectly) affects all the dimensions of the complex adaptive system that is the environment, triggering unintended consequences, and new actions. This feedback takes the system from perceived challenges to solutions to new, unintended challenges, driving the region further and further from its point of departure, towards the bottom of the sea.

AB Sowing of seedlings is one of the most critical processes on the establishment of a crop, since the future development of the plant depends largely on its health when is planted on the field. Moreover, organic agriculture has to deal with the low application of fertilizers and pesticides, which hinder the growth of seedlings. In this work, we studied the big influence of different mixtures of substrates suitable for organic agriculture based on peat, coconut husk and vermicompost in traditional varieties of tomato, pepper and eggplant. Our results indicate that the use of coconut husk based substrates in organic agriculture can reduce the growth of seedlings between 20 and 30% compared with peat-based substrates. Moreover, the plants growth in this substrate showed lower levels of chlorophyll and lower weight, but the results are strongly dependent on the species tested. Comparison between traditional plants demonstrates that traditional varieties are strongly influenced by the substrate, whereas the growth of a commercial variety of tomato barely differs when different substrates are used. The election of the substrate in organic agriculture is critical to the correct development of the plant, especially when traditional plant varieties are used.

Identifying these areas forms the basis for predicting the risk of fires in addition to developing recommendations for the rational use and reduction of fire risks in the disturbed lands of the Jewish Autonomous Region.
   The aim of the research is the comprehensive assessment of the potentially natural fire hazards associated with drained marshes in the Jewish Autonomous Region.
   Methods. For a comprehensive assessment of the potentially natural fire hazards, the criteria were selected for medium shaped landscape with respect to occurrence of a fire: terrain (slope of the territory); climate (average annual rainfall and mean multiyear temperature in July); inland waters (density of the river network); soil (water permeability and soil moisture content); and vegetation (class of vegetation-associated fire dangers). Each indicator was evaluated on a uniform five-level scale. A comprehensive assessment was obtained by summing the scores, which were ranked according to the degree of fire hazard based on the developed scale.
   Results. The authors have carried out the assessment, taking into account a number of the main natural factors causing the occurrence of fires within the wetlands. Areas with varying degrees of natural predisposition to the occurrence and spread of fires were identified. It was established that drainage reclamation is one of the agricultural factors contributing to the occurrence of vegetation fires. A change in the moisture regime primarily generates a transformation of the vegetation cover, where one type of vegetation is changed by another, as well as a change in soil cover and a decrease in the level of bog waters. All this leads to the fact that the class of fire hazard of the territory in aggregate and componentwise shifts towards an increase in fire hazard.

AB Peat moss has been a standard carrier of inoculum for experimentation and in agriculture. Peat moss is, however, a non-renewable resource. Alternatively, biochar could serve as an inoculum carrier. Here, we tested the effect of biochar-based seed coatings as a carrier for the phosphorous-solubilizing Pseudomonas libanensis inoculum, on corn growth after soluble and insoluble P addition. The survival of P. libanensis was determined based on the measure of colony-forming units from samples of four inoculated guar gum-based biochar coatings and was compared to peat. Storage experiments were performed on inoculated biochars for 22 weeks at 25 degrees C and on coated corn seeds for 16 weeks at 4 degrees C. Seed coatings were prepared with inoculated and uninoculated biochars (100 seeds treatment(-1)), and effects of these treatments are reported on indices of seed germination after 7 days. A greenhouse experiment investigated the effects of the inoculated and uninoculated biochar seed coating on corn plants. The parameters measured from the greenhouse-grown corn plants were germination, fresh weight, dry weight, height, root length, basal stem diameter, leaf area, chlorophyll content, and tissue phosphorous. Our results show that corn plants grown from seeds coated with a biochar from hardwood feedstock are 2 to 10 g heavier than controls and that controls are 4 to 26 % shorter than the plants grown from biocharcoated seeds, where soluble phosphorous is applied. Moreover, corn seeds that were coated with a biochar produced from softwood feedstock germinated more quickly, based on the speed of germination index. Overall, we show that a biochar-based seed coating can benefit sustainable agriculture by carrying P. libanensis and enhancing the growth of corn, but according to parametric statistical tests, it does so without increasing the phosphorous content of the plants.

AB Long term research has been conducted into the hydrological effects of different land usage of a wetland mire in southern Germany. Drainage for agriculture lowered the water table and reduced evaporation from about 110% of open water losses to just under the Penman short grass potential rate. The runoff regime was altered and peak flows increased. Afforestation of agricultural land increased evaporation losses to much higher levels than open water evaporation, and annual runoff was nearly halved. Forest growth reduced soil water and baseflows. Peak flows became smaller; the rate of reduction was particularly rapid in the early years of tree growth.

AB Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of CO2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of CH4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials (GWP's).
   The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. GHG fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system (CO2) and flux chamber measurements (CH4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was -446+ +/- 83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, -311 +/- 58 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869 +/- 668 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, 866 +/- 666 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. CH4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted CH4 emissions were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and CH4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake, CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water. CO2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while CH4 fluxes have increased. In GWP's the area was a small net GHG sink given as CO2- equiv. of - 86 g m(-2) yr(-1) (over a 100-year period).

AB The area under the cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops on organic soils in the northern countries is fast increasing. To understand the impact of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinaceae L.) cultivation on the carbon dioxide (CO2) balance of an organic soil, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured for four years in a RCG cultivated cutover peatland in eastern Finland using the eddy covariance technique. There were striking differences among the years in the annual precipitation. The annual precipitation was higher during 2004 and 2007 and lower during 2005 and 2006 than the 1971-2000 regional mean. During wet growing seasons, moderate temperatures, high surface soil moisture and low evaporative demand favoured high CO2 uptake. During dry seasons, owing to soil moisture and atmospheric stress, photosynthetic activity was severely restricted. The CO2 uptake [gross primary productivity (GPP)] was positively correlated with soil moisture, air temperature and inversely with vapour pressure deficit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) increased with increasing soil temperature but decreased with increasing soil moisture. The relative responses of GPP and TER to moisture stress were different. While changes in TER for a given change in soil moisture were moderate, variations in GPP were drastic. Also, the seasonal variations in TER were not as conspicuous as those in GPP implying that GPP is the primary regulator of the interannual variability in NEE in this ecosystem. The ecosystem accumulated a total of 398 g Cm-2 from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2007. It retained some carbon during a wet year such as 2004 even after accounting for the loss of carbon in the form of harvested biomass. Based on this CO2 balance analysis, RCG cultivation is found to be a promising after-use option on an organic soil.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) has been shown to strongly influence both reactions occurring at the solid-liquid interface and particle aggregation. Ferrous iron bound to iron oxides, such as goethite, can serve as a reductant towards environmental contaminants. Little is known, however, about how NOM affects reactivity and aggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles in aqueous conditions. Here, the rate of 4-chloronitrobenzene (4-ClNB) reduction is used to assess the reactivity of Fe(II) on goethite, and this reactivity is tracked as a function of increasing NOM concentration, using either 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) or bicarbonate buffer at pH 7. Pahokee Peat humic acid (PPHA), extracted from an agricultural peat soil, was selected to simulate the NOM present in groundwater. Generally speaking, the 4-ClNB degradation rate decreases with increasing PPHA concentration. Characterization of the goethite nanoparticles after repeated cycles of 4-ClNB degradation demonstrated that oxidative crystal growth occurred mainly along the goethite c-axis, reaction rates progressively slowed with each cycle, and no new phases precipitated. Finally, bicarbonate buffer, a model for groundwater, dramatically affects both aggregation and reaction rates, with reaction rates an order of magnitude slower and aggregates substantially larger than observed in suspensions prepared using MOPS.

AB Agricultural peat soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California have been identified as an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane precursors in waters exported for drinking. The objectives of this study were to examine the primary sources of DOC from soil profiles (surface vs. subsurface), factors (temperature, soil water content and wet-dry cycles) controlling DOC production, and the relationship between C mineralization and DOC concentration in cultivated peat soils. Surface and subsurface peat soils were incubated for 60 d under a range of temperature (10, 20, and 30 degrees C) and soil water contents (0.3-10.0 g-water g-soil(-1)). Both CO2-C and DOC were monitored during the incubation period. Results showed that significant amount of DOC was produced only in the surface soil under constantly flooded conditions or flooding/non-flooding cycles. The DOC production was independent of temperature and soil water content under non-flooded condition, although CO2 evolution was highly correlated with these parameters. Aromatic carbon and hydrophobic acid contents in surface DOC were increased with wetter incubation treatments. In addition, positive linear correlations (r(2) = 0. 87) between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration were observed in the surface soil, but negative linear correlations (r(2) = 0.70) were observed in the subsurface soil. Results imply that mineralization of soil organic carbon by microbes prevailed in the subsurface soil. A conceptual model using a kinetic approach is proposed to describe the relationships between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration in these soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Catchment storage sustains ecologically important low flows in headwater systems. Understanding the factors controlling storage is essential in analysis of catchment vulnerability to global change. We calculated catchment storage and storage sensitivity of streamflow for 61 boreal headwater catchments in Finland. We also explored the connection between computed storage indices and low flow conditions. The relationships between selected climate, snow, and catchment characteristics and calculated storage properties and low flows were investigated, in order to assess the importance of different factors that render catchments vulnerable to climate and environmental change. We found that the most sensitive areas to climate change were located in the southern boreal coastal zone, with fine-grained soils and agricultural areas. In contrast, catchments in the middle and northern boreal zone, with till and peatland soils and higher snow water equivalent values, were less sensitive under current conditions. In addition, we found a threshold at a snow to precipitation ratio of 0.35. Above that threshold, summer low flows were generally sensitive to changes in snow conditions, whereas below that threshold catchment characteristics gained importance and the sensitivity was more directly related to changes in temperature and timing of rainfall. These findings suggest that a warming climate will have pronounced impacts on hydrology and catchment sensitivity related to snow quantity and snow cover duration in certain snow to precipitation ratio zones. Moreover, land use activities had an impact on storage properties in agricultural and drained peatland areas, resulting in a negative effect on low flows.

AB The aging of triazine amine in soil was studied during a time course of 119 d by measuring bioavailability in terms of mineralization after inoculation of the triazine amine-degrading bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis TA57. The bioavailability was measured in four soil samples: A-, B-, and C-horizons from an agricultural soil profile and in a peat soil. The sorption of triazine amine in the soil samples was quantified during the period of aging in terms of sorption distribution coefficients (K-d) and desorption distribution coefficients (K-d,K-des). Measures of bioavailability and triazine amine concentration in the nonavailable fraction showed effects of aging in the soils that were rich in organic matter. The triazine amine bioavailability declined significantly during the aging period in soils containing greater than 2% organic carbon, whereas the B- and C-horizons showed no signs of aging, in agreement with their low content of organic material. Corresponding to this, desorption decreased significantly in the A-horizon but, surprisingly, not in the peat soil. Analyses by thin-layer chromatography indicated an association of aqueous triazine amine and dissolved organic matter in the peat soil. This gives an explanation for both the significant decrease in bioavailability and the noncorresponding stability of the nonavailable (i.e., nondesorbed) fraction.

AB We conducted a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase labelling experiment in a drained boreal organic (peat) soil cultivated with perennial crop, reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) to study the flow of carbon from plants to soil microbes. Both limed and unlimed soils were studied, since liming is a common agricultural practice for acidic organic soils. Soil samples taken within three months after the labelling and three times in the following year were used for the delta C-13 analysis of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), root sugars and root lipids. We estimated the contribution of carbon from root exudates to microbial PLFA synthesis. The flow of carbon from plants to microbes was fast as the label allocation in PLFAs had a peak 1-3 days after labelling. The results showed that fungi were important in the incorporation of fresh, plant-derived carbon, including root sugars. None of the main microbial PLFA biomarker groups (fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) was completely lacking label over the measurement period. One year after the labelling, when the labelled carbon was widely distributed into plant biomass and soil, bacterial biomarkers increased their share of the label allocation. Liming had a minor effect on the label allocation rate into PLFAs. The mixing model approach used to calculate the root exudate contribution to microbial biomass resulted in a highly conservative estimate of utilization of this important C-source (0-6.5%, with highest incorporation into fungi). In summary, the results of this study provide new information about the role of various microbial groups in the turnover of plant-derived, fresh carbon in boreal organic soil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite the importance of organic soils, including peatlands, in the global carbon cycle, detailed information on regional and global emissions is scarce. This is due to the difficulty to map, measure, and assess the complex dynamics of land, soil, and water interactions needed to assess the human-driven degradation of organic soils. We produced a new methodology for the comprehensive assessment of drained organic soils in agriculture and the estimation of the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Results indicated that over 25 million hectares of organic soils were drained worldwide for agriculture use, of which about 60% were in boreal and temperate cool areas, 34% in tropical areas, and 5% in warm temperate areas. Total emissions from the drainage were globally significant, totaling nearly one billion tonnes CO(2)eq annually. Of this, the CO2 component, about 780 million tonnes, represented more than one-fourth of total net CO2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and land use. The bulk of these emissions came from a few tropical countries in Southeast Asia, and was linked to land clearing and drainage for crop cultivation. Geospatial data relative to this work were disseminated via the FAO geospatial server GeoNetwork, while the national aggregated statistics were disseminated via the FAOSTAT database.

AB Total Pb concentrations and isotopic composition were determined in stream-bed sediments and bedrock from 29 small agricultural or forested catchments in the Gascogne area (SW France). The contribution of Pb from various natural and anthropogenic sources was investigated in this rural area which is very weakly impacted by industrial or urban emissions. Environmental parameters in catchments (importance of forest cover, organic matter and oxide content in sediments) were considered. A combination of geochemical (enrichment calculation, sequential extraction) and isotopic investigations was performed to constrain the origin of Pb and the distribution of anthropogenic Pb in sediments. Most of the sediments have low total Pb content compared to other agricultural regions more impacted by industrial or urban emissions. The results indicated a moderate but significant Pb enrichment, particularly for catchments draining forested areas. This enrichment was positively related to organic C content in sediment and catchment forest cover, whereas in entirely cultivated catchments it was related to Fe-oxide content.
   An average anthropogenic end-member was determined using Pb isotopes, and was supposed to be representative of background atmospheric Pb pollution, with a weak influence of Pb from recent gasoline and local fertiliser spreading. The amount of anthropogenic Pb (Pb-anthr) in sediments estimated using a geochemical approach (mean 63.7 +/- 20.4%) was higher than that estimated using an isotopic approach (mean 36.6 +/- 17.8%), but the same trend was observed among the samples, except for low anthropogenic contributions. The distribution of Pb-anthr in sediments from weakly forested catchments indicated a strong affinity for carbonates and Fe-oxides. Amorphous Fe-oxides became preferential trapping compounds as soon as Pb enrichment increased and carbonate content decreased. Finally, in cultivated catchments, organic C was not a main trapping component for Pb-anthr in sediments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Around the world, peatland degradation and soil subsidence is occurring where these soils have been converted to agriculture. Since initial drainage in the mid-1800s, continuous farming of such soils in the California Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) has led to subsidence of up to 8 meters in places, primarily due to soil organic matter (SOM) oxidation and physical compaction. Rice (Oryza sativa) production has been proposed as an alternative cropping system to limit SOM oxidation. Preliminary research on these soils revealed high N uptake by rice in N fertilizer omission plots, which we hypothesized was the result of SOM oxidation releasing N. Testing this hypothesis, we developed a novel N budgeting approach to assess annual soil C and N loss based on plant N uptake and fallow season N mineralization. Through field experiments examining N dynamics during growing season and winter fallow periods, a complete annual N budget was developed. Soil C loss was calculated from SOM-N mineralization using the soil C:N ratio. Surface water and crop residue were negligible in the total N uptake budget (3-4 % combined). Shallow groundwater contributed 24-33 %, likely representing subsurface SOM-N mineralization. Assuming 6 and 25 kg N ha-1 from atmospheric deposition and biological N2 fixation, respectively, our results suggest 77-81% of plant N uptake (129-149 kg N ha(-1)) was supplied by SOM mineralization. Considering a range of N uptake efficiency from 50-70 %, estimated net C loss ranged from 1149-2473 kg C ha(-1). These findings suggest that rice systems, as currently managed, reduce the rate of C loss from organic delta soils relative to other agricultural practices.

AB Ireland provides a unique setting for the study of past climates, as its climate is dominated by westerly airflow from the North Atlantic and readily responsive to changes in North Atlantic circulation patterns. Although there has been substantial research on Ireland's past environments, quantitative palaeolimnological research, especially chironomid-based research, has been lacking. In order to further develop chironomid-based palaeolimnological investigations, a calibration set was constructed to determine the dominant environmental controls on modern chironomids in western Ireland. Chironomid subfossils were collected from surface sediments of 50 lakes. The lakes were characterised with 36 environmental variables, including physical attributes, lake water characteristics, lake sediment characteristics and land cover within each catchment. In this exploratory study, no specific environmental variable was targeted and lakes were chosen to span gradients of latitude, elevation, depth and trophic status. Redundancy analysis showed that six environmental variables-mean July air temperature, lake depth, dissolved organic carbon, and percentage catchment land cover of agriculture, peat bog and scrubland-captured a large and statistically significant portion of the variance in the chironomid data. July temperature and agricultural land cover were the most dominant environmental variables, with July temperature proving the most suitable for inference model development. A classical weighted-averaging model was developed to estimate July air temperature, with a coefficient of determination (r (jack) (2) ) of 0.60 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.57 A degrees C. Results suggest that summer temperature is the dominant influence on chironomid distribution across a wide variety of lake types, and the relatively small RMSEP should allow for more accurate reconstructions of Ireland's relatively subdued Holocene temperature fluctuations.

AB A sediment sequence from a small forest lake in southwestern Sweden was investigated to explore the effects of forestry and land-use on catchment erosion and delivery of organic and minerogenic matter to the lake. Catchment-scale vegetation changes during the last 1,100 years were reconstructed quantitatively at 50-year resolution using pollen analysis and the Landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA). Variations in terrestrial organic matter input to lake sediments were assessed by total organic carbon (TOC) content and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios. Changes in minerogenic matter were analysed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning. The results show that Skogaryd was not intensively used for agriculture throughout the past 1,100 years, but its land-use changes were very sensitive to societal changes. Between ca. ad 950 and 1350, local land-use was characterized by small-scale agricultural activities associated with the Medieval expansion, and enhanced soil erosion was recorded by increased K, Ti and Rb deposition. Around ad 1350 much of the farmland was abandoned, most likely in response to outbreaks of plague. The abandonment of farmland caused increased coniferous woodland cover and lower soil erosion. From the 16th century land-use expanded and gradually intensified, concurrent with a population increase documented in the study area between ca. ad 1600 and 1850. Intensive exploitation of the forest led to soil erosion and increased terrestrial organic and minerogenic matter export to the lake. These processes peaked with the artificial drainage of a nearby wetland for agricultural purposes. During the 20th century, modern forestry management started with the plantation of conifers, and soil erosion declined.

AB Organic and inorganic carbon concentrations in lakes and the links to catchment and water quality were studied in variable landscapes using the Finnish Lake Survey data base including 874 randomly selected lakes sampled during autumn overturn. The median total organic carbon (TOC) in these boreal lakes was 7.8 mg l(-1), the median total inorganic carbon (TIC) 1.6 mg l(-1) and the median partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) 900 mu atm. When the data was divided into subgroups according to land use in the catchment, the proportion of TIC of the total carbon (TC) in lakes was highest (31%) in agricultural areas and lowest (10%) in peatland areas. Elevated TIC concentrations were associated with agricultural land in the catchment, whereas elevated TOC concentrations were observed in lakes with high peatland proportion in the catchment. Two contrasting important sources of CO2 in lakes were identified on the basis of statistical analysis of the data; weathering processes in the catchments and decomposition of organic matter. CO2 was also strongly associated with total nutrients TN and TP, implying the importance of quality of organic matter and availability of nutrients for the decomposition processes.

AB This study uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dominant agricultural land uses, and peat and coal electricity generation, with fuel-chains for Miscanthus and short-rotation-coppice willow (SRCW) electricity. A simple scenario was used as an example, where 30% of peat and 10% of coal electricity generation was substituted with co-fired Miscanthus and SRCW, respectively. Miscanthus and SRCW cultivation were assumed to replace sugar-beet, dairy, beef-cattle and sheep systems. GHG emissions of 1938 and 1346 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for Miscanthus and SRCW cultivation compared with between 3494 CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for sugar-beet cultivation and 12,068CO(2)eq.ha(-1)a(-1) for dairy systems. Miscanthus and SRCW fuel chains emitted 0.131 and 0.132 kg CO2 eq. kWh(-1) electricity exported, respectively, compared with 1.150 and 0.990 kg CO2 eq. kWh(-1) electricity exported for peat and coal fuel chains. 1.48 Mt CO2 eq. a(-1) was saved from electricity production, and 0.42 Mt CO2 eq.a(-1) was saved from displaced agriculture and soil C-sequestration. The total reduction of 1-9 Mt CO2 eq.a(-1) represents 2.8% of Ireland's 2004 GHG emissions, but was calculated to require just 1.7% of agricultural land area and displace just 1.2% of the dairy herd (based on conservative Miscanthus and SRCW combustible-yield estimates of 11.7 and 8.81 tha(-1) a(-1) dry matter, respectively). A 50% increase in cultivation emissions would still result in electricity being produced with an emission burden over 80% lower than peat and coal electricity. Lower yield assumptions had little impact on total GHG reductions for the scenario, but required substantially greater areas of land. It was concluded that energy-crop utilisation would be an efficient GHG reduction strategy for Ireland. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two Finnish agricultural soils (peat soil and loamy sand) were exposed to four freeze-thaw cycles (FTC), with a temperature change from -17.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C to +4.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C. Control cores from both soils were kept at constant temperature (+6.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) without FTCs. Soil N2O and CO2 emissions were monitored during soil thawing, and the effects of FTCs on soil microbes were studied. N2O emissions were extremely low in peat soil, possibly due to low soil water content. Loamy sand had high N2O emission, with the highest emission after the second FTC. Soil freeze-thaw increased anaerobic respiration in both soil types during the first 3-4 FTCs, and this increase was higher in the peat soil. The microbial community structure and biomass analysed with lipid biomarkers (phospholipid fatty acids, 3- and 2- hydroxy fatty acids) were not affected by freezing-thawing cycles, nor was soil microbial biomass carbon (MIB-C). Molecular analysis of the microbial community structure with temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) also showed no changes due the FTCs. These results show that freezing and thawing of boreal soils does not have a strong effect on microbial biomass or community structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change scenarios for northern boreal regions indicate that there will be increasing temperature and precipitation, and the changes are expected to be larger in winter than in summer. These precipitation and discharge patterns, coupled with shorter ice cover/soil frost periods in the future would be expected to contribute significantly to changing flow paths of organic matter over a range of land use patterns. In order to study the impact of climate change on the seasonality of organic matter export we compared total organic carbon (TOC) and total organic nitrogen (TON) concentrations and export, during different seasons and climatically different years, over 12 years for 30 Finnish rivers separated into forest, agriculture and peat dominated catchments. The mean monthly TOC concentrations were highest during autumn and there was also a peak in May during the highest flow period. The mean monthly concentrations of TON were lowest during winter, increased in spring and remaining high throughout summer and autumn. The TOC/TON ratios were lowest during summer and highest during winter, and in all seasons the ratios were lowest in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land and highest in peat-dominated catchments. The seasonality of TOC and TON exports reflected geographical location, hydrology and land use patterns. Most of the TOC and TON were transported during the high flow following the spring snowmelt and during rainfall in autumn. In all catchments the relative importance of the spring snowmelt decreased in wet and warm years. However, in peat-dominated catchments the proportion of spring period was over 30% of the annual export even in these wet and warm years, while in other catchments the proportion was about 20%. This might be linked to the northern location of the peat-dominated catchments and the permanent snow cover and spring snowmelt, even in warm years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic soils drained for crop production or grazing land are agroecosystems with potentially high but variable emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). The present study investigated the regulation of N2O emissions in a raised bog area drained for agriculture, which is classified as potentially acid sulfate soil. We hypothesised that pyrite (FeS2) oxidation was a potential driver of N2O emissions through microbially mediated reduction of nitrate (NO3-). Two sites with rotational grass, and two sites with a potato crop, were equipped for monitoring of N2O emissions and soil N2O concentrations at the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm depth during weekly field campaigns in spring and autumn 2015. Further data acquisition included temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, water table (WT) depth, and soil NO3- and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations. At all sites, the soil was acidic, with pH ranging from 4.7 to 5.4. Spring and autumn monitoring periods together represented between 152 and 174 d, with cumulative emissions of 4-5 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with rotational grass and 20-50 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with a potato crop. Equivalent soil gas-phase concentrations of N2O at grassland sites varied between 0 and 25 mu L L-1 except for a sampling after slurry application at one of the sites in spring, with a maximum of 560 mu L L-1 at the 1 m depth. At the two potato sites the levels of below-ground N2O concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 2270 mu L L-1 and from 0.1 to 470 mu L L-1, in accordance with the higher soil mineral N availability at arable sites. Statistical analyses using graphical models showed that soil N2O concentration in the capillary fringe (i.e. the soil volume above the water table influenced by tension saturation) was the strongest predictor of N2O emissions in spring and, for grassland sites, also in the autumn. For potato sites in autumn, there was evidence that NO3- availability in the topsoil and temperature were the main controls on N2O emissions. Chemical analyses of intact soil cores from the 0 to 1m depth, collected at adjacent grassland and potato sites, showed that the total reduction capacity of the peat soil (assessed by cerium(IV) reduction) was much higher than that represented by FeS2, and the concentrations of total reactive iron (TRFe) were higher than those of FeS2. Based on the statistical graphical models and the tentative estimates of reduction capacities, FeS2 oxidation was unlikely to be important for N2O emissions. Instead, archaeal ammonia oxidation and either chemodenitrification or nitrifier denitrification were considered to be plausible pathways of N2O production in spring, whereas in the autumn heterotrophic denitrification may have been more important at arable sites.

AB In this study, we report efficiencies of light capture and biomass yield of festulolium and tall fescue cultivated on a riparian fen in Denmark under different harvesting managements. Green biomass targeted for biogas production was harvested either as two cuts (2C) or three cuts (3C) in a year. Three different timings of the first cut in the 2C systems were included as early (2C-early), middle (2C-mid) and late (2C late) cuts corresponding to pre-heading, inflorescence emergence and flowering stages, respectively. The fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (f(PAR)) was derived from the canopy reflectance measured on 61 dates throughout a year, and cumulative interception of PAR (IPAR) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) was calculated. The dynamics of f(PAR) and biomass accumulations was similar for both crops before the first cuts in all managements. Festulolium f(PAR) in 2C-early and 2C-mid managements declined faster than in 2C-late and 3C managements in the second growth period and thus growing period IPAR of 2C-early and 2C-mid declined by 8% as compared to 3C management where IPAR was 925 MJ m(-2). Annual festulolium dry matter (DM) yield in 2C-early and 2C-mid managements (average 14.1 Mg DM ha(-1)) decreased by 22% compared to 3C management (18.2 Mg DM ha(-1)). The highest and the lowest RUE of festulolium were observed in 3C and 2C-mid managements as 1.97 and 1.59 g MJ(-1), respectively. For tall fescue f(PAR) declined rather slowly in the second growing period in all 2C managements, which contributed to similar IPAR (908-919 MJ m(-2)), total biomass yield (16.4-18.8 Mg DM ha(-1) yr(-1)) and RUE (1.80-2.07 g MJ(-1)) for all managements. Whereas both crops were highly productive under both 3C management and 2C management with first harvest after flowering (i.e., 2C-late), the 2C-late strategy is recommended as the least intensive of the two management systems.

AB Fifty years have passed since the first commercial inoculants were manufactured in Australia. Before 1953, various Government Agencies supplied mostly agar cultures with New South Wales Department of Agriculture issuing the first peat-based inoculants. There are no data to indicate the quality of these inoculants, but in the early commercial cultures rhizobia were often outnumbered by contaminants and field failures were widespread. A comprehensive system of quality control was developed from discussions between CSIRO and the University of Sydney. Succeeding quality control bodies have continued on the basis of the original scheme. It set inoculant standards, approved and supplied mother cultures to manufacturers annually, tested all batches of peat inoculants before sale and sampled inoculants at the point of sale. In this paper we describe the history of Australian legume inoculants, list the commercial firms and key people involved and the period during which they were active. We tabulate the strains involved, indicate the period of their use and highlight some of the problems encountered with them and with inoculant production. We indicate the personnel who have been particularly active in the quality control of inoculants, the funding bodies who have supported the work and stress the reliance of the control laboratories on the help of many agricultural scientists in Australia. An important part of the control scheme has been the implementing of standards without resort to legislation. This has depended on the cooperation of the manufacturers involved and has allowed flexibility in applying the standards.

AB The use of constructed wetlands (CWs) for the treatment of the runoff waters from field cultivation and peat production in boreal climate is reviewed on the base of the authors' own research experiences and a literature study The main water purifying mechanisms are presented, and the effectiveness of different types of CWs as well as the design and dimensioning parameters at the bottom of the effectiveness are discussed. In our view, CW area in relation to its catchment and hydraulically efficient CW shape are the main issues that a CW designer should focus on. This is because water purifying processes need time for efficient functioning, and both of these factors increase the actual residence time of water in a CW Although both these factors stand up to as general guidelines, drawing conclusions from direct comparison of CWs in different locations is often misleading because of the differences in climate, catchment properties etc that highly effect the retention performance. Landscape improvement and increased birdlife are raised as examples of the ancillary benefits of CWs. The potential significance of CWs in water protection is dealt with at catchment scale. Comprehensive catchment management with variety of pollution control measures is needed if sustainable water quality improvement is aspired. When designed and located appropriately, CWs can make a useful contribution to this.

AB The production of hydroponic leafy vegetable plug-seedlings uses coco-peat as culture substrate in South China. Coco-peat has lowered density than peat-moss, and the friction between substrate block and pickup tool is small. So, it is hard to pick up in mechanism transplantation. In order to increase the friction, the existing transplanting manipulator had relatively complex structures. To simplify the structure of transplanting manipulator and improve the stability of picking up substrate block, four stainless steel fingers with rectangular cross-section were used in this research. A vertical driving was used to realize the coupling effect that could insert and shrink at the same time, by applying different combination of constraints to the steel fingers. This could increase friction between the steel fingers and the substrate block, and then enhance the stability of the substrate block. Different combinations of constraints were applied to the rectangular stainless steel fingers (3 mmx0.8 mm). The working videos of steel fingers were taken by high-speed photography. High-speed motioned analysis software was used to acquire and analyze traces of steel fingers movements. When the length which top end of the steel fingers moved outward (M) is equal to 1.5 mm, the length which guiding part widened (N) is equal to 1 mm, the shrinking distance of steel fingers is 4.2 mm. In this research, 16-day hydroponic leafy vegetable plug-seedlings were used for performance, which cultivated with coco-peat substrate with the moisture in the substrate at 81%. The transplanting manipulator was attached to a Denso robotic arm to conduct transplanting performance test. When the shrinking distance of steel fingers increased from 0 mm to 3.2 mm and the inserting angle decreased from 80 degrees to 77 degrees, the lifting force of substrate block increased by 118% from 1.45 N to 3.16 N. However, excessive shrinkage stirred the substrate block, which would reduce the friction between the substrate block and pickup parts and lowered the lifting force of pickup part in the substrate block. The experimental results also demonstrated that when the shrinking distance of the steel fingers reached 3.2 mm and the root distribution rate reached 46%, the success rate of transplantation was 80%. When the leafy vegetable plug-seedlings root distribution rate reached 92%, the success rate of transplantation was 96.67%. The degree of root distribution rate was positively correlated with the transplantation success rate. Therefore, in order to ensure an acceptable success rate of transplantation, the root distribution rate of leafy vegetable plug-seedlings should be at least 90%. This study provides a technical reference for developing simplified transplanting manipulator that can be used to transplant the hydroponic leafy vegetable plug-seedlings with coco-peat as the culture substrate.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the water response of Talipariti elatum cultivated in different substrates. Sugarcane straw, peat, biochar and mixtures of sugarcane straw and biochar, and peat and biochar were used. The physical properties of each substrate and the water parameters of the species were determined based on the pressure-volume curve. The osmotic potential at maximum saturation and the turgor loss point presented a similar behaviour with a decreasing tendency. We found significant differences between the beginning and end of the period. The values ranged from -1.17MPa to -1.36MPa and -1.49MPa to -1.74MPa, which indicated the development of osmotic adjustment mechanisms. The modulus of elasticity values ranged between 8.10MPa and 11.20MPa at the start and between 6.65MPa and 9.39MPa at the end, indicating elastic adjustment. The plants in the substrates with lower moisture retention showed lower values of solute potentials and cell wall elasticity modulus.

AB Organic-rich, eutrophic peat soils (Histosols) represent a major store of carbon (C) within the terrestrial biosphere. However, these soils are also highly susceptible to damage, particularly when used for intensive agricultural production. Sustainable management of such soils is contingent upon improved understanding of the impact of their management on the environment. In this context, we report the first annual budget of greenhouse gas emissions from temperate peat soils under intensive horticultural production. Fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured using static chambers on three farms along an organic matter loss gradient (similar to 20%, similar to 35%, and similar to 70% soil organic matter (SOM) content respectively), under a number of commercially important crops in similar rotations. Cumulative annual fluxes of CO2 in fallow and cropped soils were large and ranged from 13.0 +/- 2.4 to 30.9 +/- 2.5 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1), showing a general increase with SOM, and on cropped compared to bare soils. Annual emissions of N2O varied from 5.0 +/- 0.7 to 13.9 +/- 1.9 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1), and CH4 from 0.02 +/- 0.08 to 0.04 +/- 0.02 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1); neither showed a significant relationship with either SOM content or cropping. Distinct seasonal patterns of CO2 and N2O fluxes were observed, corresponding to significant correlations between emissions and soil and air temperature, soil moisture content, water table depth, and soil nitrate on some soil types. No discernible seasonal pattern in CH4 fluxes was observed, and very few significant correlations with soil environmental variables were found. Compared to emissions estimates suggested in IPCC inventory guidelines for cultivated peat soils, the observed emissions in this study were relatively high, and net annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are equivalent to a loss of soil depth of 0.33-0.75 cm y(-1). We conclude that arable farming is promoting extreme mineralization of the soil's organic carbon reserves and that a change in land use or management regime is needed to protect and preserve this natural capital.

AB It was found that the actinomycetal complex of a cultivated low-moor peat soil is characterized by a high population density and diversity of actinomycetes; representatives of eleven genera were isolated from this soil: Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Actinomadura, Saccharopolyspora, Microbispora, Microtetraspora, Streptosporangium, Nocardioides, Saccharomonospora, Kibdelosporangium, and Thermomonospora. Some genera were isolated from the soil under all the studied levels of soil moisture. The so-called rare (rarely occurring) genera (Saccharomonospora, Kibdelosporangium, and Thermomonospora) were isolated upon the low level of soil moisture, which ensured an absence of competition from the more abundant actinomycetes. Spores of all the studied actinomycetes could germinate under the low moisture level (a(w) = 0.67). The level of moisture a(w) = 0.98 was found to be optimal for the development of the actinomycetes. The complete cycle of the development of all the actinomycetes up to spore formation occurring was only observed under the high moisture level (a(w) = 0.98).

AB Conservation and restoration are crucial to maintaining a wide range of functions and services in wetlands, but it is difficult to find a reasonable and resource-efficient management option without sacrificing ecological values. In the present paper, we analyse the variability and dynamics of the chemical composition and energy potential of biomass from reedbeds, floodplain meadows, coastal meadows and reed canary grass cultivation in extracted peatlands. We observed that the chemical characteristics that are crucial for bioenergy production vary by biomass origin and over time. The bioenergy potential depends on biomass production and on the conversion method. The results indicate that the energy potential ranges from 122 to 190 GJ/ha per year in semi-natural floodplain meadows in the boreal zone. About 160 GJ/ha per year can be obtained from natural reedbeds but only about 120 GJ/ha per year from cultivated extracted peatlands. Using methane conversion, we can obtain only about 50%, and using ethanol conversion we can obtain less than 20% of the total energy potential of the herbaceous biomass of floodplain meadows. Although long-term studies on homo- and heterogeneous biomass production are required, we conclude that the local biomass of natural, semi-natural and artificial wetlands could contribute significantly to sustainable development.

AB Compost of separately collected green yard and organic household wastes may contain high amounts of Zn. Hence, substrates basing on compost can result in Zn phytotoxicity. The aim of the investigations was to identify a suitable reagent to characterize phytoavailable Zn in compost-peat substrates. Petunia hybrids were cultivated in compost-peat substrates with increasing Zn amounts (basic load, 400, 800, 1600 mg kg(-1) d.m. aqua regia soluble). Extractable Zn was determined by extraction of fresh and dried substrates with H2O, 1 M NH4NO3, 0.1 M CaCl2, 1 M NH4OAc, and CaCl2-DTPA (0.01 M + 0.002 M). The Zn content of plants increased significantly with increasing Zn application and decreasing pH. The result of CaCl2 and NH4OAc extraction reflected the influence of pH on Zn phytoavailability quite well and the correlation with the plant Zn content was very good. Extraction with H2O and NH4NO3 did not give acceptable results. Extraction with CaCl2-DTPA was inconsistent for all trials and thus not suitable. The percentage of CaCl2-extractable Zn in relation to the aqua regia soluble content at the same pH varied over the trials. Thus, the phytoavailable content of the substrates is influenced by additional factors, besides Zn supply and pH. The result of CaCl2 extraction of dried substrates resulted in the best reflection of Zn phytoavailability and was used for all Further investigations, including determination of critical values of phytotoxic Zn. Plant yield was not influenced by the Zn treatments. However, Zn induced chlorosis of petunias occurred at a plant zn content > 160 mg kg(-1) d.m. and a phytoavailable Zn content in the substrate > 6 mg l(-1) in CaCl2 extract and > 2.6 mg l(-1) in NH4OAc extract, respectively.

AB Two lowland lowland catchments in the U.K. were sampled throughout 2010-11 to investigate the dominant controls on dissolved organic matter quantity and composition. The catchments had marked differences in terms of nutrient status, land cover and contrasting lithologies resulting in differences in the dominant flow pathways (groundwater vs. surface water dominated). The Upper Wylye is a chalk stream with a baseflow index of 0.98, draining a catchment dominated by intensive agricultural production. Millersford Brook is a lowland peat catchment with a baseflow index of 0.43, chaining a semi-natural catchment. with heather moorland and coniferous forest Samples were collected weekly between October 2010 and September 2011 from eleven sampling locations. Samples were analysed to determine dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fractions with DOM composition evaluated via the DOC:DON ratio, DOC:DOP ratio, specific UV absorption a1254 nm, absorbance ratio (a(250):a(365)) and the spectral slope parameter between 350 and 400 nm (S350-400). Significant differences were observed in all determinands between the catchments, over time, and spatially along nutrient enrichment and geoclimaLic gradients. Seasonal variation in preferential flow pathways mobil ising groundwater-derived DOM were identified as likely controls on the delivery of DOM in the permeable chalk dominated catchment. Steeper S350-400 values and elevated 0250:03 5 ratios in this catchment suggest material of a lower bulk aromatic C content and molecular weight delivered during the winter months when compared to the summer. DOC:DON ratios were markedly lower in the chalk catchment than the peatland catchment, reflecting the paucity of organic matter within the mineral soils of the chalk landscape, and higher fertiliser application rates. This manuscript highlights that DOM composition varies according to catchment landscape character and hydrological function. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB An assay system was evaluated for denitrification measurement with potted ornamental plants cultivated in peat substrate (Pelargonium zonale, Euphorbia pulcherrima). Flow-through chambers only enclosing the pot of the plants were considered best for denitrification measurement. Loss of N2O from the chambers by transport through the plant shoot was negligible with both species. To determine (N2O + N-2)-N loss, C2H2 was applied to inhibit reduction of N2O. Experiments were conducted with unplanted substrate in closed incubation systems to determine optimum C2H2 concentration and pre-treatment duration. Complete inhibition of N2O reduction in peat substrate was achieved using 1 vol% C2H2. However, a concentration of 5 vol% C2H2 was chosen for further experiments because C2H2 concentrations in flow-through chambers varied. The duration of C2H2 pre-treatment (0, 2, 12, 24 h) showed no clear effect on (N2O + N-2)-N accumulation. However, a pre-treatment duration of 2 h was chosen to guarantee immediate inhibition of N2O reductase at the start of experiments. Exposure to C2H2 gas proved to affect plants of both species. During C2H2 exposition in flow-through chambers, the leaves of P. zonale became chlorotic (48 h) and necrotic (72 h). E. pulcherrima showed no chlorosis but did exhibit leaf epinasty (24 h) and wilting (96 h). Transpiration of P. zonale and C availability in the growing medium of both species were not affected by 52 h and 24 h treatments with C2H2, respectively. As N emissions usually ended within 38 h of C2H2 treatment, it was concluded that side effects of C2H2 did not affect denitrification measurements.

ID EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA
AB Peat soils in the Everglades Agricultural area of south Florida are subsiding and releasing nutrients in waterways due to decomposition by aerobic microorganisms. Restoring peat soil in the Everglades involves adding organic matter back to the soil as did the native sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) in predrainage time and removing nutrients from soil water. It is not certain if sawgrass is more efficient at accumulating dry matter (DM) than agricultural crops. This experiment was conducted to compare DM yield distributions and root morphology of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), sawgrass, and St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] growing under different water-table depths. Plants were grown outside in 38-L pots containing a Pahokee muck soil (Euic, hyperthermic Lithic Haplosaprist) under 15- and 30-cm water tables. All plants were harvested after 11 mo. Across water-table treatments, sugarcane produced 55 kg m(-2) total DM (above plus below ground), while sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass had similar total DM yields averaging 5 kg m(-1). Sawgrass allocated 34% of its DM below ground averaged across water-table depths compared with 14 and 8% for sugarcane and St. Augustinegrass, respectively. However, sugarcane had 4 and 20 times more below ground DM than sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass, respectively. Sugarcane had 308 km m(-3) of total root length averaged across water-table treatments compared with an average of 24 km m(-1) for sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass, indicating that sugarcane had a much greater potential for absorbing nutrients. Sugarcane appears to have potential for building peat soil in the Everglades while reducing nutrient loading in ground water and allowing for coexistence of agriculture in soil restoration efforts.

AB Agricultural soils are the most important sources for the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), which is produced and emitted from soils also at low temperatures. The processes behind emissions at low temperatures are still poorly known. Snow is a good insulator and it keeps soil temperature rather constant. To simulate the effects of a reduction in snow depth on N2O emission in warming climate, snow pack was removed from experimental plots on three different agricultural soils (sand, mull, peat). Removal of snow lowered soil temperature and increased the extent and duration of soil frost in sand and mull soils. This led to enhanced N2O emissions during freezing and thawing events. The cumulative emissions during the first year when snow was removed over the whole winter were 0.25, 0.66 and 3.0 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) in control plots of sand, mull and peat soils, respectively. In the treatment plots, without snow cover, the respective cumulative emissions were 0.37, 1.3 and 3.3 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). Shorter snow manipulation during the second year did not increase the annual emissions. Only 20% of the N2O emission occurred during the growing season. Thus, these results highlight the importance of the winter season for this exchange and that the year-round measurements of annual N2O emissions from boreal soils are integral for estimating their N2O source strength. N2O accumulated in the frozen soil during winter and the soil N2O concentration correlated with the depth of frost but not with the winter N2O emission rates per se. Also laboratory incubations of soil samples showed high production rates of N2O at temperatures below 0 degrees C, especially in the sand and peat soils.

AB Wetland restoration on peat islands previously drained for agriculture has potential to reverse land subsidence and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as peat accretes. However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest.
   IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

AB A pot experiment was conducted to investigate factors contributing to phosphorous (P) efficiency of ornamental plants. Marigold (Tagetes patula) and poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherima) were cultivated in a peat substrate (black peat 80% + mineral component 20% on a volume basis), treated with P rates of 0, 10, 35, 100, and 170 mg (L substrate)(-1). During the cultivation period, plants were fertigated with a complete nutrient solution (including 18 mg P L-1) every 2 d. Both poinsettia and marigold attained their optimum yield at the rate of 35 mg P (L substrate)(-1) and the critical level of P in shoot dry matter of both crops was 5-6 mg g(-1). After planting, plant-available P increased at lower P rates to a higher level for poinsettia than for marigold, but no significant change was observed at higher P rates. Balance sheet calculations indicated that at lower P rates more P was fertigated than was taken up by the plants. Root-length density, root-to-shoot ratio, and root-hair length of marigold were doubled compared to that of poinsettia. Root-length density increased with crop growth, and 10 d after planting the mean half distance between roots exceeded the P-depletion zone around roots by a factor of 3 and 1.5 for poinsettia and marigold, respectively. Thus, at this early stage poinsettia exploited only 10% of the substrate volume whereas marigold utilized 43%. Later in the cultivation period, the depletion zones around roots overlapped for both crops. Taking into account P uptake via root hairs, the simulation revealed that this was more important for marigold compared to poinsettia especially at low P-supply levels. However, increase of P uptake due to root hairs was only 10%-20% at optimum P supply. For the two lower P levels, the P-depletion profile around roots calculated for 10 d after planting showed that after 2 d of depletion the concentration at the root surface was below the assumed K-m value (5 mu W) and the concentration gradient was insufficient to fit the demand. A higher content of plant-available P in the substrate was observed for poinsettia compared to marigold in the treatment with P application adequate for optimum growth, because more fertigated P was accumulated during early stages of cultivation due to lower root-length density of poinsettia. The observed difference of root morphological parameters did not contribute significantly to P-uptake efficiency, since P mobility in the peat substrate was high.

AB This study has presented a performance investigation of an advanced tracked prime mover for the operation of agricultural goods and other operations on peat terrain. The maximum and continuous traction torque of the prime mover has been developed by designing an advanced controller for controlling the intelligent system. The prime mover's mobility is studied with ultrasonic displacement sensor, torque transducer, National Instrument cRIO-9004 Compact-RIO Real-time Controller Unit (RCU), a National Instrument TPC 2106T Touch Panel Control (TPC), a Trimble AG132 GPS antenna and receiver unit, and a Dlink DIR-655 router. The fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been equipped with the prime mover hydraulic system to increase the traction torque of the hydraulic motor when the prime mover's sinkage is more than or equal to 70 mm. The prime mover's design demonstrates good potential in traversing peat terrain as the measured tractive effort was found to be 48% of the vehicle's gross weight while the recommended tractive effort is in the range of 30-36% of the vehicle's gross weight.

AB According to the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), emissions must be cut by 41-72% below 2010 levels by 2050 for a likely chance of containing the global mean temperature increase to 2 degrees C. The AFOLU sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) contributes roughly a quarter (similar to 10-12 Pg CO2 e yr(-1)) of the net anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation, fire, wood harvesting, and agricultural emissions including croplands, paddy rice, and livestock. In spite of the importance of this sector, it is unclear where the regions with hotspots of AFOLU emissions are and how uncertain these emissions are. Here we present a novel, spatially comparable dataset containing annual mean estimates of gross AFOLU emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O), associated uncertainties, and leading emission sources, in a spatially disaggregated manner (0.5 degrees) for the tropics for the period 2000-2005. Our data highlight the following: (i) the existence of AFOLU emissions hotspots on all continents, with particular importance of evergreen rainforest deforestation in Central and South America, fire in dry forests in Africa, and both peatland emissions and agriculture in Asia; (ii) a predominant contribution of forests and CO2 to the total AFOLU emissions (69 %) and to their uncertainties (98 %); (iii) higher gross fluxes from forests, which coincide with higher uncertainties, making agricultural hotspots appealing for effective mitigation action; and (iv) a lower contribution of non-CO2 agricultural emissions to the total gross emissions (ca. 25 %), with livestock (15.5 %) and rice (7 %) leading the emissions. Gross AFOLU tropical emissions of 8.0 (5.5-12.2) were in the range of other databases (8.4 and 8.0 Pg CO2 e yr(-1) in FAOSTAT and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) respectively), but we offer a spatially detailed benchmark for monitoring progress in reducing emissions from the land sector in the tropics. The location of the AFOLU hotspots of emissions and data on their associated uncertainties will assist national policy makers, investors, and other decision-makers who seek to understand the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector.

AB Wetlands, lakes and agricultural soils are important sources and sinks of the greenhouse gas methane. The only known methane sink of biological nature is the oxidation by methanotrophic microorganisms, these organisms therefore provide an important ecosystem service. To protect this ecosystem service, it is important to maintain methanotrophic microorganism diversity, especially under increased anthropogenically-induced environmental pressures, such as imbalanced input of nutrients to ecosystems. There is therefore an urgent need to understand how N and P affect the structure and activity of methane oxidizing communities. Numerous research studies have already shown variable effects of N-addition on methane oxidation: small additions tend to stimulate methane oxidation, whereas large additions are inhibitory. There is however still a large knowledge gap concerning effects of P on methane oxidation. Here, we present data on the relation between methane oxidation and various measures of P in 50 drainage ditches, and summarize literature reporting relations between P and methane oxidation in wetlands and soils. Additionally, we review experiments on effects of P, N and N + P addition on both low affinity and high affinity methane oxidation. In our set of drainage ditches, as well as studies on wetland and permafrost soils, P content is positively correlated to methane oxidation, though it also co-correlates with many other variables. However, results from P-additions in rice paddies, agricultural soils, landfills, peat bogs, permafrost soils and forests were more variable: sometimes inhibiting (2 studies), other times stimulating methane oxidation (4 studies), and sometimes showing no effect (5 studies). Two studies report increased methanotroph (pmoA) abundance following P-fertilization, but little is known about effects of P on methanotroph community structure and its consequences for methane consumption. By mining methanotrophic genomes for genes involved in N and P-related processes, we demonstrate that variability in N/P related traits (influencing acquisition, uptake and metabolism) does not reflect DNA-based phylogeny. This review points to a need for better mechanistic understanding of the effects of P on methane oxidation, and the role of traits of methanotrophic community members in regulating this process.

AB We tested the hypothesis that fertilized containerized Pinus canariensis seedlings increases survival when planted in semiarid sites through the improvement of their physiological status during the establishment phase by an increment in root growth. Seedlings were cultured under two different regimes: traditional (in non-fertilized natural soil) and alternative (in fertilized peat). Morphological attributes and nitrogen content were measured before planting. Measurements of survival and growth in the plantation were made periodically for 2 years and physiological plant responses (leaf water potential, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence) during the third summer after planting were tested and finally a set of plants were excavated to measure the same parameters as before planting. Seedlings cultivated using fertilized peat achieved the highest values for all of evaluated parameters. During the third dry season, big seedlings exhibited better physiological status. Therefore, enhanced root growth can result in better water uptake during the dry period thereby increasing survival and growth in the next few years after planting. A feed-back physiological model is proposed to explain P. canariensis establishment in a semiarid environment.

AB Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural farming practice contribute significantly to European GHG inventories. For example, CO2 is emitted when grassland is converted to cropland or when peatlands are drained and cultivated. N2O emissions result from fertilization. Enabling farmers to reduce their GHG emissions requires sufficient information about its pressure-impact relations as well as incentives, such as regulations and funding, that support climate-friendly agricultural management. This paper discusses potentials to improve the supply of information on: farm-specific climate services or impacts, present policy incentives in Germany and England that support climate-friendly farm management and related adaptation requirements. Tools which have been developed for a farm environmental management software (to be added after review because of potential identification) are presented. These tools assess CO2 emissions from grassland conversion to cropland and peatland cultivation, as well as N2O emissions from nitrogen fertilization. As input data, the CO2 tool requires a classification of soil types according to soil organic carbon storage. The input data based on soil profile samples was compared with reference data from the literature. The N2O tool relies on farm data concerning fertilization. These tools were tested on three farms in order to determine their viability with respect to the availability of required data and the differentiation of results, which determines how well site-specific conservation measures can be identified. Assessing CO2 retention function of grassland conservation to cropland on the test farms leads to spatially differentiated results (similar to 100 to similar to 900 potentially mitigated t CO2 ha(-1)). Assessed N2O emissions varied from 0.41 to 1.1 t CO(2)eq. ha(-1) a(-1). The proposed methods support policies that promote a more differentiated funding of climate conservation measures. Conservation measures and areas can be selected so that they will have the greatest mitigation effects. However, even though present policy instruments in Germany and England, such as Cross Compliance and agri-environmental measures, have the potential to reduce agricultural GHG, they do not appear to guide measures effectively or site-specifically. In order to close this gap, agri-environmental measures with the potential to support climate protection should be spatially optimized. Additionally, the wetland restoration measures which are most effective in reducing GHG emissions should be included in funding schemes.

AB We measured the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange with the eddy covariance (EC) method through three winters above a cultivated peat soil. During the first winter, the soil was ploughed, while for the next two winters it was grass-covered. On a weekly timescale, the emission was controlled by the soil temperature, whereas the vegetation had no clear impact. The deeper soil temperatures better correlated with the CO2 efflux, especially in frozen soil. The correlation with the air temperature was poor. After a mid-winter snowmelt, decreased CO2 efflux rates were temporarily detected, probably resulting from a lowered diffusion of CO) from the soil air into the atmosphere. Moderate soil-thaw CO pulses were observed in the springs of 2001 and 2003. CO2 emission rates measured with the EC method were found to be significantly lower as compared to those measured with the chamber method. The cumulative CO, emission between December and mid-March ranged from 80 to 178 m(-2) during three winters, correlating positively with air and soil temperatures and the number of snow-free days during that period. The projected increase in the air temperature related to global warming would boost the wintertime CO) efflux at our site by 30-200% (35-114 g m(-2)), depending on the selected emission scenario.

ID STRESS; ACCUMULATION
AB Wood fiber substrates perform well for lettuce seedlings production in speedling trays compared to standard commercially used press pots as well as growing media on peat base. Wood fibers contain a high air volume to allow higher levels of water tension without danger of water saturation in the substrate. For optimum growth they require a "high" matric potential. For cultivation of lettuce seedlings irrigation pulses at phi = -30 to -50 hPa are recommended in ebb and flood cultivation systems. This will provide good rooting and the least amount of proline, an indicator for plant stress.
   Accumulation of proline in lettuce seedlings could only be proved under conditions of visible stress symptoms. Not only water tension, but also the substrates in raising systems influence the free content of proline. At phi = -200 hPa proline in lettuce seedlings cultivated in a peat based press pots were ca. 40 % lower compare to seedlings in a wood fiber substrate in speedling trays. The difference in proline content between well-watered and stressed seedlings was smaller than with tomato transplants. Also, the correlation between proline content of lettuce seedlings and critical water tension for irrigation pulses was lower than with tomato transplant.
   The lettuce plants performed well after transplanting and no differences derived from seedling-treatments were recorded.

AB The release of CO2 from the snow surface in winter and the soil surface in summer was directly or indirectly measured in three different soil types (peat, sand and clay) in agricultural ecosystems in Finland. The closed chamber (CC) method was used for the direct and Fick's diffusion model (DM) method for the indirect measurements. The winter soil temperatures at 2-cm depth were between 0 and 1 degrees C for each soil type. The concentration of CO2 within the snowpack increased linearly with snow depth. The average fluxes of CO2 calculated from the gradients of CO2 concentration in the snow using the DM method ranged from 10 to 27 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), and with the CC method from 18 to 27 mg CO2 m(-2) h. These results suggest that the snow insulates the soil thermally, allowing CO2 production to continue at soil temperatures slightly above freezing in the winter. Carbon dioxide formed in the soil can move across the snowpack up to the atmosphere. The winter/summer ratio of CO2 evolution was estimated to exceed 4%. Therefore, the snow-covered crop soil served as a source of CO2 in winter, and CO2 evolution constitutes an important part of the annual CO2 budget in snowy regions.

AB Denitrification was measured by the C2H2 inhibition technique in a riparian fen irrigated with agricultural drainage water. 16 h after C2H2 treatment 88 +/- 14% of the total N2O contained in water-saturated cores could be accounted for by assuming equilibrium between the gas phase and the liquid phase. The denitrification activity averaged 2.8 and 8.8 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 in the control plot and 1.6 and 21.9mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 in the irrigated plot during the dry and the runoff periods respectively. Four percent of the incoming NO3- was reduced to gaseous N. The spatial variability was often high, with coefficients of variation > 100% and was independent of seasonal changes in soil anaerobiosis. Soil NO3- and denitrification were poorly related, and bulk concentrations of NO3- below 200 mum suggested that the process was strongly limited by diffusion of NO3- into the soil during periods of flooding. Mean denitrification and water-filled pores correlated positively, r = 0.71*** for the control and r = 0.68*** for the irrigated plots. Water-soluble C was not related to denitrification. Multiple regression models including soil water, NO3, soluble C and temperature as independent variables, predicted between 21 and 55% of the denitrification, the highest value found when only mean data was considered. Water-filled pores was the most important variable. The observations on which 2 variables controlled denitrification were supported by laboratory experiments with manipulated cores. Water additions increased denitrification only in samples collected during the dry period. Anaerobic incubation of saturated cores did not affect the process. Restricted NO3- availability was clearly illustrated by the 25-41-fold increase obtained when NO3- was injected into cores at ambient and high carbon respectively. A response of up to 13-fold was observed when substrate-amended cores were made into slurries. Glucose did not increase denitrification by more than a factor of three.

TI SPECIFICITY AND TRENDS IN IMPROVEMENT OF TRACTOR TRAIN BRAKING DYNAMICS

DT Article
DE active tractor train; trailer wheel drive; braking dynamics; selection
   of rational parameters in inter-double-reduction axle relationships
AB The paper considers an important problem in improvement of braking dynamics potential as part of the overall tractor train dynamics consisting of an all-wheel drive tractor and heavy-duty trailers which are either locally manufactured or developed with the participation of the paper's authors. The trailers have a mechanical drive for their wheels from the tractor engine. The trains are intended for transportation peat, organic fertilizers and various loads in forest exploitation and under other complicated soil and climatic and road conditions where there is justified necessity to activate the trailer wheels.
   Methodological tools have been developed with the purpose to analyze an influence of the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of an active tractor train on distribution of braking forces in double-reduction axles with due account of the heavy-duty peat trailer specificity. Theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles have been developed with regard to the braking application specificity of active tractor trains with mechanical multi-path drive for wheels of a multi-double-reduction axle propulsion device. The paper presents calculation and theoretical data in order to estimate distribution of specific braking forces in the double-reduction axle links of the active tractor train when the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of the tractor and trailer wheels is switched on and also in the case when the tractor engine is involved in braking process and a clutch coupling is switched-on.
   Sequence of the calculation formula has been completely carried out in the paper. They represent clear design and operational parameters of the active tractor train. Such approach has made it possible to realize them in the form of a software application which is convenient for analysis of the braking process pertaining to the investigated objects in order to select means for improvement of braking dynamics, rational parameters of multi-path wheel drive and tire completing of the active tractor train under design. The proposed information has a theoretical and practical value for specialists who are involved in development of new machine-tractor units for transport application in peat extraction, forestry, and agriculture.

ID NITRATE REMOVAL; AGRICULTURAL NITROGEN; WATER; GROUNDWATER; DRAINAGE;
   DENITRIFICATION; TRANSFORMATIONS; ZONE; WETLANDS; DYNAMICS
AB Riparian lowlands are known to control catchment nitrogen (N) balances. This study examined the role of agricultural tile drainage systems, often present in clay till landscapes, on the transport, transformation, and mass balance of N species in four riparian peat lowland transects receiving agricultural tile drainage water. Monitoring of N speciation of drain, stream, and groundwater, combined with a previously established water balance, enabled the determination of N mass balances for different flow paths including groundwater, subsurface drain water, and overland flow for each piezometer transect. The type of overland flow largely affected nitrate-N (NO3-N) removal efficiency, as determined by the total N output from a transect relative to the NO3-N loading (%). Infiltration and subsurface flow followed by exfiltration (short return flow) allowed an efficient removal of NO3-N (71-94%), while direct overland flow strongly lowered NO3-N removal (25%) in one transect. The hydraulic loading rate versus the lowland infiltration capacity determined the transport pathways and thus the resulting NO3-N removal efficiency. For all transects there was a net export of organic N and/or ammonium, associated with in situ N release from peat decomposition, through overland flow and groundwater discharge. These exports partly counterbalanced NO3-N removal and significantly reduced the overall total N removal for the riparian lowlands. However, the N removal efficiencies remained positive (1-56%). The study indicates that N budgets for riparian lowlands need to account for overland flow as a transport pathway for N.
   Key Points
   Nitrate (NO3-) removal in riparian lowlands (RLs) depends on the infiltration of NO3- into organic riparian lowland sediments. Direct overland flow, bypassing the RL soil and sediment, decreases nitrate removal. RLs may be sinks or sources of nitrogen (N) depending on the balance between removal of nitrate and release of ammonium and organic N.

AB This paper presents the results of standard fuel analyses of 112 different fuels, along with the results from chemical fractionation through selective leaching. The samples, obtained from boilers during the period 1995-2010, represent the following fuel classes: coal, peat, wood-derived fuels, agricultural wastes, and sewage sludge. The leaching results show that coal consists mainly of insoluble ash forming matter, dominated by different silicates. The ash-forming matter in wood-derived fuels is mainly soluble and is dominated by potassium, calcium, and phosphorus; the insoluble ash-forming matter originates from soil contamination. The ash-forming matter in peat has the characteristics of both wood-derived fuels and coal. In agricultural waste, the ash-forming matter is mainly soluble, even though it may contain some silicon, and is dominated by potassium, chlorine, and phosphorus. The ash-forming matter in sludge is mainly acid-soluble or insoluble. It is also important to note that the aluminum silicates present in sludge may capture volatile potassium during combustion, thereby reducing the risk of deposit and corrosion. The ash-forming matter in sludge is often dominated by phosphorus precipitating agents such as iron sulfate and aluminum sulfate. The study demonstrates the value of chemical fractionation through selective leaching as a tool for explaining ash behavior in FBC.

AB This study blended different proportions of Sorghum Distillery Residue (SDR) and Japanese Cedar Sawdust (JCS) in Wine Sludge (WS), extruded by a self-made mold and developed into Sludge Biochar Medium Pellet (SBMP). SDRMP (WS with SDR) and JCSMP (WS with JCS) were derived at different carbonization temperatures. The property, porosity and water absorption/desorption of both pellets were evaluated. The iodine value of SDRMP and JCSMP were 73.93-185.87 mg/g and 110.46-214.45 mg/g. The water absorption of SDRMP-40-450 (40% SDR with WS at carbonization temperature 450 degrees C) was 129%, while that of JCSMP-40-300 was 191%. The pH of SDRMP was 6.81-9.63, while that of JCSMP was 7.02-9.50. The CEC of SDRMP-40-450 was 35.24 cmol/kg, while that of JCSMP-40-450 was 35.21 cmol/kg. To investigate the degradability, and feasibility of being a functional culture medium in agriculture, all SBMPs were mixed with peat to obtain Sludge Biochar Medium Pellet Peats (SBMPP), including SDRMPP and JCSMPP. The physicochemical properties of various SBMPPs could meet the standard of an ideal culture medium. According to one month's test for degradability, JCSMP was still kept a higher percent weight, but it was lower for SDRMP.

AB Two kinds of polymer composites were prepared using poly (vinyl alcohol) as binder and forestry or wood processing wastes as fillers. In one kind of the composites pine needle meal was used as filler while the other kind of the composites was filled with pine bark meal. Glycerol and oleic acid were used for the modification of mechanical, sorption properties and solubility of the composites. The films of the composites were fabricated and their mechanical, viscoelastic and antifungal properties as well as water absorption and solubility in water were studied. Mathematical experiment design was used to evaluate influence and importance of both glycerol and oleic acid content on of mechanical properties, solubility and water absorption of the composite films filled with pine bark meal. The second order polynomial models were developed in order to find out optimal content of both glycerol and oleic acid in compositions. Exploitation properties of the composite pots prepared from the composites were studied and vegetation tests were performed. It was shown that evaporation rate of water through the walls of the composite pots was by 45% lower and the temperature of substrate in the composite pots was by 3-4 degrees C higher as compared with the corresponding characteristics of peat pots. Plants cultivated in the composite pots had better developed root system relative to those cultivated in peat pots. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To mitigate the trace elements (TE) dispersion in acid mine drainage (AMD), laboratory experiments were carried out comparing nine agricultural by-products. Five adsorbent materials were selected for adsorption batch experiments. Then, the biosorbents were tested to remove TE from AMD collected from oxidized tailings heaps, using equilibrium experiments. The As adsorption on carbonatite was high (15.4 g kg(-1)); Cd (4.1 g kg(-1)) on cow manure; Cu (17.9 g kg(-1)) on carbonatite; Pb (14.1 g kg(-1)), and Zn (16.4 g kg(-1)) on rabbit manure. The Zn adsorption on oat straw and carbonatite was well fit by Freundlich isotherm. The Langmuir equation mimics well Zn and Cd adsorption by peat moss and caw manure; Cu adsorption on peat moss and vermicompost. Except for vermicompost and carbonatite, the adsorption improved as the buffer capacity of the biosorbents increased, following a second-order equation. The FTIR analysis showed that the carboxylic, aromatic, and aliphatic aldehyde groups were involved in TE adsorption. Soluble-As, -Cd, -Cu, and -Zn from AMD were removed (90%) by the addition of 4 and 8% (m/v) of sheep manure, cow manure, rabbit manure, vermicompost, and carbonatite. Lead concentration in AMD was increased due to the addition of the biosorbents.

Hydrogeologic data were combined with measured vertical temperature profiles to constrain a series of two-dimensional, transient simulations of ground water flow and heat transport using the model code SUTRA (Voss 1990). The measured seasonal temperature signal reached depths of 2.7 m beneath the pond. Hydraulic conductivity was varied in each of the layers in the model in a systematic manual calibration of the two-dimensional.model to obtain the best fit to the measured temperature and hydraulic head. Results of a series of representative best-fit simulations represent a range in hydraulic conductivity values that had the best agreement between simulated and observed temperatures and that resulted in simulated pond seepage values within 1 order of magnitude of pond seepage estimated from the water budget. Resulting estimates of ground water discharge to an adjacent agricultural drainage ditch were used to estimate potential dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loads resulting from the restored wetland. Estimated DOC loads ranged from 45 to 1340 g C/(m(2) year), which is higher than estimated DOC loads from surface water. In spite of the complexity in characterizing ground water flow in peat soils, using heat as a tracer provided a constrained estimate of subsurface flow from the pond to the agricultural drainage ditch.

AB Possibilities of application of low-temperature pyrolysis (torrefaction) for improvement of thermotechnical characteristics of biomass granulated fuel are considered. The data on hygroscopic properties, content of volatile matter and heating value of the torrefied biomass fuel produced under various conditions of processing of such types of biomass as wood, peat, and agricultural waste are presented. It is shown that the high-temperature conversion of gases and vapors, escaping during torrefaction, into synthesis gas is an effective method of their environmentally friendly utilization and, at the same time, increases the energy efficiency of biomass processing to granulated fuel.

AB The productivity parameters of 2 Pleurotus spp. cultivated with two mixtures of wheat straw (WS) and peat moss (MG) were evaluated, the chemical composition of the mushrooms and also the antioxidant, antibacterial activities of hexanic extracts of the fruit bodies were determined. Pleurotus strains were fructified using the mixture 1 (60% of WS + 40% of MG) obtained the highest biological efficiencies, production rates and yields. The strain of Pleurotus ostreatus (XC005) cultivated using the mixture 2 (80% WS + 20% of MG) presented fruit bodies with highest protein content being of 25.28%, and also the strain of Pleurotus djamor (XC007) fructified on the mixture 2 showed mushrooms with highest protein content being of 30.98%. The highest antioxidant effect resulted in the hexanic extract of the Pleurotus ostreatus cultivated on M2 was found using the TBARS inhibition assay (EC50 = 0.12 mg mL(-1)), while the highest antioxidant activity showed the hexanic extract of the Pleurotus djamor produced on M1 was found using the TBARS inhibition assay (EC50 = 0.21 mg mL(-1)). The bactericidal effect of the hexanic extracts of Pleurotus ostreatus was obtained between 21.09 to 27.90 mg mL(-1), whereas the bacteriostatic activity of the hexanic extracts of Pleurotus djamor was achieved since 19.82 to 30.98 mg mL(-1). The results evidenced that the Pleurotus spp. cultivated on the mixture 2 presented highest protein content and better biological properties, encouraging the production of edible fungi strains and their use in the industrial field.

AB The high relative humidity of the air and many potential growth media, such as bedding materials, hay and grains in the horse stable, for example, provide suitable conditions for fungal growth. Metabolic activity of four common agricultural fungi incubated in peat and wood shavings at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C was characterized in this study using previously specified volatile metabolites of micro-organisms and CO2 production as indicators. The volatile organic compounds were collected into Tenax resin and analysed by gas chromatography. Several microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs), e.g. 1-butanol, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol and l-octanol were detected in laboratory experiments; however, these accounted for only 0.08-1.5% of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs). Emission rates of MVOCs were 0.001-0.176 mu g/kg of bedding materials per hour. Despite some limitations of the analytical method, certain individual MVOCs, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone and 3-octanone, were also detected in concentrations of less than 4.6 mu g/m(3) (0.07-0.31% of TVOC) in a horse stable where pear and shavings were used as bedding materials. MVOC emission rate was estimated to be 0.2-2.0 mu g/kg x h(-1) from bedding materials in the stable, being about ten times higher than the rates found in the laboratory experiments. Some compounds, e.g. 3-octanone and 1-octen-3-ol, can be assumed to originate mainly from microbial metabolisms.

TI Conservation by Minimal Intervention: Odonata Refuge in Idylwild

DT Article
AB Over the past decade, 84 species of dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) have been found in an area <0.6 km(2) (<0.25 mi(2)) within Idylwild Wildlife Management Area in Caroline County, MD. Eighteen of these species are species of conservation concern in both Maryland and nearby Delaware. This high level of Odonata diversity exceeds that of any other known location on the Delmarva Peninsula. We attribute this to the presence of a variety of pond, marsh, and bog habitats resulting from the unimpeded natural succession of an abandoned sand- and gravel-mining operation. This site has provided a refuge for locally rare species in a heavily agricultural region where draining of swamps and channelization of streams destroyed otherwise suitable wetland habitats for many now rare and endangered Odonata species. Deliberate planning resulted in the decision not to interfere with the ongoing natural succession in the Idylwild Wildlife Management Area, enabling colonization and persistence of Odonata species of conservation concern.

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB To tackle the symptoms of eutrophication in the open Baltic Sea and Finnish coastal waters, Finland has agreed to reduce both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) inputs. Due to large investments in treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters, TP loads started to decrease already in the mid-1970s and the respective TN loads in the mid-1990s. During the last two decades, much effort has been spent in decreasing the load originating from diffuse sources. Trend analyses in 1995-2016 showed that, despite various mitigation measures, riverine nutrient export has not substantially decreased, and especially the export from rivers draining agricultural lands remains high. In some areas TN concentrations and export were increasing and we found evidence that it was linked to ditching of peatlands. Several factors connected to climate/weather (e.g. temperature and precipitation) have counteracted the mitigation measures, and therefore Finland will not achieve the nutrient reduction targets by 2021.

Peat hydrolysate when supplemented with peptone and yeast extract supported a satisfactory growth of the yeast. Ammonium hydroxide and ammonium sulfate were the best inorganic nitrogen sources. A yield of 11.8 g/l was obtained on molasses and wort used in a concentration of 10 and 40% (v/v), respectively. Molasses were pre-treated to be effective. The best yield of 14 g/l, however, was obtained on a richer medium composed of molasses. peptone and yeast extract. The pH profiles were also studied and growth was found within a broad pH zone of 3-10.

Ditches also mediate the flow of pollutants from agroecosystems to downstream water bodies. This paper provides in overview of the science, management, and policy of ditches. Ditches provide a unique opportunity to address nonpoint source pollution problems from agriculture due to the concentration of the contaminants and the engineered nature of ditch systems. A better understanding of the nature of these complex system and the technologies available and under development to improve their management will assist in the design and implementation of water quality protection programs.

AB Natural factors and human intervention, especially fertilization, change the ion dynamics in soil and substrates. Nutrients are often available in different chemical forms (mineral and organic), and as for iron, both forms, i.e. sulfates and chelates, are commonly used. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of different sources and levels of iron, on the content of macronutrients in leaves of lettuce cultivated in peat substrate. The experiments were conducted in the spring and autumn season in a three-year cycle. They were set up under controlled, greenhouse conditions. Six sources of iron were applied (two sulfates and four chelated forms). The total content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S and Na was determined. The results were analyzed statistically with the Newman-Keuls test at a significance level of level alpha = 0.05. The differentiated iron nutrition (both source and level) influenced the mineral composition of lettuce. In the spring cultivating season, mineral forms of iron in comparison to a chelate, caused significantly lower content of nitrogen and potassium. In the autumn cultivating season, after an application of mineral forms of iron compared to chelated ones, lettuce plants contained significantly more calcium and sulfur. To describe the relationship between the experimental factors, correlation and curvilinear regressions were determined. The iron nutrition significantly influenced the content of macronutrients in lettuce leaves. Negative correlation between the level of iron in the substrate and the content of phosphorus and calcium in the leaves was found. Positive correlation was found between the content of iron in the substrate and the content of sodium in the plants.

AB Riparian lowlands act as interfaces between the streams and upland areas. This study identified and quantified local flow paths in four transects of a 26 ha Danish riparian lowland in a glacial till landscape. The riparian lowland was fed by drain water from the upland agricultural drainage catchments. Precipitation, stream stage, and drainage discharge into the riparian lowland were measured continuously, while groundwater hydraulic heads were measured in piezometer pipes twice per month. A water balance model was developed to quantify water fluxes leaving the riparian lowland area via evapotranspiration, leakage to a deeper aquifer, and via groundwater flow, drain flow, and overland flow to the adjacent stream. Overland flow originating from the tile drains was the main flow path in all four transects, and also fluxes to the stream via groundwater or lowland tile drains were significant in some subareas. The presence of a secondary tile drainage network within parts of the riparian lowland reduced overland flow and increased interaction with the riparian lowland soils. Area-normalized fluxes varied greatly between transects, largely reflecting variations in hydraulic loading rate (ratio of water input rate to the area of the receiving riparian lowland). This, combined with the significance of groundwater flow and riparian lowland tile drain flow in some of the investigated transects, revealed a heterogeneous distribution of flow paths within the small headwater lowland. The rate of overland flow was highly correlated to the hydraulic loading rate, which in turn was dominated by the drainage discharge rate at the hillslope boundary.
   Key Points
   Overland flow, bypassing the riparian lowland, is produced when the hydraulic loading exceeds riparian lowland infiltration Magnitudes of overland flow are correlated with the ratio of catchment area to riparian lowland area Riparian lowland drains reduce overland flow and increase water residence times

AB The effects of different growing medium on the physiological status of postharvest cut flowers in six cultivars; of Asiatic hybrid lilies were studied using a factorial experiment arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications. The three variables used in the factorial experiment were 1) Asiatic hybrids of lilies (Amarone, Orlando, Pink Superior, Pollyanna, Salsa and Vignola), 2) chemical treatments including gibberellic acid (50 mg/l), 8-hydroxyquinoline sulphate (200 mg/l), 3% sucrose solution and distilled water as the control and 3) growing medium, i) 1/3 peat+1/3 perlite+1/3 garden soil and ii) 1/3 humus soil+1/3 sand+1/3 garden soil. Three replicates were used for each experimental group. Bulbs of lily hybrids were cultivated in a combination of the two growing media with one bulb in each pot in the greenhouse, College of Agricultural Science, University of Guilan. The number of floral buds, shoot length, flowering time and chlorophyll content of leaves were studied before harvest. The cut flowers were treated with chemicals for 24 h and then placed in distilled water at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. The effects of different treatments on flower and leaf longevity, fresh weight of flowers and chlorophyll content of leaves were studied. Results obtained indicate that growing medium had no significant effects on the number of floral buds, flowering time and chlorophyll content of leaves. However, cultivating bed made up of peat and perlite increased shoot length significantly (P<0.01). The effect of hybrid cultivars on shoot length, number of floral buds, flowering time and chlorophyll content of leaves was significant (P<0.01). Among the chemicals used, gibberellic acid significantly increased flower and leaf longevity, fresh weight of flowers and chlorophyll content of leaves. Treatments with 8-hydroxyquinoline sulphate and sucrose increased flower longevity but resulted in decreased leaf longevity.

AB The design, construction and field operation of computer-based systems for the measurement of trace gas fluxes using the conditional sampling technique are described. A simple system which sampled air into sampling bags was used to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes from peatland and agricultural land, respectively. The system was subsequently automated by making real-time measurements of the gas mixing ratios in the sampling lines thus providing continuous measurements for periods of up to several days. Minor modifications enabled measurement of total hydrocarbons, CO2 and non-methane hydrocarbon fluxes from a forest ecosystem. Intercomparison of conditional sampling with other techniques (eddy covariance, gradient and aircraft boundary layer budget) was encouraging with good agreement between flux measurements of CH4, CO2, N2O and sensible heat. The system has been developed in a sufficiently simple and robust manner to enable extended field measurements. A number of theoretical problems remain including the absolute accuracy of the gas analysis procedures and real-time coordinate rotation procedures to deal with non-uniform terrain.

AB Soil respiration is one of the largest terrestrial fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, small changes in soil respiration rates could have large effects on atmospheric CO2. In order to assess CO2 emissions from diverse European soils with different land-use types and climate (soil moisture and temperature), we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment.
   Emission measurements of CO2 under controlled conditions were conducted using soil monoliths of nine sites from a European flux network (ECLAIRE). The sites are located all over Europe - from the United Kingdom in the west to Ukraine in the east, and from Italy in the south to Finland in the north - and can be separated according to four land-use types (forests, grasslands, arable lands and one peatland). Intact soil cores were incubated in the laboratory in a two-way factorial design, with temperature (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and water-filled pore space (WFPS; 5, 20, 40, 60 and 80 %) as the independent variables, while CO2 flux was the response variable. The latter was measured with an automated laboratory incubation measurement system.
   Land use generally had a substantial influence on carbon dioxide fluxes, with the order of CO2 emission rates of the different land-use types being grassland > peatland > forest/arable land (P < 0.001). CO2 efflux responded strongly to varying temperature and moisture content with optimum moisture contents for CO2 emissions between 40 and 70% WFPS and a positive relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature. The relationship between temperature and CO2 emissions could be well described by a Gaussian model. Q(10) values ranged between 0.86 and 10.85 and were negatively related to temperature for most of the moisture contents and sites investigated. At higher temperatures the effect of water and temperature on Q(10) was very low. In addition, under cold temperatures Q(10) varied with moisture contents, indicating a stronger prospective effect of rain events in cold areas on temperature sensitivity. At both coniferous forest sites we found a strong increase in the temperature sensitivity at a moisture range between 20 and 40% WFPS.
   We developed a new approach to calculate moisture sensitivity (MS) of CO2 efflux. MS was calculated as the slope of a polynomial function of second degree. Moisture sensitivities were highest under dry and wet conditions. In addition we found a positive relationship between MS of CO2 efflux and temperature for both arable lands.

AB Peppermint (Mentha xpiperita L.) rootstock cuttings with 9-11 internodes were planted on April 10, 2014 in rows 50 cm apart and with 25-cm distance in the row, on well fertilized muck-peat soil containing 82.1% of organic matter with a pH of 5.9. Peppermint plants were sprayed once with an activated EM-1 preparation, then on two or three further occasions as follows: at 10 cm height (May 10), at branching stage (May 29), and during rapid growth (June 19). EM did not affect peppermint growth or yield. Yields of the fresh and dry herb were high (means: 15,563 and 2,661 kg ha(-1), respectively) and characterized by a medium (1.85-1.90%) essential oil content in the dry herb. Twenty-nine compounds were identified in the oil and its main components were menthol (53.1-58.5%), menthone (14.6-16.8%), isomenthone (6.3-6.7%), menthyl acetate (4.0-5.0%), germacrene D (2.3-3.4%), beta-caryophyllene (1.8-2.4%), viridiflorol (1.5-2.3%), and 1,8-cyneole (0.3-3.7%). EM did not affect the content of essential oil in the dry herb or the oil composition (except for 1,8-cyneole). Thirty-four days after planting, 22 weed species grew in the experimental plots and the dominant were common meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.) accounting for 20% of total weed population, annual meadow grass (Poa annua L.) 17%, common chickweed [Stellaria media (L.)

Other species occurred sporadically. The total number and fresh weight of weeds growing on 1 m(2) were 412 and 246 g on plots treated with EM and 389 and 227 g on control plots, respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant.

AB The rates of CO2 production and decomposition of C-13-enriched Lolium perenne leaves and roots in soil from the surface five cm of two upland stagnohumic gley soils were measured in laboratory experiments. One of the soils had been limed (pH 6.8) 13 years earlier. The other was unlimed (pH 3.7). Liming increased the rate of CO2 release from soil to which no L. perenne had been added. About 30% of the C-13 in L. perenne leaves remained in both limed and unlimed soil after 224 days. By contrast, less C-13 remained in the limed soil amended with L. perenne roots (44%) than in the limed soils (55%). Although the daily rate of CO2 from the plant material-amended soils was initially greater in the improved than in the unimproved soil, it subsequently declined more rapidly.

AB A recently constructed marsh from previously drained agricultural land currently receives nutrient-laden water from adjacent hypereutrophic Lake Apopka, located in central Florida. Lake water is allowed to cycle through the marsh, allowing settlement of particulate organic matter, which forms a floc sediment layer on the native peat soil surface. The water leaving the marsh is returned to the lake after a retention time of 3 to 12 d. This study determined changes in temporal and spatial distribution of selected nutrients in the soil-water column of the marsh during the first 13 mo of operation. In situ distribution of selected chemical species (H+, NH4+, soluble P, SO42-, dissolved organic C, dissolved inorganic C, CH4, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Al) were measured using soil pore water equilibrators at 3, 8, and 13 mo after marsh creation. Initial flooding of the agricultural soils resulted in high concentrations of NH4+ (11 mg N L-1) and soluble P (31 mg P L-1) as a result of solubilization and anaerobic decomposition. Initially rapid soluble P flux (mean = 2.4 mg P m-2 d-1) occurred from soil to the water column, although lower flux (mean = 0.8 mg P m-2 d-1) occurred after 10 additional months of operation. In contrast, initial flux of NH4+ into the water column was generally lower (mean = 3.4 mg N m-2 d-1) than observed after 10 additional months (mean = 8.2 mg N m-1 d-1). Microbial degradation and nutrient regeneration from settled labile organic matter appeared to support nutrient flux to the water column. After 13 mo of flooding, 75% of the variability of NH4+-N and 65% of the variability of soluble P contained in the water and floc sediment was explained by (DIC + CH4)-C mineralized from settled organic matter. Anaerobic conditions in both the floc sediment and peat soil layers (indicated by increased amounts of dissolved CH4 and Fe, and by SO42- reduction) had significant effects on nutrient retention and release in the soil-water column.

AB 1. Grassland on lowland peat has considerable potential for agriculture and conservation.
   2. The limited use of fertilizer on the Somerset Moors, designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area has enabled the impact on vegetation of applying a range of nitrogen levels to be investigated using a randomized block experiment with large plots at Tadham Moor.
   3. From 1986 to 1990, the plot measurements each year included the individual percentage cover of some 100 species; these enabled the derivation of a number of measures of plant community structure.
   4. The applications of fertilizer encouraged grasses (notably Lolium perenne and Holcus lanatus) which came to dominate the sward at the expense of most other species. All measures of species diversity declined significantly and the sward became taller in plots receiving high levels of nitrogen. Only a very few forbs (e.g. Rumex acetosa) maintained or increased their cover with increased nitrogen.
   5. All Carex species, Juncus species and mosses became significantly less common in plots treated with nitrogen, producing an apparently more mesotrophic sward. Short-lived species and low-growing wetland forbs also declined with nitrogen, perhaps due to shading by tall grasses. Legumes were suppressed by high levels of nitrogen, but were common in plots receiving 25 kg ha-1 year-1 N, where replacement levels of phosphorus and potassium were applied after cutting.
   6. Except for grasses, many species common in the experimental site in 1986 declined in cover, particularly in plots receiving high levels of nitrogen. However, the data showed no instances of extinction by 1990. The application of 25 kg ha-1 N encouraged the spread of agriculturally productive grasses within 2 years and 50 kg ha-1 year-1 N significantly reduced species richness in 3 years.
   7. Certain detailed findings from this large-scale study of nitrogen application in meadows enable contrasts with previous results to be identified.

ID LOW-COST ADSORBENTS; DYE REMOVAL
AB Sorption is one of the several methods that have been successfully utilized for dyes removal. A large number of materials have been used as suitable sorbents for decolourization of industrial effluents: activated carbon (the most common but expensive adsorbent), polymeric resins, various low-cost adsorbents (agricultural and industrial by-products, peat, chitin, silica, bentonite, other clays, fly ash).
   Our paper is a review about our researches regarding different types of industrial and agricultural waste materials with sorptivc properties (ashes, textile fibres, sawdust, lignin, sun flower shells, corn cob, etc.) that were utilized into textile wastewater treatment. Batch sorption experiments were carried out in order to establish the favourable conditions to uptake of dyes. The studied operating variables were: pH, sorbent dose, dyes concentration, temperature and sorption time. The sorption systems were described using Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models.

AB Different treatments of organic production of greenhouse tomatoes - ie organic conventional and hydroponic - were compared with respect to nutritive value, organoleptic quality and productivity. As concerns organic production, the tomatoes cultivated in peat moss and shrimps compost contained higher amounts of Ca, Cu, Fe, P and Zn and had a later maturity than those cultivated in cow manure compost. The average amount of total vitamin C of tomatoes produced conventionally and hydroponically was significantly higher than that of tomatoes produced organically whereas the mineral content of tomatoes had little relation to the method of production. The taste and texture of tomatoes and the total yield of fruits were comparable for the three methods of production even if a earlier precocity was obtained with the hydroponic culture.

AB Recently in humid tropical Asia, human activities have begun to extend toward the coastal lowland areas where widespread peat swamps are distributed. Draining peat swamp areas for agricultural uses creates a high risk of sulfuric acidification. The research site in this paper was a strand plain comprising beach ridges, swales on inter-ridges, and peaty backswamps in southeast Thailand. Thus, the actual and potential acid sulfate soil in the peaty backswamps is a major problem there, but sandy podzols on older beach ridges are also considered an agricultural problem soil. To establish an agricultural landscape plan encompassing the whole of the strand plain, we studied the land characteristics associated with the landforms and soils, their spatial variability related to landscape evolution, and the status of present plant resources in terms of biomass and species diversity for local farmers on peaty backswamps and beach ridges. We found that all spatial attributes of the two soils, such as the locations, profiles, and chemical and physical properties, were closely related to the geomorphic formation process or chronosequence: the landward or older backswamp has ripe clay and the seaward or younger one partly has unripe clay; the degree of spodic horizon development with ortstein is highest in the most landward beach-ridge system and decreases seaward; and the profile positions of the spodic horizons were related to the fluctuations of marine sand sediments, as revealed in a fine-scale survey. Finding these spatial regularities is useful for predicting land characteristics in areas outside of detailed research sites, reducing time and cost as well as forming the basis of landscape planning. Plant resources presently utilized by local farmers on the strand plain are Melaleuca cajuputi forests on both the peaty backswamps and the beach ridges, and home gardens of tropical fruit trees around settlements. Ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass of M. cajuputi was not significantly different among soil types in the strand plain, but the growth rate and potential biomass of the species appears to be highest in thick, water-saturated peaty backswamps with acid sulfate soils. By comparing the species composition of home gardens in different areas, we found that oil the beach ridges, although the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass for several types of fruit trees appears lower, a great number of species particular to the shrub layer are maintained. Based on the spatial variability of land characteristics and the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass, we identified separate land units and suggested future land-management and land-use systems appropriate to each unit.

AB The present area of European wetlands is only a fraction of their area before the start of large-scale human colonization of Europe. Many European wetlands have been exploited and managed for various purposes. Large wetland areas have been drained and reclaimed mainly for agriculture and establishment of human settlements. These threats to European wetlands persist. The main responses of European wetlands to ongoing climate change will vary according to wetland type and geographical location. Sea level rise will probably be the decisive factor affecting coastal wetlands, especially along the Atlantic coast. In the boreal part of Europe, increased temperatures will probably lead to increased annual evapotranspiration and lower organic matter accumulation in soil. The role of vast boreal wetlands as carbon sinks may thus be suppressed. In central and western Europe, the risk of floods may support the political will for ecosystem-unfriendly flood defence measures, which may threaten the hydrology of existing wetlands. Southern Europe will probably suffer most from water shortage, which may strengthen the competition for water resources between agriculture, industry and settlements on the one hand and nature conservancy, including wetland conservation, on the other.

AB Small landscape elements such as ditches are an important remaining refuge for biodiversity in agricultural land especially in the Netherlands. By themselves ditches harbour steep gradients in environmental conditions creating a rich variety in microhabitat availability at the small scale. Regional variation in management and water quality could influence microhabitat variability among these ditches. Some 400 ditches in six major agricultural polder areas around Amsterdam were studied. Data were collected on ditch width, submerged or emergent plants, conductivity, bank height, slope and ditch depth. A principal component analysis using these variables showed observed variability and attributed to the ditch dimensions related to ditch maintenance carried out by the farmers and ditch water quality. Microhabitats prevalence such as percentage algal cover and emergent, vary greatly even in early spring. It was found that, there is a great variability between the ditches within the sampled agricultural polder areas.

AB Quantifying the contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to C sequestration in soils requires knowledge about extent and rate of its biodegradation. Since degradation experiments are time consuming, estimating the biodegradability of DOM by more easily measurable properties seems valuable. Our goal was therefore to investigate the biodegradation of DOM of different origin and to relate its extent and rate to properties such as UV absorbance, synchronous and emission scan fluorescence, XAD-8 sorption chromatography and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. We extracted DOM from 13 different samples (maize straw, forest floors, peats, agricultural soils) and carried out a 90-day liquid incubation experiment. DOM biodegradation was quantified by CO(2) evolution. Rapidly and slowly mineralizable portions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a measure of labile and stable DOC and the respective mineralization rate constants and half-lives were calculated by a double exponential model. The extent and rate of DOM biodegradation from less humified organic material (straw, litter and fermentation layers of forest floors) were high resulting in 61-93% of DOC being mineralized. The labile fraction comprised 59-88% of total DOC. DOM extracted from agricultural soils was of an intermediate biodegradability with a CO(2) evolution comprising 17-32% of total DOC. Labile DOC represented 14-25% of total DOC. DOM extracted from peats and Oa forest floor layers was relatively stable (mineralization of 4-9% of total DOC, labile DOC: 3-6%). The half-life of the labile DOC pool was short (2-5 days), whereas that of the stable DOC pool ranged from 0.2 years (DOM from less humified material) to 8.6 years (DOM from the Oa layer under spruce). Extent and rate of DOM biodegradation were closely but nonlinearly related to DOM properties. Solutions exceeding a threshold value of UV absorbance, aromaticity, XAD-8 adsorbable C or of humification indices derived from fluorescence spectra or having carbohydrate contents below a certain level were stable against biodegradation. Relatively simple methods like UV spectroscopy, XAD-8 fractionation and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were suitable to estimate the biodegradation of DOM.

AB Drainage, tillage, and intensive land use lead to drastic alterations in physical characteristics of organic soils. As decomposition and soil formation progress, bulk density (rho(b)) increases and total porosity (f(t)) decreases due to subsidence, shrinkage, and mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). However, the rate of subsidence and the changes in soil properties differ among management systems. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of different tillage practices on rho(b) and f(t) of cultivated peat soils. These experiments were conducted during 2004-2005, on Histosols in north central Ohio. Soil core samples were obtained from experimental plots managed with moldboard plow (MB), no-till (NT), or left bare (B). Conversion of plow tillage to NT increased Pb from 0.52 to 0.57 Mg m(-3), and decreased f, from 0.72 to 0.70 m(3) m(-3). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The results of studies of the content and stocks of organic carbon in the block "litter soil" of pine ecosystems in Zhytomyr and Chernihiv Polissia are presented. The forest ecosystems are important stabilizers of the carbon cycle as well as stocks of carbon. The components of the forest ecosystem are interconnected by the flows of energy and substances. Binding CO2 in the block of "plant-soil", followed by the transformation of carbon into insoluble humus compounds is of particular importance. In the research area sod - light-podzolic and sod-medium-podzolic soils on fluvioglacial sands are mostly spread. These soils belong to the category of old arable ones. Present here are also peat marsh soils. It is shown that the process of humus accumulation is characterized by low intensity, which is caused by a complex of reasons, in particular, the sandy composition of sod-podzolic soils (particle content < 0,01 mm 7,5 %).The thickness of the profile humus portion is 18 cm. The average content of humus is 0,97 %, and reserves 28,3 t/ha in a 20-cm layer. Similar indicators of carbon are 0,56 % and 16,4 t/ha, respectively. Organic substance of sod-podzolic soils of pine habitats is resistant to mineralization and for a long time is removed from the cycle of substances of the pine ecosystem. The average carbon content in hydromorphic organogenic soils increases to 18,1 % and its stocks are 168,9 t/ha. The ability for mineralization peat soils is lower than that of sod-podzolic soils. So, they have a high carbon sequestration capacity. Pine litter reserves on the average are 30-33 t/ha, and carbon reserves on the average are 12,6 t/ha, with its stable content 40 %.The total carbon reserves in the block "litter soil" of a typical pine ecosystem of Polissia are on average 29 t/ha, with the bulk of them being concentrated in the soil. Considering that highly productive pine forests are formed on the infertile soils of Polissia, their afforestation will not only stop the intensive degradation of soils of Ukraine, but also will increase the deposition of greenhouse gases, which will help to prevent further climate change at the regional level.

TI Common Reed for Thatching in Northern Germany: Estimating the Market

AB Reed has a long tradition as locally available thatching material, but nowadays thatch is a globally traded commodity. Germany and other major importing countries such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Denmark rely on high import rates to meet the national consumption. This study aimed at providing a detailed picture of the thatching reed market in Northern Germany and at assessing the market potential for reed of regional origin. A written survey among all thatchers in Northern Germany was carried out in 2019, arriving at an effective sample of 47 out of 141 companies. The results revealed that for the responding companies the majority of the reed (59%) was used for rethatching roofs completely, 24% for newly constructed roofs, and 17% for roof repairs. Reed from Germany held a low share of 17% of the total consumption in 2018. Own reed harvesting was conducted by less than 9% of the responding companies and given up during the last decades by another 26%. The total market volume of reed for thatching in Northern Germany was estimated for 2018 with a 95% confidence interval at 3 +/- 0.8 million bundles of reed with a monetary value at sales prices of euro11.6 +/- 2.8 million. Based on the end consumer demand, the supply gap for reed of regional or German origin was estimated at 523,000 +/- 392,000 bundles of reed equaling a market value of euro1.9 +/- 1.4 million, indicating high uncertainties. Most of the responding thatchers (70%) did not promote reed of regional origin, mainly due to insufficient availability but also a lack in quality was reported. The cultivation of reed in paludiculture, i.e., as climate-smart land use alternative to drainage-based agriculture on peatlands, can increase the availability of thatching reed in Germany and simultaneously reduce GHG emissions.

AB Rhizobium meliloti 1021 and several Tn5 generated mutants were examined for physiological activities which would reflect the capacity of these strains for efficient iron metabolism. Rhizobactin production in liquid culture, as measured by CAS reactivity, was greatest in R. meliloti 1021 with lesser amounts formed by strains PRR 63 and PRR 62. Examination of the various strains of R meliloti grown under different levels of iron revealed that all strains tested were constitutive for ferric reductase. Evaluation of Medicago saliva L. cultivated in peat pots and inoculated with R meliloti revealed that greatest levels of growth was with R meliloti 1021, the only strain in this study with an efficient rhizobactin system.  Evaluation of dinitrogen fixed by nodulated plants grown in a hydroponic system indicated that the amount of nitrogen fixed per bacteroid in the nodule was not constant but was correlated with the rhizobactin producing capability of the R. meliloti strains. Levels of dinitrogen fixed per unit of viable bacteroids was greater with R. meliloti 1021 than with PRR 29 or PRR

AB Current concern over the potentially negative impacts of climate change has brought attention to anthropogenic sources of methane, a primary greenhouse gas. Two such emission sources are methane leakage at heavy oil wells and sanitary landfills. At both of these sources, substantial quantities of methane could potentially be oxidised by methanotrophic microbes living in soils. Optimisation of this phenomenon may serve as an inexpensive technique for reducing methane emissions. Soil column and batch incubation experiments were performed on a landfill loam, an agricultural loam and a sedge peat to gain a better quantitative understanding of the biological and physical processes limiting CH4 oxidation in soils that undergo the freeze-thaw cycles associated with northern climates. Moisture content emerged as a critical variable that can limit a soil's CH4 oxidation potential. For example, the oxidation rate of the agricultural soil was seen to increase by an order of magnitude after increasing its moisture content from 6% to 10% of its dry weight.

AB An orthogonal experimental design L-9 (3(4)) with 10 repetitions was used to investigate the effect of Glomus claroideum (0, 1 or 2 g(-1) plant), G. fasciculatum (0, 1 or 2 g plant(-1)), native diazotrophic bacteria (0, 10(3) and 10(5) UFC ml(-1)) and sheep manure vermicompost (0%, 5% and 10% v/v) on maize plant growth, N and P in leaves and mycorrhization percent. Vermicompost explained most of the variation found for leaf number, wet weight, stem height, and diameter. Both mycorrhizas increased the plant wet weight but G. fasciculatum the most. Mycorrhization increased the P content, but not the N content. Mycorrhizal colonization increased when diazotrophic bacteria and vermicompost were added. It was found that weight of maize plants cultivated in peat moss amended with vermicompost increased when supplemented with G. fasciculatum and diazotrophic bacteria. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The growth of evergreen azaleas (Rhododendron spp.) can be altered by iron (Fe) chlorosis when plants are cultivated in a neutral-alkaline substrate. In this study, morphological and physiological responses to alkalinity and Fe deficiency were evaluated in five diploid Japanese azaleas to assess their potential as resources for breeding. R. obtusum 'Kirin', R. indicum 'Shinsen', R. x pulchrum 'Sen-e- oomurasaki', R. indicum 'Osakazuki', and R. ripense were pot cultivated in a peat-based substrate for 10 weeks, in acid and alkaline growing media with both adequate and inadequate Fe nutrition. Plant performance was generally affected by high pH of the substrate, while Fe deficiency by itself influenced few of the evaluated parameters, possibly due to the complex adaptive response mechanisms of these slow growing ornamental shrubs. According to the biochemical and physiological variations recorded on a long period of cultivation, R. indicum 'Osakazuki' reported the best performance. This azalea could be a valuable resource for breeders.

AB Ecosystem-based approaches provide opportunities for climate policy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to expand the adaptive capacities and resilience of land systems to a changing climate, and to simultaneously protect biodiversity and ecosystems services (ESS). However, knowledge about the economic benefits and cost-efficiency of ecosystem-based approaches is still limited. The objective of this paper is to enhance understanding of synergies and trade-offs between climate policy related measures and nature conservation and how ecosystem-based approaches can contribute to both climate as well as biodiversity and ESS conservation goals, through overall economic analyses to inform balanced decision making. The paper builds upon the current state of knowledge as brought together by contributors to the German national TEEB-study "Natural Capital and Climate Policy - Synergies and Conflicts". We present options and lessons learned from major land-use sectors of high relevance for ecosystem-based approaches to climate change, namely agriculture, peatlands, forests, wetlands and coastal and marine ecosystems. Based on these assessments, we argue that successful implementation of an ecosystembased climate policy requires effective coordination and coherence between sectors and their respective policies, for example agriculture, forestry and energy. We identify specific targets for an ecosystem-based climate policy and options for achieving this coherent implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most scenarios on instruments limiting global warming in line with the 1.5 degrees C temperature limit of the Paris Agreement rely on overshooting the emissions threshold, thus requiring the application of negative emission technologies later on. Subsequently, the debate on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) (frequently subsumed under "geoengineering") has been reinforced. Yet, it does not determine normatively whether those are legally valid approaches to climate protection. After taking a closer look at the scope of climate scenarios and SRM methods compiling current research and opinions on SRM, this paper analyses the feasibility of geoengineering and of SRM in particular under international law. It will be shown that from the perspective of human rights, the Paris Agreement, and precautionary principle the phasing-out of fossil fuels and the reduction in consumption of livestock products as well as nature-based approaches such as sustainable-and thus climate and biodiversity-smart-forest, peatland, and agricultural management strongly prevail before geoengineering and atmospheric SRM measures in particular. However, as all of the atmospheric SRM methods are in their development phase, governance options to effectively frame further exploration of SRM technologies are proposed, maintaining that respective technologies thus far are not a viable means of climate protection.

AB An animal's capacity to recolonize a patch depends on at least two components: its ability to detect the patch and its ability to reach it. However, the disruption of such processes by anthropic disturbances could explain low animal abundance patterns observed by many investigators in certain landscapes. Through field experiments, we compared the orientation and homing success of northern green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota Rafinesque, 1820) and northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens Schreber, 1782) translocated across disturbed or undisturbed surfaces. We also monitored the path selected by individuals when presented with a choice between a short distance over a disturbed surface and a longer, undisturbed route. Finally, we measured the water loss and behaviour of frogs on substrates resulting from anthropogenic disturbances and a control. When presented with a choice, 72% of the frogs avoided disturbed surfaces. Although able to orient towards the pond of capture when translocated on disturbed surfaces, frogs had a lower probability of homing successfully to the pond than when translocated at a similar distance on an undisturbed surface. Frogs lost the most water on substrates associated with disturbance and in the absence of cover. Our data illustrate that anthropically disturbed areas devoid of cover, such as mined peatlands and agricultural fields, disrupt the ability of frogs to reach habitat patches and are likely explanations to their reduced abundance patterns in such environments.

AB The delta(13)C values fi individual trihalomethanes (THM) formed on reaction of chlorine with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached from maize (corn; Zea maize L.) and Scirpus acutus (an aquatic bulrush), and with DOC extracted from agricultural drainage waters were determined using purge and trap introduction into a gas chromatograph-combustion-isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer. We observed a 16.8 parts per thousand difference between the delta(13)C values of THM produced from the maize and Scirpus leachates, similar to the isotopic difference between the whole plant materials. Both maize and Scirpus formed THM 12 parts per thousand lower than C-13 than whole plant material. We suggest that the low value of the THM relative to th whole plant material is evidence of distinct pools of THM-forming DOC, representing different biochemical types or chemical structures, and possessing different environmental reactivity.
   Humic extracts of waters draining an agricultural field containing Scirpus peat soils and planted with maize amy contribute significantly to the THM-forming DOC. The difference between the delta(13)C values of the whole isolate and that of the THM it yielded was 3.9 parts per thousand, however, suggesting diagnesis plays a role in deermining the delta(13)C value of THM-forming DOC in the drainage waters, and precluding the direct use fo siotopic mixing models to quantitatively attribute sources.

TI The transformation of urban waterscapes: documenting waterscape
   manipulation as an aspect of urban development in the Roman period
SO REVUE BELGE DE PHILOLOGIE ET D HISTOIRE
LA English
DT Article
AB There have now been a number of important studies of wetland exploitation and transformation in Roman Western Europe. This process of landscape change further intensified in post-Roman times resulting in a very different landscape to that which existed in prehistory and the Roman periods. Landscape archaeology has demonstrated, for example, that in Roman Britain coastal wetlands were drained and the land reclaimed for agricultural purposes. Other wetlands such as the East Anglian Fen land, the largest wetland in Britain before modern drainage, were used partly for agriculture and partly as pasture for keeping cattle. Urban development in Western Europe, however, also resulted in considerable changes to the landscape including wetlands and other interconnected components of waterscapes including rivers and lakes. There has conventionally been an academic divide between the archaeological methodologies and interpretations of landscape archaeology (focusing on the countryside) and urban archaeology. Drawing on research undertaken as part of a larger project examining the relationship between Roman urban spaces and waterscapes, this paper will complement the important work of landscape archaeologists by investigating the theme of wetland change from the urban context. The paper will consider the way in which towns adapted to, controlled, exploited and transformed the landscapes in which they were situated paying particular attention to water. It will examine evidence of the drainage of wetlands, the reclamation of land and the redirection of rivers for the purposes of developing and expanding the towns. Rivers were also increasingly controlled through timber revetments, embankments and wharfs, representing growing command of the landscape.

AB Organophosphorus insecticide diazinon (DZN) is diffusely used in agriculture, home gardening and crop peats. Much work so far has focused on the link between DZN exposure and the occurrence of neurological diseases, while, it is little-known that reproductive toxicological assessment on DZN exposure. This research aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of toxic hazard for DZN exposure on the cultured porcine ovarian granulosa cells. We analyzed the oxidative stress, energy metabolism, DNA damage, apoptosis and autophagy by using high-throughput RNA-seq, immunofluorescence, western blotting and real-time PCR. The combined data demonstrated that DZN exposure could cause excessive ROS and DNA damage, which induced apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway. The down-regulated CYP19A1 protein and granulosa cells death increase the risk for developing the premature ovarian failure and the follicular atresia. In conclusion, DZN exposure has obvious reproductive toxicity by induction of granulosa cell death through pathways connected to DNA damage and oxidative stress by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway.

The strains of Lentinula edodes (LEN97 and LEN95(4)XLEC24(1)) cultivated on both mixtures produced fruit bodies with highest protein contents since 16.71 to 17.10%. The hybrid strain of Lentinula edodes strain (LEN95(4)XLEC24(1)) cultivated on both mixtures showed the highest biological efficiencies since 74.61 to 82.80% and production rates between 1.21 and 1.30%, and also their hexanic extracts presented the highest antioxidant effects ranged from 8.01 to 9.84 mg mL(-1). The use of hybrid strain of Lentinula edodes can be used to improve the production of this genera.

AB The use of organic soils by agriculture involves drainage and tillage, and the resulting increase in C and N turnover can significantly affect their greenhouse gas balance. This study estimated annual fluxes of CH4 and N2O, and ecosystem respiration (R-eco), from eight organic soils managed by agriculture. The sites were located in three regions representing different landscape types and climatic conditions, and three land use categories were covered (arable crops, AR, grass in rotation, RG, and permanent grass, PG). The normal management at each site was followed, except that no N inputs occurred during the monitoring period from August 2008 to October 2009. The stratified sampling strategy further included six sampling points in three blocks at each site. Environmental variables (precipitation, PAR, air and soil temperature, soil moisture, groundwater level) were monitored continuously and during sampling campaigns, where also groundwater samples were taken for analysis. Gaseous fluxes were monitored on a three-weekly basis, giving 51, 49 and 38 field campaigns for land use categories AR, PG and RG, respectively. Climatic conditions in each region during monitoring were representative as compared to 20-yr averages. Peat layers were shallow, typically 0.5 to 1 m, and with a pH of 4 to 5. At six sites annual emissions of N2O were in the range 3 to 24 kg N2O-N ha(-1), but at two arable sites (spring barley, potato) net emissions of 38 and 61 kg N2O-N ha(-1) were recorded. The two high-emitting sites were characterized by fluctuating groundwater, low soil pH and elevated groundwater SO42- concentrations. Annual fluxes of CH4 were generally small, as expected, ranging from 2 to 4 kg CH4 ha(-1). However, two permanent grasslands had tussocks of Juncus effusus L. (soft rush) in sampling points that were consistent sources of CH4 throughout the year. Emission factors for organic soils in rotation and with permanent grass, respectively, were estimated to be 0.011 and 0.47 gm(-2) for CH4, and 2.5 and 0.5 gm(-2) for N2O. This first documentation of CH4 and N2O emissions from managed organic soils in Denmark confirms the levels and wide ranges of emissions previously reported for the Nordic countries. However, the stratified experimental design also identified links between gaseous emissions and site-specific conditions with respect to soil, groundwater and vegetation which point to areas of future research that may account for part of the variability and hence lead to improved emission factors or models.

AB The roddons of the English Fenlands are fossilised silt and sand-filled tidal creek systems of mid- to late-Holocene age, incised into contemporaneous clay deposits. However, anthropogenic change (drainage and agriculture) has caused the former channels to become positive topographical features. Three stratigraphically discrete generations of roddon have been discriminated. They all show well-developed dendritic meander patterns, but there is little or no evidence of sand/silt infill during meandering; thus, unlike modern tidal creeks and rivers they typically lack laterally stacked point bar deposits, suggesting rapid infill. Major "trunk" roddons are rich in fine sands and there is little change in grain size from roddon mouth to the upper reaches, suggesting highly effective sand transport mechanisms and uniform conditions of deposition. Tributaries are silt-rich, while minor tributaries also have a significant clay component. During infill, active drainage networks appear to have been choked by sediment, converting mudflat/salt-marsh environments into widespread peat-forming freshwater reed swamps (C) 2010 The Geologists' Association.

AB Finnish rivers exported annually on average 1.2 M t carbon, and total organic carbon (TOC) comprised the major share (nearly 80 %) of this export. The mean area specific carbon export was 4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1). The highest organic carbon export originated from peat dominated catchments, whereas rivers draining agricultural catchments had the highest area-specific inorganic carbon fluxes. Between 1975 and 2014 total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations rose more steadily than the respective TOC concentrations. There was an overall decrease in TOC concentrations between 1975 and the mid-1990s. Decreased point source loading contributed to this pattern, although decreases were also detected in rivers without any major pollution sources. From the mid-1990s TOC concentrations started to rise and the increase was even more pronounced than the earlier decrease. The upward trend was ubiquitous, both in time and space, and it was not possible to link the changes to any specific catchment characteristics or another single driver. Warming climate, changes in hydrology and decreases in acidic deposition were the major driving factors although their contribution varied geographically. At the same time both TOC and TIC export increased slightly, but the strong upward trends in TOC concentrations were not reflected as clearly in TOC export trends. This was because changes in water flow had a dominant influence on TOC export to the sea and any changes in concentrations were masked behind the variation in flow.

AB Anthropogenic effects on soil fungi have been poorly investigated in peaty soils, where they have a crucial role in the maintenance of soil fertility and in the regulation of nutrient cycles. In this study, we assessed the effects of land-use intensification on the composition of fungal communities in Mediterranean peaty soils drained for agricultural purposes. To this end, a continuous maize cropping system was compared with an extensive grassland and an agricultural soil left abandoned for 15 years. Molecular diversity and community composition of total soil fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were assessed, as well as soil chemical properties potentially responsible for fungal shifts. The relative roles of intensification and soil chemical properties were also quantified by applying variation partitioning analysis. Multivariate analyses show that: (i) land-use intensification shapes the composition of the community of total soil fungi and AMF in soil and roots; (ii) base saturation (Bas Sat) and exchangeable calcium (ExchCa) in soil are the significant soil chemical drivers of the composition of the total soil fungal community; (iii) Bas Sat is the only significant chemical parameter shaping the soil AMF community; and (iv) no soil chemical properties affect root AMF. Based on variation partitioning, which highlights a large overlap between land-use intensification and Bas Sat, we can assert that land-use intensification is well-correlated with Bas Sat in shaping the total soil fungal community composition, as well as the AMF. By contrast, intensification acts as a major driver with respect to ExchCa in shaping the composition of the total soil fungal communities.

AB Aims Agricultural soils in Germany store 2.54 Pg of organic carbon (C). However, information about how and when this C entered the soils is limited. This study illustrates how depth profiles of organic matter can shed light on different entry paths of organic C. Methods Machine learning was used to explain total organic C (TOC), C:N, particulate organic C (POC), delta C-13 and delta N-15 values down to 100 cm depth based on pedology, geology, climate and management-related variables from the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. We estimated TOC turnover rates based on the relationship between the proportion of maize (only C-4 plant) in crop rotations and soil delta C-13 values. Results In the upper 30 cm of cropland, fresh photosynthates added on average 0.2 to 0.8 Mg C ha(- 1) year(- 1). Organic fertiliser was another source of topsoil C, especially in grassland. Sandy sites in north-west Germany contained historic C from past heathland and peatland. One third of German agricultural land was found to be on colluvial and alluvial deposits, in which allochthonous C from upstream and upslope areas evidently increased the TOC content of subsoils. In and below hardpans, TOC content and C:N and POC:TOC ratios were low, indicating restricted root-derived C input. Conclusions Our data indicate that ongoing management in German agricultural soils mainly affects topsoil C, while C storage in subsoils reveals significant legacies from allochthonous, buried or translocated C inputs. Specific attention should be focused on the sustainable loosening of hardpans that could result in a slow, but significant increase in subsoil C stocks.

AB Foliage of terrestrial plants provides an important energy and nutrient source to aquatic ecosystems but also represents a potential source of contaminants, such as mercury (Hg). In this study, we examined how different stream water types and terrestrial tree species influenced the release of Hg from senesced litter to the water and its subsequent methylation during hypoxic litter decomposition. After laboratory incubations of maple leaf litter for 66 days, we observed 10-fold differences in dissolved Hg (DHg, < 0.45-mu m) concentrations among different stream water types and more than 50-fold differences in dissolved methylmercury (DMeHg) concentrations. Percent MeHg (i.e., DMeHg x 100 divided by DHg on day 66) varied from 23-102% across seven natural stream water types. In general, stream waters with higher dissolved sulfate, suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentrations (e.g., eutrophic streams draining agricultural land) are associated with higher Hg release and methylation compared to more pristine sites (e.g clear waters from coldwater trout stream). Across six tree species collected at the same site and incubated with the same source water, litter from slower decomposing species (e.g., cedar and pine) yielded higher DHg concentrations than those with more labile carbon (e.g., maple and birch). Percent MeHg, however, was relatively similar among different leaf species (i.e., 61-86%). Our study is the first to demonstrate that stream water chemistry and terrestrial plant litter characteristics are important factors determining Hg release and methylation during hypoxic litter decomposition. These results suggest that certain watershed and aquatic ecosystem properties can determine the levels of MeHg inputs during litterfall events.

AB The implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategies and Actions Plans (NBSAP), as required by Article 6 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), would improve the base for political decisions by quantifying the costs and benefits of biodiversity conservation in monetary terms and by illustrating the benefits of related ecosystem services (ESS). However, so far the costs and benefits of the NBSAP have not been routinely estimated. This paper presents results from research quantifying the financial costs and benefits of implementing a set of measures based on the National Strategy on Biological Diversity in Germany (NBS). Based on the NBS and the Quality Status Reports of the EU Habitat Directive, a conservation program was developed consisting of land use changes for six ecosystems/land use types: forests, arable land, grassland, peatlands, wetlands and dry habitats. In addition to the benefits of maintaining biodiversity, two potential ESS benefits of the NBS, water purification and climate mitigation, are estimated as well as the financial costs of implementation. A nationwide contingent valuation study was undertaken to determine the benefits of maintaining biodiversity as a result of the conservation program. The benefits of the conservation program with regard to the ESS water purification are calculated for N-reduction in the leachate and based on abatement costs. The contribution of nature conservation to climate mitigation is calculated for the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and based on damage costs. The results of the study indicate that the implementation of the NBS would lead to significant financial costs, but the benefits would exceed the financial costs of measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria can improve plant health by providing enhanced nutrition, disease suppression and abiotic stress resistance, and have potential to contribute to sustainable agriculture. We have developed a sphagnum peat-based compost platform for investigating plant-microbe interactions. The chemical, physical and biological status of the system can be manipulated to understand the relative importance of these factors for plant health, demonstrated using three case studies: 1. Nutrient depleted compost retained its structure, but plants grown in this medium were severely stunted in growth due to removal of essential soluble nutrients - particularly, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Compost nutrient status was replenished with the addition of selected soluble nutrients, validated by plant biomass; 2. When comparing milled and unmilled compost, we found nutrient status to be more important than matrix structure for plant growth; 3. In compost deficient in soluble P, supplemented with an insoluble inorganic form of P (Ca-3(PO4)(2)), application of a phosphate solubilising Pseudomonas strain to plant roots provides a significant growth boost when compared with a Pseudomonas strain incapable of solubilising Ca-3(PO4)(2). Our findings show that the compost system can be manipulated to impose biotic and abiotic stresses for testing how microbial inoculants influence plant growth.

AB Vegetated agricultural ditches play an important role in mitigation of pesticides following irrigation and storm runoff events. In a simulated runoff event in the Mississippi (USA) Delta, the mitigation capacity of a drainage ditch using the pyrethroid esfenvalerate (Asana XL(TM)) was evaluated. The pesticide was amended to soil prior to the runoff event to simulate actual runoff, ensuring the presence of esfenvalerate in both water and suspended particulate phases. Water, sediment, and plant samples were collected temporally and spatially along the drainage ditch. Even with mixing of the pesticide with soil before application, approximately 99% of measured esfenvalerate was associated with ditch vegetation (Ludwigia peploides, Polygonum amphibium, and Leersia oryzoides) three hours following event initiation. This trend continued for the 112 d study duration. Simple modeling results also suggest that aqueous concentrations of esfenvalerate could be mitigated to 0.1% of the initial exposure concentration within 510 m of a vegetated ditch. Observed field half-lives in water, sediment, and plant were 0.12 d, 9 d, and 1.3 d, respectively. These results validate the role vegetation plays in the mitigation of pesticides, and that ditches are an indispensable component of the agricultural production landscape.

AB Soils are the most important sink for atmospheric hydrogen, which is assumed to be oxidized by abiontic soil hydrogenases or by putative high-affinity hydrogenases of microbial origin. The activity of soil hydrogenases has been found to change with soil temperature as it changes during the day and the season. However, it is unclear whether and to which extent the soil hydrogenases are deactivated by increased temperature. Therefore, we incubated soils from different climates and different ecosystems (forest, agricultural, arid, hyper-arid, paddy, peat) at elevated temperature and measured the residual activity at 25 degrees C after different incubation times. We found that at least part of the soil hydrogenase is deactivated irreversibly already at relatively low temperatures (>30 degrees C) and short exposure times (>10 min) and that the deactivation was more pronounced in soil from cold versus hot climate. The deactivation kinetics could be fitted to a biexponential model, but were complex with respect to soil type and deactivation temperature. The results show that new hydrogenase activity has to be generated in the soil to compensate for activity loss by diurnal and seasonally increased temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Three stages in the history of land reclamation in the Netherlands
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
LA English
DT Article
DE Netherlands; drainage; reclamation; Lake Haarlem; Zuiderzee; IJsselmeer
AB The Netherlands has faced unique water management challenges. Much of the western part of this country is covered by compressible peat or clay soils. Historic land use practices resulted in loss, decay, and consolidation of these soils and subsequent land subsidence. This, along with the sea level rise, tides, and storms, resulted in a country where one-third of the land lies below mean sea level and without dunes, dikes, and pumps, 65% would be under water at high tide.
   Over many centuries the Dutch have fought against this loss of land. Three stages in the historical development of land drainage and reclamation activities are presented.
   The first stage was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when many lakes north of Amsterdam were drained and reclaimed for agricultural use. Windmills were used to pump these lakes dry. Next, in the nineteenth century, Lake Haarlem became the largest lake drained in the Netherlands and the one of the first to be drained using steam-powered pumps alone. Finally, in the twentieth century the Zuiderzee tidal estuary was drained and reclaimed, resulting in an additional 1650 km(2) of new land for agriculture, recreation, and urban expansion.

AB The paper deals with the implementation of a levelling and Global Positioning System (GPS) network to control land subsidence in the coastal area north of the Venice Lagoon. About 480 km of levelling lines with 527 benchmarks, 45 of which suited for Differential GPS measurements, were established in 2004. A complete survey of the net was carried out in 2004 soon after its establishment. The 2004 records have been compared with previous scattered data obtained by the use of levelling surveys, DGPS and SAR interferometry. The results show a trend in land settlement that increases from the lagoon margin to the north and jeopardize the Venice coastland. Groundwater withdrawals for domestic, agricultural, and health spas uses, peat oxidation of reclaimed marshlands for farming, natural consolidation of the Holocene deposits, and tectonics of the pre-Quaternary basement are the causes of land subsidence in the study area. Since most of the area lies below the mean sea level and on account of the expected sea level rise due to global change, a detailed monitoring of land displacements in the near future will be of paramount importance to plan necessary works for coastland protection.

AB The Netherlands are a small, low-lying delta in W. Europe (42 000 km 2;50degrees-54degrees N; 3degrees-8degrees E), mainly consisting of alluvial deposits from the North Sea and from the large rivers Rhine and Meuse. The country was 'created by man'. The conversion of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems into drained agricultural land was a major cultural operation over the past 1000 years. Roughly 55% of the country's surface area is still agricultural land. Some decades ago, The Netherlands' landscape was characterised by an armoured coastline and bridled estuaries, a drastically reduced area of saline and freshwater marshes, fully regulated rivers and streams, and numerous artificial lakes. The aquatic ecosystems beyond the influence of the large rivers, the Pleistocene raised bogs and moor lands, have almost been completely annihilated in the past. Acidification and eutrophication led to the deterioration of the remaining softwater lake vegetation. Last but not least, an artificial drainage system was constructed, leading to an unnatural water table all over the country, high in summer, low in winter. Only very recently, some 25 years ago, the tide has been turned and ecological rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed ecosystems are in full swing now, enhanced by the European Union policy to set aside agricultural land in the Netherlands in favour of the development of 'nature'. The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands is given. Starting from the conceptual basis of restoration ecology, the successes and failures of hundreds of restoration projects are given. Numerous successful projects are mentioned. In general, ecological restoration endeavours are greatly benefiting from progressive experience in the course of the years. Failures mainly occur by insufficient application of physical, chemical or ecological principles. The spontaneous colonisation by plants and animals, following habitat reconstruction, is preferred. But sometimes the re-introduction of keystone species (e.g. eelgrass; salmon; beaver) is necessary in case the potential habitats are isolated or fragmented, or when a seed bank is lacking, thus not allowing viable populations to develop. Re-introduction of traditional management techniques (e. g. mowing without fertilisation; low intensity grazing) is important to rehabilitate the semi-natural and cultural landscapes, so characteristic for the Netherlands. For aquatic ecosystems proper (estuaries, rivers, streams, larger lakes) the rule of thumb is that re-establishment of the abiotic habitat conditions is a pre-requisite for the return of the target species. This implies rehabilitation of former hydrological end geomorphological conditions, and an increase in spatial heterogeneity. The 'bottom-up' technique of lake restoration, viz. reduction in nutrient loadings, and removal of nutrient-rich organic sediment, is the preferred strategy. The 'top-down' approach of curing eutrophicated ecosystems, that is drastic reduction of fish stock, mainly bream, and introduction of carnivorous fish, may be considered as complementary. For semi-aquatic ecosystems (river-fed and rain-fed peat moors, brook valleys, coastal dune slacks) it also counts that the abiotic constraints should be lifted, but here the species-oriented conservation strategy, the enhancement of the recovery of characteristic plant and animal species
   is mainly followed. An important pre-requisite for the rehabilitation of the original natural or semi-natural vegetation is the presence of viable seed bank.
   Restoration of salt-marsh vegetation has to deal with a short-lived persistent seed bank, which means that transport of seeds by water currents is important. Isolated softwater ecosystems may rely on the long-lived seeds of the aquatic macrophytes. The paper ends with some notes on the predictability of the outcome of ecological restoration measures and the societal position of restoration ecology as a science. Scientists hold different views on the predictability of restoration measures. A fact is that the predictability of ecosystem development increases, with increasing knowledge of the underlying environmental processes.

AB Relationship between the phenolics content and the decomposition rate of Carex nigra, Scirpus sylvaticus, Phalaris arundinacea and Phragmites australis was evaluated in this study. The study was aimed at the selection of plants growing in the Czech Republic, that can be used for constructed wetlands treating agricultural runoff and that can also contribute to carbon sequestration. Plant decomposition was studied using the litterbag experiments lasting 365 days. One set of samples (each plant from three various location in four replicates) were taken after 81, 173, 301 and 365 days and decomposition rate was evaluated. The phenolics concentrations in aboveground biomass of selected macrophytes were varied in narrow range from 6.73 +/- 1.26 g.kg(-1) (leaves of P. arundinacea) to 14.09 +/- 3.52 g.kg(-1) (C. nigra). On the other hand, decomposition rate significantly varied among different plants and different plan parts as well. The close relationship between the concentrations of phenolics and decomposition rates was found for C. nigra, S. sylvaticus and leaves of P. arundinacea and P. australis in this study - the higher the phenolics concentration, the lower decomposition rate. The study also revealed a very strong relationship between total phenolics/total nitrogen ratio in the biomass, and therefore, the plants with high phenolics content would be more efficient in carbon sequestration. It is necessary to extend the research with the aim to find other plants naturally occurring in the Czech Republic characterized by high concentration of phenolics in the aboveground biomass, thus, having the potential of slow decomposition and high carbon sequestration.

AB The Salton Sea in California is an important habitat for fish and waterfowl. Its ecosystem is threatened due to diminishing water supplies and increasing. salinity. An alternative source of water to support species conservation habitat may be obtained from local rivers (e.g., Alamo or New Rivers), provided that a wetland treatment system can be developed to remove selenium (Se), fertilizer nutrients, and other contaminants. Here, we used mesocosms to evaluate a number of potential design options (e.g., plant species selection, sediment composition and arrangement, forced aeration, organic amendments, etc.) to improve the efficiency of Se removal using treatment wetlands. Our results show that, of five different substrate arrangements tested for Se removal, the most efficient was obtained for cattails growing in a substrate of cattail litter overlying sand and peat moss sediment (water column Se was reduced from 15 mu g Se/L to <0.1 mu g Se/L in 72 h). The addition of organic amendments in the form of alfalfa hay or alfalfa meal was also helpful in lowering Se levels. These results suggest that it may be possible to design constructed wetland water treatment systems capable of reducing Se concentrations in river water to values below 1 mu g Se/L.

AB A strain-specific molecular marker enabling the detection and tracking of the biological control agent Bacillus subtilis 101, when released into the environment, was developed. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was used to differentiate this from other B. subtilis strains. A differentially amplified fragment obtained from RAPD profiles was sequenced and characterized as sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, and four primer pairs were designed and evaluated for their specificity towards this strain. The sensibility of the selected SCAR primer pair was evaluated by qualitative PCR and Southern blotting, and the detection limit was assessed around 10(2) CFU (g dry wt soil)(-1), thus providing a reliable tool for the traceability of this B. subtilis strain in greenhouse or field trials. A plating assay coupled to PCR with the SCAR primer pair was then used as a detection method in microcosm experiments for monitoring the population of B. subtilis 101 in the rhizosphere of tomato, grown under two different soil conditions, i.e. nonsterile peat-based substrate and sandy-loam agricultural soil, respectively. The data of rhizosphere colonization indicated that the soil conditions significantly affected the rhizosphere establishment of strain 101.

AB The ectomycorrhizal fungi symbiosis with native florestal essences may be an alternative to revegetation of metal contaminated soils. The aim of this work was to determine canafistula seedlings behavior, inoculated to ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil with copper excess. The trial was conducted in greenhouse conditions. The ectomycorrhizal fungi used was Pisolithus microcarpus UFSC Pt116, cultivated on peat-vermiculite substrate (3: 1). The canafistula seedlings were developed in washed sand and transplanted, when showed two definitive leaves. Vase of 1L with 1 kg of soil were used as experimental unit. The inoculation was accomplished in the seedlings transplant, added 2g of inoculates for experimental unit. The experimental design was entirely casual in bi factorial scheme (2 x 4) qualitative in A, with and without fungi inoculum and quantitative in D being the control addition of 150 mg Kg(-1), 300 mg Kg(-1) and 450 mg Kg(-1) of copper (CuSO4), with seven repetitions. Plant height, colon diameter, dry matter, copper content, mycorrhizal colonization percentage, superficial roots area and roots length were assessed. The increase of soil copper levels reduced roots length, specific superficial roots area, height and plant diameter of canafistula. Canafistula seedlings inoculated to ectomycorrhizal fungi showed low cooper amounts in their tissue and copper absortion reduced in high copper doses.

AB Small-scale landscape elements, such as ditch banks are an important remaining source of biodiversity in many agricultural landscapes, including the Western Peat District in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, plant species richness is declining even in these habitats. To understand the factors threatening biodiversity, we studied demographic traits (occupancy, trend, colonisation and extinction) for a large number of plant species, in a 25-year long data set. We developed a method to investigate the relative importance of colonisation and extinction for species increase and decrease in multi-species assemblages. We show that colonisation has been more important for determining species trends than extinction. Decreasing species were small and characterised by low nutrient tolerance and high light requirements, indicating that competitive. ability influences species trends. The mechanism by which high nutrient levels reduce plant diversity appears to be closely related to colonisation (germination and seedling establishment). Local management should therefore continue to focus on nutrient reduction and the creation of regeneration sites. Yet, these measures will be insufficient for restoring species richness since isolation also hampers species increase. Therefore, to maximise the effects of local management, additional regional management solutions are required to improve seed dispersal for example, from nature reserves.

AB The possibility of effective control of selected dams in the Note Bystra river is analyzed. Such a control is expected to permit inundation of selected arable areas, e.g., peat grasslands, to avoid flooding of the city of Czarnkow and the terrains located downstream. The chosen case study is the reach of the Note River between the dams Pianowka-Mikolajewo-Rosko. The analysis was made on the basis of simulations of the flow and regulation of dams in flood conditions. The flow peaks of hypothetical flood waves were designed according to the directions of the ISOK project (Informatyczny System Osony Kraju przed nadzwyczajnymi zagroeniami-IT System of the Country's Protection Against Extreme Hazards) as the maximum flows over 10-years (p = 10%), 100-years (p = 1%), and 500-years (p = 0.2%). The obtained results are presented as longitudinal profiles of the water surface, maps of inundated areas and maps of inundated soils. The main conclusion is that the robust control of dams reduces the peak of flow during flood wave propagation and forces inundation of the a priori selected areas. It helps to decrease the spatial range of the flood hazard and significantly reduces risk related to floods.

AB This study employed image enhancement for LANDSAT TM and ALOS imagery to monitor the changing status of coastal resources from 2001 to 2011, object-based classification of high-resolution THEOS imagery to extract fish cage culture sites and interpolation methods to determine marine environmental quality in 2011 in the northern part of Phu Quoc Island. There were five classes in the study site: natural forest, Melaleuca forest, agriculture, peat and built-up areas. Agricultural land and Melaleuca forest changing into built-up areas constituted approximately 51.13% of the total area changing. The benthic seagrass habitat increased dramatically from 2001 to the end of 2010. Besides, marine culture has been concerned to cage culture which is one of the sources directly affecting aquatic life and water quality in coastal environment. Cage culture locations were detected using high-resolution imagery as THEOS data for image fusion and Object-based Image Analysis methods. Water quality criteria including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined by interpolation method, and the spatial distribution of these parameters showed a concentration in the study area in the range from 0.17 to 0.49 mg/L, 0.012 to 0.073 mg/L and 0.26 to 1.046 g/L, respectively.

AB Denitrifying prokaryotes are phylogenetically and functionally diverse. Little is known about the relationship between soil denitrifier community composition and functional traits. We extracted bacterial cells from three cultivated peat soils with contrasting native pH by density gradient centrifugation and investigated their kinetics of oxygen depletion and NO2 -, NO, N2O and N2 accumulation during initially hypoxic batch incubations (0.51 mu M O2) in minimal medium buffered at either pH 5.4 or 7.1 (2 mM glutamate, 2 mM NO3 -). The three communities differed strikingly in NO2 - accumulation and transient N2O accumulation at the two pH levels, whereas NO peak concentrations (2453 nM) were similar across all communities and pH treatments. The results confirm that the communities represent different denitrification regulatory phenotypes, as indicated by previous denitrification bioassays with nonbuffered slurries of the same three soils. The composition of the extracted cells resembled that of the parent soils (PCR-TRFLP analyses of 16S rRNA genes, nirK, nirS and nosZ), which were found to differ profoundly in their genetic composition (Braker et al., ). Together, this suggests that direct pH response of denitrification depends on denitrifier community composition, with implications for the propensity of soils to emit N2O to the atmosphere.

DE Environmental tax; Life cycle analysis; Environmental input-output
   analysis
AB The main aim of this work is to define an environmental tax on products based on their carbon footprint. We examine the relevance of life cycle analysis (LCA) and environmentally extended input-output analysis (EIO) as methodological tools for identifying the emission intensities on which the tax is based. The price effects of the tax and the policy implications of considering non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) are also analyzed. The results from the case study on pulp production show that the environmental tax rate based on LCA (1.8%) is higher than both EIO approaches (0.8 and 1.4% for product and industry, respectively), but they are of the same order of magnitude. Although LCA is more product specific and provides a more detailed analysis, we recommend EIO as a more relevant approach to applying an economy-wide environmental tax. If an environmental tax were applied to non-CO2 GHG instead to CO2 alone, the tax would greatly affects sectors such as agriculture, mining of coal, extraction of peat, and food. Therefore, it is worthwhile for policy-makers to pay attention to the implications of considering either a CO2 tax or a global GHG emissions tax in order to make their policy measures effective and meaningful.

AB Integrated buffer zones (IBZ) are novel mitigation measures designed to decrease the loading of nitrogen (N) transported by subsurface drainage systems from agricultural fields to streams. In IBZ, drainage water flows into a pond with free water surface followed by an inundated, vegetated filterbed. This design provides an environment favorable for denitrification and thus a decrease in nitrate concentration is expected as water flow through the IBZ. However, due to the establishment of anaerobic conditions, there is a risk for increasing emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). In this year-long study, we evaluated the N removal efficiency along with the risk of N2O and CH4 emissions from two pilot-scale IBZs (IBZ1 and 2). The two IBZs had very different yearly removal efficiencies, amounting to 29% and 71% of the total N load at IBZ1 and 2, respectively. This was probably due to differences in infiltration rates to the filterbed, which was 22% and 81% of the incoming water at IBZ1 and 2, respectively. The site (IBZ2) with the highest removal efficiency was a net N2O sink, while 0.9% of the removed nitrate was emitted as N2O at IBZ1. Both IBZs were net sources of CH4 but with different pathways of emission. In IBZ1 CH4 was mainly lost directly to the atmosphere, while waterborne losses dominated in IBZ2. In conclusion, the IBZs were effective in removing N three years after establishment, and although the IBZs acted as greenhouse gas sources, especially due to CH4, the emissions were comparable to those of natural wetlands and other drainage transport mitigation measures.

AB Aspergillus sp. is an extremely resilient species that can be found everywhere in the environment and is present abundantly in water and soil. The defining characteristic of Aspergillus sp. is their extensive hyphal network which enable them to survive anywhere, even in very harsh conditions. This study was carried out to isolate the filamentous fungi from peat soil of animal agricultural farm and characterise them based on their morphological and molecular characteristics. Growth rate of each isolated fungi was also evaluated in order to determine the period of maturity for each fungi. Soil samples were collected, weighed and then dissolved in sterile distilled water. The samples were serially diluted and spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) for isolation. Different isolated colonies that were morphologically different from each plate was purified and sub-cultured onto new media for macroscopic and microscopic identifications. For molecular identification, a conventional technique was used in genomic DNA extraction of filamentous fungi due to their thick cell wall and presence of surface proteins protecting the fungus. These characteristics make it difficult to harvest the genomic DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using internal transcribed spacer primers; ITS1 (forward) and ITS4 (reverse). The morphological identification and molecular technique showed that majority of these isolated fungi are Aspergillus sp.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the historical change in sedimentation rates in lakes that have been impacted by river regulation and agricultural activities in the Ishikari River floodplain. We dated sediment cores using caesium-137 (Cs-137) dating and tephrochronology, and we estimated sediment sources from Cs-137 concentrations in the topsoil of representative land covers. We found that, between 1739 and 1963, the distance between the lake and the main river channel and whether or not the lake was connected to the river affected the sedimentation rates. After 1963, agricultural drainage systems were established in the Ishikari River floodplain. The average sedimentation rate before and after the construction of drainage ditches varied between 1-66 and 87-301 mg cm(-2) a(-1), respectively. The increase in the sedimentation rate after 1963 was caused by the construction of a number of drainage networks, as well as extensive cultivation activity and/or fragmentation of the swamp buffers surrounding the lakes. The Cs-137 activities at the surfaces of the lake as well as the catchment-derived Cs-137 contributions and Cs-137 inventory in the lake profiles were used to examine the sediment influx from the various drainage areas after the establishment of the drainage system. Our results indicate that the majority of the lake sediments were derived from cultivated areas, and therefore the catchment-derived Cs-137 contribution in the lakes was strongly correlated with the sedimentation rate. The Cs-137 inventory across all of the lake profiles was also significantly greater than the atmospheric fallout. We identified a negative correlation between the Cs-137 lake profile inventory and the sedimentation rate. This is because the sediment originating from the drainage areas contained low Cs-137 concentrations, which diluted the overall concentration of Cs-137 in the lake sediment.

AB The increasing use of heavy metals, synthetic dyes and pesticides is a major environmental concern. Wastewaters containing heavy metals and dyes, extensively released from small and large scale industries enter excessively into food chains resulting in mutagenesis, carcinogenicity and serious health impairments in living systems. The arrays of technologies are implemented to date to remediate both inorganic and organic contaminants from wastewaters. Among which, adsorption is the most attractive method as it employs eco-friendly, sustainable and cost-effective biomaterials. Use of bioadsorbents is advantageous over the conventional adsorbents. Clay, chitin, peat, microbial biomass and agricultural wastes are commonly used bioadsorbants. These bioadsorbents are extensively used for elimination of dyes, heavy metals, adsorption of toxic industrial effluents, removal of fertilizers/pesticides, atmospheric pollutants and nuclear waste from the environment. The current review presents state of the art knowledge on various types of biosorbents, their uses, and mechanism of action. Various strategies to enhance the efficiency of bioadsorbents and physicochemical conditions to remediate dyes and heavy metals from waste streams are also incorporated in this review. Use of nano-bioadsorbents in industries to minimize the hazardous effect of solid and liquid waste has also been discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A population model for the black tern Chlidonias niger in West-Europe
SO JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY

DE black tern; population model; adult survival; landscape stratification;
   conservation
AB Based on empiric data of breeding success and accurate number trends in The Netherlands, a population model for the black tern was constructed. This model is based on Leslie matrices. Reproductive parameters from the four most important landscape types (river landscape, agricultural grasslands, peat marsh and heath land/moors) are used as model input. Highly accurate national population trend data were used to obtain the best (least square) estimate of overall adult and subadult survival (resp. 0.849 and 0.595). Estimating survival parameters in this way might be useful for threatened (bird) species, especially if catching and ringing is difficult or less desired from a conservation perspective. The model shows the actual importance of the river landscape as the main source for reproductive output of the Dutch black tern population. The prediction model was subsequently used to test different conservation strategies for the Dutch black tern population. Conservation strategies ranged from a null scenario (no change in conservation effort) to in- or decreasing the number of rafts in the most productive landscape (river landscape) to a scenario where breeding success is improved recently in agricultural grasslands via minimizing disturbance. For all scenarios, the model predicts a slow to rapid population increase in the Dutch black tern population after 10-20 years. Improving breeding success in agricultural grasslands habitat has the highest added value.

AB The accumulation of phosphorus (P) in the bottom sediment of field drainage ditches poses a threat to the ecology both of the ditch water and downstream water courses. We investigated the amounts, forms and internal loading of sediment-bound P along two drainage ditches that regulate water levels in a basin fen (similar to 200 ha) supporting a mixture of restored wetland and drained agricultural fields. Water levels in the Lady's Drove Rhyne are currently managed to enhance the biodiversity of the wetland (Catcott Lows Reserve - an area formerly cultivated for arable crop production); whereas, the East Ditch is managed to drain adjoining land that remains under arable and livestock production.
   Laboratory-based chemical fractionation schemes were used to characterise the forms and potential mobility of the sediment-bound P. whilst pore-water equilibrators were employed in situ to evaluate the diffusive flux of P through the sediment-water column, and to characterise the corresponding redox conditions. Along both ditches, sediment pore-water profiles indicated conditions ranging from weakly to very reducing conditions with increasing depth, and net fluxes of P from the sediment to overlying water. P flux values ranged from 033 to 1.30 mg m(-2) day(-1). Both the degree of P saturation (DPS) of the sediment and NaOH extractable (Fe/Al-bound) P correlated significantly (P<0.05) with P flux. Both in the wetland and agricultural ditches, by far the highest values for P flux were recorded at sites closest to points of drainage water entry from the corresponding, adjoining land. Although the P flux data were obtained from only a single sampling event, this study highlights the contribution of historical as well as ongoing agricultural land use on the sustained elevated P status of ditch sediments in lowland catchments.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in freshwater biogeochemistry. To investigate the influence of catchment character on the quality and quantity of DOM in freshwaters, 45 sampling sites draining subcatchments of contrasting soil type, hydrology, and land cover within one large upland-dominated and one large lowland-dominated catchment were sampled over a 1-yr period. Dominant land cover in each subcatchment included: arable and horticultural, blanket peatland, coniferous woodland, and improved, unimproved, acid, and calcareous grasslands. The composition of the C, N, and P pool was determined as a function of the inorganic nutrient species (NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, and PO43-) and dissolved organic nutrient (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], and dissolved organic phosphorus [DOP]) concentrations. DOM quality was assessed by calculation of the molar DOC : DON and DOC : DOP ratios and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)). In catchments with little anthropogenic nutrient inputs, DON and DOP typically composed > 80% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentrations. By contrast, in heavily impacted agricultural catchments DON and DOP typically comprised 5-15% of TDN and 10-25% of TDP concentrations. Significant differences in DOC : DON and DOC : DOP ratios were observed between land cover class with significant correlations observed between both the DOC : DON and DOC : DOP molar ratios and SUVA(254) (r(s) = 0.88 and 0.84, respectively). Analysis also demonstrated a significant correlation between soil C : N ratio and instream DOC : DON/DOP (r(s) = 0.79 and 0.71, respectively). We infer from this that soil properties, specifically the C : N ratio of the soil organic matter pool, has a significant influence on the composition of DOM in streams draining through these landscapes.

AB QuestionsCan drainage ditches in agricultural marsh grassland provide a suitable habitat for the persistence of fen meadow species? How does the ditch margin vegetation develop as a function of regular dredging? Is ornithologically oriented management also beneficial for plant biodiversity?
   LocationRiparian marshes, Eider-Treene-Sorge lowland, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.
   MethodsWe performed vegetation surveys of drainage ditches along with their water body, slope and margin structures annually for 3years. The data were analysed with respect to date and means of ditch dredging. In addition, we recorded vegetation of the surrounding agricultural grassland, measured nutrient status of the soil and the water body and sampled seed bank of the ditch slopes. We used ANOVA and multivariate methods to describe the development of the ditch vegetation and the persistence of target meadow species.
   ResultsVegetation re-development of ditch margins proceeds quite rapidly after disturbance from dredging. Dominance of mudbank species was observed only in the first year, followed by an increase of reed species and reduction of phytodiversity. Target species of wet meadow communities reach highest abundance in the second and third year and build a significant seed bank before being suppressed by reeds.
   ConclusionsIn heavily eutrophicated, intensively used marsh grassland, regularly disturbed ditch margins are important secondary habitats for pioneer and subdominant wetland species, which have nearly disappeared in a larger area. Current management cycles of ditch dredging every 3-4years comply with the successional development, allowing the mudbank and wet meadow species to persist in the vegetation and seed bank. In contrast to the frequency, the form of dredging (ditch profile), which is crucial for bird protection, plays a minor role for plants. We recommend moderate disturbance (mowing of ditch margins) to suppress strong competitors in the years between dredging for additional support to target plant species.

ID SOIL CARBON STOCKS; MANAGEMENT
AB In 2014 temperate zone emission factor revisions were published in the IPCC Wetlands Supplement. Default values for direct CO2 emissions of artificially drained organic soils were increased by a factor of 1.6 for cropland sites and by factors ranging from 14 to 24 for grassland sites. This highlights the role of drained organic soils as emission hotspots and makes their rewetting more attractive as climate change mitigation measures. Drainage emissions of humic soils are lower on a per hectare basis and not covered by IPCC default values. However, drainage of great areas can turn them into nationally relevant emission sources. National policy making that recognizes the importance of preserving organic and humic soils' carbon stock requires data that is not readily available. Taking Ireland as a case study, this article demonstrates how a dataset of policy relevant information can be generated. Total area of histic and humic soils drained for agriculture, resulting greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation potential were assessed. For emissions from histic soils, calculations were based on IPCC emission factors, for humic soils, a modified version of the ECOSSE model was used. Results indicated 370,000 ha of histic and 426,000 ha of humic soils under drained agricultural land use in Ireland (8% and 9% of total farmed area). Calculated annual drainage emissions were 8.7 Tg CO(2)e from histic and 1.8 Tg CO(2)e from humic soils (equal to 56% of Ireland's agricultural emissions in 2014, excluding emissions from land use). If half the area of drained histic soils was rewetted, annual saving would amount to 3.2 Tg CO(2)e. If on half of the deep drained, nutrient rich grasslands drainage spacing was decreased to control the average water table at 25 cm or higher, annual savings would amount to 0.4 Tg CO(2)e.

AB Naturally-occurring wetlands perform such functions as flood control, pollution filtration, nutrient recycling, sediment accretion, groundwater recharge and water supply, erosion control, and plant and wildlife preservation. A large concentration of wetlands is located in Eastern Europe. A significant amount of Eastern European wetlands has been converted to agricultural use in the past, and remaining wetlands are subject to agricultural drainage. Drained wetlands are used as prime agriculture lands for a variety of food crops. Other agricultural uses of wetlands range from growing Phragmites australis (common reed) for thatch and livestock feed, to collecting peat for heating and cooking fuel. Altered hydrologic regimes due to global climate change could further exacerbate encroachment of agricultural land use into wetlands.
   The vulnerability and adaptation studies of the U.S. Country Studies Program are used to analyze where climate change impacts to agriculture may likewise impact wetland;areas. Scenarios indicate higher temperatures and greater evapotranspiration altering the hydrologic regime such that freshwater wetlands are potentially vulnerable in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Russia, and that coastal wetlands are at risk in Estonia. Runoff is identified as a key hydrological parameter affecting wetland function. Since wetland losses may increase as a result of climate-change-induced impacts to agriculture, precautionary management options are reviewed, such as establishing buffer areas, promoting sustainable uses of wetlands, and restoration of farmed or mined wetland areas. These options may reduce the extent of negative agricultural impacts on wetlands due to global climate change.

AB Chelate-induced remediation has been proposed as an effective tool for the extraction of lead(Pb)from contaminated soils by plants. However, side-effects, mainly mobilization and leaching of Pb, raise environmental concerns. Biodegradable, synthetic organic chelate ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS), and commonly used ethylenedimanetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were used for induced phytoextraction with a test plant Brassica rapa and in situ washing of soil contaminated with 1350 mg/kg of Pb. Horizontal permeable barriers were placed 20 cm deep in soil columns and tested for their ability to prevent leaching of Pb. The reactive materials in the barriers were nutrient enriched vermiculite, peat or agricultural hydrogel, and apatite. EDTA and EDDS addition increased Pb concentrations in the test plant by 158 and 89 times compared to the control, to 817 and 464 mg/kg, respectively. In EDTA treatments, approximately 25% or more of total initial soil Pb was leached in single cycle of chelate addition. In EDDS treatments, 20% of the initial Pb was leached from columns with no barrier, while barriers with vermiculite or hydrogel and apatite decreased leaching by more than 60 times, to 0.35%. 11.6% of total initial Pb was washed from the soil above the barrier with vermiculite and apatite, where almost all leached Pb was accumulated. Results indicate that use of biodegradable chelate EDDS and permeable barriers may lead to environmentally safe induced Pb phytoextraction and in situ washing of Pb.

AB Certain organic compounds, including biphenyl and salicylic acid, stimulate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) degradation by microorganisms in some environments. However, the usefulness of these amendments for improving PCB removal by microorganisms from diverse habitats has not been extensively explored. This study evaluated the effects of biphenyl, salicylic acid, and glucose on changes in aerobic PCB removal and bacterial communities from an agricultural soil, a wetland peat soil, a river sediment, and a mixture of these samples. PCB removal patterns were significantly different between soils and sediments amended with carbon compounds: (i) terrestrial soil microorganisms removed more PCBs than river sediment microorganisms, particularly with regard to PCBs with >4 chlorine substituents, (ii) glucose-supplemented, agricultural soil microorganisms removed more hexachlorobiphenyl than unsupplemented samples, (iii) biphenyl-supplemented, river sediment microorganisms removed more di- and tri-chlorobiphenyls than unamended samples. Carbon amendments also caused unique shifts in soil and sediment bacterial communities, as determined by specific changes in bacterial 16S rRNA denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis banding patterns. These results indicate that organic carbon amendments had site-specific effects on bacterial populations and PCB removal. Further work is needed to more accurately characterize PCB degrading communities and functional gene expression in diverse types of environments to better understand how they respond to bioremediation treatments.

AB The current understanding of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation within biomass burning (BB) plumes is limited by the incomplete identification and quantification of the non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) emitted from such fires. Gaseous organic compounds were collected on sorbent cartridges during laboratory burns as part of the fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-4) and analyzed by two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-ToFMS). The sensitivity and resolving power of GC x GC-ToFMS allowed the acquisition of the most extensive data set of BB NMOCs to date, with measurements for 708 positively or tentatively identified compounds. Estimated emission factors (EFs) are presented for these compounds for burns of six different vegetative fuels, including conifer branches, grasses, agricultural residue, and peat. The number of compounds meeting the peak selection criteria ranged from 129 to 474 among individual burns, and included extensive isomer groups. For example, 38 monoterpene isomers were observed in the emissions from coniferous fuels; the isomeric ratios were found to be consistent with those reported in relevant essential oils, suggesting that the composition of such oils may be very useful when predicting fuel-dependent terpene emissions. Further, 11 sesquiterpenes were detected and tentatively identified, providing the first reported speciation of sesquiterpenes in gas-phase BB emissions. The calculated EFs for all measured compounds are compared and discussed in the context of potential SOA formation.

AB The blending of drainage with water of low electrical conductivity and the sequential reuse of the drainage water are innovative technologies to manage salts in agricultural drainage. Plants of Cucumis melo were grown in coir grow bags, and Rosmarinus officinalis and Cacti spp. were grown in pots with a mixture of sphagnum peat-moss and perlite. In order to assess the effect and evolution over time of these water treatments on plant growth and water management and removal of nutrients, three water treatments were applied over a period of eight weeks. These were: (1) standard nutrient solution; (2) blended water treatment (drainage water blended with water of low electrical conductivity (EC)) and (3) sequential reuse of drainage water treatment. During the experimental growing period, samples of water supplies and drainages generated in each water treatment were collected weekly and from these data water volume and nutrient loads were calculated. At the end of the experiment, leaf fresh weight of rosemary plants decreased under the fertigation with the blended and sequential reuse water treatments. Nevertheless, the application of blended and sequentially reused water allowed for the saving of significant amounts of water and nutrients in comparison to the standard nutrient solution treatment. Considering these advantages, we strongly recommend the setting-up of these water treatments in areas with water scarcity such as in the Mediterranean Basin.

DE Wadden Sea; coastal wetlands; man-made landscape; man and nature;
   history
AB Humans have been present in the Wadden Sea area since the end of the last ice age, but their perception of and interference with their marine environment has changed over time. In this paper, I will give an overview on the interactions between man and nature since the 6th millennium B.C., on the opportunities for human settlement as well as on restrictions posed by the maritime environment. Only after many centuries of passive adaptation did the local farming population begin to modify their immediate surroundings. They made a living as cattle breeders, supplemented this with fishing, hunting, weaving, salt production and peat digging. Efforts to transform the agricultural landscape did not start before the 11th century A.D., when the first dikes and canals were constructed. The consequences were profound. By the end of the Middle Ages, the dikes had become totally indispensable. The land under cultivation was perceived as a sacred inner world, conflicting sharply with the marine environment outside its flood-gates. This essentially dichotomous world-view held out until the 19th and early 20th centuries. As we will see, however, the actual settlement history had been marked by various gains and losses, by successes as well as by setbacks. Not only did humans destroy valuable natural resources, but they also created alternative habitats for novel species. I conclude that the initial tendency towards increasing natural and cultural diversity has been reversed during the last few centuries. Yet, mounting conservationist concerns may cause a turning-point.

AB Global nitrogen fixation contributes 413 Tg of reactive nitrogen (N-r) to terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually of which anthropogenic activities are responsible for half, 210 Tg N. The majority of the transformations of anthropogenic Nr are on land (240 Tg N yr(-1)) within soils and vegetation where reduced Nr contributes most of the input through the use of fertilizer nitrogen in agriculture. Leakages from the use of fertilizer Nr contribute to nitrate (NO3-) in drainage waters from agricultural land and emissions of trace N-r compounds to the atmosphere. Emissions, mainly of ammonia (NH3) from land together with combustion related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), contribute 100 Tg N yr(-1) to the atmosphere, which are transported between countries and processed within the atmosphere, generating secondary pollutants, including ozone and other photochemical oxidants and aerosols, especially ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium sulfate (NH4)(2)SO4. Leaching and riverine transport of NO3 contribute 40-70 Tg N yr(-1) to coastal waters and the open ocean, which together with the 30 Tg input to oceans from atmospheric deposition combine with marine biological nitrogen fixation (140 TgN yr(-1)) to double the ocean processing of Nr. Some of the marine Nr is buried in sediments, the remainder being denitrified back to the atmosphere as N-2 or N2O. The marine processing is of a similar magnitude to that in terrestrial soils and vegetation, but has a larger fraction of natural origin. The lifetime of N-r in the atmosphere, with the exception of N2O, is only a few weeks, while in terrestrial ecosystems, with the exception of peatlands (where it can be 102-103 years), the lifetime is a few decades. In the ocean, the lifetime of Nr is less well known but seems to be longer than in terrestrial ecosystems and may represent an important long-term source of N2O that will respond very slowly to control measures on the sources of Nr from which it is produced.

AB A pilot experimental field combining rewetting of reclaimed peaty soils and water phyto-treatment was set up in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin (Tuscany, Italy) to reduce the water eutrophication and peat degradation caused by almost a century of drainage-based agricultural use.
   In this paper, we investigated the restoration process occurring consequently to the conversion of a drained area in a natural wetland system (NWS) (the partial top soil removal, the realization of a perimeter levee to contain the waters, the rewetting with the drainage waters coming from the of surrounding cultivated areas) and the capability of the spontaneous vegetation to catch nutrients acting as a vegetation filter.
   To follow the restoration process over time (2012-2016), we used a mixed approach merging phytosociological surveys with ortophotos taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). During the last year of observation (2016), we performed destructive sampling on the most widespread plant communities in the area (Phragmites australis and Myriophyllum aquaticum community) to quantify the biomass production and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus.
   Stands of Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. yielded more than Myriophyllum aquaticum (Veil.) Verdc. (4.94 kg m-2 vs 1.08 kg m-2). M. aquaticum showed higher nutrient contents (2.04% of N and 0.35% of P), however P. australis was able to take up more nutrients within the NWS because of its larger cover and productivity.
   In the perspective of maximizing the plant development and consequently the amount of nutrients extracted from treated waters, the authors suggest 4-5 year-long-harvesting turns, better occurring in spring-summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphate (P-i) release due to Fe-III oxide dissolution is well documented for soils undergoing reduction. The P-i sorption properties of soils in anoxic conditions are, however, still under consideration, In this investigation, P-i sorption to strictly anoxic soils was compared with oxic conditions to assess the potential of lowland soils to function as traps for P-i when flooded with drainage water. Batch sorption experiments were performed on seven minerogenic soils. Sorption to the anoxic soils was conducted after anoxic incubation, resulting in reduction of 36 to 93% of the dithionite-extractable Fe-III (Fe-BD) - Langmuir fitted P-i sorption isotherms showed a P-i release of up to 1.1 mmol kg(-1) in six soils when P-i concentrations in the matrix (P-sol) were lower than 10 mu M. Phosphate desorption was attributed to dissolution of amorphous iron oxides, and higher pH under anoxic conditions. The point of zero net sorption (EPC0) increased 2- to 10-fold on reduction. Five soils showed higher P-i sorption capacities in the anoxic than in the oxic state at higher P-sol concentrations. Solubility, calculations indicated that Precipitation of vivianite or similar Fe-II phosphates may have caused the higher sorption capacities. Use of maximum sorption capacity (S-max) is therefore misleading as a measure of P-i sorption at low P-sol concentrations. The results demonstrate that none of the strongly anoxic soils, irrespective of the initial Fe-III oxide content, the P saturation, and the degree of Fe-III oxide reduction, could retain P-i at natural P-sol concentrations in agricultural drainage water.

AB Ground water and Surface water interactions are of fundamental importance for the biogeochemical processes governing phosphorus (P) dynamics in riparian buffers. The four most important conceptual hydrological pathways for P losses from and P retention in riparian buffers are reviewed in this paper: (i) The diffuse flow path with ground water flow through the riparian aquifer, (ii) the overland flow path across the riparian buffer with water coming from adjacent agricultural fields, (iii) irrigation of the riparian buffer with tile drainage water from agricultural fields where disconnected tile drains irrigate the riparian buffer, and (iv) inundation of the riparian buffer (floodplain) with river water during short or longer periods. We have examined how the different flow paths in the :I riparian buffer influence P retention mechanisms theoretically and from empirical evidence. The different hydrological flow paths determine where and how water-borne P compounds meet and interact with iron and aluminum oxides or other minerals in the geochemical cycling of P in the complex and dynamic environment that constitutes a riparian buffer. The main physical process in the riparian buffer-sedimentation-is active along several flow paths and may account for P retention rates of up to 128 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), while plant uptake may temporarily immobilize up to 15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). Retention of dissolved P in riparian buffers is not as pronounced as retention of particulate P and is often below 0.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). Several studies show significant release of dissolved P (i.e., Lip to 8 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)).

TI Effectiveness of Unfertilized Buff er Strips for Reducing Nitrogen Loads

AB Unfertilized buff er strips (BS) are widely accepted to reduce nitrogen (N) loads from agricultural land to surface water. However, the relative reduction of N load or concentration (BS eff ectiveness, BSE), varies with management and local conditions, especially hydrogeology. We present novel experimental evidence on BSE for 5-m-wide grass BS on intensively drained and managed plain agricultural lowland with varying hydrogeology. We selected characteristic sites for fi ve major hydrogeological classes of the Netherlands and installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference (REF) treatments along the ditch. Th e REF was managed like the adjacent fi eld, and BS was only harvested. Treatments were equipped with reservoirs in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and fl ow proportional N concentration for 3 or 4 yr. In addition, N concentration in upper groundwater was measured. We found a statistically signifi cant BSE of 10% on the peat site. At the other sites, BSE for N was low and statistically insignifi cant. Low BSE was explained by denitrifi cation between adjacent fi eld and ditch, as well as by the site-specifi c hydrologic factors including low proportion of shallow groundwater fl ow, downward seepage, low residence time in the BS, and surface runoff away from the ditch. We emphasize that a REF treatment is needed to evaluate BSE in agriculture and recommend reservoirs if drainage patterns are unknown. Introduction of a 5-m-wide BS is ineff ective for mitigating N loads from lowland agriculture to surface waters. We expect more from BS specifi cally designed to abate surface runoff

AB A comprehensive assessment of nitrogen (N) flows at the landscape scale is fundamental to understand spatial interactions in the N cascade and to inform the development of locally optimised N management strategies. To explore these interactions, complete N budgets were estimated for two contrasting hydrological catchments (dominated by agricultural grassland vs. semi-natural peat-dominated moorland), forming part of an intensively studied landscape in southern Scotland. Local scale atmospheric dispersion modelling and detailed farm and field inventories provided high resolution estimations of input fluxes. Direct agricultural inputs (i.e. grazing excreta, N-2 fixation, organic and synthetic fertiliser) accounted for most of the catchment N inputs, representing 82% in the grassland and 62% in the moorland catchment, while atmospheric deposition made a significant contribution, particularly in the moorland catchment, contributing 38% of the N inputs. The estimated catchment N budgets highlighted areas of key uncertainty, particularly N-2 exchange and stream N export. The resulting N balances suggest that the study catchments have a limited capacity to store N within soils, vegetation and groundwater. The "catchment N retention", i.e. the amount of N which is either stored within the catchment or lost through atmospheric emissions, was estimated to be 13% of the net anthropogenic input in the moorland and 61% in the grassland catchment. These values contrast with regional scale estimates: Catchment retentions of net anthropogenic input estimated within Europe at the regional scale range from 50% to 90 %, with an average of 82% (Billen et al., 2011). This study emphasises the need for detailed budget analyses to identify the N status of European landscapes.

AB Abiotic variability is known to structure lotic invertebrate communities, yet its influence on lentic invertebrates is not clear. This study tests the hypothesis that variability of nutrients and macro-ions are structuring invertebrate communities in agricultural drainage ditches. This was determined by investigating invertebrate adaptations to disturbance using insect life-history strategies. Many low-lying agricultural areas contain drainage ditches which potentially provide suitable habitat for aquatic invertebrates. In the province of North Holland (The Netherlands) the extensive network of eutrophic ditches are hydrologically managed, creating seasonal variability of water quality arising from agricultural run-off and the inlet of mineral rich, river derived water. This temporal variability was analysed from monitoring data, collected over a 7 month period (February till August) and covering 84 ditches in three soil regions; sand, clay and peat. Invertebrate diversity was determined as local (alpha diversity), regional (gamma diversity) and species-turnover (beta diversity). We ran canonical correspondence analysis and linear mixed models to determine correlations between invertebrate diversity, functional community composition and specific abiotic parameters, including variability (expressed as the Median Absolute Deviation). Invertebrate a diversity was positively correlated to variability in water transparency and negatively correlated to average pH, with the two parameters reflecting a water quality gradient in the environment. Insect life-history strategies expressed adaptations to abiotic variability and harsh (eutrophic) conditions. These adaptations were mainly achieved through good dispersal abilities and developmental trade-offs. The results support measures to reduce influxes of excess nutrients to this network of ditches.

AB Drainage ditches are integral components of agricultural production landscape, yet their contaminant mitigation capacity has been scarcely examined. If ditches are indeed capable of contaminant mitigation, then their use may serve as an alternative agricultural best management practice (BMP). A 50 ra portion of an agricultural drainage ditch, located in the Mississippi Delta Management Systems Evaluation Area (MDMSEA), USA, was amended with a mixture of water, atrazine , (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) (herbicide) and lambda-cyhalothrin (lambda -cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate) (insecticide), simulating a storm runoff event. Pesticide amendment was achieved using a diffuser to disperse the mixture at an inflow point along the ditch (designated as "0 m"). Pesticide concentrations in water, sediment, and plants were monitored for 28 days. One hour following initiation of simulated runoff, mean percentages of atrazine concentrations measured in water and sediment were 37 and 2%, respectively, while mean percentages of lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations in water and sediment were 12 and 1%, respectively. Atrazine and lambda-cyhalothrin mean percentage concentrations in plants (Polygonum (water smartweed),Leersia (cutgrass), and Sporobolus (smutgrass)) were 61 and 87%, respectively. Therefore, plants serve as an important site for pesticide sorption during runoff events. Aqueous concentrations of both pesticides decreased to levels which would not elicit non-target toxicological effects by the end of the 50 m portion of the drainage ditch. This research provides fundamental answers concerning the capability of vegetated agricultural drainage ditches to mitigate pesticide-associated storm water runoff. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Environmental change caused by urban development, land drainage, agriculture or climate change may result in accelerated decay of in situ archaeological remains. This paper reviews research into impacts of environmental change on hydrological processes of relevance to preservation of archaeological remains in situ. It compares work at rural sites with more complex urban environments. The research demonstrates that both the quantity and quality of data on preservation status, and hydrological and chemical parameters collected during routine archaeological surveys need to be improved. The work also demonstrates the necessity for any archaeological site to be placed within its topographic and geological context. In order to understand preservation potential fully, it is necessary to move away from studying the archaeological site as an isolated unit, since factors some distance away from the site of interest can be important for determining preservation. The paper reviews what is known about the hydrological factors of importance to archaeological preservation and recommends research that needs to be conducted so that archaeological risk can be more adequately predicted and mitigated. Any activity that changes either source pathways or the dominant water input may have an impact not just because of changes to the water balance or the water table, but because of changes to water chemistry. Therefore, efforts to manage threatened waterlogged environments must consider the chemical nature of the water input into the system. Clearer methods of assessing the degree to which buried archaeological sites can withstand changing hydrological conditions are needed, in addition to research which helps us understand what triggers decay and what controls thresholds of response for different sediments and types of artefact.

AB The effect of various concentrations and ratios of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) chelates on growth, micronutrient uptake and chlorophyll content was investigated in a glasshouse experiment using potted petunia plants. The plants were cultivated in a peat substrate amended with dolomitic limestone at rate of 3.0 g/L (control substrate) or 12.0 g/L. The higher rate was established both to restrict the uptake of Fe, Mn and other nutrients and also to test the effectiveness of various Fe and Mn treatments. The plants in all the treatments were fertigated at weekly intervals with a nutrient solution containing macronutrients and micronutrients. Various chelate forms of Fe and Mn were used with the exception of two treatments where these two elements were omitted. The effects of different substrate pH levels (derived from different limestone contents) had a large effect on plant growth, chlorophyll content and content of Fe and Mn accumulated in the plant leaves. The plants in the high-limestone substrate devoid of Fe and Mn had reduced growth and lower chlorophyll content. They also had lower leaf Fe and Mn content than the control plants in the R3 substrate. Regular fertigation with a nutrient solution containing Mn and Fe improved plant growth rate and also increased chlorophyll content. However, its efficiency depended on the chelate form and concentration used. The effect of chelate application on the Fe and Mn leaf content was unclear as it only marginally increased leaf Fe absorption in some treatments. No effect of the various Fe/Mn ratios was observed.

AB Micro-propagation techniques contribute to the multiplication of several bromeliad species. However, micropropagated plantlets often present low survival rate due to anatomical and physiological disorders induced by in vitro conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the sucrose and gas exchange impact on in vitro propagated Billbergia zebrina plants and to check if there is any residual effect of the in vitro conditions on micropropagated plants after acclimatization. Previously in vitro-established B. zebrina plants were transferred to culture media containing 0.0, 15.0, 30.0, 45.0 or 60.0 g L-1 sucrose. Two different culture container sealing systems were tested: lids with a filter (permitting an excellent gas exchange) and a filter covered with PVC (blocking fluent gas exchange). At 45 days in vitro growth, B. zebrina plantlets were transplanted onto plastic pots containing peat and cultivated for 80 days in greenhouse. At 45 days in vitro and 80 days of acclimatization in the greenhouse, the plants were evaluated. High sucrose levels in the in vitro media resulted in reduced growth. Plantlets exposed to aerated containers presented better rooting, being the sugar-free medium the best in vitro condition (photoautotrophic condition). Limited air exchange resulted in plantlets with anatomical and physiological disorders at the end of the in vitro period. The highest growth rate in the greenhouse was observed in plants previously propagated in unlimited gas exchange system and sugar-free medium. The use of photoautotrophic conditions induces B. zebrina plantlets without anatomical and physiological disorders and it interfere positively on ex vitro growth.

AB Background: Effluents from agricultural activities, metal and peat mining, urban and industrial areas, informal settlements and wastewater treatment plants all influence tributaries feeding the Mooi River. All these land uses ultimately result in a deterioration of water quality in the Mooi River.
   Objectives: The main objective was to relate the effects of inflowing tributaries to water quality and phytoplankton assemblages in the Mooi River.
   Method: Physico-chemical environmental variables were compared with water quality objectives and known limits to assess general water quality in the Mooi River over a one-year period. Water quality and phytoplankton in tributaries were compared to that at sites upstream and downstream from their inflows to determine the extent to which the tributaries affected the Mooi River. Multivariate analysis assisted in the interpretation of phytoplankton and physico-chemical data at the different sites.
   Results: Seven phytoplankton phyla were identified in the Mooi River. Diatoms and green algae were most dense and diverse. Cyanobacteria were responsible for various problems, especially in the Wasgoedspruit where they dominated and reached high densities. Lowest phytoplankton density and diversity were found in the upstream and downstream sections of the river, while maximum density and diversity were found during summer in the middle reaches. The inflow of tributaries, especially the Wasgoedspruit, had a pronounced effect on water quality downstream. Phytoplankton density and diversity were less affected than chemical variables, especially nutrient concentrations.
   Conclusion: Various land use activities surrounding the Mooi River's tributaries contributed to a deterioration of water quality in the main stream of the Mooi River.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effects of two different periods (i.e wet and dry) and five different oil palm materials [i.e. tenera (DxP) and clonal palms (i.e. PL68, PL104, PL106 and PL127)] on leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), leaf gas exchange parameters such as net photosynthesis (P-N), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration rate (T-r)), intercellular CO2 concentration (ci) and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) and their relationships, in different oil palm materials cultivated on peat. Leaf gas exchange of 8-year old DxP and clonal palms were determined during dry and wet periods which were also analysed for leaf Delta. Results showed that there were significant differences in P-N, g(s) and between different periods. The g(s) values decreased by 54% during dry period compared to the wet period. This reduction in g(s) led to a reduction of 59% and 44% in P-N and T-r, respectively. The interaction effect between oil palm materials and different periods had a significant influence on the leaf Delta values. Leaf Delta in clonal palm PL106 was less discriminated (23.74 +/- 0.42 parts per thousand) compared to the DxP palm during dry season (27.92 +/- 0.70 parts per thousand). A negative relationship was observed between leaf Delta with instantaneous WUE and leaf Delta was found to be highly correlated with c(i) in oil palm during the wet period.

AB There is increasing concern regarding how to sustainably meet the basic needs of a growing population with a continuously decreasing resource base. This study analyses the water-energy-food nexus in Burundi. The country experiences challenging demographic pressures which increase the demand for food, energy, and freshwater. Yet strategies developed to meet requirements lead to natural resource depletion and degradation. Being a resource-poor country, the population depends mainly on agriculture for food, labor, and income. In order to increase food production, agriculture was intensified using traditional methods, mainly by clearing new, mostly marginal land, increasing cultivation cycles per year. The overexploitation of land decreased the soil fertility and yields, and increased deforestation and soil erosion. This has resulted in mass impoverishment of farmers and a growing malnutrition rate in the countryside. On the other hand, poverty often correlates directly with the type of energy supply and food security. Energy is provided mainly by biomass through firewood, charcoal, peat, and agricultural residues, which implies further deforestation. These factors increase the pressure on existing forest areas both for the reclamation of new agricultural land and for the production of firewood and charcoal. Finally, Burundi is classified by the UN as a country with economic water scarcity due to the population growth rate, low level of education, and a high poverty rate. The economic water scarcity is closely linked to energy production and to agriculture. More hydropower could reduce the extent of deforestation. The high deforestation rate reduces the infiltration rate (less groundwater recharge) and increases surface run-off. The latter is leading to higher erosion and loss of soil fertility, thus influencing agriculture and food security negatively. (C) 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Current emissions inventories of black carbon aerosol, an important component of PM2.5 and a powerful climate altering species, are highly uncertain in both space and time. One of the major and hardest to constrain sources of black carbon is fire, which comes from a combination of forest, vegetation, agricultural, and peat sources. Therefore, quantifying this source more precisely in both space and time is essential. While there is a growing body of work on this topic, the best estimations generally underestimate measurements by integer factors. In this work, 12 years of measurements from 2000 through 2012 of AOD from the MISR satellite and AOD and AAOD from the AERONET network, are used to evaluate the aerosol climatology from Southeast Asian fires. First, the fires in Southeast Asia are uniquely characterized in both space and time to reveal two major burning regions: one with a regular inter-annual and intra-annual distribution, and the other with an irregular inter-annual and somewhat variable intra-annual distribution. These patterns correspond well with regional and local measurements of both composition and meteorology. Using these newly developed relationships, a new temporally and spatially varying set of black carbon emissions is developed. Finally, the best fits with the various measurements yield an annual average value for black carbon emissions due to fires bounded by the range 0.36-0.54 Tg yr(-1), with the amount in the year of the greatest fires being bounded by the range 1.2-1.8 Tg yr(-1). These magnitudes are significantly higher and differently distributed in space and time when compared with current inventories, and therefore are expected to have a significant impact on regional particulate loadings and the global climate system.

AB Large quantities of mineral phosphorus (P) fertilizer are often applied to intensively cultivated organic soils. Although erosion and runoff can contribute to loss of P, the large amount of fertilizer applied causes a rapid build-up of this nutrient, resulting in the downward movement of excess P in the soil profile and subsequent loss through tile drainage water. For arable organic soils, these losses often occur through subsurface tile drains, a common requirement to maintain a favorable air-water balance in the crop root zone, as well as to prevent soil subsidence. As such, subsurface drainage is a major pathway for agricultural P loss, contributing to persistent eutrophication of rivers, lakes, and estuaries globally. Although studies have been conducted on P mitigation within organic soils, application of drainage water management (DWM) as a P mitigation strategy in these soils, has not been extensively studied. The objective of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge by reviewing previous studies on P losses from subsurface drained agricultural organic soils while evaluating potential mitigation strategies. Specifically, this paper assesses the unique properties of organic soils that could influence P fate and transport, such as the distribution of P pools within the soil pools; variable pore geometry, hydrophobicity, and shrinkage; P loads exiting tile drains; and DWM practices in mitigating P losses. It is concluded that P retention is affected by the dynamic nature of soil water movement in organic soils and that substantial P loads enter surrounding water bodies via subsurface drainage effluent. There is evidence that DWM is an effective best management practice in the abatement of subsurface P losses.

AB We examined the concentration profiles of nutrients in the surface water, soil and pore water along the eutrophication gradient of the Water Conservation Area-2A (WCA-2A) in the northern Everglades. Phosphorus levels in the surface waters contributed by the agricultural runoff showed an exponential decrease downstream of the inflow structures attaining background values of 7-12, 7-9 and 5-6 mu g l(-1) of TP, TDP and PO4-P, respectively, at distances of 8-10 km. The pore water PO4-P concentration in the oligotrophic areas ranged between 5 and 10 mu g l(-1). Molar ratios of dissolved inorganic N and P suggest a possible switch in nutrient limitation in the surface water from P in the oligotrophic areas to N in the eutrophic areas (DIN:DIP similar to 5). External nutrient loading has also contributed to a three-to four-fold increase in soil TP concentration and enhanced pore water PO4-P in the northern marshes. Unlike P, C and N concentration in the soils remained fairly uniform along the eutrophication gradient. Pb-210 dating of soil cores suggests that the increase in soil P concentration (from < 500 to 1500 mu g g(-1)) and P accumulation rate (from 0.06 to 0.46 g P m(-2) per year) at the eutrophic site correlates with the installation of inflow structures in 1960-1963 through which agricultural drainage from the Hillsboro canal enters the marshes. Organic P makes up 70-90% of the total P in the soils as uptake by algae and macrophytes is the primary mechanism of P removal in these wetlands. Calcium supply from the underlying bedrock suggested from the surface and pore water chemical profiles has important consequences for P-cycling in the Everglades as Ca-bound P is the major form of inorganic P storage in the soils.

AB This study focuses on the distribution of major anions and inorganic N species after the installation of a subsurface drainage system in loamy clay soils overlaying paleo-marsh peats and paleo-channel sediments. An agricultural field of 6 ha was chosen as the experimental site. Its stratigraphy was reconstructed thanks to a high resolution core sampling in 13 boreholes. In the lower undisturbed portion of the soil profile a large vertical and horizontal heterogeneity for nitrate and ammonium content was noticed, mainly due to the type of sediment underling the cultivated layer. On the contrary, the upper portion of the soil profile (0.5-0.6 m) displayed a homogeneous texture, organic matter content and permeability, most likely induced by tillage. The presence of the subsurface drainage system, reduces soil salinity and avoids soil waterlogged conditions guaranteeing an oxic/suboxic environment, where nitrate is the dominant N species. Underneath the subsurface drainage system, the elevated ammonium, chloride and bromide concentrations are directly related to the presence of non-drained peaty sediments, suggesting a natural origin of these species. Shallow groundwater samples displayed very similar content of anions with respect to the soils extractions, proving chemical equilibrium conditions between matrix/solution and confirming that advection is not dominant and that, the chemical fluxes are driven by diffusion.
   This paper shows that subsurface drainage systems are effective in ameliorating soil properties even in agricultural field consisting of low permeability materials with naturally high content of organic matter and salinity and that they can induce changes in redox conditions responsible for the large differences in N speciation found in soil profiles.

AB [1] The impacts of historical land use changes on the Swiss Plateau on the summer climate were investigated. The land use changes consist primarily of a conversion of wetlands with extended peat soils into highly productive agricultural lands. We used the "Lokal-Modell'' of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling to conduct several 1-month-long high-resolution simulations (1.5 x 1.5 km(2)) with present and past landscape conditions. The past land use was reconstructed from historical maps ( 1800 - 1850) over a relatively small perturbed area of approximate to 400 km(2) embedded in an otherwise unchanged present-day landscape. The documented changes in land use and land cover lead to a daytime cooling of up to 0.3 degrees C and a nocturnal warming of the same magnitude, thereby decreasing the diurnal temperature range by 0.6 degrees C. The alteration of the radiation budget and the surface energy balance leads to a shallower daytime mixed layer under present compared to past conditions, with a reduction in the convective upward transport of moisture. The cloud coverage over the study area decreased by up to 5% on average under present conditions. The regional precipitation is most strongly affected in the mean downwind areas and not so much over the area of land use changes. Because of orographic effects in the downwind area a decrease in precipitation in lower-elevation areas was modeled, while precipitation in the adjacent higher-elevation downwind areas increased. In contrast to our expectations the soil water status did not play a dominant role in this area because of the high water table. Even under present conditions the availability of soil moisture and the accessibility of the groundwater to plant roots is, on average, still not a limiting factor for plant transpiration.

AB Eggplant fruits are abundant in potassium, the amount of which ranges from 200 to 600 mg K.100 g(-1) FM, depending on a variety. They are also a rich source of phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, and iron. As there are no fertilization recommendations for eggplant cultivation under cover, this study been undertaken to evaluate the vegetable's requirements. The aim was to test how the type and dose of potassium fertilizer influences nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium levels in eggplant fruits. The experiment on cv. Epic F(1) eggplant was carried out in unheated polyethylene tunnel in 2004-2005. The eggplant was cultivated on peat subsoil in 10 dm(3) capacity cylinders made of rigid plastic. The experiment was set up in a two-factor, completely randomized design. The influence of two factors was examined: I - type of potassium fertilizer (KCl, K(2)SO(4), KNO(3)), and II - potassium rate (8, 16, 24 g K.plant(-1)). Fruit samples for laboratory determinations were collected in mid-August, in the middle of fruiting stage. Fruits were harvested at the stage of technological maturity and the following were determined: N(tot), P, K, Ca, Mg. The results were processed by variance analysis. Significantly higher total nitrogen and potassium concentrations in fruits of plants fertilized with potassium nitrate as compared to the other two fertilizer types were recorded. Increasing potassium doses, regardless the fertilizer type, considerably increased the element content in eggplant fruits and widened the K:Ca ratio value. The diversification of potassium fertilization did not have significant influence on phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in eggplant fruits. No significant changes in calcium content in fruits were observed when applying potassium sulfate or nitrate, while higher potassium chloride rates significantly decreased the concentration of this element in fruits.

AB We used radiocarbon measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to resolve sources of riverine carbon within agriculturally dominated landscapes in California. During 2003 and 2004, average Delta(14)C for DOC was -254aEuro degrees in agricultural drains in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, -218aEuro degrees in the San Joaquin River, -175aEuro degrees in the California State Water Project and -152aEuro degrees in the Sacramento River. The age of bulk DOC transiting the rivers of California's Central Valley is the oldest reported for large rivers and suggests wide-spread loss of soil organic matter caused by agriculture and urbanization. Using DAX 8 adsorbent, we isolated and measured (14)C concentrations in hydrophobic acid fractions (HPOA); river samples showed evidence of bomb-pulse carbon with average Delta(14)C of 91 and 76aEuro degrees for the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers, respectively, with older HPOA, -204aEuro degrees, observed in agricultural drains. An operationally defined non-HPOA fraction of DOC was observed in the San Joaquin River with seasonally computed Delta(14)C values of between -275 and -687aEuro degrees; the source of this aged material was hypothesized to be physically protected organic-matter in high clay-content soils and agrochemicals (i.e., radiocarbon-dead material) applied to farmlands. Mixing models suggest that the Sacramento River contributes about 50% of the DOC load in the California State Water Project, and agricultural drains contribute approximately one-third of the load. In contrast to studies showing stabilization of soil carbon pools within one or two decades following land conversion, sustained loss of soil organic matter, occurring many decades after the initial agricultural-land conversion, was observed in California's Central Valley.

AB The effects of historical land-use and land-cover changes on the climate of the Swiss Plateau in the different seasons were investigated. In the 19th century, a civil engineering project was initiated to reshape the lake and river system on the Swiss Plateau in order to ban the frequent flooding during extreme weather events. The landscape modifications consisted primarily of a conversion of wetlands with extended peat soils into a highly productive agricultural landscape. Historical maps (1800-1850) served as a basis for the reconstruction of the past land use. The "Lokal-Modell" of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling was used to conduct eight one-month long high-resolution simulations (1.5 x 1.5 km(2)) with present and past landscape conditions. The modified soil and surface properties led to distinctly altered energy and moisture exchanges at the surface and as a consequence affected the local and regional climate. The climatic changes show different characteristics and magnitudes in the cold (October - March) as compared to the warm season (April - September). The landscape modifications led to an average daytime cooling between -0.12 degrees C (January) and -0.61 degrees C (April) and a night-time warming of 0.19 degrees C-0.34 degrees C. The differences in the mean monthly temperatures show a warming of 0.1 degrees C-0.2 degrees C in the cold season and a cooling of similar magnitude in most of the study area in the warm season. The modification of the radiation budget and the surface energy balance distinctly affected the convective activity in the study area in the warm season, but had only a weak effect on convectivity in the cold season. The cloud coverage in the warm season is therefore distinctly reduced compared to the past.

AB Since the Middle Ages the Dutch have reclaimed many lakes and parts of the sea, creating polders. Drainage is required to use the land: for the inhabitants, for agriculture and for nature. Traditionally drainage was by gravity: through open (and later pipe) drains excess rainfall was transferred into open collector drains, from where the water was pumped out to a river, lake or the sea. Since the 1950s, land use has been changing towards a more diverse and intensive agriculture, more attention for nature, recreation and continuing urbanization. On top of this, the climate is changing: significant increases in precipitation, both average and extreme. Until recently, the solution to more excess water was to increase pump capacity. Yet the combined problems of climate change, sea level rise, subsidence and urbanization require more structural changes in water management. Drainage systems have to be modified to enable the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each agricultural plot. A new approach of 'retention, storage and controlled removal' is being used to develop climate adaptation scenarios for the three hydro-ecological zones in the Netherlands, i.e.: (1) the man-made polder areas with marine clay soils along the North Sea coast and the former Zuider Sea; (2) the low-lying peat lands in the west and north; and (3) the sandy and loamy soils areas in the centre, south and east. New approaches for tailor-made drainage solutions following this strategy are being tested in various pilot areas in the three zones. Although the research is still ongoing, this paper presents the lessons learned to date related to the challenges, risks and limitations associated with the introduction of these new drainage strategies for coping with climate change in the Netherlands.

AB Mineralisation of organic matter can substantially add to the risk of nitrogen leaching from drained humus-rich soils under intensive agricultural use. The objective of this study was to investigate net nitrogen mineralisation (NNM) in a drained Mollic Gleysol over the course of a year and to separate contributions from the decomposition of fresh organic residues ('litter') and stabilised soil organic matter ('humus'). Using NNM rates measured under different moisture conditions in two undisturbed subsoil monoliths and a moisture response function determined by incubation experiments with small soil cores from a humus-rich subsoil layer, a first-order rate model was calibrated to describe NNM of the 'humus pool'. Standardised to the same moisture conditions by means of this response function, NNM rate constants were independent of depth and also did not differ between monoliths and small soil cores. The model predicted NNM rates determined in situ at a depth of 20-40 cm well. For the topsoil (0-20 cm) it was necessary to extend the model by a second pool of organic matter with a higher turnover rate ('litter pool'). Assuming the same moisture and temperature dependence of NNM in the two pools, the basic NNM rate constant of the litter pool was determined by data fitting. With this calibration, the two-pool model predicted a net mineralisation of 322 kg N ha(-1) during the experimental year in the upper 40 cm of the soil of which 55% occurred in the 'litter pool'. While overall NNM predictions relating to the entire study period agreed well with the field data, predictions for individual incubation periods (3-6 weeks) and soil layers were much less reliable.

AB Solutions containing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from a depressional wetland that receives agricultural drainage water were incubated in pure quartz sands with FeCl3 added as the main electron acceptor. The effects of three factors (the water, DOC, and Fe contents) on the CO2 and CH4 production rates, integrated cumulative C emissions and Fe-OC co-precipitation were studied. The results showed that CO2 production during the DOC mineralization process was facilitated by Fe(III) reduction at the expense of CH4 production. Additionally, the cumulative CO2 emissions determined by integrating the temporal curves of CO2 production were negatively correlated with those of CH4 (r = -0.48, p < 0.01). Extremely large ratios of the CO2:CH4 production rate (13,762 and 44,885 under two soil water conditions: saturation and flood conditions of twice the saturation level) were observed. These ratios were likely caused by simultaneous anaerobic fermentation, microbial respiration, and methanogenesis suppression triggered by iron reduction. The effects of exogenous Fe(III) inputs on total C emissions (as the sum of integrated cumulative CO2 and CH4) were only dependent on soil water conditions during the initial period of the experiment, and flooded conditions increased total C emissions by as much as double. Increased ratios of Fe inputs to C contents were found to proportionally increase the total C emissions (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.01). Under saturated conditions, the co-precipitation of Fe-OC complexes prevented the remainder of the DOC from undergoing mineralization. In terms of DOC, we concluded that wetland saturation with introduced Fe(III) can reduce total C emissions from anaerobic respiration and promote C sequestration.

AB Groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment are worldwide tools in supporting groundwater protection and land planning. In this study, we used three of these different methodologies applied to the Campanian Plain located in southern Italy: SINTACS, AVI and LOS. However, their capability to describe the observed chemical pollution of the area has resulted quite poor. For such a reason, a modified SINTACS method has been then implemented in the area in order to get a more reliable view of groundwater vulnerability. NO3- and SO42- from more than 400 monitoring wells were used for specific vulnerability assessment. Land use was chosen as key parameter to infer the risk of groundwater pollution in our area. The new methodology seems to show a higher correlation with observed NO3- concentrations and a more reliable identification of aquifer's pollution hot spots. The main sources of NO3- were found in sub-urban areas, where vulnerability and risk are higher than in other areas. Otherwise due to reducing conditions triggered by the presence of elevated sedimentary organic matter and peat, concentrations below agricultural areas were lower than in sub-urban areas. The SO42- specific vulnerability map showed a positive correlation with observed concentrations, due to geogenic and anthropogenic SO42- sources present in the area. The combination of both NO3- and SO42- derived risk maps becomes essential to improve the conceptual model of aquifer pollution in this severely anthropized area. The application of this new and original approach shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of each of the described previous methods and clearly showed how anthropogenic activities have to be taken into account in the assessment process.

AB In closed-loop soilless culture, one of the most relevant problems may be the accumulation in the recirculating nutrient solution of ions contained in irrigation water that are not or scarcely absorbed by the plants (e.g. Na, Q In order to verify the possibility to reduce the rate of recirculating water salinisation by means of subirrigation, an experiment was carried out in the spring of 2002 and 2004, with tomato plants (cv. Jama) grown in glasshouse and watered by conventional drip irrigation (D) or by subirrigation (trough bench system: S). The plants were cultivated in pots filled with a peat-perlite substrate for approximately 3 months and fed with complete nutrient solution, which was prepared with fresh water containing 10 mol m(-3) NaCl; the nutrient solution in the collecting tank was replaced when the value of electrical conductivity (EC) exceeded 6.0 dS m(-1). Water and nutrient crop use, salt accumulation in the substrate, and fruit yield were monitored. In S Culture, the composition and EC of the recirculating nutrient solution changed slightly, while in D treatment there was a fast water salinisation that made it necessary to flushed out the nutrient solution in six different occasions, with consequent loss of water and fertilisers. In S Culture, the upward water movement in the substrate, coupled with selective mineral uptake by the roots, caused salinity build-up in the upper region of the substrate, which was associated with Na+ accumnulation. No significant influence of irrigation methods on fruit yield and quality was observed. These findings suggest that subirrigation can be a tool to reduce the water consumption and nutrient runoff in closed-loop substrate culture of tomato conducted with saline water.

AB We studied morphological parameters and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal colonisation of Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings produced from seeds of Western (W1 and W2 provenances), Central (C1 and C2 provenances) and Eastern (E1 provenance) seed regions in Latvia. In total, 50 seedlings of each seed provenance were cultivated in a sphagnum peat substrate in the plastic pots, which were randomly arranged in an open field in order to allow natural ECM fungal colonisation. After six-year cultivation in a forest nursery, significant differences both in morphological parameters (shoot height, root collar diameter and shoot volume) and in ECM fungal colonisation were detected among seedlings of different regions and provenances. Seedlings of C2 and W2 showed significantly better growth and possessed significantly higher number of ECM morphotypes, while seedlings of W1, and in particular of C1, were of the poorest growth and possessed the lowest number of ECM morphotypes. Nine fungal taxa were revealed amplifying the internal transcribed spacer of fungal ribosomal DNA from 102 selected ECM root tips; amplicon separation on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) gels and sequencing methods were used. Basidiomycete Amphinema byssoides (33.1%) and ascomycete Wilcoxina sp. (50.3%) dominated fungal communities in roots but their abundances significantly varied among seedlings of different regions and provenances. Principal component analysis showed that fungal communities in seedling roots from the Western, Central and Eastern seed regions were separated from each other thereby showing their certain specificity. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that despite P.abies seedlings of different seed regions and provenances were exposed to the same growth conditions and natural ECM fungal colonisation, the genetic background of the seeds has likely influenced both seedling growth and their root colonisation by ECM fungi. This can be of significant practical importance for successful establishment and growth of seedlings in the nursery and after their outplanting in the field.

AB Afforestation has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the often high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils with high organic matter content. However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes after afforestation can be considerable, depending predominantly on site drainage and nutrient availability. Studies on the full GHG budget of afforested organic soils are scarce and hampered by the uncertainties associated with methodology. In this study we determined the GHG budget of a spruce-dominated forest on a drained organic soil with an agricultural history. Two different approaches for determining the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were applied, for the year 2008, one direct (eddy covariance) and the other indirect (analyzing the different components of the GHG budget), so that uncertainties in each method could be evaluated. The annual tree production in 2008 was 8.3 +/- 3.9 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) due to the high levels of soil nutrients, the favorable climatic conditions and the fact that the forest was probably in its phase of maximum C assimilation or shortly past it. The N2O fluxes were determined by the closed-chamber technique and amounted to 0.9 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). According to the direct measurements from the eddy covariance technique, the site acts as a minor GHG sink of -1.2 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). This contrasts with the NEE estimate derived from the indirect approach which suggests that the site is a net GHG emitter of 0.6 +/- 4.5 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). Irrespective of the approach applied, the soil CO2 effluxes counter large amounts of the C sequestration by trees. Due to accumulated uncertainties involved in the indirect approach, the direct approach is considered the more reliable tool. As the rate of C sequestration will likely decrease with forest age, the site will probably become a GHG source once again as the trees do not compensate for the soil C and N losses. Also forests in younger age stages have been shown to have lower C assimilation rates; thus, the overall GHG sink potential of this afforested nutrient-rich organic soil is probably limited to the short period of maximum C assimilation.

AB The purpose of our work was to establish features of formation of filtration processes and to define prevention measures towards the nutrients leaching from drainage soils into the ground waters. Our researches were carried out on typical drained floodplain soils of Panfil Research Station, Institute of Agriculture of National Academy of Agrarian Science (floodplain of Supiy River, Yahotyn district, Kiev region, Ukraine) in 2016-2018. The arable layer of peatlands had high level of decomposition (50-60%) with gross nitrogen contamination of 1.9%, phosphorus - 0.4, potassium - 0.17 and sodium - 7.1%, which is typical for the forest-steppe zone. The drying and humidifying system was satisfactory. Research on nutrient washing into ground water was carried out on various agricultural lands, during and out of crop rotation. iltration water was taken from water measurement wells, from drainage canals and directly from the Supi River twice a year (in autumn and spring) on sites with different fertilisation schemes. We found that in the fields with perennial grasses without mineral fertilizers 4.9 mg L-1 of NO3 was washed out, 11.7 mg of K2O, and 130 mg of CaO; on the fertilized fields it were 4. 2-19.4, 12.8-22.2, and 122-148 mg L-1 respectively; on the annual crop fields without the fertilizers a total of 9.2 mg L-1 of NO3, 16.8 of K2O and 134 mg L-1 of CaO were leached, whereas it were 14.3-19.6, 21.2-34.4 and 138-161 mg L(-1)on the annual crop fertilized fields in the humid years. We observed a similar dependence in the dry 2018 year. Our observations of nutrient wash-out showed that on the fields with perennial grasses and annual crops (winter rye and corn) there were much more wash-out of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen, mobile phosphorus and potassium in autumn compared to spring for average from 2016-2018. In addition, the autumn drainage water contains more carbonates and had higher content of Na2O (up to 48.7-51.3 mg L-1). We did not register the dependence of nutrient washing into the ground water on the cultivated crops. At the same time, a significant amount of calcium and magnesium was washed out from perennial and annual crop fields in spring.

AB Re-established riparian wetlands used to mitigate nitrogen (N) loss from agricultural soils to surface water may lose phosphorus (P) from the top soils that often have received fertilizers. This could lead to eutrophication of lakes and estuaries. For a 2-year period we established mass balances of N and Pin two restored riparian wetlands of similar to 0.6 ha situated on mineral soil. Monitoring began 5 years after restoration. Both wetlands received drainage water from upland agricultural fields rich in nitrate (1.5-12.3 mgN L-1) and low in total P (TP) (0.016-0.04 mg P L-1). Water balances were reasonably accounted for (15% imbalance at most). Water passed the wetlands as sheet flow without exchange with groundwater because of clay horizons in sub-soils, and sheet pilings along the stream banks allowed continuous measurements of inflow and outflow. The Egeskov riparian wetland (wetland:upland ratio 0.13) removed 121 and 28 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (43 and 75% of the load) and retained 0.08 kg P ha(-1) (6% of the load) in year one and had a net release of 0.15 kg P ha(-1) (25% of the load) in year two. The Stor A riparian wetland (wetland:upland ratio 0.02) removed 229 and 158 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (32 and 26%). Net releases of P were 0.33 and 0.90 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) (22 and 127%). Nitrogen removal rates are on par with published rates for similar wetlands, while the P release rates appear surprisingly low. Phosphate outlet concentrations resembled the equilibrium concentrations (EPC0) where no phosphate exchange occurred between top soils and drainage water, suggesting that P release or retention was controlled by phosphate adsorption. This value was 0.015 mg P L-1 for Egeskov and 0.047 mg P L-1 for Stor A. The high phosphate affinity was probably governed by high ratios between oxidized iron and iron-bound P. The top soils (10 cm) contained 87 and 201 kg P ha(-1) as iron-bound P and herbaceous vegetation accumulated 10.7 and 16.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). These figures are 55-136 and 8-11 times higher than the annual P-load to the wetlands, and we suggest that annual harvest of vegetation could maintain or even improve the P retention capacity of these wetlands.

AB While imparting gastronomic novelty and sensory delight, microgreens also constitute rudimentary leafy greens packed with nutrients and phytochemicals. As such, they comprise an upcoming class of functional foods. However, apart from bioactive secondary metabolites, microgreens also accumulate antinutritive agents such as nitrate, especially under conducive protected cultivation conditions. The current work examined nutrient deprivation before harvest (DBH), applied by replacing nutrient solution with osmotic water for six and twelve days, as a strategy for reducing microgreen nitrate levels in different species (lettuce, mustard, and rocket). The three species were sown on a peat-based substrate, cultivated in a controlled climate chamber, and harvested 18 days after sowing, when the first two true leaves emerged. DBH impact on major constituents of the secondary metabolome, mineral content, colorimetric, and yield traits was appraised. Nitrate and mineral content were determined through ion chromatography, phenolic composition through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, and carotenoid composition through HPLC-DAD. Nutrient deprivation was effective in reducing nitrate content; however, effective treatment duration differed between species and decline was more precipitous in nitrate hyperaccumulating species such as rocket. Quercetin and kaempferol glycosides were the flavonol glycosides most abundant in brassicaceous microgreens, whereas lettuce microgreens were steeped in caffeoyl quinic acid. DBH interacted with species as it increased the total phenolic content of lettuce, decreased that of rocket, but did not affect mustard. Further research to link changes in phenolic composition to the sensory and in vivo bioactive profile of microgreens is warranted. Notably, brief (<= 6 days) DBH can be applied across species with moderate or no impact on the phenolic, carotenoid, and mineral composition of microgreens. Brief DBH applications also have limited impact on microgreens' yield and colorimetric traits hence on the commercial value of the product. They can therefore be applied for reducing microgreen nitrate levels without significantly impacting key secondary metabolic constituents and their potential bioactive role.

AB An integrated spatio-temporal statistical, P-spline modeling, Mann-Kendall and Thiel-Sen trend detection, and factorial analyses techniques were performed on 438 chemical and 274 microbiological data collected from twenty drinking water supply wells over four years (2010-2013) in Tanta District (Egypt). The prime objective was to characterize the spatio-temporal quality trends using indicators of turbidity, pH, TDS, Cl-, SO42-, Na+, Total Alkalinity, hardness (Total, Mg, and Ca), Fe2+, Mn2+, Al3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, F-, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-, SiO2, bacterial, and algal contents. Factorial analysis was applied to identify the significant factors loading the quality variation. Out of the 20 wells, notable upward trends were significant (>95% level) for the total hardness (30%), total alkalinity (20%), TDS (15%), Fe2+ (15%), Mn2+ (15%), NO2- (10%), and 10% for the NH4+, PO43-, and SiO2. Attenuation rates (mg/l/year) were higher in NH4+ (av. 0.023) than Mn2+ (av. 0.013) and Fe+2 (av. 0.010), and remarkable average rates were 6.77 (TDS), 3.27 (total alkalinity), 2.12 (total hardness), 0.79 (SiO2), 0.011 (PO43-), and 0.002 (NO2-) in decreasing order. High precision of the trend estimate was confirmed for the Mn2+, NH4+, and Fe2+ data. Five factors were found to explain 78.8% of the total variance of the quality variables and in particular, a significant load of hardness parameters, Total alkalinity, TDS, Mn2+, NH4+, and Fe2+ in decreasing order were identified. The spatio-temporal variation in pollutants originated from organic matter degradation, either naturally from the aquifer peaty sediments or anthropogenic due to improper well head protection in the urban centers or from the agricultural drains in low relief areas. Our findings have important societal implications regarding the management of the limited and valuable water resources in arid and semi-arid lands. The adopted methodologies could be readily applied to similar alluvial aquifers elsewhere. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For a long time, agricultural areas had considerable ornithological value, an ecological richness which in The Netherlands was epitomised by the term 'meadow birds'. However, over the last half century, agricultural intensification has negatively affected the quality of meadow bird habitats. Here we provide a quantitative characterization of agricultural habitats and their use by Black-tailed Godwits Limosa I. limosa in the south-western part of the province of Friesland, The Netherlands, in 2009, to provide a yardstick to evaluate further change. We used groundwater level, vegetation typology, relief in the landscape, the occurrence of foot drains, land use and soil characteristics such as textures and peat to describe the landscape that comprised 43 polders covering 8480 ha. We used a Principal Component Analysis to summarize landscape characteristics and find that much of the habitat variation is explained by a combination of herb richness of the vegetation, the presence or absence of foot drains and groundwater level. The modern agricultural landscape of southwest Friesland consists of 80% of uniform, intensively managed landscape with herb-poor meadows and low groundwater levels, the remaining 20% being taken by remnants of the former herb-rich meadows. The whole study area was searched weekly and Black-tailed Godwits were mapped between arrival and egg-laying. The positive relationship between godwit density and the first PC axis indicates that Black-tailed Godwits preferred herb-rich polders with high groundwater levels and the presence of foot drains. Soil texture was poorly correlated with godwit breeding densities for intensively managed (herb-poor) parcels, but for herb-rich meadows, soils of sandy clay loam and sandy clay harboured the highest densities of godwits. To protect Black-tailed Godwits, areas should have a herb-rich vegetation, contain foot drains and high groundwater tables should be re-established.

AB Enhancing the rhizosphere colonization and persistence of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is necessary for maximizing PGPR-mediated benefits for crop growth and fitness in environmentally friendly agriculture. In the present investigation, we attempted manipulation of the rice rhizosphere by spraying of low molecular weight plant-regulating metabolites on the foliage of rice plants to in turn enhance the colonizing efficiency of soil-inoculated PGPR strain. The green fluorescent protein gene-tagged rhizobacterial strain, Pseudomonas chlororaphis ZSB15-M2, was inoculated in sterile plant growth medium (vermiculite coco peat mixture) and non-autoclaved agricultural soil. We sprayed different plant growth-regulating small molecules on the foliage of rice seedlings and monitored the colonizing efficiency of ZSB15-M2 in the rice rhizosphere. Among the chemicals assessed, salicylic acid (SA) at 1 mM or Corynebacterium glutamicum cell extract (CGCE, 0.2% w/v) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell extract (SCCE, 0.2% w/v) showed a tenfold increase in rhizosphere colony-forming units of ZSB15-M2 compared to control with a significant decline in non-rhizosphere bulk soil population. Foliar spray of CGCE enhanced soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and soil protein by 21.86%, 9.68% and 11.57% respectively in the rice rhizosphere as compared to mock control. Additionally, CGCE spray enhanced the key soil enzymes, viz., dehydrogenase and acid- and alkaline phosphatase in the rhizosphere ranging 15-36%. The cumulative effect of this engineered rhizosphere resulted in the elevation of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc availability by 21.83%, 28.83%, 23.95% and 61.94%, respectively, in rice rhizosphere as compared to control. On the other hand, SCCE and SA spray had an equal influence on the rhizosphere's biological attributes, which is lower than that of GCGE and higher than that of mock control. From the study, we propose that the aboveground management of rice with microbial-based small molecules will modulate the rice rhizosphere to attract more beneficial PGPR-based inoculants, thus improving the crop and soil health.

AB The development of phytopathogen-resistant varieties is the most reliable and economic way to reduce potato yield losses. Breeding of such varieties is possible by using genetic sources of resistance. The use of DNA markers for identification of valuable genotypes, including forms with several resistance genes, makes it possible to significantly improve breeding efficiency. The development of a multiplex PCR technique and using it to simultaneously test varieties and breeding lines for several genes that control the resistance to viruses and nematodes is a new approach to using DNA markers. This study is aimed at screening samples from the collection of the Narym Department of Breeding and Seed Production of the Siberian Research Institute of Agriculture and Peat (the Branch of the Siberian Federal Agrobiotechnology Research Center, the Russian Academy of Sciences) using the multiplex PCR technique, for genes for resistance to Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallidas, potato wart disease, viruses X and Y. 40 samples were tested by means of genetic markers to identify genes for resistance to potato wart disease (Sen 1), virus X (Rx), virus Y (Ryadg, Rychc, Rysto), Globodera rostochiensis (H1, Gro 1-4) and Globodera pallida (Gpa2), in the genome.The sample included two varieties, three populations produced by self-pollination of the Ideal variety, and 35 individually selected potato hybrids. As a result, we identified marker NL25 (Sen1) in 19 samples; marker PVX (Rx) in 13 samples; marker RYSC3(312) (Ryadg) in 10 samples; marker YES3-3A(341) (Rysto) in 5 samples; markers TG 689(141) , 57R(450) , N195(337) (H1) in 12 samples; marker Gro1-4-1(602) (Gro 1-4) in 6 samples; marker Gpa2-2(452) (Gpa2) in 13 samples. In terms of economically valuable traits, sample C-31-15 is noted for high yield and quality indicators. It carries genes for resistance to potato virus X (Rx), Y (Rysto), Globodera rostochiensis (H1, Gro1-4), and Globodera pallida (Gpa2).

AB Carbon (C)-rich wetland soils are often drained for agriculture due to their capacity to support high net primary productivity. Increased drainage is expected this century to meet the agricultural demands of a growing population. Wetland drainage can result in large soil C losses and the concentration of residual soil minerals such as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). In upland soils, reactive Fe and Al minerals can contribute to soil C accumulation through sorption to poorly crystalline minerals and coprecipitation of organo-metal complexes, as well as C loss via anaerobic respiration by Fe-reducing bacteria. The role of these minerals in soil C dynamics is often overlooked in managed wetland soils and may be particularly important in both drained and reflooded systems with elevated mineral concentrations. Reflooding drained soils have been proposed as a means to sequester C for climate change mitigation, yet little is known about how reactive Fe and Al minerals affect C cycling in restored wetlands. We explored the interactions among soil C and reactive Fe and Al minerals in drained and reflooded wetland soils. In reflooded soils, soil C was negatively associated with reactive Fe and reduced Fe(II), a proxy for anaerobic conditions (reactive Fe:R-2 = .54-.79; Fe(II):R-2 = .59-.89). In drained soils, organo-Al complexes were positively associated with soil C and Fe(II) (AlR2 = .91; Fe(II):R-2 = .54-.60). Soil moisture, organo-Al, and reactive Fe explained most of the variation observed in soil C concentrations across all sites (p < .01). Reactive Fe was negatively correlated to soil C concentrations across sites, suggesting these Fe pools may drive additional C losses in drained soils and limit C sequestration with reflooding. In contrast, reactive organo-Al in drained soils facilitates C storage via aggregation and/or formation of anaerobic (micro)sites that protect residual soil C from oxidation and may at least partially offset C losses.

AB We have analyzed various methods and models for determining and calculating drainage module. The drainage module is an important indicator of the hydrogeological effect of drainage and soil drainage. For the calculation of the drainage calculation module, an empirical, analytical, water-balance method is used, or it is accepted on the recommendations without sufficient economic and environmentaljustification. This does not meet the modern requirements for the creation and operation of such objects. Traditionally, the designs and parameters of agricultural drainage are determined by the drainage module. It provides the necessary conditions for the removal of excess moisture of the active soil layer in the spring (as the main calculation) and corresponds to a certain level of the calculated security of the formation of the runoff hydrograph. According to the generalized results of the research, in the calculation of drainage parameters, the values of drainage modules were taken within: for mineral soils - 0.4... 0.6 I/s.ha, for peat soils 0.2... 0.6 I/s.ha. These recommended values are not correct because then the defined drainage parameters take into account only the technological conditions of its operation. But this does not take into account the conditions of formation of economic and environmental effect within the system, and they are not economically and environmentally optimal for the calculation of the drainage system and its elements. We have performed research and evaluation of the hydrogeological effect of the drainage and drainage systems. The results of these researches showed the variability of values of drainage modules in time and space. We have also identified many influencing factors and confirmed their difference with the calculated value. A new evaluation of the effectiveness of drainage systems and the calculation of drainage modules are proposed. This evaluation includes the yield criterion for variable natural (climatic) and agricultural conditions. New optimal values of drainage modules are proposed. These values are also presented for critical conditions (maximum daily rainfall of different levels of probability).

AB This study of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany is based on the national greenhouse gas inventory, which was compiled as part of a report the EU's National Inventory Report (NIR) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in order to collect and evaluate data about all direct GHG emissions from agriculture at the state level. The purpose of this anallysis was (1) to determine which GHG sources are the most important and should, therefore, be primarily considered for the implementation of mitigation strategies; and (2) to find any possible connections between structural and technological changes as well as changes in management which have influenced the amount of GHG emissions from the individual sources over the past years since 1990.
   A business ABC analysis was used to analyse the data from the NIR as it is a method which allows a rating of the sources and sinks for GHG emissions, thereby enabling their importance to be determined. Based on this approach, individual strategies for different countries can be evaluated in order to determine the proper strategy out of a portfolio of mitigation measures for each country.
   Out of a total of 30 individual sources identified in Germany using the ABC analysis, four GHG sources contributed to 63.2% of the total emissions from the agricultural sector: agriculturally used peat soils, entric fermentation of cattle, drainage of grassland and usage of mineral fertilizer In the MR, five emission categories are given; namely, manure management, enteric fermentation, agricultural soils, land use and land use change (LULUC), and fuels. The categories dealing with the utilization of farmland, namely agricultural soils and LULUC, were found to cause 68.6% of the total of GHG emissions from agriculture. lnterestingly, the consumption of fuels, even in a highly mechanised agricultural system such as that found in Germany, only represents 6% of the total GHG emissions from agriculture. Sinks ill Germany are minor (is they only sequestrate 1.5% (if the total emissions. The evaluation of the agricultural GHG emission changes ill Germany, which decreased by about 16.0% within the period from 1990 to 2004, shows that the biggest part of GHG emission mitigation has been based oil structural change rather than oil abatement measures.

AB In the UK, as organo-mineral soils are a significant store of soil organic carbon (SOC), they may become increasingly favoured for the expansion of upland forestry. It is important, therefore, to assess the likely impacts on SOC of this potentially major land use change. Currently, these assessments rely on modelling approaches which assume that afforestation of organo-mineral soils is 'carbon neutral'. This review evaluates this assumption in two ways. Firstly, UK information from the direct measurement of SOC change following afforestation is examined in the context of international studies. Secondly, UK data on the magnitude and direction of the major fluxes in the carbon cycle of semi-natural upland ecosystems are assessed to identify the likely responses of the fluxes to afforestation of organo-mineral soils. There are few directly relevant measurements of SOC change following afforestation of organo-mineral soils in the UK uplands but there are related studies on peat lands and agricultural soils. Overall, information on the magnitude and direction of change in SOC with afforestation is inconclusive. Data on the accumulation of litter beneath conifer stands have been identified but the extent to which the carbon held in this pool is incorporated into the stable soil carbon reservoir is uncertain. The effect of afforestation on most carbon fluxes is small because the fluxes are either relatively minor or of the same magnitude and direction irrespective of land use. Compared with undisturbed moorland, particulate organic carbon losses increase throughout the forest cycle but the data are exclusively from plantation conifer forests and in many cases pre-date current industry best practice guidelines which aim to reduce such losses. The biggest uncertainty in flux estimates is the relative magnitude of the sink for atmospheric carbon as trees grow and mature compared with that lost during site preparation and harvesting. Given the size of this flux relative to many of the others, this should be a focus for future carbon research on these systems.

AB Properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) determine its biodegradation. In turn, biodegradation changes the properties of the remaining DOM, which may be decisive for the formation of stable organic carbon in soil. To gain information on both mechanisms and controlling factors of DOM biodegradation and the properties of biodegraded DOM, we investigated changes in the composition of 13 different DOM samples extracted from maize straw, forest floors, peats, and agricultural soils during a 90-day incubation using UV absorbance, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, FTIR- spectroscopy, H-1-NMR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and C-13 natural abundance before and after incubation. Changes in the DOM properties were related to the extent of biodegradation determined by the release of CO2, Increasing UV absorption and humification indices deduced from fluorescence emission spectra. and increasing portions of aromatic H indicated relative enrichment of aromatic compounds during biodegradation. This enrichment significantly correlated with the amount of DOC mineralized suggesting that aromatic compounds were relatively stable and slowly mineralized. C-13 depletion during the incubation of highly degradable DOM solutions indicated an enrichment of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Py-FI mass spectra indicated increasing contents of phenols and lignin monomers at the expense of lignin dimers and alkylaromatics during incubation. This partial degradation of higher-molecular, lignin-derived DOM compounds was accompanied by relative increases in the proportions of lower-molecular degradation products and microbial metabolites. Carbohydrates, especially when abundant at high initial contents, seem to be the preferred substrate for microorganisms. However, four independent methods suggested also some microbial production of carbohydrates and peptides during DOM degradation. After incubation, the composition of highly degradable DOM samples became similar to relatively stable DOM samples with respect to aromaticity, carbohydrate content, and thermal stability. We conclude that DOM biodegradation seems to result in organic matter properties being a precondition for the formation of stable carbon. These structural changes induced by DOM biodegradation should also result in stronger DOM sorption to the soil matrix additionally affecting DOM stabilization. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB At the 21st session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, COP21), a voluntary action plan, the '4 per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate' was proposed under the Agenda for Action. The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious aspirational target of a 4 per 1000 (i.e. 0.4%) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO2 losses, e.g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target.

AB Global warming, altering the physiology and irrigation demand of grapevines, has already been perceived in certain premium viticulture regions across the world. Selection of proper rootstocks for especially new cultivars has vital role for asustainable viticulture under water-deficit conditions. The grapevine cultivar 'Michele Palieri' has been finding a good reception on the global markets. The objective of this study was to determine the response of 'Michele Palieri' cultivar to deficit irrigation using different rootstocks with distinct genetic origins. Two irrigation regimes (Full Irrigation [FI] and Deficit Irrigation [DI]) were applied to the vines of different grafting combinations of 'Michele Palieri' with Kober 5 BB, Richter 99, Richter 110, 140 Ruggeri, 44-53 Malegue or grown on own roots. Two years old vines were cultivated in 60L pots containing sterile peat under controlled glasshouse conditions. Irrigations were regulated according to soil water matric potential (m) levels using tensiometers. The volume of the irrigation water that has to be applied to attain 100% field capacity was performed as FI, while 50% of FI was considered as DI. The water was transported directly into the pots by micro-irrigation systems consisting of individual spaghetti tubes. The vines of DI treatment showed visible symptoms of mild water stress (e.g., loss of turgor in shoot tips), but no defoliation or leaf necrosis occurred. DI treatment reduced the gs of 'Michele Palieri' scion cultivar in varying levels depending on the rootstock. DI treatment also affected vegetative growth of the scion cultivar in different levels. For example, the greatest decrease (26.7%) in shoot length resulting from DI was determined in 'Michele Palieri'/5 BB grapevines, followed by own rooted vines (13.1%), while the lowest change (2.4%) was found in vines grafted on 110R. Overall findings of this study imply that the rootstocks originating from V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids (110R, 99R, 140Ru and 44-53M) better performed in a similar genetic aptitude under deficit irrigation regime while the rootstock 5 BB (V. berlandiery x V.rupestris) showed more susceptible responses. On the other hand, the general response of own rooted vines were better than those grafted on 5 BB. Therefore, the use of one of V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids may be abetter choice for viticulture under semiarid regions.

AB Mother plants were cultivated under two separate sets of conditions to establish the impact of exposure to different levels of light intensity on the storage and rooting of Plectranthus coleoides cuttings. One set of mother plants was cultivated in a climate chamber with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (Halogen HQI) for 12 h a day at a temperature of 20 degrees C simulating southern latitudes. The other set was exposed to climatic conditions in a greenhouse with an average PPFD of 84 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) per average daylength of 10.3 h and an average temperature of 16.6 degrees C simulating Central European conditions. Then, all cuttings were wrapped in polyethylene foil, stored for periods of 3, 4, 5, 6,7 or 14 d at temperatures of 1, 5 or 12 degrees C. For rhizogenese, they were inserted into a propagation substrate (white peat, perlite) and cultivated in the greenhouse at an average temperature of 20 degrees C and an average PPFD of 88 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).
   Damage to shoots was influenced by preharvest light conditions. Cuttings from the climate chamber (1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were particularly susceptible to a storage temperature of 5 degrees C, where they developed damaged shoots in faith; large numbers, whereas cuttings produced in the greenhouse (84 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were more susceptible to such damage at a storage temperature of 12 degrees C. Cuttings from both treatments did not differ in regards to rooting percentage when they were stored at 5 or 12 degrees C. Storage at 1 degrees C generally resulted in a large number of decayed cuttings during the rooting period, regardless of the preharvest conditions.
   The experiments demonstrated that exposure to high PPFD during the cultivation of stock plants and the cutting production stage resulted in a pronounced preference of the cuttings for certain storage temperatures. Plectranthus cuttings can be easily stored for 7 d without any adverse effect on duality; but the storage and transport temperatures will have to be adapted to the conditions under which the cuttings were produced. Storage and transport temperatures for cuttings produced in southern latitudes under high PPFD should not fall below 10 degrees C, whereas for cuttings produced under central European conditions in the winter and early spring, a storage and transport temperature of 5 degrees C is most suitable.

AB Root and shoot growth response of Eleocharis cellulosa and Rhynchospora tracyi, two wet prairie species from the Everglades, to water level and phosphate availability were examined in rhizotrons facilitating root growth analysis. Plants were cultivated in Everglades peat subjected to ambient (10 mug Pl(-1)) and high phosphorus (500 mug Pl(-1)) availability and three water levels (+45, +10 and -30 cm). Flooded conditions resulted in large increases in canopy height (from 60 to 80 cm), maximum shoot length (from 75 to 100 cm), and aboveground (from 8.5 to I I g), root (from 2.6 to 3.8 g), rhizome (from 1.1 to 1.6 g), and total (from 15 to 20 g) biomass in E cellulosa. Flooding also increased relative growth rate (RGR) in E. cellulosa from 0.012 to 0.016 g g(-1) per day and root densities at -10 cm, had no effect on shoot/root ratio, and root density at the 30 and 40 cm soil depths, but decreased relative biomass allocation to shoots from 0.77 to 0.73. In R. tracyi, flooded conditions resulted in an increase in shoot/root ratios from 5.1 to 6.7, and relative biomass allocation to shoots (from 0.75 to 0.81) as well as in canopy height (from 59 to 67 cm), had no effect on maximum shoot length, root porosity, aboveground biomass, rhizome and total biomass, but decreased root biomass (from 1.5 to 0.8 g), RGR of total biomass (from 0.017 to 0.014 g g(-1) per day), root density (from 22 to 6 at -10 cm) and relative biomass allocation to roots (from 0.06 to 0.04). High P-availability increased aboveground (+24%) and total biomass (+22%) and root density in both species (+60% in E. cellulosa and +80% in R. tracyi at -10 cm), but had no effect on canopy height, maximum shoot length, and root and rhizome biomass. In E. cellulosa, high P-availability increased RGR of total biomass from 0.012 to 0.016gg(-1) I per day, but did not influence shoot/root ratio and relative biomass allocation. High P-availability did not influence RGR of total biomass in R. tracyi, but increased shoot/root ratio from 4.3 to 6.6 and increased relative biomass allocation to shoots from 0.76 to 0.80. In E. cellulosa, flooding increased root porosity from 52 to 69%, but had no effect on shoot porosity. In R. tracyi, the opposite was the case (increase of shoot porosity from 19 to 29%). Neither root porosity nor shoot porosity was affected by high P-availability. The results indicate E. cellulosa is better adapted to higher water levels than R. tracyi. Consistently, E. cellulosa performed best under flooded conditions, while R. tracyi growth was better under drained conditions. Thus, the relative success of E. cellulosa and R. tracyi in the field may change with alterations in site hydrology and P-availability. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB We have studied the sulfur speciation and isotopic composition of two peat cores from Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA 2A) in the Florida Everglades. Core site El is affected by agricultural runoff from the Hillsboro Canal which drains the Everglades Agricultural Area; Core site U3 is distant from the canal and relatively unaffected by agricultural runoff, Depth profiles of the total sulfur content of both cores show fairly constant levels (similar to 0.7 wt.%) below about 25-30 cm depth in Core El and below 40-45 cm in Core U3. Above these depths, total sulfur increases to as much as 1.52 wt.% in Core El and 1.74 wt.% in Core U3, suggesting that more sulfur has entered the sediments and/or that more sulfur is being retained in recent times at both sampling sites. The changes in total sulfur content with depth in Core El correlate with changes in total phosphorus that have been observed in other studies at con sites near the Hillsboro Canal. This correlation of total sulfur with phosphorus with depth is not seen in Core U3 located away from the canal, possibly because phosphorus is more effectively retained than sulfur in the organic sediment near the canal. Organic-sulfur (OS) concentrations are at least twice as high as the disulfide-sulfur (DS) concentrations in the upper parts of both cores suggesting that iron is presently limiting the amount of disulfide minerals formed in these sediments. The degree of pyritization (DOP) in the upper parts of the cores suggest that sulfide mineralization is limited by the availability of highly reactive iron during the earliest stages of diagenesis. Positive delta(34)S values for reduced sulfur forms in both cores indicate a relatively restricted sulfate reservoir, consistent with nearly complete reduction of the sulfate available in the sediment at any given time. Differences between the two cores appear in the delta(34)S values for the near-surface sediments. The DS delta(34)S values in the upper 10.0 cm of sediment are more positive at site El, with a mean delta(34)S value of + 12.9 per mil, than at site U3, with a mean delta(34)S value of + 2.9 per mil. These results may indicate that increased rates of organic deposition due to nutrient loading near the canal have increased the rate of sulfate reduction at the El site in recent times. Acid-volatile-sulfide (AVS) concentrations are lower than DS and OS concentrations by at least a factor of 10. increasing delta(34)S values for AVS with increasing depth in both cores suggests ongoing reduction of a limited porewater sulfate reservoir after deposition. The disulfide and organic-sulfur delta(34)S values diverge from the delta(34)S values for AVS with depth, suggesting that most of the transformation of AVS into disulfide minerals or incorporation of sulfur into organic matter occurs in the near-surface sediments. A comparison of organic-sulfur delta(34)S values in the dominant flora at the U3 site (sawgrass leaves and periphyton) with organic-sulfur delta(34)S values at the top of the U3 core indicates that there was early incorporation of an isotopically light sulfide species into the organic matter.

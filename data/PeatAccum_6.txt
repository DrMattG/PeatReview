AB Coal-forming environments require humid to perhumid conditions. Tectonics governs the size, location and availability of coal seams developed in such environments. While large Pennsylvanian paralic basins generated thick and continuous coal seams, many other small coeval basins, which were tectonically active, developed a puzzling succession, with carbonaceous deposits that varied in size, thickness and the nature of the coal-forming flora. This study, conducted in the Penarroya-Belmez-Espiel coalfield, a Variscan strike-slip basin in the south of Spain, provides insights into this subject. The coal seams analysed, generated in different depositional environments, have quantitatively different palynological assemblages. Lacustrine coals are dominated by lycopsids; distal alluvial plain/marginal lacustrine coals are dominated by sphenophytes and tree ferns, and middle alluvial fan coals are dominated by sphenophytes, tree ferns and lycopsids. This means that when conditions were favourable for peat accumulation, peat accumulated regardless of the nature of the available flora.

ID CENTRAL APPALACHIAN BASIN; USA; PALEOECOLOGY; FACIES
AB Four channel-filling coal beds from the lower part of the Breathitt Formation (lower Middle Pennsylvanian, late Westphalian A) were examined palynologically, petrographically and geochemically to determine the paleoenvironmental conditions under which these peats accumulated. These results were then compared with detailed sedimentological analyses of the strata overlying the coal in the channels to see if any genetic relationship between coal composition and the origin of the overburden could be drawn.
   All four of the coal beds used in this study are located in the western-most part of the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field and occur at, or near, the Early Pennsylvanian unconformity (0-30 m). Lycospora and Densosporites (and related crassicingulate taxa, e.g. Cristatisporites, Cingulizonates and Radiizonates) dominate the studied assemblages, with Granulatisporites (and related trilete, sphaerotriangular genera, e.g. Leiotriletes and Lophotriletes), Laevigatosporites and Schulzospora being common accessory genera. Petrographically, all four coals contain high percentages of vitrinite macerals (avg. 78.6% mineral matter free), moderate amounts of Liptinite (or exinite) macerals (avg. 14.9%, mmf) and low percentages of inertinite macerals (avg. 6.5%, mmf).
   Strata above the coals consist of dark, carbonaceous shales, and heterolithic strata that exhibit varying degrees of bioturbation. Commonly occurring trace fossils include Arenicolites, Monocraterion, Planolites and Skolithos. Although marine-influenced strata, as determined from detailed sedimentology and ichnology (the study of trace fossils), covers all four coal beds, they are not uniformly high in total total sulfur content as might be expected. Rather they are extremely variable, ranging from 1-9% (dry basis) total sulfur. Ash yields are also variable ranging from 6.2-54.3% (dry basis). It is probable that the origin of the very first sediments covering the peat, as well as the amount of brackish water influence during peat accumulation, were important factors in determining the total sulfur content of the resultant coal. Initial sedimentation of fresh water clays and silts may have acted as a barrier to downward percolation/diffusion of sulfate bearing waters, or may have served as a site for sulfide formation, thereby keeping the total sulfur content of the underlying coal low. If initial sedimentation was of brackish or marine origin, as indicated by bioturbated laminae directly above the coal, or if the peat was subject to frequent brackish or marine water influence during accumulation, then sulfide generation might proceed unchecked, resulting in high sulfur coal.

AB The changes in dry matter (DM) yield, botanical composition and nutritive value of herbage to ruminants of two wet grasslands, Arrhenatherum elatius grassland (Experiment 1) and a Molinia caerulea fen meadow (Experiment 2), in which a range of cutting and fertilizer treatments were imposed in 1999, were assessed after 4-7 years of treatment imposition. Both experiments had a split-plot design with four replicates. In Experiment 1 the three main-plot cutting treatments were two cuts with a delayed first cut, three cuts and four cuts during the growing season of each year. In Experiment 2 the cutting treatments were two cuts with a traditional harvest time, two cuts with a delayed first cut and three cuts. The four sub-plot fertilizer treatments were an unfertilized control, application of a phosphorus and potassium (PK) fertilizer, application of a nitrogen (N) and PK fertilizer to the first cut only (N(1)PK) and application of PK plus N applied to each of two, three or four cuts (N(c)PK). Application of fertilizer influenced yield and botanical composition of herbage more than the cutting treatments while the opposite occurred for nutritive value of the herbage. Application of fertilizer increased the proportion of tall grasses in Experiment 1 and forbs in Experiment 2. The proportion of Equisetum palustre, present only in Experiment 1, was reduced from 0 center dot 33 to less than 0 center dot 01 by increased cutting frequency together with the NPK fertilizer treatments. In Experiment 1 diversity of vascular plants was negatively affected only by the four-cuts treatment while on both wet grasslands other cutting and fertilizer application treatments had no effect. Changes in DM yield of herbage caused by the cutting and fertilizer application treatments were similar for both vegetation types with DM yield increased significantly by fertilizer application but only slightly or not reduced by increasing the cutting frequency. Nutritive value of herbage was positively correlated with cutting frequency and was most influenced at the first cut.

AB There is some debate about the likelihood that soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of agricultural land decreases because of global warming and governmental restrictions on animal manure application rates in some countries.
   Here, we report on changes in the mean SOC contents of the top soils (0-5 cm) of grassland and the top soil (0-25 cm) of arable land in the Netherlands during the period 1984-2004, using a data base with similar to 2 million results of SOC determinations from farmers' fields. The analyses were made for all agricultural land on mineral soils and for agricultural land in 9 regions with distinct differences in mean soil textures and SOC contents (marine and riverine clay, peaty clays, reclaimed peat soils, and Aeolian sand and loess), and land uses (arable land and permanent grassland). Except for the regions with peaty clay and reclaimed peat soils, samples with SOC>125 g/kg were designated as peat and peaty soils and excluded from the analyses. Mean SOC content of soils under arable land in 2003 ranged from 13 to 22 g/kg for sand, loess and clay soils to 59 g/kg for reclaimed peat soils. Mean SOC content of soils under permanent grassland in 2003 ranged from 22 to 56 g/kg for sand and clay soils. The difference in mean SOC contents between grassland and arable land is in part related to the difference in sampling depth.
   Mean SOC contents of all mineral soils under grasslands and arable land tended to increase annually by 0.10 and 0.08 g/kg, respectively. We observed large differences in mean trends between regions. Regions with relatively low SOC contents tended to accrue C by up to 0.37 g/kg/year, while regions with relatively high SOC contents (e.g., peaty clays) tended to lose C by up to 0.98 g/kg/year.
   In conclusion, mean SOC contents of the top part of mineral soils of agricultural land in most regions in the Netherlands tended to increase slightly during the period 1984-2004. This result contrasts with reports from e.g., United Kingdom and Belgium that suggest decreasing C stocks in arable land possibly due to changes in land use and climate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Salix schwerinii was tested in a pot experiment to assess plant growth performance i.e., relative height and dry biomass and the potential for heavy metal uptake in soils polluted with chromium, zinc, copper, nickel and total petroleum hydrocarbons. The soil used in the pot experiment was collected from a landfill area in Finland. Peat soil was added at different quantities to the polluted soil to stimulate plant growth. The plants were irrigated with tap water or processed water (municipal waste water) to further investigate the effects of nutrient loading on plant biomass growth. The soil was treated at two pH levels (4 and 6). The results showed that the addition of 40-70% peat soil at pH 6 to a polluted soil, and irrigation with processed water accelerated plant growth and phytoextraction efficiency. In the pot experiment, Salix grown in chromium, zinc, copper, nickel and total petroleum hydrocarbons-contaminated field soil for 141 days were unaffected by the contaminated soil and took up excess nutrients from the soil and water. Total mean chromium concentration in the plant organs ranged from 17.05 to 250.45 mg kg(-1), mean zinc concentration ranged from 142.32 to 1616.59 mg kg(-1), mean copper concentration ranged from 12.11 to 223.74 mg kg(-1) and mean nickel concentration ranged from 10.11 to 75.90 mg kg(-1). Mean chromium concentration in the plant organs ranged from 46 to 94%, mean zinc concentration ranged from 44 to 76%, mean copper concentration ranged from 19 to 54% and mean nickel concentration ranged from 8 to 21% across all treatments. Under the different treatments, chromium was taken up by Salix in the largest quantities, followed by zinc, copper and nickel respectively. Salix also produced a moderate reduction in total petroleum total petroleum hydrocarbons in the polluted soil. The results from the pot experiment suggest that Salix schwerinii has the potential to accumulate significant amounts of chromium, zinc, copper and nickel. However, long term research is needed to verify the phytoextraction abilities of Salix observed in the pot experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands in the polar desert environment of the High Arctic provide a special ecological niche for the tundra plants, insects, birds, and animals. Non-tidal patchy wetlands exhibit a hydrologic regime that includes a high water table and extensive flooding in the snowmelt period, followed by a gradual summer drying that is interrupted by rainfall events that raise water levels. These wetlands are also prone to inter-annual variations in wetness. Given sufficient local water supply, they are self-sustaining entities in which soil saturation favors ground ice formation, but the ice-rich permafrost prevents deep percolation while vegetation growth and peat development further insulate the ground. Several processes can alter this balance: a change in drainage can reduce inflow; excessive melting of ground ice leading to thermokarst can modify wetland morphology and flow pattern. On a regional scale, projected climatic warming of the Arctic may extend the thawed season, enhance evaporation, and eliminate the late-lying snowbanks that feed some patchy wetlands. Under such a scenario, patchy wetlands in the High Arctic are considered to be highly vulnerable.

AB Archaeological excavations and environment-archaeology studies over many years in the Yangtze Delta region have provided exceptional information about climatic variations, growth and demise of human civilization and human-environment interactions. The archaeological excavations show that the cultural layers of the Neolithic sites are interrupted by barren layers without any cultural relics (so-called cultural interruptions), which may be the result of harsh environmental conditions (arid; flooding, extreme cold or warmth). Temporal and spatial analyses of 14 C-dates for buried trees, peat, shell ridges, and Neolithic sites show that environmental changes are responsible for the rise and fall of human civilization. The progress of human civilization was interrupted at least 5 times in the Yangtze Delta, matching 5 periods of high sea level, peat accumulation, and burial of trees. The collapse of the Liangzhu culture about 4000 BP was followed by the less-developed Maqiao culture and resulted from extreme environmental and hydrological conditions such as floods.

AB The feasibility of incorporating vermicompost as a plant growth promoter into pine (Plans Ait.) nurseries was investigated. Pines were grown in conventional peat-based nursery potting media where the peat was substituted by 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 25% solid vermicompost. In addition, in order distinguish between possible physical and biochemical mechanisms, the effects of solid vermicompost and vermicompost extracts on pine seedling growth were compared. Five different open-pollinated pine progenies were used in order to evaluate the possible genotype-dependent effects of vermicompost. All pots were provided with adequate mineral fertilization in order to avoid nutrient limitations and arranged in the greenhouse following a bifactorial randomized block design. Twenty weeks after sowing, seedlings were harvested and their aerial and root growth were measured, as well as biomass partitioning and seedling maturity. Amendment with solid vermicompost at 2.5% and 10% significantly stimulated pine seedling height, but not aerial biomass. Vermicompost also produced seedlings with greater shoot:root biomass ratios than the control. Besides, we noticed a significant inhibition of aerial and root biomass with the higher dose of solid vermicompost (25% substrate substitution). No effects, either positive or negative, were detected in plant growth due to the vermicompost extracts. All the reported results were the same for all the different progenies assayed, and therefore no genotype dependent effects were detected.

AB Fate monitoring data on anaerobic transformation of the benzimidazole anthelmintics flubendazole (FLU) and fenbendazole (FEN) in liquid pig manure and aerobic transformation and sorption in soil and manured soil under laboratory conditions were used for corresponding fate modeling. Processes considered were reversible and irreversible sequestration, mineralization, and metabolization, from which a set of up to 50 different models, both nested and concurrent, was assembled. Five selection criteria served for model selection after parameter fitting: the coefficient of determination, modeling efficiency, a likelihood ratio test, an information criterion, and a determinability measure. From the set of models selected, processes were classified as essential or sufficient. This strategy to identify process dominance was corroborated through application to data from analogous experiments for sulfadiazine and a comparison with established fate models for this substance. For both, FLU and EN, model selection performance was fine, including indication of weak data support where observed. For FLU reversible and irreversible sequestration in a nonextractable fraction was determined. In particular, both the extractable and the nonextractable fraction were equally sufficient sources for irreversible sequestration. For FEN generally reversible formation of the extractable sulfoxide metabolite and reversible sequestration of both the parent and the metabolite were dominant. Similar to FLU, irreversible sequestration in the nonextractable fraction was determined for which both the extractable or the nonextractable fraction were equally sufficient sources. Formation of the sulfone metabolite was determined as irreversible, originating from the first metabolite. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of fire in land management has come under increasing scrutiny with regard to its potential effects on sustainability and climate change. Moorlands in the United Kingdom have traditionally used rotational burning of the heather (Calluna vulgaris) to improve the grazing and habitat, especially for grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus). However, these ecosystems overlie carbon-rich soils and concerns have been raised about the merits of this practice. In order to assess the impact of rotational burning on carbon balance, an investigation was undertaken on a grouse moor in the Yorkshire Dales, UK. This showed that the quantity of carbon stored above ground in heather biomass ranged from 600 to 1325 g C/m(2) (typical for UK upland heaths). However, the national UK carbon inventory assumes 200 g C/m(2), thereby appearing to underestimate considerably the importance of these habitats for carbon storage above ground.
   Analysis of 2 burns in subsequent years showed that 16 +/- 4% and 24 +/- 5% (+/- s.e.) of the above-ground material was consumed in the fires, resulting in the direct release of 103 +/- 22 and 201 +/- 62 g/m(2) of carbon, respectively. Indirect carbon losses, which other studies have shown to be primarily due to erosion, were estimated to release another 5-21 g C/m(2). year. The significance of other major greenhouse gas fluxes was assessed for the whole system using published parameters and models. We show that, over the burning cycle of 15-20 years, losses of carbon from burning are < 10% of the total losses of carbon from the system, implying that careful burning management at this site does not have a major detrimental effect on the carbon budget, which for this moor lies within the range of an annual net loss of 34 g C/m(2). year to a net uptake of 146 g C/m(2) year.

AB Between June and August 1990, observations were made at two surface micrometeorological towers near Schefferville Quebec (54 degrees 52N, 66 degrees 40.5W), one in a fen and one in the subarctic lichen woodland, and at four surface climatological stations. Data from these surface stations were supplemented by regular radiosonde launches. Supporting measurements of radiative components and soil temperatures allowed heat and moisture balances to be obtained at two sites. The overall surface meteorological experiment design and results of micrometeorological observations made on a 30-m tower in the lichen woodland are presented here. Seasonal variation in the heat and water vapor transport characteristics illustrate the marked effect of the late summer climatological shift in air mass type. During the first half of the summer, average valley sidewalls only 100 m high are sufficient to channel winds along the valley in the entire convective boundary layer. Channeling effects at the surface, known for some time at the long-term climate station in Schefferville, are observed both at ridge top and in the valley, possibly the response of the flow to the NW-SE orientation of valleys in the region. Diurnal surface temperature amplitude at ridg0e top (approximate to 10 degrees C) was found to be half that observed in the valley. Relatively large differences in precipitation among these stations and the climatological station at Schefferville airport were observed and attributed to the local topography. Eddy correlation observations of the heat, moisture and momentum transports were obtained from a 30-m tower above a sparse (approximate to 616 stems/ha) black spruce lichen woodland. Properties of the turbulent surface boundary layer agree well with previous wind tunnel studies over idealized rough surfaces. Daytime Bowen ratios of 2.5-3 are larger than those reported in previous studies. Surface layer flux data quality was assessed by looking at the surface layer heat balance. Diurnal and seasonal scale heat budget imbalances were found. We suggest that unmeasured surface heat storage may be responsible for some of the observed imbalance. The presence of the unexplained residual in this and other studies of energy balance over forests casts a note of caution on the interpretation of energy balance components obtained using heat residual methods.

AB Waste management is an increasingly important problem in many developed countries and much effort is currently being expended into identifying novel uses for waste products. We consider the effects of substituting proportions of earthworm-digested composted green waste (vermicompost) into commercial peat based growing media on the germination, growth, and productivity of Helianthus annitus, Cosmos bipinnatus and Eschscholzia californica. The percentage germination, time to flowering, seed production, overall heights and biomass were measured for all three species in treatments of commercial peat based growing media where the growth medium was substituted with vermicompost at rates of 09%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 100%. In addition, the total numbers of inflorescences was recorded in multiple flowering species. Results for Helianthus suggest that while vermicompost additions induced small species specific growth responses in germination rate, growth rate, overall height and total biomass, none were statistically significant. For Cosmos there was a significant increase in early plant growth rate and in the final flower numbers at substitution rates of 20% and 40% vermicompost. The total biomass and numbers of flowers produced by Eschscholzia was decreased significantly by substitution of 20% and 40% vermicompost. We conclude that the plant growth enhancement properties of this vermicompost seem more species specific than previously reported. Further, in order to preserve consumer confidence in waste-derived horticulture products, vermicompost marketing strategies should acknowledge these findings.

AB Experimental flooding of a boreal forest wetland caused the wetland to change from being a small, natural carbon sink, with respect to the atmosphere, of -6.6 g of C m(-2) yr(-1) to a large source of +130 g of C m(-2) yr(-1). This change was caused by the death of the vegetation, which eliminated the photosynthetic CO2 sink and stimulated the microbial production of CO2 and CH4 from decomposition of plant tissues and peat. Another type of microbial activity that increased was the methylation of inorganic mercury to the much more toxic methyl mercury (MeHg) form. The wetland was a source of MeHg prior to flooding and became an even larger source (39 fold) after flooding. MeHg concentrations in the water sometimes exceeded 2 ng L-1, with the average being 0.9 ng L-1 in the first 2 years after flooding. MeHg also increased in the flooded vegetation and peat, in lower food chain organisms, and in fish. Two recommendations, which should minimize both greenhouse gas production and MeHg production in reservoirs, can be made: (1) minimize the total area of land flooded (i.e., avoid flooding areas of low relief) and (2) minimize the flooding of wetlands, which contain larger quantities of organic carbon than uplands and are sites of intense production of MeHg.

AB Sorption of alpha-endosulfan by kaolinite and montmorillonite alone and in the presence of sorbed and dissolved humic acid (HA) was investigated (pH 8 and 25 degrees C). Three types of HA, Elliot soil HA (EHA), Peat HA (PHA), and Summit Hill HA (SHHA), were used to represent typical humic substances found in soils. For sorption of HA by either mineral, Freundlich sorption coefficient (K-f) values appeared to decrease in the order of EHA > PHA > SHHA, which followed increasing polarity (expressed as the O/C atomic ratio) and decreasing percent-carbon content. For both clays, sorption of alpha-endosulfan by the HA mineral complex was greater than for sorption by the clay alone. Sorption of alpha-endosulfan by the HA mineral complexes followed the same order as the K-f of the HAs (EHA > PHA > SHHA). Based on the amount of HA adsorbed by each mineral, organic carbon partition coefficients (K-OC) were determined for sorption of alpha-endosulfan by two of the HA mineral complexes. The value of K-OC for aendosulfan sorption was greater for kaolinite EHA than kaolinite SHHA. However, the opposite trend was found with the montmorillonite HA complexes. Montmorillonite appeared to sorb alpha-endosulfan and/or HA with higher affinity than kaolinite, which likely is due to its 2:1 layer structure and higher surface area. Sorption of endosulfan diol, a hydrolysis product, by the minerals was much less than the parent pesticide.

AB Wetlands are important dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoirs, and principal sources of DOC to the fluvial environment, constituting a significant linkage between land and ocean in the context of global carbon cycle. The Sanjiang Plain, a floodplain in Northeastern China that encompasses numerous natural freshwater wetlands, has been experiencing extensive building of drainage ditches and thus elevated degradation of wetlands. This paper investigated DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved total carbon (DTC) in soil, the surface ponding and rivers from natural wetlands and the degraded wet-land, and also in an artificial drainage ditch in the Sanjiang Plain during the growing season (May to October) of 2009. Seasonal averaged DOC concentrations were greater in soil and the surface ponding of the degraded riparian wetland than those originating from the natural riparian wetlands (i.e. Bielahong, Yalv and Nongjiang riparian wetlands). Seasonal averaged DIC concentrations in the surface ponding of the degraded wetland increased by 1.76, 0.59 and 2.05 times, compared to those in the Bielahong, Yalv and Nongjiang riparian wetlands, respectively. Similar to dissolved carbon dynamics in the field sites, the seasonal averaged DOC concentration in the degraded marshy river showed higher value (10.36 +/- 1.99 mg/L), compared to those in the pristine marshy rivers. Seasonal DIC concentrations followed a trend as the degraded marshy river (15.09 +/- 2.43 mg/L) - the artificial ditch (12.52 +/- 1.61 mg/L) - pristine marshy rivers on average (8.53 +/- 0.96 mg/L). Seasonal mean DTC concentration in the artificial ditch showed higher values than that in the natural marshy rivers, while seasonal mean DTC concentration in the degraded marshy river was greater than that in the artificial ditch. Further, seasonal DOC and DIC dynamics were similar in the artificial ditch and the degraded marshy river. These qualitative changes in the dissolved carbon dynamics in our study might have important implications that the impact of building of artificial ditches on dissolved carbon of waters more fully reflected in increases of dissolved carbon resulting from wetland degradation rather than increases in the artificial ditch itself.

The organic carbon content (TOC) and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the sandy sediments were low (TOC, 100-300 mu g C (g DW)(-1); CEC, 0.1-0.5 meg per 100 g DW) and correlated fairly well with the geology. Processes in the contaminant plume caused depletion of oxidation capacity and precipitation of reduced iron and sulfur species. However, some of these parameters were also affected by the geology, e.g. the oxidation capacity (OXC) was significantly higher in the Quaternary layer (OXC, 14-35 mu eq g DW-1) than in the Tertiary sand layer (OXC, < 5 mu eq g DW-1). The intermediate layers (silt/clay and brown coal) have significantly higher values of most of the parameters investigated. This work demonstrates the need for a small scale geological model and a detailed mapping of the geochemistry of the sediments in order to distinguish impacts caused by the contaminant plumes from natural variations in the aquifer geochemistry.

TI Warming Effects of Spring Rainfall Increase Methane Emissions From
   Thawing Permafrost

AB Methane emissions regulate the near-term global warming potential of permafrost thaw, particularly where loss of ice-rich permafrost converts forest and tundra into wetlands. Northern latitudes are expected to get warmer and wetter, and while there is consensus that warming will increase thaw and methane emissions, effects of increased precipitation are uncertain. At a thawing wetland complex in Interior Alaska, we found that interactions between rain and deep soil temperatures controlled methane emissions. In rainy years, recharge from the watershed rapidly altered wetland soil temperatures, warming the top similar to 80 cm of soil in spring and summer and cooling it in autumn. When soils were warmed by spring rainfall, methane emissions increased by similar to 30%. The warm, deep soils early in the growing season likely supported both microbial and plant processes that enhanced emissions. Our study identifies an important and unconsidered role of rain in governing the radiative forcing of thawing permafrost landscapes.
   Plain Language Summary Because the world is getting warmer, permanently frozen ground around the arctic, known as permafrost, is thawing. When permafrost thaws, the ground collapses and sinks. Often a wetland forms within the collapsed area. Conversion of permanently frozen landscapes to wetlands changes the exchange of greenhouse gases between the land and atmosphere, which impacts global temperatures. Wetlands release methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. The ability of methane to warm the Earth is 32 times stronger than that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years. In our study, we found that methane release from a thaw wetland in Interior Alaska was greater in rainy years when rain fell in spring. When spring rainwater entered the wetland, it rapidly warmed wetland soils. Rain has roughly the same temperature as the air, and during springtime in northern regions, the air is warmer than the ground. The microbial and plant processes that generate methane increase with temperature. Therefore, wetland soils, warmed by spring rainfall, supported more methane production and release. Northern regions are expected to receive more rainfall in the future. By warming soils and increasing methane release, this rainfall could increase near-term global warming associated with permafrost thaw.

AB Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of organic pollutants to soil biota, often required by risk assessment, are mostly obtained in non-sterile laboratory-contaminated artificial soils. However, microbial degradation has been indicated by many authors to influence the fate of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in soils. A question arises if the microbial community of peat which is used for artificial soil preparation affects the measured values of BAFs. In this study the effect of soil microorganisms on bioavailability of HOCs was studied and a portion of each soil was sterilized by gamma irradiation. Results indicated that the sterilization process significantly affected the fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; phenanthrene and pyrene) and increased bioavailability of these compounds to earthworms with BAFs several times higher in the sterile soils compared to their non-sterile variants. This suggests that sterilization of soils can be used as the "worst-case scenario" for laboratory tests of toxicity or bioaccumulation of biodegradable HOCs such as PAHs. It represents a situation of limited microbial degradation resulting in higher bioavailable fractions to other organisms (e.g. invertebrates). This may be the case in soils where microbial communities face stresses caused by contamination or land management. The bioavailability of chlorinated HOCs (lindane, 4,4'-DDT and PCB 153) was not affected by sterilization, as their BAFs were similar in the sterile and non-sterile soils during the experiment.

AB Peatlands are known to perform essential economical, societal and regulating functions. Once they are drained to provide optimal crop growth conditions, however, a series of degradation processes is generated. Wind and water erosion, subsidence and soil organic matter oxidation are the main causes of degradation observed in cultivated histosols. This study evaluated the decomposition dynamics and chemical changes of three biomass crops during an in-situ incubation in a cultivated histosol. The decomposition dynamics characterized in the field study were then used in a simulation to determine if sustainability could be reached by using biomass crops as a soil amendment. The results showed that an exponential decay fitting curve best represented the weight loss of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] in the in-situ bags over time, while a logistic fitting curve best represented that of miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) and willow (Salix miyabeana). The quality of the crop determined the initial and overall decomposition dynamics observed. The loss of carbon from the crushed biomass crop was much more important in sorghum than in miscanthus and willow. The long-term simulation of histosol amendment revealed that using miscanthus and willow at input rates of 7.5 and 10 T of carbon per year, respectively, would be sufficient to ensure sustainability. Improving knowledge on carbon loss in cultivated histosols as related to soil and crop management would help in developing a soil amendment program at the farm scale. In addition, more knowledge is needed to determine the impact of long-term and successive amendment with biomass crops on the physical and biochemical properties of histosols.

DE Adsorbent characteristics; Adsorption; Biosorbents; Hydrochar; Surface
   analysis
AB Surface structure and chemical properties of adsorbents are important factors required to understand the mechanism of adsorption. The purpose of this study was to produce hydrochars from biomass using hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) and to analyse their sorption capacities. The biomass used in this study were coco-peat (CP), coconut shell (CS), eggshell (ES), rice husk (RH) and lemon peel (LP). The operating conditions for HTC were 200 degrees C and 20 h residence time. The characterisation methods consisted of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared Ray (FTIR) Spectroscopy, and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET). The results showed that HTC improved the sorption capacities of the biomass wastes. It was found that hydrochars were crispy and flaky with more micro- and meso-porous structures, indicating that lignin and other components were denatured due to carbonisation. This led to the creation of more active sites for sorption and pollutant binding. The hydrochars showed a percentage increase in carbon content and a decrease in oxygen content with traces of other elements, compared to their corresponding raw biomass. The major functional groups identified were -OH and -COOH. The surface area of the hydrochars which include CP (2.14 m(2)/g), CS (14.04 m(2)/g), ES (0.50 m(2)/g), RH (15.74 m(2)/g), and LP (6.89 m(2)/g) were significantly improved compared with those of the raw biomass. The study showed that the hydrochars produced from the biomass wastes have the potential to be used as adsorbents.

AB Switchgrass is a high yielding, low-input intensive, native perennial grass that has been promoted as a major second-generation bioenergy crop. Raw switchgrass is not a readily acceptable feedstock in existing power plants that were built to accommodate coal and peat. The objective of this research was to elucidate some of the characteristics of switchgrass biochar produced via carbonization and to explore its potential use as a solid fuel. Samples were carbonized in a batch reactor under reactor temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 degrees C for 1, 2 and 3 h residence times. Biochar mass yield and volatile solids decreased from 82.6% to 35.2% and from 72.1% to 43.9%, respectively, by increasing carbonization temperatures from 300 degrees C to 400 degrees C and residence times from 1 h to 3 h. Conversely, biochar heating value (HV) and fixed carbon content increased from 17.6 MJ kg(-1) to 21.9 MJ kg(-1) and from 22.5% to 44.9%, respectively, under the same conditions. A biomass discoloration index (BDI) was created to quantify changes in biochar colors as affected by the two tested parameters. The maximum BDI of 77% was achieved at a carbonization temperature of 400 degrees C and a residence time of 3 h. The use of this index could be expanded to quantify biochar characteristics as affected by thermochemical treatments. Carbonized biochar could be considered a high quality solid fuel based on its energy content.

AB Bitumen extraction via surface mining has affected nearly 1000 km(2) of boreal forest habitat in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, pushing entire ecosystems back to the primary stages of forest and soil succession. Previous work in the Athabasca oil sands region has investigated the influence of vegetation, mineral reclamation material, and peat cover soil on microbial communities and the quality of soil carbon. No research has been conducted to assess the bioindicator potential of soil fauna, specifically oribatid mites, in these reclaimed soils. This study investigated the influence of time-since-reclamation (8-31 yrs.) and canopy type (white spruce (Picea glatica (Moench) Voss), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides, Michx)) on the abundance and diversity of oribatid mite adults >= 300 pm in size after land reclamation in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region. Thickness of the forest floor accumulating on top of the peat cover soil at the reclaimed sites was the most powerful predictor of oribatid mite richness, and was a better predictor than time-since-reclamation. A forest floor with a thickness >= 2 cm strongly increased oribatid mite abundance to levels higher than those found in the forest floors of natural, undisturbed stands in the area. Species richness in the ( >= 2 cm thick) forest floor within reclaimed stands was slightly lower than within natural stands but was notably higher than in the peat cover soil. Assemblage diversity followed the same trend as species richness, and mite diversity in the forest floor with a thickness >= 2 cm in reclaimed stands was the most similar to natural stands. Four of the six reclaimed stands with a forest floor thickness >= 2 cm were aspen stands, and increased aspen density may aid in faster reestablishment of oribatid mite communities after oil sands mining.

The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

AB Restoration can be viewed as the process of reestablishing both exogenous drivers and internal feedbacks that maintain ecosystems in a desirable state. Correcting exogenous and abiotic drivers is clearly necessary, but may be insufficient to achieve desired outcomes in systems with self-organizing biotic feedbacks that substantially influence ecological stability and timing of responses. Evidence from a broad suite of systems demonstrates the prevalence of biotic control over key ecosystem attributes such as hydroperiod, nutrient gradients, and landform that are most commonly conceived of as exogenously controlled. While a general theory to predict conditions under which biotic controls exert such strong feedbacks is still nascent, it appears clear that the Greater Everglades/South Florida landscape has a high density of such effects. The authors focus on three examples of biotic control over abiotic processes: hydroperiod and discharge controls exerted by peat accretion in the ridge-slough landscape; phosphorus (P) gradients that emerge, at least in part, from interactions between accelerated peat accretion rates, vegetation structure and fauna; and reinforcing feedbacks among land elevation, aquatic respiration, and carbonate dissolution that produce local and landscape basin structure. The authors propose that the unifying theme of biogeomorphic landforms in South Florida is low extant topographic variability, which allows reciprocal biotic modification of local site conditions via mechanisms of peat accretion (including via effects of landscape P redistribution on primary production) or limestone dissolution. Coupling these local positive feedbacks, which drive patch expansion, with inhibitory or negative feedbacks on site suitability at distance, which serve to constrain patch expansion, provide the mechanistic basis for landscape pattern formation. The spatial attributes (range and isotropy) of the distal negative feedback, in particular, control pattern geometry; elucidating the mechanisms and properties of these distal feedbacks is critical to restoration planning.

AB To evaluate the response of soil respiration and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission to soil moisture, temperature and nitrogen fertilization, and to estimate the contribution of soil and rhizosphere to total soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted in the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the northeast of China. The experiment included four treatments: bare soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (CK), and maize-cropped soils amended with 0 (N0), 150 (N150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha-1 yr-1. The cumulative soil CO2 emission in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments was estimated to be 698, 863, 962, and 854 g CO2 C m-2, respectively. The seasonal soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by soil temperature, with a Q10 value between 1.99 and 2.47. Analysis of the stepwise regression indicated that the CO2 flux can be quantitatively described by a linear combination of soil moisture content and soil temperature 5 cm below ground. Approximately 70, 58, 60, and 44% of the variability in CO2 flux can be explained by these two parameters, in CK, N0, N150, and N250, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased CO2 fluxes by 14.5% compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, in the soil fertilized with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1, high N fertilization suppressed soil respiration. There was an exponential relationship between soil temperature 5 cm below ground and N2O flux, with a Q10 value of 1.30-2.91. Mean cumulative soil N2O emissions during the maize-growing season in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments were estimated to be 86, 44, 200, and 484 mg N2O-N m-2, respectively. In contrast to the maize planting, soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased N2O fluxes by 354 and 1000%, compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Soil respiration and N2O fluxes measurement using the root-exclusion technique indicated that the rhizosphere of the maize could be the dominant habitat of soil respiration and N2O formation.

AB Understanding relations between climate and pollen production is important for several societal and ecological challenges, importantly pollen forecasting for pollinosis treatment, forensic studies, global change biology, and high-resolution palaeoecological studies of past vegetation and climate fluctuations. For these purposes, we investigate the role of climate variables on annual-scale variations in pollen influx, test the regional consistency of observed patterns, and evaluate the potential to reconstruct high-frequency signals from sediment archives. A 43-year pollen-trap record from the Netherlands is used to investigate relations between annual pollen influx, climate variables (monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation values), and the North Atlantic Oscillation climate index. Spearman rank correlation analysis shows that specifically in Alnus, Betula, Corylus, Fraxinus, Quercus and Plantago both temperature in the year prior to (T-1), as well as in the growing season (T), are highly significant factors (T-April r(s) between 0.30 [P<0.05[ and 0.58 [P<0.0001]; TJuli-1 rs between 0.32 [P<0.05[and 0.56 [P<0.0001]) in the annual pollen influx of wind-pollinated plants. Total annual pollen prediction models based on multiple climate variables yield R-2 between 0.38 and 0.62 (P<0.0001). The effect of precipitation is minimal. A second trapping station in the SE Netherlands, shows consistent trends and annual variability, suggesting the climate factors are regionally relevant. Summer temperature is thought to influence the formation of reproductive structures, while temperature during the flowering season influences pollen release. This study provides a first predictive model for seasonal pollen forecasting, and also aides forensic studies. Furthermore, variations in pollen accumulation rates from a sub-fossil peat deposit are comparable with the pollen trap data. This suggests that high frequency variability pollen records from natural archives reflect annual past climate variability, and can be used in palaeoecological and -climatological studies to bridge between population- and species-scale responses to climate forcing.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) of an Antarctic Pergelic Cryohemist was studied with special emphasis on soil formation processes under extreme climate conditions. An integrated approach using wet-chemical analyses, cross polarization magic angle spinning carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CPMAS C-13-NMR), and pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) was applied to characterize the SOM composition at different depths. Dead mosses material are the source of fresh organic matter for soil formation in the Pergelic Cryohemist. Polysaccharides are the primary organic compounds. This composition is very similar to that of litter from peat soils in temperate climate regions. In addition protein and alkyl carbon are found in the mosses, whereas in contrast to temperate climate zones lignin was of minor importance. The alkyl compounds consist of lipids, fatty acids, and sterols. A high amount of carboxyl groups probably develops from fatty acids and proteins and the aromatic structures mainly from aromatic amino acids. Changes in the SOM morphology were not confirmed with the classical wet chemical analysis but were confirmed by CPMAS-C-13-NMR and Py-FIMS. Carbohydrates are less mineralized than under temperate climate conditions. Alkyl carbon units are enriched due to selective preservation. During advanced humification the alkyl carbon units are probably incorporated into the complex humic matter. The drastic increase of alkyl-C with peat depth has been described also for peat soils in temperate climate zones. The aromatic structures identified demonstrate that lignin input is not necessary for the formation of aromatic humics. The chemical degradation of the organic matter is not as intensive as in soils of temperate climate regimes. The extremely cold climate conditions retard the transformation of fresh organic residues. Therefore in this Antarctic peaty soil, carbohydrates dominate in the composition of the SOM also in the deeper horizons.

AB On the Hope River segment of the Hope Fault, west of Hanmer Springs, New Zealand, a 36 m dextral offset of a dated river terrace riser indicates an average local late Holocene horizontal slip-rate of 10.5 +/- 0.5 m/kyr.  A trench excavated across the fault in a nearby swamp revealed five silt layers within a 1.5 m thick column of peat.  Radiocarbon dates and plant pollen indicate that the base of the swamp is approximately 700 years old, so peat has accumulated at an average rate of 2.35 +/- 0.6 mm/yr.  The youngest silt layer was probably derived from a landslide triggered during an M 7-7.3 earthquake in 1888 AD, and the older silt layers are attributed to similar prehistoric (pre-1850 AD) earthquakes.  Pollen from the lowest silt shows brief local dominance of lacebark (Hoheria cf. H. lyalli) during a phase of former beech (Nothofagus) forest.  Sharp increases in the percentage of matagouri (Discaria toumatou) pollen follow the younger silt layers, which were deposited during a later period of fire-induced shrubland.  Both lacebark and matagouri are vigorous colonisers of bared ground, and matagouri presently forms the dominant plant cover on fault scarps and landslides known to have been bared during the 1888 earthquake.  We infer that this pattern of plant succession on bared sites has followed repeated surface rupture along this segment of the Hope Fault.  The vertical spacing of the silt layers, and our calculated mean peat accumulation rate, indicate a recurrence interval for silt deposition of 81-200 years, and support a model proposing that the 1888 earthquake was a characteristic event for the Hope River segment of the Hope Fault.

AB In a glasshouse experiment, the effectiveness of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) was compared with abamectin for the control of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) on slicer cucumbers. In a period from mid June to the end of August, cucumbers were grown in four different growth substrates: expanded perlite, expanded vermiculite, light expanded clay aggregate and peat. A suspension of entomopathogenic nematodes (2500 infective juveniles ml(-1)) was applied to cucumber leaves nine times in one growing season, whilst insecticide at recommended dose (22.5 g a.i. ha(-1)) was used three times. A significant effect of the extent of pest damage to the leaves (assessed by a six grade scale) was determined only for treatment type (nematodes, insecticide and untreated control), but not for the type of growth substrate or the damage evaluation date (16 July, 3 August, and 23 August). The leaves of cucumbers treated with nematodes and insecticide were significantly less damaged than untreated plants, with damage never exceeding 10% of the leaf surface. Nevertheless, type of growth substrate showed a significant effect on the number of fruits as well as on the mean mass of fruits. Light expanded clay aggregate was seen to be the least appropriate growth substrate, whilst the other three substrates can all be recommended for cucumber growing. The mean mass of fruits was also significantly influenced by type of suppression, with the mean mass of fruits in treated plants being significantly higher (from 7 up to 5 1%) than in untreated plants. The mean number of fruits per plant did not differ significantly between different types of pest suppression. Spraying nine times with nematodes and three times with abamectin gave similar efficacy against western flower thrips on glasshouse-grown slicer cucumbers.

AB Quality control of growing media mainly consists of chemical analysis and plant assays, which are time-consuming and expensive. Objectives were to test, if near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is capable to predict several chemical characteristics and plant assay results for a large population of various peat-based growing media having a wide range of humification degrees and characteristics (n=320). Near-infrared measurements (including the visible range, 4002,500 nm) were done with fresh and with dried and ground growing media in order to predict their chemical characteristics and the results of plant assays using Chinese white cabbage (Brassica napus var. Chinensis). Spectral manipulations (taking 1(st) to 3(rd) derivative after baseline correction), cross-validation and a modified partial-least squares regression method were used to develop equations over the whole spectrum. Generally, NIRS predicted the chemical characteristics of growing media and the yields of fresh weight of Chinese white cabbage and rating better for fresh than for dried and ground samples. The pH and contents of total carbon and nitrogen, salt, P, K, mineral nitrogen, NO3-, NH4+ and the NH4+:NO3- ratio were predicted well: the RSC (ratio of standard deviation of laboratory results to the standard error of cross-validation) ranged between 2.0 (NO3-) and 4.4 (total carbon), the correlation coefficient (r) of measured against predicted values was higher or equal to 0.9 and the regression coefficient (a) was between 0. 9 and 1. 1. The good predictions of total carbon content may have been partly due to a clustering of data. Fresh weight yield of Chinese white cabbage was predicted well for the subpopulation of the growing medium with a degree of humification of H2 to H3 on the von Post humification scale (RSC=2.0, r=0.9 and a=0.9). The fresh weight yields for the subpopulations of growing media with H5 to H6 and with H7 were predicted satisfactorily (RSC =1.6 and 1.9, respectively). The prediction of the rating at harvest (overall plant impression) was satisfactorily for two subpopulations (RSC=1.7, r=0.8 and a=0.9 or 1.0) but unsatisfactory for the one with H5 to H6 (RSC=1.3). Overall, NIRS is sufficiently reliable to be used for standard chemical analysis for growing media and it is promising in predicting the results of plant assays.

AB This study was conducted in a greenhouse in Izmir/Turkey during the winter-early spring of 2016-2017, on spinach grown in the floating water culture system. Cultivation was carried out in aerated nutrient solutions on seedling trays, and peat was used as germination and rooting medium. Each seed was inserted to each hole (17 cc) in trays with 210 cells (957 plant m(-2)). Following germination in the germination chamber, trays were moved to climate controlled greenhouse. After emergence, the seedlings were transferred to water culture on 07.12.2016 and 10.03.2017 for the 1st and 2nd period, respectively. The nutrient solution was applied as "full dose" (mg L-1: N 150, P 50, K 150, Ca 150, Mg 50, Fe 5.0, Mn 0.50, Zn 0.05, B 0.50, Cu 0.03, Mo 0.02), "half dose" (with macro elements reduced by 50%) and "without nutrients" (water). Plants as baby leaves were harvested 3 times in both periods. Results showed that plant growth, yield, quality, and water consumption vary depending on the concentration of nutrient solution as well as the temperature during the growing season. Especially in the 2 nd period when the temperatures were higher, plant water consumption and yield increase and earliness were achieved. It was observed that as the concentration of nutrient solution decreased, vitamin C, leaf Ca content and pH value of the nutrient solution increased while leaf N, P, K and Fe contents, EC value of the nutrient solution, leaf nitrate content, yield and plant biomass decreased. There was no statistical difference between full and half dose applications in many measured parameters. It is concluded that spinach can be grown as a baby leaf in a floating water culture and that in addition to reducing nitrate content, half-dose application may be preferred in terms of yield and water consumption, and production should be done during early spring season in greenhouse conditions for high yield and quality.

AB Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers; (GDGTs) are membrane lipids of unknown bacteria that are ubiquitous in soil and peat. Two indices based on the distribution of these lipids in soils, the Cyclization of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) and the Methylation of Branched Tetraethers (MBT) indices have been shown to correlate with soil pH, and mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH, respectively, and can be used to reconstruct MAT in palaeoenvironments. To verify the extent to which branched GDGTs in marine sediments reflect the distribution pattern on land and whether these proxies are applicable for palaeoclimate reconstruction in high latitude environments with a MAT of <0 degrees C, we compared the branched GDGT distribution in Svalbard soils and nearby fjord sediments. Although branched GDGT concentrations in the soil are relatively low (0.02-0.95 mu g/g dry weight (dw)) because of the cold climate and the short growing season, reconstructed MATs based on the MBT/CBT proxy are ca. -4 degrees C, close to the measured MAT (ca. -6 degrees C). Concentrations of branched GDGTs (0.01-0.20 mu g/g dw) in fjord sediments increased towards the open ocean and the distribution was strikingly different from that in soil, i.e. dominated by GDGTs with one cyclopentane moiety. This resulted in MBT/CBT-reconstructed MAT values of 11-19 degrees C, well above measured MAT. The results suggest that at least part of the branched GDGTs in marine sediments in settings with a low soil organic matter (OM) input may be produced in situ. In these cases, the application of the MBT/CBT palaeothermometer will generate unrealistic MAT reconstructions. The MBT/CBT proxy should therefore only be used at sites with a substantial input of soil OM relative to the amount of marine OM, i.e. at sites close to the mouth of rivers with a catchment area where sufficient soil formation takes place and the soil thus contains substantial amounts of branched GDGTs.

AB To study the effect of land use change from marshland to croplands (rice and soybean cultivation), the water and energy fluxes in marshland, rice and soybeans were measured in northeastern China by the eddy covariance method for two growing seasons (May-October in 2005 and 2006). The rice (flooded until early September) and soybean (dry land) croplands were reclaimed from marshlands over 15 years ago. The annual precipitation in 2005 (480 mm) was below the 1981-2004 average (564 130 mm), the precipitation in 2006 (655 mm) was significantly above average. The conversion of marshland to rice cropland resulted in an enhancement in latent heat flux (LE) and a decrease in sensible heat flux (H), which caused an increase in the ratio of LE and net radiation (LE/ Rn) from 0.6 to 0.8 on average, and a decrease in H/Rn from 0.4 to 0.2 on average for the growing season. However, where the marshland was converted to soybean cropland, the latent heat flux was tower in 2005 under dry conditions, but higher in 2006 under wet conditions than it had been previously been, which was the opposite of the trend of H. Therefore, LE/Rn for soybean dropped to about 0.2 in the dry month of June 2005, and rose to 0.7 in the wet month of June 2006. H/Rn for soybeans shows opposite variation in LE/Rn in both years. The maximum evapotranspiration (ET) was about 4.5, 6-7 and 5 mm day(-1) for marshland, rice and soybeans, respectively. Rn, air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf area index (LAI) were important environmental and biological factors controlling the seasonal dynamics of LE and H for the three ecosystems, which explains about 80% of LE and 50% of H for marshland and rice; and 30-50% of LE and 60% of H for soybeans. Among them, Rn was the primary variable controlling the variations of LE and H for marshland and rice. However, for soybeans, VPD played a more important role in LE under dry conditions.

AB The present study evaluated the effect of different organic fertilizers on the morphological parameters and yield in two different onion cultivars. Proper use of organic fertilizers in appropriate amounts could be helpful to growers from the economic point of view. Field experiments were conducted to study the effect of three different organic biofertilizers on yield and morphological parameters of two onion cultivars 'Stuttgarter Riesen' and 'Rote Laaer' during 2016 and 2017. The investigated treatments included: B-Stimul (R) - a mixture of bacterial and algal extracts, EkoBooster 2 (R) - organic matter and NPK, and VermiFit A (R) - an extract of compost produced by Californian earthworms, peat, nutrients, plant hormones, enzymes, amino acids, and sugars. The following parameters of onion plants were evaluated: number of leaves, bulb diameter, bulb weight, marketable and total yields. The study showed that all the results were affected by the growing season (higher values were recorded in 2016). In 'Stuttgarter Riesen', EkoBooster 2 (R) application resulted in the highest bulb weight in 2016 (67.16 g) and in 2017 (55.17 g) and in the highest number of leaves in 2016 (6.66) and in 2017 (6.30), which led to the highest marketable bulb yield in 2016 (3.47 kg m(-2)) and in 2017 (2.53 kg m(-2)). In 'Rote Laaer' in 2016, EkoBooster 2 (R) application resulted in the highest number of leaves (7.06), bulb diameter (54.32 mm) and bulb weight (79.30 g). In 2017, the largest bulb diameter (54.13 mm) and the highest bulb weight (71.79 g) and marketable bulb yield (2.39 kg m(-2)) were determined after VermiFit A (R) application. EkoBooster 2 (R) showed the best effect on parameters such as the number of leaves, bulb weight, and marketable bulb yield of the cultivar 'Stuttgarter Riesen' and positively affected the parameters of 'Rote Laaer' during 2016, while in 2017 VermiFit A (R) showed better results as compared to the other treatments.

AB Population size of habitat-specialized butterflies is limited in part by host plant distribution and abundance. Effective conservation for host-specialist species requires knowledge of host-plant habitat conditions and relationships with the specialist species. Clayton's copper butterfly (Lycaena dorcas claytoni) is a Maine state-endangered species that relies exclusively on shrubby cinquefoil (Dasiphora fruticosa) as its host. Dasiphora fruticosa occurs in 28 wetlands in Maine, ten of which are occupied by L. d. claytoni. Little is known about environmental conditions that support large, persistent stands of D. fruticosa in Maine. We evaluated the environment (hydrology, pore water and peat nutrients) associated with D. fruticosa distribution, age, and condition in Maine wetlands supporting robust stands of D. fruticosa to compare with L. d. claytoni occurrence. Although dominant water source in D. fruticosa-containing wetlands included both groundwater discharge and surface-flow, D. fruticosa coverage was greater in wetlands with consistent growing season water levels that dropped into or below the root zone by late season, and its distributions within wetlands reflected pore water hydrogen ion and conductivity gradients. Flooding magnitude and duration were greatest during the L.d. claytoni larval feeding period, whereas, mean depth to water table and upwelling increased and were most variable following the L. d. claytoni egg-laying period that precedes D. fruticosa senescence. Oldest sampled shrubs were 37 years, and older shrubs were larger and slower-growing. Encounter rates of L. d. claytoni were greater in wetlands with larger D. fruticosa plants of intermediate age and greater bloom density. Wetland management that combines conditions associated with D. fruticosa abundance (e.g., non-forested, seasonally consistent water levels with high conductivity) and L. d. claytoni occurrence (e.g., drawdown below the root zone following egg-laying, abundant blooms on intermediate-aged D. fruticosa, nearby D. fruticosa-containing wetlands) will aid L. d. claytoni conservation.

AB It has been shown by numerical simulation that the rate of formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) in smoke plumes caused by vegetation and peat fires under real conditions can significantly depend on the aerosol optical thickness (AOT). The AOT determines the photodissociation rate and hydroxyl radical concentration, which in turn determines the rate of SOA generation as a result of oxidation of semivolatile organic compounds. Quantitative analysis has been carried out for the situation that took place in European Russia during the 2010 Russian wildfires. The state-of-the-art 3D chemical transport model is used in this study; the simulations are optimized and validated using the data of monitoring of the particulate matter in the Moscow region and Finland. The findings indicate that it is important to allow for this effect in studies focused on the analysis and prediction of air pollution due to wildfires, as well as climate and weather studies, whose results may depend on the assumptions about the content and properties of atmospheric carbon-containing aerosol.

AB A paleo-environmental record covering the last 16 ka (16,000 cal yrs BP) from the eastern areas of the summer rainfall region in South Africa is presented. This area is until now sparsely investigated due to the lack of well preserved natural archives. For this study, we used a peat section from a wetland situated close to the Drakensberg escarpment, where the high annual rainfall amounts supported a continuous peat accumulation since c. 16 ka. One peat core was analysed in terms of fossil pollen composition, carbon and nitrogen content, isotope composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) and microscopic charcoal concentration. The greatest degree of temporal resolution was achieved from the late Pleistocene and early Holocene section, where proxy-records indicate relatively dry conditions between ca. 16-13.7 ka, 12.8-10.5 ka, 9.5-8.2 ka, and wet conditions between c. 13.7-12.8 ka and 10.5-9.5 ka. A weak moisture signal is also evident at c. 8.2-7.5 ka. The late Pleistocene to early Holocene period was relatively cool, while conditions became generally warmer after 11-8 ka. The interpretation of the mid- and late-Holocene sequence is limited due to a slow accumulation and low sample resolution, but the available data suggest relatively dry conditions until c. 1.5 ka, followed by more humid conditions until c. 0.5 ka. We suggest that the millennial scale variability within the record can be attributed to shifts in the circulation systems dominating the region, i.e. the latitudinal movements of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the dynamics of the mid-latitude low pressure belts.

AB The lignite deposit at Pontokomi (Sector 6) in the Ptolemaida Basin of Greece was studied petrographically so that the conditions that prevailed in the paleo-environment could be analyzed. The above deposit is situated in the northwestern part of the broader basin of Ptolemaida in Macedonia, Greece. It consists of alternating beds of lignite and interbedded strata. The interburden is made of clay marls, occasionally enriched in sand. Thirty-seven samples of lignite were taken for analysis from two representative coreholes (Delta 3 and Delta 5) located in the central part of the lignite deposit. The study showed that macerals of the huminite group were dominant, followed by inertinite macerals. Liptinites made up a small percentage of the total population. Densinite, attrinite, eu-ulminite, corpohuminite and detrogelinite were the most abundant huminite group macerals, respectively. Inertodetrinite and fusinite were the dominant inertinite macerals, while sporinite and resinite were the predominant litpinite macerals. Mineral matter consisted mainly of clays, carbonates and pyrite. Detailed maceral analysis allowed us to obtain indices related to the wetness in the peat swamp (GI), degree of vegetation growth (VI), level of water table (GWI), and preservation of plant tissues (TPI). By comparing ratios of these indices and correlating them to ternary diagrams developed by different authors, we were able to obtain valuable information as to the conditions that dominated in the original peat swamp. The ratio of VI/GWI provided data on the hydrology and nutrient supply in the peat-forming environment, whereas the ratio of TPI/GI was used to interpret the paleo-environment in relation to the water table. Evaluation of the data showed that the environment that hosted the parent flora was limnic (open water) dominated by grasses and sedges under rheotrophic to mesotrophic nutrient supply conditions.

AB We determined inventories and accumulation of C, N, P, and Cd in 2 profiles from sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus) breeding colonies. Inventories ( 0 - 70 cm, F horizon) were: 42.9 kg/m(2) ( C; both profiles), 1.39 and 1.95 kg/m(2) (N), 2.52 and 3.99 x 10(-2) kg/m(2) (P), and 9.89 and 9.69 x 10(-5) kg/m(2) (Cd). Radiocarbon analysis for accumulation calculations was invalid in one profile due to bioturbation. Accumulation rates (95% confidence interval) for the other profile were: 61 - 76 g/m(2). year (C), 2.0 - 2.4 g/m(2). year (N), 0.036 - 0.044 g/m(2). year ( P), and 0.14 - 0.17 mg/m(2). year (Cd). These accumulation data were within the range of other pristine peat systems, but lower than those with high anthropogenic inputs. Applying literature estimates of gross inputs indicated that only 0.6 - 2.2% of N and 0.1 - 0.6% of P were retained over the 567 - 705-year accumulation period.

AB Environmental perturbations in wetlands affect the integrated plant-microbial-soil system, causing biogeochemical responses that can manifest at local to global scales. The objective of this study was to determine how saltwater intrusion affects carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas production in coastal wetlands. Working with tidal freshwater marsh soils that had experienced similar to 3.5 yr of in situ saltwater additions, we quantified changes in soil properties, measured extracellular enzyme activity associated with organic matter breakdown, and determined potential rates of anaerobic carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production. Soils from the field plots treated with brackish water had lower carbon content and higher C : N ratios than soils from freshwater plots, indicating that saltwater intrusion reduced carbon availability and increased organic matter recalcitrance. This was reflected in reduced activities of enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of cellulose and the oxidation of lignin, leading to reduced rates of soil CO2 and CH4 production. The effects of long-term saltwater additions contrasted with the effects of short-term exposure to brackish water during three-day laboratory incubations, which increased rates of CO2 production but lowered rates of CH4 production. Collectively, our data suggest that the long-term effect of saltwater intrusion on soil CO2 production is indirect, mediated through the effects of elevated salinity on the quantity and quality of autochthonous organic matter inputs to the soil. In contrast, salinity, organic matter content, and enzyme activities directly influence CH4 production. Our analyses demonstrate that saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater marshes affects the entire process of carbon mineralization, from the availability of organic carbon through its terminal metabolism to CO2 and/or CH4, and illustrate that long-term shifts in biogeochemical functioning are not necessarily consistent with short-term disturbance-type responses.

ID STRATIGRAPHY; CANADA
AB Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used in several selected deltaic sedimentary environments to better understand subsurface stratigraphy and reconstruct former depositional environments. The profiles provide high-resolution, continuous subsurface data on facies thickness and depths, orientation of major sedimentary structures, postdepositional failure planes, and depth of peat deposits.
   Field experiments were carried out on six river deltas. Records from four of the deltas exhibit sedimentary facies; a record from one delta shows a possible slump; and records from another delta reveal the thickness and stratigraphic relationships of peat deposits. The delta types are (i) sandy, wave influenced; (ii) sandy, immature wave influenced (steeper middle and lower shoreface); (iii) sandy braided; and (iv) gravelly, fan-foreset.
   In areas of limited subsurface control (stratigraphic logs from drill core, cutbank exposure, or geophysical logs), radar profiles can provide "big picture" perspectives of the subsurface, a view only available in laterally extensive exposures. High-resolution profiles of subsurface stratigraphy and sedimentary facies from GPR provide an opportunity for geomorphologists and sedimentologists to further advance field research. Although GPR has limited success in silt and clay, results from sand and gravel deposits often reveal detailed facies assemblages.

AB Coal contains detailed long-term records of contemporaneous environment, climate, and subsequent diagenetic processes. Stable isotopes of carbon, petrological, palynological, and mineralogical analyses were carried out on a 28 m thick low-rank Miocene coal seam from the Mile Basin, Yunnan Province, China for the purpose of deciphering the palaeoclimate and sedimentary conditions during peat deposition. The coal is characterized by both pale and dark lithotypes. Palynological analyses show that both lithotypes are dominated by angiosperms, which is interpreted to indicate a moderately warm climate. The absence of Fagus and Taxodiaceae pollen suggests that there may have been dry periods during peat accumulation; in general, both Fagus and Taxodiaceae require a constant wet environment in order to proliferate. Organic petrography, delta C-13, and gypsum concentrations corroborate that there were alternating drier and wetter periods within the palaeomire during peat accumulation. The fine-scale variability in the delta C-13 signature appears to be controlled by plant type. Angiosperm/gymnosperm ratios and Vegetation Index are directly correlated with delta C-13 isotopic values. Plant type, however, seems to be proximally controlled by water level. Angiosperms were more dominant during times of lower water table or less moist conditions, interpreted to correspond to less negative values of delta C-13. The correlation of greater concentrations of gypsum with less negative delta C-13 values also supports drier conditions. However, in addition to the fine-scale variability, four larger scale cycles are defined based on less negative delta C-13 values. A less negative delta C-13 isotopic signature demarcates the top of each of these cycles, which represent spikes of lower water table and/or drier conditions. In addition, a general correlation of the delta C-13 variations in the studied coal seam with atmospheric CO2 suggests that the atmosphere also had a significant influence on peat formation in the Mile Basin. Although the Mile Basin palaeomire accumulated over a long time, an integrated approach to its analysis has demonstrated considerable variation in palaeoclimate. Changes in wetness/dryness had a direct effect on the ecological composition of the palaeomire. These floral changes would not have only been restricted to the palaeomire but most likely had a regional influence. Thus, detailed analysis of coals can yield useful, insightful and practical knowledge on past regional palaeoenvironmental conditions, which can then be placed within a global context.

AB The effects of five decades of de-vegetation on the quantity and quality of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) in soils were investigated. The WEOM was sampled from the A(p)-horizon of an agricultural plot and a neighboring bare plot 5 times during the spring. The quantity of WEOM was determined by measuring its organic carbon content, and its quality was characterized by its UV absorptivity, by a humification index based on the fluorescence emission spectrum, and by its fluorescence efficiency (fluorescence divided by UV absorption). The potential substrate value of WEOC was also determined by its Microbial metabolic loss over 7 d.
   As expected, long-term de-vegetation decreased WEOC significantly (by 70%). Not expected were two results: (1) Qualitative de-vegetation effects were relatively small. In some cases they were statistically significant, but in all cases differences compared to the vegetated plots were less than 13%; and (2) Despite a major increase in vegetation (from essentially 0% to 100% plant coverage) on the agricultural plot during the spring, there was no seasonal trend to be seen in any of the measured parameters. These unexpected field based results indicate that vegetal input into the ecologically relevant dissolved organic matter pool occurs only to a minor degree directly. Most of the fresh material must be initially sequestered into the soil matrix from which it is then subsequently released. This also indicates that there is a strong "buffering" in soils of freshly introduced organic matter. These results should be considered in Our attempt to understand biogeochemical cycles in soil.

It ranges from 9-47 to 33-224 mg C-CO2/m(2) per hour in the soils of alas depressions, from 16-68 to 76-253 mg C-CO2/m(2) per hour in flood-plain soils, and from 142 to 324-431 mg C-CO2/m(2) per hour (daytime data) in the soils of polygonal bogs at different stages of plant successions. Along this landscape gradient, the share of soil respiration in the total efflux of CO2 from the ecosystem increases as well as the role of soil microorganisms in this process. Data scattering in particular sites is conditioned by spatial heterogeneity of the soil cover; lower values are characteristic of the waterlogged loci with suppressed microbiological activity, on one hand, and retarded gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere, on the other. Calculated values of annual carbon release from the ecosystems of automorphic tundra and bog of the lake depression reached 402 and 203 g C-CO2/m(2), respectively (data of 1990). The input of soil respiration to the net emission of carbon from these ecosystems constituted 144 and 105 g C-CO2/m(2), respectively. The losses during the autumn-winter period reached 5.6% and 18.7% of annual losses, respectively. Microbial cenosis of tundra soil (podbur) comprises 32% of microorganisms that decompose fresh plant remains, 15% of microorganisms that decompose organic substances of peaty horizons, and 53% of microorganisms that utilize root falloff and root exudates.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) in a peat soil, humic acid, and humin and their precursors (i.e., cellulose and lignin) were treated at high temperature (250 and 400 degrees C) with high influence of diagenesis on their composition and structure, and impact of the simulated diagenesis on sorption behaviors of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) (i.e., naphthalene and 1-naphthol) by these samples was investigated. High temperature and pressure treatment greatly influenced chemical composition and physical properties of the original samples and their sorption for both naphthalene and 1-naphthol. Sorption of naphthalene by all samples was jointly regulated by hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions with their alkyl and aromatic carbon moieties, which was derived from the positive correlation between total hydrophobic carbon content of all sorbents and their organic carbon content-normalized sorption coefficients (K-oc) for this compound (p = 0.075). However, sorption of 1-naphthol by the tested sorbents was governed by hydrogen bonding with their 0-containing polar functionalities, as derived from the positive correlation between K-oc values of 1-Naph and their polarity index ((0+N)/C). Difference in sorption mechanisms of naphthalene and 1-naphthol by the original and treated samples noted the great influence of chemical composition of sorbates on their interaction and essential roles of specific interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) in sorption of polar compound (i.e., 1-naphthol) to these sorbents. Surface area (SA) and porosity data of sorbents obtained from N-2 sorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K showed that new SA and pores were created during the diagenetic process of all original samples, which provided substantial sorption sites and thus enhanced sorption of naphthalene and 1-naphthol. Among all tested samples, physicochemical properties of cellulose were most strongly affected by the simulated diagenetic process, and impact of such a process on its sorption intensity for the tested compounds was the most significant. The characterization data of the treated sorbents showed that the high temperature and pressure treatment similarly simulated the naturally occurring diagenesis of SOMs and their precursors, which is a first attempt. These findings are valuable for better understanding of the sorption behaviors of HOCs to SOM and its precursors as affected by diagenesis, which in turn is critical for elucidating the transport and fate of HOCs in the environment.

AB This paper reports a first estimate of the Holocene lake sediment carbon pool in Alberta, Canada. The organic matter content of lake sediment does not appear to depend strongly on lake size or other limnological parameters, allowing a simple first estimate in which we assume all Alberta lake sediment to have the same organic matter content. Alberta lake sediments sequester about 15 g C m(-2) yr(-1), for a provincial total of 0.23 Tg C yr(-1), or 2.3 Pg C over the Holocene. Alberta lakes may represent as much as 1/1700 of total global, annual permanent carbon sequestration.

TI Soil nitrogen amendment effects on seasonal nitrogen mineralization and

SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SANDY SOIL; CORN; FERTILIZATION; METHODOLOGY; INSITU; MANURE
AB Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a measure of the extent to which a crop transforms available N to economic yield. Seasonal N mineralization of organic amendments increases available N and, depending on the timing of mineralization and crop requirements for N, mag improve NUE while reducing soil N losses. A two-par study was conducted in an ongoing five-gear held experiment (1992-1996) on a Brandon loam soil (fine-loamy, mired, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) (Orthic Humic Gleysol) at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, ON, Canada (45 degrees 23' N, 75 degrees 43' W). Our objectives were to (i) quantify the effects of inorganic N fertilizer, stockpiled (SM), and rotted manure (RM) application on seasonal N mineralization and (ii) monitor the mineral N balance in the soil-plant system. Application of manure at the highest rate having a mineral N (NH4+ plus NO3-) of approximate to 100 kg N ha(-1) and up to 800 kg N ha(-1) of total N resulted in up to 120 kg ha(-1) of net N mineralized. The potential loss of this mineralized N was minimized during the growing season compared with inorganic fertilizer application because of the synchronization of soil N release and uptake by maize (Zea mays L.). in soil receiving 200 kg inorganic N ha(-1), the amount of net N mineralized over the season was between 130 and 170 kg ha(-1), but large losses of mineral N from the rooting zone occurred during the same period. The amount of net N mineral ized over the season accounted for up to half of the plant N uptake in all treatments; for example, the amount of net N mineralized in manured soils represented about 30 to 60 % of total plant N. It appears that a priming effect on soil mineral N occurred in all treatments during the vegetative period. This resulted in a curvilinear relationship between net N mineralization rate and soil mineral N levels at preplanting that reached a plateau at approximate to 140 kg N ha(-1). The rate of N mineralization during the grain-filling period was approximately the same at both levels of inorganic N fertilizer, but was, on average, three times higher under manure treatments. Compared with N mineralization under the 200 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer treatment, all manure treatments resulted in higher rates of net N mineralization during the grain-filling period.

ID NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS
AB The extension of the fractional step method to three-dimensional, time-dependent incompressible flows in non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems is presented. A formulation based on block-LU decomposition is combined with a mired implicit / explicit treatment of the discretized equations. Using local volume flares as dependent variables, the block-LU decomposition enables a unique definition of the sequential operations of the fractional step method for general coordinate systems. in this work a semi-direct scheme is developed for solution of the Poisson equation using series expansion along one coordinate direction that is discretized on a uniform, Cartesian grid Also investigated in this study is solution of a simplified Poisson equation obtained by neglecting cross derivatives in the full Poisson equation. If is shown that for fractional step methods satisfaction of the zero-divergence constraint is still possible using the simplified Poisson equation, but the associated error is larger than theta(Delta t).

AB This study examines the effects of natural solar radiation on the metal-binding capacity of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Newington Bog water (35.5 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) was irradiated for 20 days under UV-B lamps in the laboratory and under natural solar radiation. In the presence of irradiated DOM, IC50 (contaminant concentration required to reduce algal growth by 50%) was significantly decreased with UV-B treatment for four metals: Pb, 64%; Cu, 63%; Ni, 35% and Cd, 40%. Solar radiation also significantly decreased IC50 of Pb (58%) and Cu (49%), DOC concentration (11%), DOM fluorescence (DOMFL, 33%) and DOG specific UV absorbance. Further experiments on Raisin River water (20.7 mg DOC L-1) exposed to 20 days of artificial UV-A and UV-B radiation produced significant decreases in IC50 for Cu (48%) with UV-A and for Pb (43%) with UV-B. DOC concentration was decreased 20% by UV-B and 24% by UV-A. DOMFL decreased 51.5% in the first 5 days of UV-A exposure, an effect that was not observed with the UV-B treatment. The UV-A treatment decreased UV absorbance more at longer wavelengths and over a broader wavelength band than did the UV-B treatment. Change in toxicity with UV irradiation was inconsistent among the metals tested in this study, indicating that some organic metal-binding ligands were more quickly removed or altered than others. The DOM remaining after irradiation appears to be qualitatively different from the unirradiated DOM. The much greater irradiance of UV-A makes its contribution to the removal and/or alteration of DOM at least as important as the influence of higher energy UV-B.

AB Like many wetland ecosystems, areas of the northern Everglades of Florida, USA, have been influenced by P eutrophication, Our objective was to determine if P enrichment of water influences the litter decomposition rate and nutrient immobilization by litter and, further, to determine the quantitative relationship of these responses across a range of P concentrations in surface water, in addition, we determined whether P additions rapidly elevated microbial biomass P in the soil. In order to isolate the effects of P enrichment, we placed bags containing cattail (Typha domengensis Crantz) and sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Pers.) litter into two sets of experimental channels into which controlled inputs of five different phosphate concentrations were added continuously, After 1 yr of incubation, litter was analyzed for C, P, N, Cu, Ca, and K content. Loss of C at the end of 1 yr increased linearly with increasing average PO4 content in the channels with a similar slope for both species of litter, Immobilization caused an absolute increase in P content of the litter up to approximately ninefold across the range of water P concentrations, while immobilization of N, Ca, and K did not vary with water P concentrations. During decomposition, litter exhibited a net uptake of Cu (a nutrient potentially limiting plant growth on peat soils). The microbial biomass P was up to nine times higher in the surface soil of the most enriched channel compared with the control, but this elevation in concentration was restricted to the upper 12 cm of soil.

AB Salicylic acid (SA) influences plant physiological processes and induces tolerance to several stresses. Such stresses are imposed on micropropagated plants during the acclimatization stage, due to their underdeveloped photosynthetic apparatus. The aim of the study was to improve the growth and acclimatization of P. bipinnatifidum by the application of SA during in vitro rooting. Axillary shoots were rooted on MS medium supplemented with alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (1 mg l(-1)) and different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg l(-1)) of SA for 6 weeks. The plants were then acclimatized in a sterile mixture of peat moss and perlite (1 : 1; v/v) for 30 days in a growth chamber. SA application resulted in higher levels of stomatal conductance, transpiration, and CO2 assimilation. Biomass measurements and growth indices (leaf weight ratio, stem weight ratio, root weight ratio, and specific leaf area ratio) were highest in plantlets supplemented with 10 mg l(-1) SA. Based on these findings, the application of SA is recommended to improve the growth and acclimatization of P. bipinnatifidum.

AB In order to test the usefulness of stable zinc isotopes as an atmospheric source tracer, we analyzed the zinc isotopic composition of two sediment cores, taken at 1 km distance of the former zinc smelter in Lommel, Belgium. The peat bog lake sediments accumulate mainly atmospheric particles, have high organic matter contents (12-60 wt.%), are anoxic and highly contaminated with heavy metals (up to 4.7 wt.% Zn, and 1.1 wt.% Pb) with a sulfide mineralogical control on mobility. Down core variations in delta(66) Zn (relative to the JMC 3-0749L standard) were small, ranging from +0.07 parts per thousand to + 0.39 parts per thousand, but are nevertheless eight times the external reproducibility of 0.04 parts per thousand. Good agreement was found between the two cores, and despite 30% Zn mobilization to deeper layers, no evidence of associated diagenetic Zn isotope fractionation was found. Sediments deposited in the early 20th century have delta(66) Zn of +0.30 parts per thousand +/- 0.05 parts per thousand (2SD, n=5) and a shift takes place between 1945 and 1950 to 666 Zn values of +0.14 parts per thousand +/- 0.09 parts per thousand (2SD, n=7) in the 2nd half of the century. In order to understand this shift in delta Zn-66 we analyzed 32 ore-grade sphalerite (ZnS) samples from African, Australian and European origin. Together with 29 published delta Zn-66 values for ore-grade ZnS, we find remarkably homogeneous isotopic compositions, which when averaged for mining location gives delta Zn-66 of +0.16 parts per thousand +/- 0.20%. (2SD, n=10 mines, n = 61 analyses). Early 20th century Zn deposition with delta Zn-66 of +0.30 parts per thousand is significantly different (p < 0.001) from average ZnS delta Zn-66 of +0. 16 parts per thousand. We suggest that this reflects the presence of an atmospheric smelting residue (slag) component, enriched in the heavy Zn isotopes due to Rayleigh type fractionation during Zn refining.

AB Arctic soils contain large amounts of organic matter which, globally, exceed the amount of carbon stored in vegetation biomass and in the atmosphere. Recent studies emphasise the potential sensitivity for this soil organic matter (SOM) to be mineralised when faced with increasing ambient temperatures. In order to better refine the predictions about the response of SOM to climate warming, there is a need to increase the spatial coverage of empirical data on SOM quantity and quality in the Arctic area. This study provides, for the first time, a characterisation of SOM from the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal Region, Western Siberia, Russia. On the one hand, soil humic acids and their humification state were characterised by measuring the elemental composition and diversity of functional groups using solidstate C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Also, the total mineralisable carbon was measured. Our results indicate that there is a predominance of aliphatic carbon structures, with a minimal variation of their functional-group composition both regionally and within soil depth. This vertical homogeneity and low level of aromaticity reflects the accumulation in soil of lowly decomposed organic matter due to cold temperatures. Mineralisation rates were found to be independent of SOM quality, and to be mainly explained solely by the total carbon content. Overall, our results provide further evidence on the sensitivity that the soils of Western Siberia may have to increasing ambient temperatures and highlight the important role that this region can play in the global carbon balance under the effects of climate warming.

AB Sorption mechanisms of an antibiotic sulfamethazine (SMT) to humin (HM) isolated from a peat soil and its subfractions after sequential treatments were examined. The treatments of HM included removal of ash, O-alkyl carbon, lipid, and lignin components. The HF/HCl de-ashing treatment removed a large amount of minerals (mainly silicates), releasing a fraction of hydrophobic carbon sorption domains that previously were blocked, increasing the sorption of SMT by 33.3%. The de-O-alkyl carbon treatment through acid hydrolysis greatly reduced polarity of HM samples, thus weakening the interaction between sorbents with water at the interfaces via H-bonding, leaving more effective sorption sites. Sorption of SMT via mechanisms such as van der Waals forces and pi-pi interactions was enhanced by factors of 2.04-2.50. After removing the lipid lignin component with the improved Soxhlet extraction/acid hydrolysis, the organic carbon content-normalized sorption enhancement index E-oc was calculated. The results demonstrated that the Eoc-lipid for SMT (16.9%) was higher than Eoc-lignin (10.1%), implying that removal of unit organic carbon mass of lipid led to a higher increase in sorption strength than that of lignin. As each component was progressively removed from HM, the sorption strength and isotherm nonlinearity of the residual HM samples for SMT were gradually enhanced. The K-oc values of SMT by HM samples were positively correlated with their aromatic carbon contents, implying that pi-pi electron donor-acceptor interactions between the benzene ring of sorbate and the aromatic domains in HM played a significant role in their interactions.

AB Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) has become an important pillar of modern forest management, and one way to evaluate the sustainability of forestry is to assess long-term supply of ecosystem services (ESs) indicators. The concept of sustainability also has come to include adapting to climate change and the associated dynamic timber markets. This study aims to: (1) incorporate several ESs indicators in a Forest Management Decision Support System (FMDSS) that can deal with climate change and dynamic timber markets; and (2) analyse the impact that intensified forest management, resulting from global change scenarios that represent different levels of climate change mitigation efforts, will have on forest ES indicators in the west of Ireland. A linear programming model that optimized Net Present Value (NPV) from mill-gate sales was previously developed in Remsoft Woodstock, a DSS framework used for strategic forest planning around the world. This Woodstock model was modified to include the effects of global scenarios that include climate change and dynamic timber prices. This model was further developed to include indicators for five ESs (carbon storage in the forest as well as in harvested wood products and carbon substitution, windthrow risk, biodiversity, water quality, and cultural values), to assess the impacts of these global scenarios on the forest landscape and the sustainability of forest management. The ES indicator values were mainly linked to forest age, forest type, and yield tables, and their inclusion in the FMDSS had almost no impact on total model run times. Intensified forest clearfelling, as a result of increasing timber prices associated with most global scenarios, led to increased phosphor emissions to waterbodies, and reductions in windthrow risk and carbon storage. The global scenarios only resulted in minor differences in the indicator values for biodiversity and cultural values. Besides the global scenarios, recent forest policy development and the poor soil conditions in the study area impacted on the results. The developed system, with its innovative method to incorporate climate change and associated market dynamics, could be applied to other forest landscapes in Ireland and Europe, or indeed by any forest company or organization that uses Remsoft Woodstock.

AB Due to their use in various domestic and industrial formulations, benzalkonium compounds have been isolated in many environmental matrices. Sorption to soil components has been shown to play a key role in their environmental fate. Whereas sorption of benzalkonium compounds to soils is attributed to cation exchange and van der Waals forces, the relative contributions of these two mechanisms at environmental levels have not been clearly defined. In this study a previously reported algal toxicity assay-based method was employed to determine the distribution coefficients (K-d) of benzalkonium compounds between water and soil components, at environmental concentrations. Cation exchange capacity corrected K-d values for organic matter and clays were all within one order of magnitude. This implies that ion exchange is the dominant mechanism of sorption for benzalkonium compounds. When the sorption data were used to compute sorption energies for four homologues of benzalkonium ions, the magnitude of the free energy change of sorption increased with size of the molecule. The increase in sorption energy could be partly explained by increased energy of hydration with addition of methylene groups to the alkyl chain. A model that predicts sorption coefficients of benzalkonium compounds to soils using organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity was also defined. When tested using an artificial soil, the model estimates were all within one order of magnitude of the experimental values. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In shallow flooded parts of rich fens Mentha aquatica might thrive in deeper water than Epilobium hirsutum but previous experiments have provided no clear indication that the flooding tolerance of these species differs. In this study we investigated, by measuring growth, biomass allocation and vegetative reproduction, whether the impact of water level on vegetative reproduction might produce different lower boundaries on water level gradients. There was a striking contrast between biomass production at high water levels and the field distribution of both species. After 18 wk, the mean biomass of E. hirsutum grown in waterlogged and flooded conditions was 82% and 54%, respectively, of the mean biomass production of drained plants. Biomass of waterlogged and flooded M. aquatica was reduced to 57% and 37%, in drained conditions. Waterlogged and hooded E. hirsutum had swollen stem bases and invested a high proportion of biomass in adventitious roots. Stems of M. aquatica did not swell, formed few adventitious roots and maintained an equal proportion of below-ground roots at all water levels. The effect of water level on vegetative reproduction corresponded well with the lower hydrological boundaries of both species. When waterlogged and flooded, most rhizomes of E. hirsutum emerged from above-ground parts of the stem base and were oriented in an upward direction. Plants in flooded soil allocated less biomass to rhizomes and also reduced the number and size of rhizomes. Rhizome formation of M. aquatica on the other hand was not directly affected by water level and only depended on plant size. These differences in vegetative reproduction are discussed in relation to the different abilities of both species to oxygenate their below-ground roots. It was concluded that the mode of adaptation to soil flooding might also affect vegetative reproduction and, therefore, a species' ability for long-term persistence in soil-flooded habitats.

AB We review 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and other phenoxy herbicide sorption experiments.
   A database with 469 soil-water distribution coefficients K (d) (in liters per kilogram) was compiled: 271 coefficients are for the phenoxy herbicide 2,4-D, 9 for 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid, 18 for 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanoic acid, 109 for 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, 5 for 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)butanoic acid, and 57 for 2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propanoic acid. The following parameters characterizing the soils, solutions, or experimental procedures used in the studies were also compiled if available: solution CaCl2 concentration, pH, pre-equilibration time, temperature, soil organic carbon content (f (oc)), percent sand, silt and clay, oxalate extractable aluminum, oxalate extractable iron (Oxalate Fe), dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable aluminum, dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable iron (DCB Fe), point of zero negative charge, anion exchange capacity, cation exchange capacity, soil type, soil horizon or depth of sampling, and geographic location. K (d) data were also compiled characterizing phenoxy herbicide sorption to the following well-defined sorbent materials: quartz, calcite, alpha-alumina, kaolinite, ferrihydrite, goethite, lepidocrocite, soil humic acid, Fluka humic acid, and Pahokee peat.
   The data review suggests that sorption of 2,4-D can be rationalized based on the soil parameters pH, f (oc), Oxalate Fe, and DCB Fe in combination with sorption coefficients measured independently for humic acids and ferrihydrite, and goethite.
   Soil organic matter and iron oxides appear to be the most relevant sorbents for phenoxy herbicides. Unfortunately, few authors report Oxalate Fe and DCB Fe data.

AB In this study, solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to explore the carbon-containing functional groups present in pyrogenic carbon (PyC) produced during different fire spread modes to forest litter fuels from a dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest burnt in a combustion wind tunnel. A replicated experimental study was performed using three different fire spread modes: heading fires (i.e. fires which spread with the wind), flanking fires (i.e. fires which spread perpendicular to the wind) and backing fires (i.e. fires which spread against the wind). In addition to C-13 NMR measurements of PyC, detailed fire behaviour measurements were recorded during experiments. Experiments showed that heading fires produced significantly more aryl carbon in ash samples than flanking fires. All other experimental comparisons for burnt fuel samples involving different fire spread modes were statistically insignificant. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to explore the relationship between C-13 NMR functional groups and fire behaviour observations. Results from PCA indicate that maximising the residence time of high temperature combustion and the combustion factor (i.e. the fraction of pre-fire biomass consumed by fire) could be a method for increasing the amount of aryl carbon in PyC. Maximising the amount of aryl carbon could be beneficial for the overall PyC balance from fire, since more recalcitrant carbon (e.g. carbon with a higher aryl carbon content) that is not emitted to the atmosphere has been shown to have longer residence times in environmental media such as soils or sediments.

AB Antibiotics are biologically active compounds that are routinely detected in the environment and usually associated with treated wastewater discharge. Due to their high biological activity, antibiotics may have more environmental impacts than other pharmaceuticals. Wetlands are often used to treat or polish wastewater, with the goals of reducing nutrient and carbon loading into the environment. Nitrogen and carbon processing in wetlands is largely associated with microbial activity, however impacts to microbial activity due to antibiotic loading into treatment wetlands is relatively unknown. Two wetland soils (mineral and peat) were individually spiked with ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline ranging from 1-1000 ppb to examine effects on microbial mediated evolution of CH4, CO2 and N-2. The antibiotics both positively and negatively affected microbial respiration (a proxy for microbial activity) rates in the two wetland soils depending on soil properties and concentration. Sulfamethoxazole reduced CO2 and N2O respiration rates at higher concentrations (500, 1000 ppb) in the mineral soil. However, the CO2 rates recovered within 48 hours, while N2O suppression continued through the end of the incubation. Ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole also demonstrated the ability to suppress respiration at low spiking concentrations (1, 50 ppb) for several treatments. The results demonstrate the ability of antibiotics to impact soil respiration at environmentally relevant concentrations. Parameters that appear to affect the impacts of antibiotics were sorption, length of exposure and soil carbon content. Future studies are needed to provide further insight into antibiotic effects to microbial community structure.

AB The objective of this research was to assess the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) reducing efficiency of sulfur-based inorganic agents including calcium polysulfide (CPS), iron sulfide (FeS), pyrite (FeS2) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) in three soils. An alkaline soil (soil 1), a neutral soil (soil 2) and a slightly acid soil (soil 3) constituted the investigated soils. The soils were spiked with two levels of Cr(VI) (100 and 500mgCr(VI)kg(-1)soil) and incubated at field capacity (FC) for one month. Then, CPS, FeS, FeS2 and Na2S were added at 0, 5 and 10gkg(-1) and the concentrations of exchangeable Cr(VI) were measured after 0.5, 4, 48 and 168h in a batch experiment. The pH and organic carbon content of the soils played predominant role in Cr(VI) self-reduction by the soil itself. Complete self-reduction of Cr(VI) from soils 1, 2 and 3 was achieved at maximum Cr(VI) levels of 1, 50 and 500mgkg(-1), respectively. Therefore, the concentration of Cr(VI) should not exceed the given levels in order to ensure that Cr(VI) is not released into the environment from contaminated sites. Moreover, decreasing pH in the alkaline soil caused significant increase of Cr(VI) reducing efficiency. Na2S, CPS and FeS, in contrast to FeS2, were efficient Cr(VI) reducing agents in all three soils. For all added amendments the following order of Cr(VI) reducing capacity was observed: Na2S > CPS > FeS > FeS2 in soil 1, Na2S >> CPS similar to FeS > FeS2 in soil 2 and Na2S >> FeS > CPS similar to FeS2 in soil 3.

AB Trends in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 during three recent interglacials - the Holocene, the Eemian and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 - are investigated using an earth system model of intermediate complexity, which we extended with process-based modules to consider two slow carbon cycle processes - peat accumulation and shallow-water CaCO3 sedimentation (coral reef formation). For all three interglacials, model simulations considering peat accumulation and shallow-water CaCO3 sedimentation substantially improve the agreement between model results and ice core CO2 reconstructions in comparison to a carbon cycle set-up neglecting these processes. This enables us to model the trends in atmospheric CO2, with modelled trends similar to the ice core data, forcing the model only with orbital and sea level changes. During the Holocene, anthropogenic CO2 emissions are required to match the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 after 3 ka BP but are not relevant before this time. Our model experiments show a considerable improvement in the modelled CO2 trends by the inclusion of the slow carbon cycle processes, allowing us to explain the CO2 evolution during the Holocene and two recent interglacials consistently using an identical model set-up.

AB Tropical papyrus wetlands have the ability to assimilate and sequester significant amounts of carbon. However, the spatial extent, productivity and carbon sink strength associated with papyrus wetlands remains poorly characterised. The objective of this study was to collate information from peer-reviewed publications and relevant government and NGO reports to better understand carbon dynamics within papyrus dominated wetlands, and to assess the processes that regulate the magnitude of the carbon sink. Papyrus wetlands were shown to exhibit high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation of up to 40 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) where the incident photosynthetic photon flux density was a parts per thousand yen1,000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), high rates of net primary production ranging between 14 and 52 g DM m(-2) d(-1) and represent a significant carbon sink where up to 88 t C ha(-1) is stored in the aboveground and belowground components of the papyrus vegetation. Under flooded conditions significant detrital and peat deposits accumulate in excess of 1 m in depth, representing an additional carbon store in the order of 640 t C ha(-1). This study also highlighted the lack of empirical data on emissions of other radiatively important trace gases such as methane and nitrous oxide and also the vulnerability of these carbon sinks to both future changes in climate, in particular periods of hydrological drawdown, and anthropogenic land use change where the papyrus vegetation is removed in favour of subsistence agricultural cropping systems.

AB Although microporosity and surface area of natural organic matter (NOM) are crucial for mechanistic evaluation of the sorption process for nonpolar organic contaminants (NOCs), they have been underestimated by the N-2 adsorption technique. We investigated the CO2-derived internal hydrophobic microporosity (V-0) and specific surface area (SSA) obtained on dry samples and related them to sorption behaviors of NOCs in water for a wide range of condensed NOM samples. The V-0 is obtained from the total CO2 derived microporosity by subtracting out the contribution of the outer surfaces of minerals and NOM using N-2 adsorption-derived parameters. The correlation between V-0 or CO2-SSA and fractional organic carbon content (f(OC)) is very significant, demonstrating that much of the microporosity is associated with internal NOM matrices. The average V-0 and CO2-SSA are, respectively, 75.1 mu L g(-1) organic carbon (OC) and 185 m(2) g(-1) OC from the correlation analysis. The rigid aliphatic carbon significantly contributes to the microporosity of the Pahokee peat. A strong linear correlation is demonstrated between V-0/f(OC) and the OC-normalized sorption capacity at the liquid or subcooled liquid-state water solubility calculated via the Freundlich equation for each of four NOCs (phenanthrene, naphthalene, 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene). We concluded that micropore filling ("adsorption") contributes to NOC sorption by condensed NOM, but the exact contribution requires knowing the relationship between the dry-state, CO2-determined microporosity and the wet-state, NOC-available microporosity of the organic matter. The findings off er new clues for explaining the nonideal sorption behaviors of NOCs.

AB Here we present results of high-resolution palaeoecological studies of the organic deposits accumulated in Lake Jaczno, located in the north-eastern Poland. Plant macrofossils and malacological analyses complimented by radiocarbon dating (AMS) were undertaken to reconstruct Early Holocene succession of the pioneer wetland plants and molluscs in the lake ecosystem. Numerous presence of charcoal pieces (> 1 mm) and fungal remains (sclerotia) in the peat layer accumulated on the mineral ground document dry habitat what coincides with warm and dry climate conditions in the early Holocene recorded in this part of Europe. Change to lacustrine environment documented by accumulation of the carbonate gyttja on the highly decomposed peat layer took place ca. 10,500 cal yr BP. The current morphology of Lake Jaczno, in which several basins can be distinguished, suggests that different age of sediments accumulated at the bottom part at our sampling sites might result from different sizes of the buried dead ice blocks, and their heterochronous final melting. The first aquatic plants that appeared in Lake Jaczno were Chara sp., Ceratophyllum demersum and Nymphaea alba. The appearance of Cladium mariscus in Lake Jaczno ca. 9400 cal yr BP was synchronous with the substantial spread of this plant in this region which coincided with increased climate humidity. The first molluscan species that colonized the lake ecosystem were Gyraulus crista and Bithynia tentaculata, species living on macrophytes, and Valvata piscinalis, typical for habitats characterized by a thick layer of plant detritus.

AB Two coal-to-shale sequences of late Middle Pennsylvanian (Asturian) age from the southern portion of the Eastern Interior (Illinois) Basin, USA were examined geochemically, petrographically and palynologically. The Springfield coal was found to be moderately low in ash yield and high in total sulfur content. Petrographically, the coal is high in vitrinite content and low in liptinite and inertinite. Palynologically, the bed is co-dominated by spores of arborescent lycopod and tree fern affinities. The examination of closely-spaced bench samples revealed vertical species variation within both of these plant groups. Lycospora micropapillata + L. orbicula, both of which were produced by Paraiycopodites, are most abundant in basal coal benches, whereas Lycospora granulate, produced by Lepidophloios is the dominant arborescent lycopod spore throughout the rest of the bed. Thymospora pseudothiessenii is the dominant tree fern spore throughout most of the coal, with Laevigatosporites globosus becoming dominant in the top-most coal benches.
   The Herrin coal bed is also moderately low in ash yield and high in total sulfur content. Unlike the Springfield coal, it contains two distinct inorganic partings that have regional extent. The Herrin coal also has several coal benches with increased ash and sulfur that were not present in the Springfield coal bed. Petrographically, it is dominated by vitrinite, with the partings and high ash coal benches containing more inertinite, and liptinite. Palynologically, the Herrin coal is dominated by arborescent lycopod spores with subdominant tree fern spores. As with the Springfield coal, Lycospora micropapillata + L. orbicula are the dominant arborescent lycopod spores at the base of the coal, with Lycospora granulata dominating the rest of the bed. Granasporites medius, which was produced by Diaphorodendron and Synchysidendron, occurs more frequently in the Herrin coal bed, and are most abundant in, and in proximity to, the two inorganic partings. Tree fern spores are less abundant in the Herrin coal, and do not display any discernable vertical species variation.
   Collectively, both the Springfield and Herrin coal beds are interpreted to have formed in extensive planar, topogenous mires. Consistently saturated peat conditions throughout the development of both paleomires are indicated by the high vitrinite contents, and prevalence of arborescent lycopods. The deposition of widespread inorganic partings in the Herrin coal represents significant events in peat accumulation, with high ash coal benches representing smaller, more local events.
   Both of the coals are overlain by black, very organic-rich (avg. TOC +/- 20%) marine shales. The Turner Mine Shale, which directly overlies the Springfield coal, has layers at the coal/shale contact with fairly abundant vitrinite, primarily in the form of vitrodetrinite, near the base of the shale, but the majority of the shale is dominated by the liptinite macerals bituminite, lamalginite and amorphinite. Micrinite is a major organic component of the shale. The Anna Shale, which directly overlies the Herrin coal, is similar in overall maceral composition, but contains less vitrinite, and more solid bitumen and micrinite. Trace element ratios (Ni/Co, V/Cr, V/V + Ni), indicative of paleoredox conditions, indicate that both shales were deposited under mainly dysoxic to suboxic/anoxic conditions. The shales are interpreted to represent a progressively rising water table, caused by an increase in eustatic sea levels. Vitrinite reflectance values in the shales are lower than corresponding values measured from the coal, indicating some degree of vitrinite suppression occurring in the Turner Mine and Anna Shales.

AB We examine the carbon balance of North American wetlands by reviewing and synthesizing the published literature and soil databases. North American wetlands contain about 220 Pg C, most of which is in peat. They are a small to moderate carbon sink of about 49 Tg C yr(-1), although the uncertainty around this estimate is greater than 100%, with the largest unknown being the role of carbon sequestration by sedimentation in freshwater mineral-soil wetlands. We estimate that North American wetlands emit 9 Tg methane (CH4) yr(-1); however, the uncertainty of this estimate is also greater than 100%. With the exception of estuarine wetlands, CH4 emissions from wetlands may largely offset any positive benefits of carbon sequestration in soils and plants in terms of climate forcing. Historically, the destruction of wetlands through land-use changes has had the largest effects on the carbon fluxes and consequent radiative forcing of North American wetlands. The primary effects have been a reduction in their ability to sequester carbon (a small to moderate increase in radiative forcing), oxidation of their soil carbon reserves upon drainage (a small increase in radiative forcing), and reduction in CH4 emissions (a small to large decrease in radiative forcing). It is uncertain how global changes will affect the carbon pools and fluxes of North American wetlands. We will not be able to predict accurately the role of wetlands as potential positive or negative feedbacks to anthropogenic global change without knowing the integrative effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur on the carbon balance of North American wetlands.

AB The length increment and production of Sphagnum fuscum with enhanced nitrogen deposition (0, 10, 30 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and CO2 concentration (350, 700, 1000 and 2000 ppm) were measured. The experiment was carried out in the glasshouse, where S. fuscum was grown with the water table maintained at 10 cm below the moss surface for 120 d.
   For length growth, 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1): and for biomass production, 30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) were found to be the optimal loads. A load of 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) inhibited elongation and biomass production almost completely. An increased CO2 concentration reduced length increment slightly, but it did not have a significant effect on biomass production. However, above ambient CO2 concentrations increased capitulum density and stem dry mass per unit length. In addition, increased CO2 concentration accelerated relative growth in Sphagnum carpets when these also received additional nitrogen.
   The study highlights the high degree of spatial variability that occurs within Sphagnum fuscum. Differences in growth and biomass production between samples, not found in natural conditions, emerged during the experiment.
   On the basis of our results, the present nitrogen deposition load in Southern Finland (ca 6-10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) is quite suitable for the growth and production of S. fuscum. If N deposition increased substantially, differences in the vitality of the species might be expected.

TI STRATIGRAPHIC AND REGIONAL VARIATION OF THE PETROGRAPHIC AND

   ROCKS IN WESTERN KENTUCKY
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

DT Article
ID EVERGLADES; SULFUR; PEAT
AB The stratigraphic and regional variation of petrographic and chemical properties within the coals of the Upper Carboniferous Tradewater Formation and surrounding rocks in the Western Kentucky coal field were analyzed with the intent of constructing a depositional model for the occurrence of these low sulfur coals. Cores were megascopically described, and coal samples were analyzed for maceral, ash, and sulfur contents. These data were then analyzed to determine regional variation within the study area, as well as vertical variation within single coal columns.
   Sedimentological data from core logs indicate that the majority of the Tradewater rocks consist of irregularly distributed, coarsening-upward, fine-grained detrital material that was deposited in shallow bodies of water. Fossiliferous shales and limestones indicate a marine influence. Less common coarse-grained, fining-upward sequences appear to represent deposits of meandering or braided channels.
   Like the detrital rocks, the coal seams are irregularly distributed and exhibit substantial variation in petrographic and chemical properties which reflect changes in the Eh and pH of the coal swamp waters. These individual swamps were relatively limited in extent and probably occupied a low-lying coastal area. The relatively high vitrinite content of most of the coals suggests a reasonable degree of preservation of decaying plant materials. The study of benched samples from surface mines suggests a distinct dichotomy between swamps that were in more or less continuous contact with sulfate-rich marine or brackish water and those in which peat accumulated in a dominantly fresh-water setting. Most of the latter show a pattern of upward increasing sulfur content and decreasing vitrinite content, indicating increasing influences of oxygenated water that would encourage microbial action and which would degrade the peat and increase the tendency for sulfide precipitation. The high sulfur coals do not display this variability. The high rates of lateral variability encountered in the data suggest that future study should concentrate on smaller areas where variation can be completely documented.

AB In low lying areas with dense networks of canals for land drainage, sediments accumulate in the waterways and have to be periodically dredged. These adjacent areas are mainly used for farming and agriculture and suffer from high rates of subsidence. The recycling of organic amendments, such as sediments, compost and manure, in agricultural soils can improve plant growth and yield, soil carbon content, and microbial biomass and activity, and have the potential to reverse the process of land subsidence.
   The effect of mixing bio-waste compost and the solid fraction of swine manure with dredged sediments before dewatering and biochemical ripening was investigated in terms of type and quantity of organic matter, CO2 production and O-2 consumption, and N, P and S content. The water released during dewatering, the aggregate stability, and the undrained shear strength after ripening were also assessed since these areas have to be assessable by trucks and cattle.
   For the sediment with compost and manure the transformations in the type of organic matter, CO2 production and O-2 consumption were larger compared to the individual fractions, indicating a positive priming effect. Most volume lost during ripening can be attributed to the loss of water and not to the loss of organic matter. In addition, the mixtures result in very stable aggregates and showed an undrained shear strength three times higher than measured for the sediments.
   Sediments, compost and manure can be used and applied as beneficial use to reverse the process of land subsidence in low lying areas.

AB The long-term development of a humic lake ecosystem in Poland was investigated via palaeoecological analyses of age-dated sediment cores. Peat and lacustrine deposit records spanning approximately 12,000years of lake history were analysed with regard to palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, degree of peat decomposition, Cladocera and geochemistry. Our study demonstrated the difficulty of classifying sediments deposited in humic lakes. We considered it inadequate to classify dy sediment exclusively using macroscopic criteria in the absence of geochemical parameters. Our study of the palaeoecology of the humic lake suggested three primary shifts in its trophic status: from oligotrophy to mesotrophy (AllerOd-Boreal), to eutrophy (Atlantic), and to humotrophy (from the Sub-Boreal to the present). The results indicated that shifts in the trophic status occurred in response to climatic changes and factors linked to the catchment. The transformation from a clearwater lake of high trophic status to a humic lake was possible, such that the latter may originate not only from an oligotrophic lake. As a result of our pioneering study, we determined that a humic water body may even develop because of transformation of a eutrophic lake.

TI Landscape controls on riverine export of dissolved organic carbon from

AB The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from land to ocean via rivers is a significant term in the global C cycle, and has been modified in many areas by human activity. DOC exports from large global rivers are fairly well quantified, but those from smaller river systems, including those draining oceanic regions, are generally under-represented in global syntheses. Given that these regions typically have high runoff and high peat cover, they may exert a disproportionate influence on the global land-ocean DOC export. Here we describe a comprehensive new assessment of the annual riverine DOC export to estuaries across the island of Great Britain (GB), which spans the latitude range 50-60 degrees N with strong spatial gradients of topography, soils, rainfall, land use and population density. DOC yields (export per unit area) were positively related to and best predicted by rainfall, peat extent and forest cover, but relatively insensitive to population density or agricultural development. Based on an empirical relationship with land use and rainfall we estimate that the DOC export from the GB land area to the freshwater-seawater interface was 1.15 Tg C year(-1) in 2017. The average yield for GB rivers is 5.04 g C m(-2) year(-1), higher than most of the world's major rivers, including those of the humid tropics and Arctic, supporting the conclusion that under-representation of smaller river systems draining peat-rich areas could lead to under-estimation of the global land-ocean DOC export. The main anthropogenic factor influencing the spatial distribution of GB DOC exports appears to be upland conifer plantation forestry, which is estimated to have raised the overall DOC export by 0.168 Tg C year(-1). This is equivalent to 15% of the estimated current rate of net CO2 uptake by British forests. With the UK and many other countries seeking to expand plantation forest cover for climate change mitigation, this 'leak in the ecosystem' should be incorporated in future assessments of the CO2 sequestration potential of forest planting strategies.

TI Holocene environmental history on the eastern slope of the Polar Ural
   Mountains, Russia

LA English
DT Article
ID LATE PLEISTOCENE; TAYMYR PENINSULA; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; DYNAMICS; LAKE
AB The Holocene environmental history of the eastern slope of the Polar Ural Mountains has been reconstructed using pollen, spores, algae and other microfossils from the Chernaya Gorka palsa section (67 degrees 05'N, 65 degrees 21'E, 170 m a.s.l.). An initial oligotrophic lake was formed at the study site c. 9800 - 9500 C-14 yr BP. Although tundra communities dominated the vegetation in the area, birch and larch trees might have grown at lower elevations. Dry and disturbed soil habitats also occurred around the lake. Algae (mostly Pediastrum and Botryococcus) started to expand in the lake as climate gradually improved after c. 9500 C-14 yr BP. However, the role of mosses (mostly Calliergon and Drepanocladus) was most important for the infilling of the lake basin. Increased temperatures and subsequent improvement of hydrological conditions resulted in vegetation changes: stands of willows developed rapidly and the role of tree birch in the local vegetation increased. The lake was completely filled at c. 8600 C-14 yr BP. Peat accumulation started with Bryales mosses and, later, Sphagnum became dominant. Stands of Larix, Picea and Betula became well developed during the Boreal climate optimum. Tree birch began to spread into the tundra. Different Bryales mosses formed peat c. 8000 - 6500 C-14 yr BP. Cyperaceae later became the main peat-forming element. Dense spruce canopies with Larix sibirica and Betula pubescens surrounded the study site during the Atlantic period, pointing to the warmest climate during the Holocene. Summer temperatures might have been up to 3 - 4 degrees C higher than today. However, a decline of spruce and an increase of birch around 6700 - 6300 C-14 yr BP may reflect some climate deterioration. There are no dated deposits younger than 6000 C-14 yr BP. It is assumed that Subboreal climate deterioration resulted in the development of permafrost and formation of the palsa at the site. The deposits, now protruding above the surrounding terrain, were eroded by wind, water and cryogenic processes.

AB The distribution of frost table depths on a peat-covered permafrost slope was examined in a discontinuous permafrost region in northern Canada over 4 consecutive years at a variety of spatial scales, to elucidate the role of active layer development on runoff generation. Frost table depths were highly variable over relatively short distances (0.25-1 m), and the spatial variability was strongly correlated to soil moisture distribution, which was partly influenced by lateral flow converging to frost table depressions. On an interannual basis, thaw rates were temporally correlated to air temperature and the amount of precipitation input. Simple simulations show that lateral subsurface flow is governed by the frost table topography having spatially variable storage that has to be filled before water can spill over to generate flow downslope, in a similar manner that bedrock topography controls subsurface flow. However, unlike the bedrock surface, the frost table is variable with time and strongly influenced by the heat transfer involving water. Therefore, it is important to understand the feedback between thawing and subsurface water flow and to properly represent the feedback in hydrological models of permafrost regions.

AB The results of palynological analysis of a section of unconsolidated deposits in the 12-m-high coastal escarpment of the Baidaratskaya Bay (68 degrees 51'N, 66 degrees 54'E), the southeastern part of the Yugorskii Peninsula, are outlined. The section includes the lower member of sandy loam rich in ice, presumably accumulated in the late glacial time. The upper peat member was accumulated between 8 and 4 ka ago. The rough boundary between pear and oxbow-lake loams with cryoturbation marks suggests a hiatus in sedimentation between 10.9 and 8.2 ka ago. The age of deposits was determined by the radiocarbon method. The results of palynological analysis reveal several phases of vegetation development in the study area and specify their time limits. We believe that the Allerod warming period was more favorable than the Middle Holocene for the development of arboreal-fritucose vegetation in the region now occupied by typical tundras. This is likely a result of the sea level rise at the end of the late Pleistocene and in the first half of the Holocene up to altitudes somewhat exceeding the recent level, when the influence of the ocean upon climate and vegetation was enhanced.

AB The restoration of degraded peat-grasslands is an important nature conservation goal in The Netherlands. We investigated the effects of ceased fertilization (15 years) combined with a groundwater-raised water table (6 years) on the production of the peat-grassland vegetation and soil nutrient availability in a meadow. Furthermore, we evaluated whether and how this difference between meadows affected the balances between nutrient inputs and outputs in the ecosystem. We used an adjacent fertilized meadow in which the water table followed agricultural practice as a control. Yield of the grassland vegetation was significantly lower in the wet than in the control meadow. The tissue concentrations of N, P, and K in the harvested vegetation were significantly lower, but those of Ca higher in the wet than in the control meadow. The difference between both meadows significantly affected the annual nitrification rate, but not the annual C and N mineralization rates and the annual net P and K release rates. The difference between both meadows also significantly affected the seasonal nitrification and K release rates. Season exerted a significant effect on the seasonal C and N mineralization and nitrification rates. The elemental balances and relative contributions of the balance terms to elemental inputs and outputs varied considerably with element. Annually, the wet meadow lost N, P and K, while the control meadow gained these elements. The elemental demand of the grassland vegetation in the wet meadow was met for N for a large part by mineralization and for the remainder by atmospheric deposition, for P it was in the same order of magnitude as the net soil-P release, as it was for K. It is to be expected that the soil resources of N, P and K will continue to decrease under a continued regime of ceased fertilization and a raised water table, with those of N decreasing with the same rate, of P more rapidly and of K more slowly than estimated from regressions.

AB [1] Concentrations and fluxes of greenhouse gases methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured during open water conditions in two hydroelectric reservoirs, Lokka and Porttipahta, in the northern boreal zone in Finland. These reservoirs were located on peat and forest soils and were built in 1967 and 1970, respectively. Over 20 years after their flooding, the reservoirs were still largely supersaturated with dissolved CH4 and CO2. Measured with floating static chambers, the stations in Lokka released more CH4 (means of 5.3-119 mg m(-2) d(-1)) during the open water periods in 1994 and 1995 than the stations in Porttipahta (means of 2.5-4.8 mg m(-2) d(-1)), measured in 1995. The mean CO2 emission rates in Lokka (21-133 mg m(-2) h(-1)) and Porttipahta (36-95 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) were more similar. The chamber measurements could not detect episodic CH4 ebullition in Lokka Reservoir, indicated by generally higher CH4 fluxes (means of 2.6-660 mg m(-2) d(-1)) obtained with bubble gas collectors than with the chambers. The seasonal mean N2O fluxes were generally low, ranging from -89 to 270 mug m(-2) d(-1). There was no clear association between the CH4 emissions and the bottom type, including mineral soils and old peat deposits. The flooded vegetation, higher nutrient content, and primary production in the water column rather than old peat could account for the higher CH4 emissions from the stations in Lokka. This conclusion is supported by the high content of modern carbon (C) in methane (percent modern C of 92-104%) that was extracted from the sediment of Lokka. The results suggested that if there is a good long-term availability of phosphorus and nitrogen, the intensive internal C cycle associated with the primary production could maintain high CH4 and CO2 production for decades, similar to the situation in eutrophied natural lakes.

AB A rich fossil flora occurs in the roof shale of the Middle Pennsylvanian (Moscovian) age, Springfield Coal flanking the Galatia channel, a river deposit approximately 1 km in width and 150 km long, partially contemporaneous with the Springfield peat swamp. Siltstone and sandstone, > 30 m thick, were deposited in the channel during the final estuarine phase. The river formed under seasonal subhumid climate during early deglaciation as marine waters retreated from the land surface. It existed continuously through glacial maximum, under increasingly humid climate, as a low-sediment or black-water river with peat along its flanks. During early deglaciation, under subhumid climate and sea-level rise, the river became a sediment-laden estuary, drowning the peat swamp and burying vegetation in place under extensive mudflats. This buried flora was studied in three underground mines in southern Illinois, permitting vegetation to be characterized spatially. Three transects, comprising 100 sites, a total linear distance of similar to 12 km, reveal distinct zonation perpendicular to the channel margin. An innermost belt, 0.5 to 2.5 km wide, consists almost exclusively of the pteridosperm Neuropteris fiexuosa. North of a river bend, three belts succeed the N. flexuosa zone: mixed pteridosperms and marattialean tree ferns; mixed arborescent lycopsids and marattialians; lycopsids with rare marattialians. South and inside the same bend, N. flexuosa is succeeded by mixed lycopsids, particularly Sigillaria, and marattialean ferns. Within the transects, marattialian ferns have wider distribution than other groups, suggesting broader environmental tolerances. Neuropteris flexuosa channel-margin mono-dominance may reflect high sedimentation rates, elevated nutrient conditions, or floating-seed dispersal. Lycopsid dominance in interior areas conforms with tolerance of deep, standing water. The spatial scale examined affects our perception of community assembly. Overall, distinct vegetational zonation suggests niche-assembly; however, within vegetational bands, there is considerable small-scale spatial variation suggesting stochastic properties.

AB The A-ren and Yatagan Basins in SW Turkey host several Miocene coal deposits currently under exploitation for power generation. The present study aims to provide insight into the palaeoenvironmental conditions, which controlled the formation of the Husamlar coal seam located in A-ren Basin. The coal seam displays many sharp alternations of matrix lignite beds and inorganic, lacustrine sediment layers. The coal is a medium-to-high ash lignite (10.47-31.16 wt%, on dry basis) with high total sulphur content (up to 10 wt%, on dry, ash-free basis), which makes it prone to self-combustion. The maceral composition indicates that the peat-forming vegetation consisted of both arboreal and herbaceous plants, with the latter being predominant in the upper part of the seam. Mica and feldspars contribute to the low part of the seam; carbonates are dominant in the upper part, whereas quartz and pyrite are present along the entire coal profile. The sudden transitions of the telmatic to the lacustrine regime and reverse is attributed to tectonic movements that controlled water table levels in the palaeomire, which affected surface runoff and hence, clastic deposition.

AB The formation of bound residues by naphthalene and its metabolite, cis-naphthalene-1,2-dihydrodiol, in a sediment (1% OC), a silty loam soil (2.9% OC) and a peat (26% OC) was examined. The experiments were carried out under both sterile and nonsterile conditions for up to 35 days. The samples containing bound contaminant were hydrolyzed at an alkaline pH and fractionated using 3000 and 500 Da molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration membranes in series. The results for all the geosorbents examined showed that bound residue formation is low for naphthalene and between 5 and 20 times higher for the metabolite. The amount of bound residues released by hydrolysis was higher for the metabolite than for the parent compound for all the samples. The molecular weight distribution of bound radioactivity after hydrolysis showed binding to the high molecular weight components of the sediment organic matter and to the low molecular weight components for soil and peat organic matter when incubated with cis-naphthalene-1,2-dihydrodiol. Experiments performed with naphthalene-UL-C-14 showed larger amounts of bound residue found than in experiments with naphthalene-1-C-14. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated a suitable method for in vitro germination of spores, propagation of prothalli, and the formation of sporophytes in the fern Dryopteris nipponensis Koidz. Spore germination rate was relatively high regardless of culture medium. Prothallus development was faster in Knop medium than in Murashige and Skoog (MS) media. Prothalli used in all experiments were obtained from germinated spores, and were cultivated in different concentrations of media components. The active formation of sexual organs such as antheridium made 1MS medium suitable for prothallus propagation, although there was a lower propagation ratio compared to Knop medium. Growth and morphogenesis of prothalli were most effective on 1MS medium containing 2% sucrose, and 60 mM of total nitrogen source with 20:40 mM ratio of NH4+: NO3-. To select a suitable soil composition for sporophyte formation, ground prothalli were cultivated on single and mixed soils using bed soil, peat moss, perlite, and decomposed granite for 14 weeks. Bed soil promoted sporophyte formation and growth regardless of single or mixed use. In particular, a mixture of bed soil and decomposed granite in a 2:1 ratio (v: v) led to accelerated sporophyte formation (0.83/cm(2)).

AB The effect of foliar sprays with aqueous vermicompost extracts on growth, yields, morphological and chemical fruit quality and natural infection with late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary)) on three tomato varieties (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Diplom F1, cv. Matina, cv. Rheinlands Ruhm) was investigated in a field experiment. Extracts were prepared of vermicompost produced from fruit, vegetable and cotton waste by redworms (Eisenia fetida Sav., Lumbricidae); tap water served as control treatment. Foliar application (spraying) of vermicompost extracts did not affect plant growth, biomass or nutrient allocation, or yields and number of fruits of the three tomato varieties; however, for several dates it significantly reduced the number of flowers produced. Foliar vermicompost spraying either increased or decreased peel firmness dependent on tomato variety and increased fruit circumference consistently as well as contents of nitrogen but decreased L-ascorbic acid compared with water sprayed fruits. All other measured parameters of fruit quality (dry matter, C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, glucose and fructose content) were similar for vermicompost and water sprayed plants. Natural infection of leaves, stems and fruits by P infestans was generally very low under the experimental conditions; however, across varieties, only half as many vermicompost sprayed plants showed clear signs of P. infestans infection as water sprayed plants; the severity of the infection was unaffected by the two spraying treatments. In conclusion, these results suggest that the use of vermicompost might be considered more in organic farming not only as a substitute for peat in potting media but also as foliar sprays for fertilization and biological disease prevention.

TI PETROLOGY AND PALYNOLOGY OF THE NO 5 BLOCK COAL BED, NORTHEASTERN

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BASIN
AB The upper Middle Pennsylvanian (middle Westphalian D equivalent) No. 5 Block coal bed (Eastern Kentucky Coal Field of the Central Appalachian Basin) is a low-sulfur, compliance coal resource, dominantly comprised of dull, inertinite-rich lithotypes. Ash yields tend to be highly variable in the No. 5 Block, as does bed thickness and frequency of bed splitting. This study describes the petrographic, palynologic and geochemical characteristics of the No. 5 Block coal bed, and reports on some temporal and spatial trends among these parameters in eastern-northeastern Kentucky. Petrographically the No. 5 Block coal is predominated by dull, often high-ash lithotypes, with inertinite contents commonly exceeding 30% (mmf). The coal thins to the north-northwest where it tends to be higher in vitrinite and sulfur content. Representatives of large and small lycopsids and ferns (both tree-like and small varieties) dominate the No. 5 Block coal bed palynoflora. Calamite spores and cordaite pollen also occur but are less abundant. Small lycopsid (Densosporites spp. and related crassicingulate genera) and tree fem (e.g. Punctatisporites minutus, Laevigatosporites globosus) spore taxa are most abundant in dull lithotypes. Bright lithotypes contain higher percentages of arboreous lycopsid spores (Lycospora spp.). Regionally, the No. 5 Block coal contains abundant Torispora securis , a tree fem spore specially adapted for desiccation prevention. This, along with overall high percentages of inertinite macerals, suggest that peat accumulation may have taken place in a seasonally dry (?) paleoclimate.
   The No. 5 Block coal bed thickens rather dramatically in a NW-SE direction, as does the frequency of coal bed splitting. This phenomenon appears to be related to increased accommodation space in the southeastern portion of the study area, perhaps via penecontemporaneous growth faulting. Maceral and palynomorph variations within the bed correspond with these changes. Thin coal along the northwestern margin tends to be vitrinite rich and contains abundant Lycospora, perhaps reflecting relatively stable peat-forming conditions. Thicker coal to the southeast contains more inertinite, high-ash coal layers, and inorganic partings. Spore floras contain more small lycopsid and tree fern components and are temporally variable, perhaps indicating a more unstable peat-forming environment.

AB This study is aimed at assessing the effect of factors including lithology, forest/peatland coverage, dissolved organic carbon, and vegetation on chemical fluxes and concentrations of major elements in rivers. The mean annual element concentrations and dissolved fluxes of acid and basic rock dominated watersheds of the Karelia region and Kola peninsula, NW Russia, have been estimated from the chemical composition of river water samples collected in the summers of 1996-2000 and from annual discharge and chemical composition data of 16 watersheds collected from 1961 to 1975. The mean annual flux corrected for atmospheric input varies from 0.5 to 5.6 t/km(2)/y and is dominated by alkali metals for the Kola alkaline rocks and by calcium for the Karelian granito-gneisses. The pure "granitic" and pure "basaltic" river chemical denudation rates in the Baltic shield are 0.33 and 2.3 t/km(2)/y, respectively. The cationic and silica fluxes of both granitic and basaltic watersheds are comparable with those of other boreal regions having similar runoff, compositions, and climate. The cationic flux of the rivers is positively correlated with the basic rock fraction of the watershed, whereas the dissolved organic carbon flux increases with the increasing peatland fraction. The chemical composition of the river water is controlled by bedrock dissolution during dry periods, and by plant litter degradation and washout of organic debris from the topsoil' horizon during wet periods. Taking account the chemical composition of the plant litter and the biological turnover intensity, it was estimated that the plant litter degradation in Kola and Karelia regions provides 10-40% of total annual dissolved riverine element flux.

AB The presence of methanol (MeOH) improves DMS removal (up to 11-fold) by enhancing biomass growth in inorganic biofilters. Although the overall effect is positive, prolonged growth on methanol also negatively affects DMS degradation as a result of competition with DMS. The objectives of this study were to explore the potential to optimize DMS removal with methanol addition and to develop and experimentally validate a mathematical model describing the biofiltration of DMS in the presence of MeOH. Continuous experiments using three bench-scale biofilters packed with inorganic material were performed to examine the removal of DMS under different MeOH addition rates ranging from 0 to 140 g/m(3)/h. For a constant DMS loading of 3.5 g/m(3)/h, a maximum DMS removal rate of 1.8 g/m(3)/h was achieved at a MeOH addition rate of 20 g/m(3)/h in the inorganic biofilters. A steady-state model incorporating the competitive and activation affects of MeOH on DMS biodegradation was developed, and the modeled results on DMS and MeOH removal were in close agreement with experimental data. Both the experimental data and model simulation suggest that there is an optimum MeOH addition rate for a given DMS loading. A step-feeding strategy for MeOH addition was proposed and tested by the model to optimize DMS removal. The model-predicted results demonstrate that six-step feeding of MeOH enhances DMS treatment by 46% in the biofilters when compared to conventional feeding (one-step) of MeOH at the same total mass loading.

AB Agriculture in the Czech Republic after 1989 has been passed through many changes, at the same time also with searching for the optimum situation of an area of extensive and intensive use of the soil fund. Changes in utilization of lands may have a different impact as on all components of hydrological balance (infiltration and seepage of water through soil profile, retention of water in soil, transpiration and evapotranspiration, surface runoff, complement of reserves of underground waters), as on the quality of water of the given localities and regions. In 36 weighable lysimeters at Borkovice actual evapotranspiration (ET) of the grassland in conditions of different water supply of the stand (1991 to 1992), black and green fallow, mulching and regular utilization of the grassland (1993 to 1997) in three soil textures (sandy, loam and peat) was studied. Mixed sward (madow fescue, timothy, Kentucky bluegrass) was sown in lysimeters in 1989. Interval of observation was weekly in the first two years, then a fortnight one. Statistical evaluation of the ET results was performed by multi-factor analysis of variance by the Scheffe test. The experimental plot is situated at the altitude of 416 m above sea level, climatic region is in the district B3 - slightly warm. The normal of precipitation is 588 mm, the normal of temperature is 7.3 degrees C, in the growing season 378 mm and 13.47 degrees C (precipitation measured at Sobeslav, temperatures at Tabor). According to the Departmentalism of Agricultural Production of the CSSR (1963) the village Borkovice belongs to the agricultural production region IIIc/3 (potato-wheat type). The system of variants Borkovice: The year 1991 to 1992. variant I - without water supply (control), variant 2 - 60% of available water capacity (AWC), variant 3 - 80% AWC (all variants - three-cut utilization). The year 1993 to 1994: variants I - without water supply (control) and variants II - 100% AWC with subvariants: 1 - fallow, 2 - self-grassing, 3 - uncut, without fertilization, 4 - one cut, 25 kg N.ha(-1) + PK, 5 - two cuts, 50 kg N.ha(-1) + PK, 6 - three cuts, 75 kg N.ha(-1) + PK. The year 1995 to 1997: variant 1 - fallow, variant 2 - self-grassing, 3 - uncut, unfertilized, variant 4 - one cut, mulching by cut mass, variant 5 - one cut, mass harvested, unfertilized, variant 6 - two cuts, 50 kg N.ha(-1), in all variants irrigation to 80% AWC.
   In investigation of evapotranspiration (ET) of the grassland in weighable lysimeters in the locality Borkovice, statistically significant difference between average ET values of different soils in four (1991, 1994 to 1997) of six studied years (Tabs II and III, Figs 1 to 4) was recorded. The peat soil was significantly different (highest ET values) from sand and loamy soils. With increasing water content in the soil, the ET values were increasing too also in dependence on the retention capacity of soil profile. The effect of different utilization of the grassland (one-, two-cut, self-grassing, fallow, mulching) in conditions of the site, including dominant effect of the year on the ET level, despite a great variability of values, was manifested by their differentiation, the most among fallow variants and other variants. The highest ET values were achieved in the years 1995 to 1997 in the two-cut variant or one-cut variant in 1996 (578.6 mm and 550.4 mm or 501.7 mm) in the peat soil. On an average of the years and soils self-grassing showed after two-cut utilization the highest value of evapotranspiration. Mulching in the years 1995 to 1997 was manifested in the loam soil by the lowest ET values in variants with the stand (352.7 mm and 336.7 mm or 376.3 mm). The results indicate the application of the given interventions in loam soils with more uniform water regime of the site. In view of water management the variant with self-grassing seems to be very negative when succession of weed species and their different water running and root system may induce unfavourable phenomena in hydrological balance.

AB Large quantities of organic materials such as animal manures, yard trimmings, and biosolids are produced each year. Beneficial use options for them are often limited, and composting has been proposed as a way to better manage these organic materials. Similarly, burning of coal created 125 million tons of coal combustion products (CCP) in the United States in 2006. An estimated 53 million tons of CCP were reused, whereas the remainder was deposited in landfills. By combining CCP and composted organic materials (COM), we were able to create soilless plant growth mixes with physicochemical conditions that can support excellent plant growth. An additional benefit is the conservation of natural raw materials, such as peat, which is generally used for making soilless mixes. Experimental mixes were formulated by combining CCP and COM at ratios ranging from 2:8 to 8:2 (vol/vol), respectively. Water content at saturation for the created mixes was 63% to 72%, whereas for the commercial control, it was 77%. pH values for the best performing mixes ranged between 5.9 and 6.8. Electrical conductivity and concentrations of required plant nutrient were also within plant growth recommendations for container media. Significantly (P < 0.0001) higher plant biomass growth (7%-130%) was observed in the experimental mixes compared with a commercial mix. No additional fertilizers were provided during the experiment, and reduced fertilization costs can thus accrue as an added benefit to the grower. In summary, combining CCP and COM, derived from source materials often viewed as wastes, can create highly productive plant growth mixes.

AB From studies undertaken during 1995-2004, annual budgets of CH4 emissions from natural wetlands and its temporal and spatial variations were examined throughout China, and various f actors influencing CH4 emissions were also evaluated. The seasonal variation in CH4 emissions that increased with increasing plant growth reached its peak in August; decrease in the emissions was found in freshwater marshes but not in peatlands. Emissions were mainly controlled by temperature and depth of standing water. Low CH4 emissions at the early plant growing stages were not because of deficiency of organic C for CH4 production but because of low temperatures. Low temperatures not only reduced CH4 production but also stimulated CH4 oxidation by lowering the activity of other aerobic microbes which left more O-2 in the rhizosphere for methanotrophs. Low summer temperatures (below 20 degrees C) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau lowered CH4 production and CH4 emission resulting in little or no seasonal variation of emissions. Diet and spatial variation in CH4 emissions depended on plant species. For plants that transport CH4 using the pressure-driven convective through-flow mechanism, diet variation in CH4 emissions was governed by diet variation of solar energy load (that produces temperature and vapor pressure differences within various plant tissues) and stomatal conductance. For plants that transport gases using the molecular diffusion mechanism only, the diet variation of CH4 emissions was because of differences in the magnitude of O-2 produced through photosynthesis and then delivered into the rhizomes and/or rhizosphere for CH4 oxidation. Emergent plants could transport more CH4 than submerged plants because the former transport CH4 directly into the atmosphere rather than into water as do submerged plants where CH4 can be further be oxidized during its diffusion from water to the atmosphere. Emergent plants with high gas transport capacity could not only transport more CH4 into the atmosphere but also live in deeper water, which in turn would inundate more plant litter, resulting in increased availability of C for CH4 production. Annual CH4 emission from natural wetlands in China was estimated to be 1.76 Tg, up to 1.17 Tg of which was emitted from freshwater marshes. CH4 emission from freshwater marshes mainly occurred during the growing season and less than 8% was released during the freeze-thawing period despite the fact that thawing efficiently released CH4 fixed in ice column into the atmosphere.

AB Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural farming practice contribute significantly to European GHG inventories. For example, CO2 is emitted when grassland is converted to cropland or when peatlands are drained and cultivated. N2O emissions result from fertilization. Enabling farmers to reduce their GHG emissions requires sufficient information about its pressure-impact relations as well as incentives, such as regulations and funding, that support climate-friendly agricultural management. This paper discusses potentials to improve the supply of information on: farm-specific climate services or impacts, present policy incentives in Germany and England that support climate-friendly farm management and related adaptation requirements. Tools which have been developed for a farm environmental management software (to be added after review because of potential identification) are presented. These tools assess CO2 emissions from grassland conversion to cropland and peatland cultivation, as well as N2O emissions from nitrogen fertilization. As input data, the CO2 tool requires a classification of soil types according to soil organic carbon storage. The input data based on soil profile samples was compared with reference data from the literature. The N2O tool relies on farm data concerning fertilization. These tools were tested on three farms in order to determine their viability with respect to the availability of required data and the differentiation of results, which determines how well site-specific conservation measures can be identified. Assessing CO2 retention function of grassland conservation to cropland on the test farms leads to spatially differentiated results (similar to 100 to similar to 900 potentially mitigated t CO2 ha(-1)). Assessed N2O emissions varied from 0.41 to 1.1 t CO(2)eq. ha(-1) a(-1). The proposed methods support policies that promote a more differentiated funding of climate conservation measures. Conservation measures and areas can be selected so that they will have the greatest mitigation effects. However, even though present policy instruments in Germany and England, such as Cross Compliance and agri-environmental measures, have the potential to reduce agricultural GHG, they do not appear to guide measures effectively or site-specifically. In order to close this gap, agri-environmental measures with the potential to support climate protection should be spatially optimized. Additionally, the wetland restoration measures which are most effective in reducing GHG emissions should be included in funding schemes.

AB The Results of the researches on the use of growth stimulators of a natural and chemical origin when pricking of Scotch pine seedlings are considered, grown up with the closed root system. The aqueous extract from bark and chicken manure compost and heteroauxin are approved as stimulators. Our researches affect a new way of using stimulators - soaking the roots of pine seedlings when they are being pricked out, that is necessary when the germination rate is less than 95 % and 2-3 seeds are needed in each cell. Roots were dived into stimulator solutions and kept for 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours. The research was conducted in the qreenhouse complex in Velsk, the Arkhangelsk Region, the middle taiga subzone. The seedlings were grown up in "Plantek-81" containers on a peat substratum for two years - the first year inside the greenhouse, the second - at the sites of completion of growing. Analysis of the averages of the seedlings parameters showed that the highest efficiency was obtained in the variant with roots soaking for 16 hours. Height, stem volume and yield of standard size seedlings increased by 22-30 %. Seedlings, soaked in a solution of aqueous extract from bark and chicken manure compost, showed particular advantage. We established that the positive effect of stimulators could be seen as soon as after a month, and it most fully realized in the end of the growing season. At the end of the second year of growth, the stem volume corresponded to the ranks of the first year, which obviously was an indicator of the stimulators' effectiveness. In general, it can be noted, that the aqueous extract from bark and chicken manure compost as a stimulator has a positive impact on the growth of pine seedlings. Using the growth stimulators when pricking out and fertilizing seedlings, as well as in the preparation of seeds for sowing, improves yield and quality of containerized seedling stock and can be an important innovation for intensive multirotational technology of forest planting stock production in the harsh climate of the North.

AB It has been estimated that solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the Earth's surface will continue increasing until 2050s. To investigate the effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CH4 emission from the coastal marsh, mesocosm experiments were conducted to monitor CH4 emissions in stands of invasive plant Spartina alterniflora and native plant Phragmites australis from a coastal salt marsh exposed to ambient and elevated UV-B radiation, respectively. Enhanced UV-B radiation dramatically decreased aboveground, belowground biomass and plant height of P. australis by 16%, 24% and 16%, respectively, and did not affect those of S. alterniflora. This suggests that P. australis was much more sensitive to elevated UV-B than S. alterniflora. The seasonal variation patterns of CH4 fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis mesocosms were very similar, and were hardly affected by exposure to elevated UV-B. Mean CH4 emission rates were higher in S. alterniflora than P. australis mesocosms under both ambient and enhanced UV-B radiation due to the higher biomass of S. alterniflora, which could fix and allocate more photosynthetic carbon to the soil. Seasonal average CH4 flux from the P. australis mesocosms under elevated UV-B radiation was 0.51 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which was 25% lower than the value under ambient radiation. In contrast, there was no notable effect of elevated UV-B on CH4 emission from the S. alterniflora mesocosms. Enhanced UV-B remarkably decreased porewater DOC and CH4 concentrations by 17% and 23%, respectively, in the P. australis mesocosms during the growing season. This indicates that CH4 emission from the P. australis mesocosms under elevated UV-B was primarily reduced by the reduction of porewater CH4 concentration due to the decrease in plant biomass. Thus, our results suggest that CH4 fluxes in the coastal marshes would be increased by the invasion of S. alterniflora, and the effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CH4 emission from the coastal salt marsh is strongly correlated with plant characteristics.

AB The Medullosales were among the most diverse seed-plant clades in the Pennsylvanian palaeotropical, peat-fonning wetlands and their fossil foliage constitutes valuable biostratigraphical and palaeofloristic indices. However, there have been several recent taxonomic revisions of the intramontane floras of the Central and Western Bohemian basins, as well as a number of unpublished records that were not incorporated into previous palaeogeographical studies. In this paper, we collate all of the currently available data on medullosalean foliage from the middle and upper Pennsylvanian Kladno Formation from these basins. The different autochthonous and allochthonous floras of the Radnice Member were coded separately to see if the habitats that represent may have had an effect on the analysis. The new dataset suggests that the roof shale floras, although still distinct from those of the lowland paralic basins, are more comparable to the similar aged intramontane Saar-Lorraine floras than was suggested previously. The apparent palaeofloristic difference between the Central and Western Bohemia and Saar-Lorraine floras seems to have been at least partly because the data for the former area included species from both ash deposits that representing peat substrate vegetation and roof shale floras representing elastic substrate vegetation.

ID GRAZED SWARDS
AB A factorial pot-experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of burial of stolons (stolons unburied or buried to a depth of 0.5-1 cm at day 0), with and without defoliation (plants uncut or all unfolded laminae removed at weekly intervals) on the growth of two varieties of white clover (cv. Kent or cv. Milkanova) harvested on three dates (14 d, 28 d and 42 d after burial).  The soil used was a 3:2:1 mixture of clay loam:peat:sand, and there were three replicates of each variety for each treatment at each harvest date.
   Burial of stolons in the absence of defoliation had no effect on stolon extension, leaf appearance, or the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrate in the stolons.  The number of axillary buds developing (new branches plus flowers) was increased on the new surface-growing tips of primary stolons but was reduced on branch (i.e. secondary) stolons.  The proportion of branches to flowers was largely unaffected by burial.
   Defoliation caused substantial reductions in the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates in stolons and stolon extension growth, a reduction in number of axillary buds developing, and in the proportion of buds which were floral, but had only a small effect in reducing leaf appearance.
   The combination of stolon burial and defoliation resulted in the death of secondary stolons; 42% of all secondary stolons had died by day 42, and stolon extension, leaf appearance and numbers of axillary buds developing on secondary stolons were severely reduced.  The numbers of axillary buds developing on primary stolons was increased owing to more buds developing on the resurfaced stolon tips, but the increase was inadequate to compensate for the reduced growth, and death of secondary stolons.
   Differences between clover varieties in response to treatments were small.  In general, the smaller variety, cv. Kent, was more adversely affected by burial than the larger variety, cv. Milkanova.  A variety X defoliation interaction occurred for senescence of leaves; petiole senescence of cut leaves was reduced or similar to that of intact leaves for cv. Kent, but was increased for cv. Milkanova.
   The results are discussed in relation to treatment effects on carbon sources and sinks, and in relation to climate-soil interactions.

AB The carbon-isotope and palynological record through 580 m thick almost continuous brown coal in southeast Australia's Gippsland Basin is a relatively comprehensive southern hemisphere Middle Eocene to Middle Miocene record for terrestrial change. The carbon isotope delta C-13(coal) values of these coals range from -27.7 parts per thousand to -23.2. This isotopic variability follows gymnosperm/angiosperm fluctuations, where higher ratios coincide with heavier delta C-13 values. There is also long-term variability in carbon isotopes through time. From the Eocene greenhouse world of high gymnosperm-heavier delta C-13(coal) values, there is a progressive shift to lighter delta C-13(coal) values that follows the earliest (Oil?) glacial events around 33 Ma (Early Oligocene). The overlying Oligocene-Early Miocene brown coals have lower gymnosperm abundance, associated with increased % Nothofagus (angiosperm). and lightening of isotopes during Oligocene cooler conditions.
   The Miocene palynological and carbon-isotope record supports a continuation to the Oligocene trends until around the late Early Miocene (circa 19 Ma) when a warming commenced, followed by an even stronger isotope shift around 16 Ma that peaked in the Middle Miocene when higher gymnosperm abundance and heavier isotopes prevailed. The cycle between the two major warm peaks of Middle Eocene and Middle Miocene was circa 30 Ma long. This change corresponds to a fall in inferred pCO(2) levels for the same period. The Gippsland data suggest a link between gymnosperm abundance, long-term plant delta C-13 composition, climatic change, and atmospheric pCO(2). Climatic deterioration in the Late Miocene terminated peat accumulation in the Gippsland Basin and no further significant coals formed in southeast Australia. The poor correspondence between this terrestrial isotope data and the marine isotope record is explained by the dominant control on delta C-13 by the gymnosperm/angiosperm abundance, although in turn this poor correspondence may reflect palaeoclimate control. From the brown coal seam dating, the coal appears to have accumulated during a considerable part of the allocated 30 Ma Cenozoic time period. These brown coal carbon isotope and palynological data appear to record a more gradual atmospheric carbon isotope change compared to the marine record. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ice-wedge polygons are common features of northeastern Siberian lowland periglacial tundra landscapes. To deduce the formation and alternation of ice-wedge polygons in the Kolyma Delta and in the Indigirka Lowland, we studied shallow cores, up to 1.3 m deep, from polygon center and rim locations. The formation of well-developed low-center polygons with elevated rims and wet centers is shown by the beginning of peat accumulation, increased organic matter contents, and changes in vegetation cover from Poaceae-, Alnus-, and Betula-dominated pollen spectra to dominating Cyperaceae and Botryoccocus presence, and Carex and Drepanocladus revolvens macro-fossils. Tecamoebae data support such a change from wetland to open-water conditions in polygon centers by changes from dominating eurybiontic and sphagnobiontic to hydrobiontic species assemblages. The peat accumulation indicates low-center polygon formation and started between 2380 +/- 30 and 1676 +/- 32 years before present (BP) in the Kolyma Delta. We recorded an opposite change from open-water to wetland conditions because of rim degradation and consecutive high-center polygon formation in the Indigirka Lowland between 2144 +/- 33 and 1632 +/- 32 years BP. The late Holocene records of polygon landscape development reveal changes in local hydrology and soil moisture.

AB The reclamation of freshly produced composite or consolidated tailings (CT) is a challenge for the Oil Sands Industry in the boreal forest of Western Canada. CT tailings materials are characterized by a relatively high salinity (dominated by sodium, sulphate and chloride) and a high pH (8-9). A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the germination, survival, injury and early plant growth of two grass species recommended for land reclamation, altai wildrye (Elymus angustus Trin) and slender wheatgrass (Agropyron trachycaulum Link Malte), growing in two different oil sand CT tailings (alum-CT and gypsum-CT), with and without peat amendment. Ion accumulation in the resulting plant tissues was determined. Our results showed that slender wheatgrass was most affected by the tailings at the germination stage, while for altai wildrye, the early growth stage was the most sensitive stage. Alum-CT had similar or less negative impact on plants than gypsum-CT. Amendment of CT with peat limited the reduction in germination and growth that was recorded in plants growing directly in CT. Based on these results, recommendations were made to improve reclamation strategies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stream water concentrations of 13 major and trace elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, La, Mg, Na, Ni, Si, Sr, U, Y) were used to estimate fluxes from 15 boreal catchments. All elements displayed a significant negative correlation to the wetland coverage, but the influence of wetlands was stronger for organophilic metals; 73% of the spatial differences in the normalized element fluxes could be explained based only on the wetland coverage and the affinity for organic matter, which was quantified using thermodynamic modeling. When the analysis was restrained to the smaller streams (<10 km(2)) the explanatory power increased to 88%. The results suggest that wetlands may decrease the fluxes of metals from boreal forests to downstream recipients by up to 40% at otherwise similar runoff. We suggest that the decrease in element fluxes is caused by a combination of low weathering in peat soils and accumulation of organophilic metals in peat. The model could not explain the spatial patterns for some metals with low affinity for organic matter, some redox-sensitive metals, and some metals with exceptionally high atmospheric deposition, but the results still demonstrate that wetlands play an important role for the biogeochemical cycling of many metals in the boreal landscape.

AB Metal nanoparticles (NPs) are finding ever-wider applications in plant production (agricultural and forestry-related) as fertilisers, pesticides and growth stimulators. This makes it essential to examine their impact on a variety of plants, including trees. In the study detailed here, we investigated the effects of nanoparticles of silver and copper (i.e., AgNPs and CuNPs) on growth, and chlorophyll fluorescence, in the seedlings of Scots pine and pedunculate oak. We also compared the ultrastructure of needles, leaves, shoots and roots of treated and untreated plants, under transmission electron microscopy. Seedlings were grown in containers in a peat substrate, prior to the foliar application of NPs four times in the course of the growing season, at the four concentrations of 0, 5, 25 and 50 ppm. We were able to detect species-specific activity of the two types of NP. Among seedling pines, the impact of both types of NP at the concentrations supplied limited growth slightly. In contrast, no such effect was observed for the oaks grown in the trial. Equally, it was not possible to find ultrastructural changes in stems and roots associated with the applications of NPs. Cell organelles apparently sensitive to the action of both NPs (albeit only at the highest applied concentration of 50 ppm) were chloroplasts. The CuNP-treated oaks contained large plastoglobules, whereas those dosed with AgNP contained large starch granules. The NP-treated pines likewise exhibited large numbers of plastoglobules, while the chloroplasts of NP-treated plants in general presented shapes that changed from lenticular to round. In addition, large osmophilic globules were present in the cytoplasm. Reference to maximum quantum yields from photosystem II (Fv/Fm)-on the basis of chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements-revealed a slight debilitation of oak seedlings following the application of both kinds of NP at higher concentrations. In contrast, in pines, this variable revealed no influence of AgNPs, as well as a favourable effect due to the CuNPs applied at a concentration of 5 ppm. Our research also showed that any toxic impact on pine or oak seedlings due to the NPs was limited and only present with higher concentrations.

AB Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however, anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea level rise threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based image analysis of high-resolution four-band aerial imagery revealed that over 7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond densities as high as 290 ponds per km(2). Physical disturbance from pond creation and sediment dispersal extended to over 17% of the bay's tidal wetlands. By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it took 5 years for 51% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69% recovery, with complete recover (100%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (-42 g C . m(-2) . year(-1)), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C . m(-2) . year(-1), respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds-which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide-may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation function.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands are important for our planet as they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our goal was to determine how the construction of ponds in wetlands-which is common worldwide to support expanding aquaculture-affects the ability of marshes to take up carbon dioxide. We estimated the number and extent of ponds constructed for mosquito control in coastal wetlands in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. Additionally, we measured greenhouse gas exchange from the ponds, surrounding intact marsh, and in bare areas at several sites across the growing season to estimate the total carbon uptake of the whole marsh. We found that over 7,000 ponds have been dug for mosquito control in New Jersey and that pond density is as high as 290 ponds per km(2). We also found that the ponds constructed in wetlands reduce the ability of wetlands to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

AB 1. Regeneration of Calluna vulgaris following normal heath fires is from surviving stem bases or, where survival is poor, from a seed bank. Severe fires causing ignition of surface organic horizons kill stem bases and cause a serious depletion of the seed bank, most of which (up to 10(6) seeds m-2) lies in the litter and upper 2-3 cm of soil or organic material. Germinable seeds were detected in appreciable numbers down to 6 cm beneath the boundary of the F/O soil horizons in soil cores from mature heath vegetation on a blanket peat and peaty stagnopodzol. However, severe fires in which more than 10 cm of peat is ignited will destroy all of the viable seed bank.
   2. At the site studied, the seed-rain density for Calluna was approximately inversely proportional to the dispersal distance; regression equations predicted an annual seed rain of only c. 25 seeds m-2 at 10 m from source plants. Small numbers of wind-dispersed flowers retaining some seeds may be important in long-distance dispersal.
   3. The crustose lichens Lecidea granulosa and L. uliginosa and several species of algae form a near-ubiquitous film over the surface of exposed organic soil following severe moorland fires. This creates a crust overlying unconsolidated sub-surface peat. The lichen-alga film significantly reduced germination of Calluna seeds by about 40%.
   4. No evidence was found to link poor germination or growth to low pH, low nutrient levels or soil toxicity. Fertilizer experiments show that addition of potassium increases the root:shoot ratio of Calluna seedlings while nitrogen increases shoot growth at the expense of root development. It is suggested that the seedling root:shoot ratio may be important in establishment and in surviving the effects of needle ice formation, surface instability and desiccation.
   5. Transplant experiments and observations on naturally occurring seedlings show that summer desiccation of seedlings, winter browning, surface instability due to needle ice formation, and trampling by sheep are all major factors preventing seedling establishment. The relative importance of these factors varies from site to site.

AB It remains poorly understood how sea level drives environmental change and hydrographic development in coastal karst basins (underwater caves, sinkholes, blueholes, etc.) over millennial timescales. It was previously hypothesized that coastal karst basins (CKBs) transition from vadose, to littoral, then anchialine, and finally submarine environments as sea-level rise inundates coastal karst landscapes, but the initial flooding event of CKBs remains challenging to sample. Runway Sinkhole hosts a modern anchialine ecosystem located similar to 225 m from Great Abaco Island coastline in The Bahamas, and its shallow water depth (similar to 1.8 mbsl) permits an investigation into the early environmental evolution and hydrographic development in a CKBs after inundation by sea-level rise. Four sediment cores were collected from Runway Sinkhole, and late Holocene environmental change was reconstructed with benthic foraminiferal paleoecology, organic matter geochemistry (OM%, delta C-13(org), and C:N), X-radiography, and radiocarbon dating. Despite some uncertainties associated with the chronology, it appears that Holocene sea-level rise initially flooded Runway Sinkhole and created a littoral environment at least by similar to 3.9 ka, whereafter a detrital peat deposit accumulated in the sinkhole. This detrital peat had a high organic matter content (mean 88%), a delta C-13(org) value indicative of organic matter derived from C-3 plants including mangroves (-28 parts per thousand), and an unknown calcareous microfossil suggestive of a non-marine habitat in the sinkhole. A shift to carbonate sand deposition, organic matter with more marine-influenced delta C-13(org) values (-23 parts per thousand,), and expansion of euryhaline (Bolivina striatula, Elphidium poeyanum, and Triloculina bermudezi) and anchialine (Physalidia simplex and Conicospirillina exleyi) benthic foraminifera at similar to 1.2 ka marks the onset of modern anchialine environmental conditions at the sediment-water interface (similar to 1.8 mbsl). These results suggest that relative sea-level rise in the Bahamas forced environmental change in Runway sinkhole at similar to 1.2 ka, and indicate that peat deposits in coastal sinkholes must be verified as in-situ before being utilized as sea-level indicators.

AB The Hofdoaholar rock avalanche, in the Skagafjordur area of northern Iceland, was investigated on the basis of a geomorphological analysis of its landforms and close surrounding environment. Thanks to sound chronological constraints (C-14 dating from birch remnants in peat areas that developed within depressions over the chaotic rock-avalanche deposit, tephrochronological sequences resulting from subsequent ash fallouts over the deposit, calibration of an age-depth model of peats and previously dated raised beaches), we define the rock-avalanche implementation with a wider timeframe between 10,200 and 7975 cal. yr BP and with a narrower frame between 9000 and 8195 +/- 45 cal. yr BP. Such a well constrained timing proposes one of the most precise datings of an early-Holocene major slope failure in Iceland. This result fits well in the known chronology of the deglaciation in this area and in the prevailing Icelandic theory of a generalized phase of landsliding that occurred shortly after the deglaciation of the area. The main driver for the rockavalanche occurrence is associated to a paraglacial origin; glacio-isostatic rebound, associated to rockwall debuttressing, is thought to be the main factor in the genesis of this Boreal major disequilibrium.

AB Purpose The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of lake disappearance, groundwater table fluctuations, and some aspects of human pressure on stages of soil cover development in the catchment of Lake Rakutowskie. Materials and methods Research was conducted in soil chronosequence composed of eight soil profiles located in 785-m-long transect. Soils were sampled every 10 cm. Physical and chemical properties were determined with the use of disturbed and undisturbed samples. Radiocarbon dates were obtained for the bottom part of peat in each soil profile. The mineral composition of selected soil samples was determined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Additionally, the hydrological conditions were continuously monitored from July 27, 2013 to September 23, 2014. Results and discussion An increased rate of shallow lakes overgrowth and final disappearance is a commonly observed process in the European lowlands. This paper presents and discusses the influence of changes in the range of the Lake Rakutowskie wetlands complex (central Poland) and water level fluctuations on soil cover transformation in the immediate vicinity of the lake. Five major phases of soil cover development (from Subaquatic Histosols (Limnic) to Hypereutric Regosol (Drainic, Humic)) were hypothetically reconstructed based on detailed studies of soil physical and chemical properties, mineral composition, water level fluctuations, and radiocarbon dating. The degree of peat decomposition in the studied profiles increased with the distance from the contemporary lake surface. Along with the progressive dehydration and mineralization of organic soils, their physical and chemical properties deteriorated, which is visible, e.g., in soil structure, and mineral and chemical composition (especially TOC and TN). Obtained radiocarbon ages of selected samples indicate that the oldest peat layers developed about 5856 cal BCE (6970 +/- 70 C-14 BP), while the youngest were deposited about 1074 cal CE (980 +/- 40 C-14 BP)-1573 cal CE (300 +/- 35 C-14 BP). Hydrological studies indicate a progressive process of lake disappearance. Conclusions The process of soil cover transforming of the studied area takes place relatively quick, mainly recently due to the influence of human activity. Based on these results, it can be predicted that the lake will most likely disappear in a relatively short time, and the soil cover will be entirely in the fifth phase (P5) of evolution.

DT Article
ID TRAVERTINES
AB Calcium carbonate production in most freshwater tufa systems is controlled by a combination of physico-chemical precipitation, and biomediation associated with procaryote-microphyte biofilms. Inorganic precipitation is dominant under turbulent flow regimes, whereas biomediation necessitates sluggish flow or static water. We show here that temperature is also likely to affect tufa formation rates and architecture, leading to the development of a clearly definable range of fabrics. Two contrasting models are proposed: Warm semi-arid tufas: well seen in the Ruidera Pools National Park, Albacete Province, Central Spain, where tufa barrages consist of vertical, narrow rimmed arcuate structures. Frequently these are bounded both upstream and downstream by deep lakes. Laterally accreting mammilate stromatolites dominate the upper two thirds of lake margin subaqueous overhangs, whereas conical growth-forms dominate shady basal parts of subaqueous overhangs. Dense reed stands grow in thin peats on top of the vertical lake margin walls. Resistivity survey and percussion augering show up to 20 m of earlier lake fill which is banded into dark and pale beds. The upper 10 m accumulated in 4600 years. There is little or no preservation of organic material within these deposits.
   Cool temperate tufas: typified by slowly accumulating barrage tufas at Caerwys (N. Wales) and Alport (N, Derbyshire, UK). Transverse barriers across valleys are dominated by arcuate buttress developments built up of downstream-facing tabular carbonate sheets. Pools upstream of the barriers are shallow, dominated by clotted lime mud and organic sapropels in their depocentres, and stromatolite-dominated (laminar to low domes, or oncoidal) facies in broad marginal zones. Marginal stands of semi-aquatic vegetation are rooted in thick peats but frequently are also encrusted around their exposed stems by oncoidal carbonate. Fabric preservation is good for the carbonate material, however, marginal peats rapidly oxidise and stem encrustations collapse to produce cylindrical oncoid beds. Depocentre sapropels are always preserved and contain important pollen records otherwise rare in carbonate regions.
   Carbonates in both models accumulate relatively rapidly. They have a moderate preservation potential within Late Cenozoic terrestrial successions. The distinctly different characteristics of their preserved fabrics should allow recognition of two contrasting ''climatic'' models for fluvial barrage tufas in ancient deposits.

AB Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm) in the Southern Hemisphere has been increasing over the last few decades due to seasonal stratospheric ozone depletion associated with the 'ozone hole' and a more general erosion of the stratospheric ozone layer. We studied the effect of UV-B radiation on growth responses of Carex curta and C. decidua, the two most dominant sedges in a fen ecosystem in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) in field plots and growth chambers where U-V-B radiation was manipulated using different transparent plastic films that either transmitted or attenuated UV-B radiation. In the field, leaf and spike elongation of both species was unaffected by UV-B treatments in all four seasons studied (1997/98 through 2000/2001). Specific leaf areas (SLA) were only measured in the last two seasons and remained unaffected by UV-B for both species in the third field season. However, SLA decreased for C. curta in the fourth season but increased for C. decidua under near-ambient UV-B. Ecosystem specific root length was unaffected by UV-B. Although UV-B did not have a statistically significant effect on biomass production, there was a trend for a 15% higher production under near-ambient UV-B in the fourth year (P = 0.064). In the growth chambers, simulated ambient UV-B approximately equivalent to ambient UV-B in Tierra del Fuego stimulated seedling emergence of C. curta but reduced emergence of C. decidua; leaf elongation remained unaffected in both species. While plant morphology of C. curta remained unaffected by UV-B radiation, C. decid-ua had fewer tillers per plant, however tillers had more leaves and biomass under simulated ambient UV-B than under reduced UV-B radiation. The SLA of C. curta was unaffected by UV-B treatments; however, it was significantly lower for C. decidua under simulated ambient UV-B. Root morphology remained unaffected by UV-B for C. curta but roots of C. decidua were significantly thicker under simulated ambient UV-B. Taken collectively, our findings demonstrate that even moderate changes in UV-B radiation (e.g., corresponding to those expected with current stratospheric ozone depletion) may influence growth, morphology and biomass allocation in a species-specific manner for these native sedges in growth chambers and might also affect competitive relationships of these species in the field.

AB Permafrost is a large reservoir of soil organic carbon, accounting for about half of all the terrestrial storage, almost equivalent to twice the atmospheric carbon storage. Hence, permafrost degradation under global warming may induce a release of a substantial amount of additional greenhouse gases, leading to further warming. In addition to gradual degradation through heat conduction, the importance of abrupt thawing or erosion of ice-rich permafrost has recently been recognized. Such ice-rich permafrost has evolved over a long timescale (i.e., tens to hundreds of thousands of years). Although important, knowledge on the distribution of vulnerability to degradation, i.e., location and stored amount of ground ice and soil carbon in ice-rich permafrost, is still limited largely due to the scarcity of accessible in situ data. Improving the future projections for the Arctic using the Earth System Models will lead to a better understanding of the current vulnerability distribution, which is a prerequisite for conducting climatic and biogeochemical assessment that currently constitutes a large source of uncertainty. In this study, present-day circum-Arctic distributions (north of 50 degrees N) in ground ice and organic soil carbon content are produced by a new approach to combine a newly developed conceptual carbon-ice balance model, and a downscaling technique with the topographical and hydrological information derived from a high-resolution digital elevation model (ETOPO1). The model simulated the evolution of ground ice and carbon for the recent 125 thousand years (from the Last Interglacial to the present) at 1 degrees resolution. The 0.2 degrees high-resolution circum-Arctic maps of the present-day ground ice and soil organic carbon, downscaled from the 1 degrees simulations, were reasonable compared to the observation-based previous maps. These data, together with a map of vulnerability of ice-rich permafrost to degradation served as initial and boundary condition data for model improvement and the future projection of additional greenhouse gas release potentially caused by permafrost degradation.

AB In Dombayova graben (Dinar-Afyonkarahisar, western Turkey) a 203-m-thick coal-bearing zone of Late Miocene to Pliocene age was recently drilled. The zone hosts several coal beds with a total thickness of 46 m. Coal samples from the Dombayova field were studied by means of standard proximate, ultimate, petrological analyses, micro-FTIR spectroscopy and Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and organic geochemical analyses.
   Coal proximate analyses and the presence of carbonate minerals and fossil shell fragments point to alkaline surface waters of changing pH-values due to fluctuations of the water level in the paleomire and/or Ca-rich water influx. Low sulfur contents argue for sulfate-limitation of bacterial sulfate reduction. Petrographic observations reveal that the coal is dominantly composed of weakly altered wood fragments and roots. The mean random reflectance values of ulminite (0.33 %Ro) indicate lignite rank of the coal.
   The micro-FTIR data of macerals of huminite group indicate higher contributions of aliphatic hydrogen in textinite, compared to more aromatic levigelinite. The semi-quantitative differences in the ratios of selected functional groups suggest that aromaticity and the extent of oxidation are higher in levigelinite. Aliphatic chains are longest in textinite and ulminite, and shortest in texto-ulminite and levigelinite. We interpret this difference to point to a different origin of levigelinite, probably from colloidal humic solutions that were gelified during diagenesis.
   The concentrations of n-alkanes and their distribution patterns provide evidence for higher terrestrial plants as the dominant source of organic matter. Decreasing pristane/phytane ratios with depth are interpreted to reflect more reducing conditions during peat formation due to higher (ground) water level. The absence of diasterenes is most probably caused by low clay mineral contents and is consistent with the presence of alkaline waters in the paleomire. The presence of terpenoid hydrocarbons in the lignite indicates a major contribution of angiosperms to peat formation. The positive relationship between the concentrations of perylene and lupane-type triterpenoids suggests an increasing abundances of wood-degrading fungi in the peat-forming vegetation characterized by a high density of Betulaceae.

AB The lichen genus Siphulella (Lichenised Ascomycotina, Helotiales, Baeomycetaceae) is described, based on the single species Siphulella coralloidea Kantvilas, Elix & James sp. nov. The genus is characterised by a dimorphic thallus, apothecia borne on podetia, eight-spored asci of the Baeomyces-type, and simple, hyaline ascospores. Its chemistry consists of siphulellic acid, a unique previously unknown beta-orcinol depsidone structurally related to psoromic acid. Siphulella is endemic to Tasmania where it occurs on soil, peat, and stones in treeless vegetation in high rainfall areas. Its relationships with the other genera of the Baeomycetaceae are discussed briefly.

AB Deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America was accompanied by sequestration of organic carbon in newly exposed soils. The greatest rate of land exposure occurred around 12,000 to 8,000 years ago, and the greatest increase in the rate of carbon sequestration by soils occurred from 8,000 to 4,000 years ago. Sequestration of carbon in deglaciated peat lands continues today, and a steady state has not been reached. The natural rate of carbon sequestration in soils, however, is small relative to the rate of anthropogenic carbon dioxide production.

AB Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) contains substances of medicinal value. Aqueous extracts of its various parts (leaves + shoots, roots, seeds and ground seeds) were bioassayed in laboratory conditions to determine their allelopathic effects on seed germination and early seedling growth of 9 test crops (Pisum sativum L., Cicer arietinum L, Phaseolus vulgaris L., Lens esculentum M., Foeniculuin vulgare Mill., Linum usitatissimum L, Hordeum vulgare L, Triticum aestivum L. and Zea mays L). The Phaseolus vulgaris was the most resistant species and Foelliculum vulgare, Hordeum vulgare and Zea mays were the most sensitive. Incorporation of residues from aerial plant parts in peat stimulated the root and shoot growth of P. vulgaris by 4 and 8 times, respectively. Thus, aqueous extracts or residues of fenugreek plants had potent allelopathic activity and the activity differed with target species and plant parts. The inhibitory effect was in the following order: leaves and shoots > ground seeds > seeds > roots. Its biomass stimulated the germination and growth of test crops.

AB Chert and silicified wood from the Permian through Cretaceous of Antarctica contain abundant information on fungal diversity and plant-fungal interactions. The chert deposits represent a particularly interesting setting for the study of plant-fungal interactions because they preserve remains of distinctive high latitude forest ecosystems with polar light regimes that underwent a profound climate change from icehouse to greenhouse conditions. Moreover, some of the cherts and wood show the predominance of extinct groups of seed plants (e.g. Glossopteridales, Corystospermales). Over the past 30 years, documentation of fossil fungi from Antarctica has shifted from a by-product of plant descriptive studies to a focused research effort. This paper critically reviews the published record of fungi and fungal associations and interactions in the late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic cherts and silicified wood from Antarctica; certain fungal palynomorphs and fungal remains associated with adpression fossils and cuticles are also considered. Evidence of mutualistic (mycorrhizal), parasitic and saprotrophic fungi associated with plant roots, stems, leaves and reproductive organs is presented, together with fungi occurring within the peat matrix and animal-fungus interactions. Special attention is paid to the morphology of the fungi, their systematic position and features that can be used to infer fungal nutritional modes.

AB Late Quaternary landscapes of unglaciated Beringia were largely shaped by ice-wedge polygon tundra. Ice Complex (IC) strata preserve such ancient polygon formations. Here we report on the Yukagir IC from Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island in northeastern Siberia and suggest that new radioisotope disequilibria (Th-230/U) dates of the Yukagir IC peat confirm its formation during the Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 7a-c interglacial period. The preservation of the ice-rich Yukagir IC proves its resilience to last interglacial and late glacial-Holocene warming. This study compares the Yukagir IC to IC strata of MIS 5, MIS 3, and MIS 2 ages exposed on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island. Besides high intrasedimental ice content and syngenetic ice wedges intersecting silts, sandy silts, the Yukagir IC is characterized by high organic matter (OM) accumulation and low OM decomposition of a distinctive Drepanocladus moss-peat. The Yukagir IC pollen data reveal grass-shrub-moss tundra indicating rather wet summer conditions similar to modern ones. The stable isotope composition of Yukagir IC wedge ice is similar to those of the MIS 5 and MIS 3 ICs pointing to similar atmospheric moisture generation and transport patterns in winter. IC data from glacial and interglacial periods provide insights into permafrost and climate dynamics since about 200 ka.

AB This paper examines if an erosive hiatus found in the peat stratigraphy and marsh-accumulation record from northwest Hammock River Marsh (HRM), Connecticut (CT) can be attributed to a 14th or a 15th century hurricane, each documented by a radiocarbon-dated overwash fan in Succotash Marsh (SM) (Rhode Island) about 90 kin to the cast. Given that (i) the best estimate age range for the 15th century overwash deposit in SM (1400-1440 cal AD, 2 sigma) overlaps entirely with that for first plant growth after erosion at HRM (1390-1450 call AD, 2 or), while the best estimate age range for the 14th century overwash deposit (1290-1410 cal AD, 2 sigma) overlaps just 10 yr, and (ii) interpretation of the available stratigraphic and sedimentary evidence from HRM suggests that a high-energy event offers the simplest explanation for the observed marsh erosion, we conclude that a plausible link exists between the 15th century hurricane and the marsh erosion in HRM. The best estimate age range for the 14th century hurricane appears to overlap for 91% with the age range for the first plant growth (1290-1400 cal AD, 2 sigma) following marsh erosion in East River Marsh (CT), located about 12 km west of HRM. These results imply that erosive boundaries in salt-marsh peat deposits have potential as markers of past hurricane activity.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

ID FOSSIL FORESTS; WOOD; COALIFICATION; ANTARCTICA
AB Silicified conifer (Podocarpus cf. hallii) stumps up to 0.8 m in diameter are present at two levels in seam M2 of the Miocene Gore Lignite Measures, Mataura Coalfield, eastern Southland. the in situ stumps are believed to be the remains of forests which grew during pauses in peat accumulation, when groundwater levels were depressed as a result of climatic change or basinal processes.  Growthing measurements show the trees increased in radius between 0.16 and 1 mm per year.  In two of six specimens, the growth-rates halved during their final 30-40 years of life; rising water levels may have resulted in less favorable growth conditions.
   Within the stumps, much of the wood structure is well preserved.  Progressive diagenesis involved impregnation of the cell walls by silica, infilling of the cell lumens with length-slow chalcedony and opaline silica, and deposition of opal, length-fast chalcedony, and minor siderite in fractures.  Radial and axial parenchyma contain coalified organic material and minor chalcedony.
   Filaments of wood-rotting fungi and probable root masses of epiphytes are present in some fossil wood.  However, by analogy with modern Podocarpus hallii, we maintain the stumps were preserved for later silicification because the wood was highly resistant to fungal and bacterial decay.  The stumps presumably functioned as conduits to ascending silicia-saturated meteoric groundwater and water released during compaction, because of the contrasts in permeability between the vertical stumps and the surrounding peat.

AB Anthropogenic greenhouse gases are expected to induce changes in global climate that can alter ecosystems in ways that, in turn, may further affect climate. Such climate-ecosystem interactions can generate either positive or negative feedbacks to the climate system, thereby either enhancing or diminishing the magnitude of global climate change. Important terrestrial feedback mechanisms include CO2 fertilization (negative feedbacks), carbon storage in vegetation and soils (positive and negative feedbacks), vegetation albedo (positive feedbacks), and peatland methane emissions (positive and negative feedbacks). While the processes involved are complex, not readily quantifiable, and demonstrate both positive and negative feedback potential, we conclude that the combined effect of the feedback mechanisms reviewed here will likely amplify climate change relative to current projections that have not yet adequately incorporated these mechanisms.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
LA English

ID CARBON
AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes substantially to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the agricultural and landuse sectors. Owing to the high effort needed for measuring N2O emissions and the resulting lack of sufficient field measurements to apply at country-wide scale, soil-borne N2O emissions are often estimated by applying published IPCC default emission factors. To examine the data reported in the national GHG inventory, the current study utilizes a large data set of soil C/N ratios to predict N2O emissions and their distribution from drained organic soils in Switzerland. Calculated emission rates increase in the order of forest < grassland < cropland, and they are similar to the mean values currently used in the inventory. Distributions of N2O emissions are highly positive-skewed and they reveal probabilities of 10 and 14% for cropland and grassland, respectively, to be above 20 kg of N2O-N per hectare and year. It is likely that the greater part of N2O from drained organic soil derives from N released upon peat decomposition, and not from fertilization. In conclusion, this research shows that measurement of soil C/N ratios improves the reliability of organic soil N2O emissions estimates on a national scale and identifies site conditions where future emission measurements would be most effective for reducing the uncertainty in the GHG inventory.

AB The chemical nature of xenobiotic binding sites in soils is of vital importance to environmental biogeochemistry. Interactions between xenobiotics and the naturally occurring organic constituents of soils are strongly correlated to environmental persistence, bioaccessibility, and ecotoxicity. Nevertheless, because of the complex structural and chemical heterogeneity of soils, studies of these interactions are most commonly performed indirectly, using correlative methods, fractionation, or chemical modification. Here we identify the organic components of an unmodified peat soil where some organofluorine xenobiotic compounds interact using direct molecular-level methods. Using F-19 -> H-1 cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the F-19 nuclei of organofluorine compounds are used to induce observable transverse magnetization in the H-1 nuclei of organic components of the soil with which they interact after sorption. The observed F-19 -> H-1 CP-MAS spectra and dynamics are compared to those produced using model soil organic compounds, lignin and albumin. It is found that lignin-like components can account for the interactions observed in this soil for heptafluoronaphthol (HFNap) while protein structures can account for the interactions observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This study employs novel comprehensive multi-phase (CMP) NMR technology that permits the application of solution-, gel-, and solid-state NMR experiments on intact soil samples in their swollen state.

AB Different from typical hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are more soluble in water and less partitioned to soil than the HOCs. It remains unclear whether and to what extent PFAAs could be sequestrated in soil. In this study, sequential extraction of PFAAs in soil and bioaccumulation of PFAAs in earthworm were carried out to understand the sequestration and bioavailability of PFAAs in soils with different soil organic matter (SOM) and aged for different time periods (7 and 47 d). Sequestration occurred in different degrees depending on the amount and compositions of SOM in soil, structural properties of PFAAs and aging time. Surprisingly, in one peat soil with high fraction of organic carbon (f(oc), 59%), the PFAAs were completely sequestrated in the soil. Aging might lead to further sequestration of PFAAs in soil with relatively lower f(oc). As a consequence of sequestration, the bioavailability of PFAAs in peat soils was reduced 3-10 times compared to that in the plain farmland soil. However, the sequestrated PFAAs were still bioaccumulative in earthworms to some extent. The results indicated that the risk of PFAAs in field soil with high content of SOM could be underestimated if only free PFAAs using mild solvent extraction were monitored. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a review of the genetic types and geochemical processes that have formed 'metalliferous' coals around the world. Primary attention is given to elements in coal that are currently being extracted from coal as raw material (Ge and U) or have, in our opinion, the best chance for such use (REE, Ag, Au, and PGE). Coals with anomalously high concentrations of other metals having potential for economic by-product recovery (Be, Sc, V, Ga, Sb, Cs, Mo, W, and Re) are briefly considered. Original data and a survey of the literature indicate that metalliferous coals are in many coal basins. Ore formation in coal-bearing structures may occur during peat accumulation, during diagenesis of the organic matter, or by epigenesis. Various metals are supplied to sedimentary basins as minerals that are transported by water and wind or as ionic species in surface water and descending and ascending underground water and may be incorporated into peat or coals. The modes of occurrence of metals in the enriched coals are diverse. The data presented in this review indicates that metalliferous coals should be regarded as promising for economic recovery for by-products in the course of coal mining and combustion.

AB Springtime atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) lead to snow with elevated mercury concentrations (>200 ng Hg/L) in the Arctic and Antarctic. During AMDEs gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) is photochemically oxidized by halogens to reactive gaseous mercury which is deposited to the snowpack. This reactive mercury is either photochemically reduced back to GEM and re-emitted to the atmosphere or remains in the snowpack until spring snowmelt. GEM is also deposited to the snowpack and tundra vegetation by reactive surface uptake (dry deposition) from the atmosphere. There is little consensus on the proportion of AMDE-sourced Hg versus Hg from dry deposition that is released in spring runoff. We used mercury stable isotope measurements of GEM, snowfall, snowpack, snowmelt, surface water, vegetation, and peat from a northern Alaska coastal watershed to quantify Hg sources. Although high Hg concentrations are deposited to the snowpack during AMDEs, we estimate that similar to 76 to 91% is released back to the atmosphere prior to snowmelt. Mercury deposited to the snowpack as GEM comprises the majority of snowmelt Hg and has a Hg stable isotope composition similar to Hg deposited by reactive surface uptake of GEM into the leaves of trees in temperate forests. This GEM-sourced Hg is the dominant Hg we measured in the spring snowpack and in tundra peat permafrost deposits.

AB A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of organic matter content oil arsenic speciation and mobilization in chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-containinated soils. The study was performed with four synthetic CCA-contaminated soils, with a range of organic matter content (mixture of peat moss and poultry manure) varying between 0.5% and 15% (w/w), under unsaturated and aerobic conditions for 40 days. Changes in water-soluble arsenic speciation (As(V), As(III), MMAA, DMAA) were monitored over time in soil extracts by HPLC-ICP-MS and in the soil solid phase (As(III), As(V)) by a solvent extraction method. irrespective of organic matter content, As(V) was the predominant soil bound and aqueous phase arsenic species. However, over 40 days, a high soil organic matter content (7.5% and 15%) was able to entail formation of soil bound As(III). Moreover, total water-soluble arsenic was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (r(2) =0.88). However, the organic matter content did not influence arsenic speciation in the soluble fraction; neither As(V) reduction nor arsenic biomethylation occurred within 40 days. An increase in dissolved organic carbon content promoted both As(V) and As(III) solubilization in soils. Also, over time, organic matter contents of 7.5% and 15% entailed the persistence of soluble As(V), likely due to the high content of dissolved organic compounds which prevented its sorption onto soil. Based on this data, the environmental risk of aerobic CCA-contarninated soils rich in organic matter may be due to an enhanced availability of soluble As(V) over time, rather than to the formation of the more toxic and more mobile As(III).

AB A late glacial to early Holocene lacustrine and peat succession, rich in conifer remains and including some palaeolithic flint artefacts, has been investigated in the Palughetto intermorainic basin (Venetian Pre-Alps). The geomorphological and stratigraphical relationships, C-14 dates and pollen analyses allow a reconstruction of the environmental history of the basin and provide significant insights into the reforestation and peopling of the Pre-Alps. The onset of peat accumulation is dated to 14.4-14.1 kyr cat. BP, coinciding with reforestation at middle altitudes that immediately post-dates the immigration of Larix decidua and Picea abies subsp. europaea. Plant macrofossils point to the expansion of spruce about 14.3 kyr cal. BP, so far one of the earliest directly dated in the late glacial period of southern Europe. The previous hypothesis of an early Holocene spruce immigration in the Southern Alps from Slovenia needs reconsideration. Organic sedimentation stopped at the end of the Younger Dryas and was followed by the evolution of hydromorphic soils containing lithic artefacts, anthropic structures and wood charcoal. The typological features of the flint implements refer human occupation of the site to the end of the recent Epigravettian. Charcoals yielded dates either consistent with, or younger than, the archaeological chronology, in the early and middle Holocene. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A radiocarbon-dated multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental record from Beckton in the Lower Thames Valley, Southern England, has permitted a detailed reconstruction of human activities and environmental change during the middle-Holocene. Peat accumulation occurred over river terrace gravels from ca. 7200 to 6600 until at least 3450-3240 cal. BP, and in the later period a trackway and platform structure provide unequivocal evidence for human exploitation of the floodplain environment during the Bronze Age. The site is unique in offering the first certain evidence of the utilisation of Taxus in the construction of a wooden prehistoric platform. Across north-west Europe during the middle-Holocene, the colonisation of Taxus on peat is well documented; at Beckton, it occurred between ca. 5220-4940 and 4410-4220 cal. BP. This research provides important insights into the former distribution of Taxus, and reasons for its expansion and decline during the Holocene, which has relevance to present-day concerns over the conservation and management of Taxus woodland. Abandonment of the site occurred in response to environmental change to wetter conditions. The study employed multi-proxy analyses, including pollen, plant and wood macrofossils, and uniquely Coleoptera; Coleopteran analysis has significant potential to enhance understandings of environmental change and human-environment interactions in coastal wetland research.

AB It is estimated that half the soil carbon globally is in the subsoil, but data are scarce. We updated estimates of subsoil organic carbon (OC) in England and Wales made by Bradley etal. (2005) using soil and land-use databases and compared the results with other published data. We estimated that the soils of England and Wales contained 1633, 1143 and 506Tg of OC at 0-30, 30-100 and 100-150cm depths, respectively. Thus, half of the soil OC was found below 30cm depth. Peat soils accounted for the largest proportion, containing 44% of all the OC below 30cm despite their small areal extent, followed by brown soils, surface-water gley soils, ground-water gley soils and podzolic soils. Peat soils had more than 25% of their profile OC per unit area in the 100-150cm depth, whereas most other soils had <8% at this depth. The differences between soil types were consistent with differences in soil formation processes. Differences in depth distributions between land uses were small, but subsoil OC stocks in cultivated soils were generally smaller than in soils under grassland or other land uses. Data on subsoil OC stocks in the literature were scarce, but what there was broadly agreed with the findings of the above database exercise. There was little evidence by which to assess how subsoil OC stocks were changing over time.

AB Mosses dominate the understory of black spruce forest, and changes in moss community composition and functional traits may influence many important ecosystem processes, particularly paludification due to accumulation of peat (mainly Sphagnum). To understand performance and fitness of ground-cover mosses in early forest succession following clearcutting, we investigated photosynthetic traits in Sphagnum and three feathermoss species (i.e., Hylocomium, Ptilium, and Pleurozium) coexisting in mature stands and decade-old black spruce harvest blocks. The results showed that all of these mosses have a significantly higher light saturation point at the harvested plots than the forested plots. Feathermosses at the harvested plots all underwent a reduction in quantum efficiency, chlorophyll b content, and chlorophylls:carotenoids ratio related to photoinhibition, particularly Pleurozium, which experienced a significant decrease in maximum net photosynthesis. In contrast, Sphagnum showed a significant increase in maximum gross photosynthesis, dark respiration, and the ratio of chlorophyll a:b at the harvested plots compared with the forested plots. The distinctive responses of moss photosynthetic traits indicate the potential proliferation of Sphagnum and decrease of feathermosses, and thus consequent peat accumulation. Our results emphasize the importance of the photosynthetic traits of moss as indicators of postharvest conditions for enhancing understory vegetation management to maintain and improve productivity of black spruce.

AB Glomalin is described in the literature as a N-linked glycoprotein and the putative gene product of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Since the link between glomalin and various protein fractions in soil is not yet clearly defined, glomalin- related soil protein (GRSP) more appropriately describes glomalin's existence in natural organic matter (NOM). The objective of this study was to examine the chemical characteristics of GRSP present in several mineral and organic soils of varying organic carbon content. GRSP was isolated using high temperature sodium citrate extraction followed by either trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) precipitation. GRSP was characterized by quantitative solid-state C-13 DPMAS NMR, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and the Bradford assay for protein content. GRSP accounted for 25% and 52% of total C in the mineral soils and organic soil, respectively. Molar C/N and H/C ratios reveal that GRSP has less nitrogen than bovine serum albumin (BSA), and that GRSP extracted from the Pahokee peat soil possessed a more unsaturated, and thus aromatic character relative to the mineral soil GRSP, respectively. GRSP's high aromatic (42-49%) and carboxyl (24-30%) carbon contents and low aliphatic (4-11%) and carbohydrate-type carbon contents (4-16%) suggests that GRSP does not resemble a typical glycoprotein. In fact, the NMR spectra of GRSP closely resemble that of humic acid. GRSP extracted from mineral and organic soils possessed the same NMR fingerprint regardless of the precipitation method used (i.e., either TCA or HQ. It is likely that the current GRSP extraction methods, because of their similarity to the method used to extract humic acid, are coextracting both materials. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The south Ecuadorian Andean mountain belt between 3500 and 4500 in altitude is covered by a highly endemic and fragile ecosystem called paramo. The Histic Andosols covering this region have highly developed hydric properties and exert a key function in the hydrological regulation of the paramo ecosystem. Unlike most Andosols, their extreme water retention capacity is not due to the presence of typical minerals such as allophane or imogolite. Although these minerals are virtually absent, the large organic carbon content, due to organometallic complexation, gives rise to similar proper-ties. The water content at 1500 kPa can exceed 2000 g kg(-1), and the high hydraulic conductivity at saturation (about 15 nun h(-1)) drops sharply when low suction is applied. The three methods applied, i.e. the inverted auger hole, the tension infiltrometer and the constant-head permeameter method, give very similar results. The paramo is characterized by a slow hydrological response and a good water regulation, caused by the combination of a high water storage capacity and high conductivity. The wide pore size distribution of the organometallic complexes results in a water retention curve that differs significantly from the classic Mualem-Van Genuchten description, but can better be described with a simple linear or semilogarithmic model. The soils investigated are very prone to irreversible structural changes caused by land-use changes. The conversion of natural land for cultivation has a large impact on the hydrological function of the region. The water storage capacity increases by 5 to 30%, and the hydraulic conductivity is 31% higher in cultivated catchments. These changes are related to a larger peak flow, a smaller base flow and aenerally a smaller discharge buffering capacity, despite the higher storage capacity.

AB Relevance. Macrophytes are one of the key participants in accumulation of chemical elements in lake ecosystems, but despite this, the issue of elemental composition of macrophytes of thermokarst lakes in Western Siberia and accumulation of chemical elements relative to the sediments and pore water remains practically unexplored.
   The aim of the research is to describe the formation of elemental composition of macrophyte species of thermokarst lakes in the north of Western Siberia and to identify the possibility of their use in biomonitoring.
   The objects of research were macrophyte plants (Hippuris vulgaris L., Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb., Comarum palustre L., Ranunculus spitzbergensis Hadac, Carex aquatilis Wahlenb s. Str., Menyanthes trifoliata L.), sediments and pore waters of thermokarst lakes of the north of Western Siberia.
   Methods. The elemental composition of the samples was studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent Technologies, 7500 se), the concentration of anions in water samples was determined by liquid chromatography (Dionex ICS-2000), the dissolved organic carbon was defined by infrared spectroscopy TOC-VCSN, Shimadzu), the organic carbon content of the sediments was determined by infrared spectrometry (Horiba Jobin Yvon Emia-320V C/S Analyzer). Statistical processing of data was carried out using the STATISTICA 6.0 software package.
   Results. The coefficients of biological accumulation of chemical elements in macrophytes relative to sediments and pore water were calculated for four key thermokarst lakes. It has been shown that macronutrients (Na, Mg, Ca), some heavy metals and metalloids (Ni, Cu, Zr, Co, As, Cd), as well as B and Mo are actively accumulated in water plants of thermokarst lakes of Western Siberia. High coefficients of accumulation of heavy metals indicate a significant phytoremediation function of macrophytes in a given territory.

AB To evaluate the selenium (Se) level in agricultural soils in Japan and to investigate its determining factors, 180 soil samples were collected from the surface layer of paddy or upland fields in Japan and their total Se contents were determined. Finely ground soil (50 mg) was wet-digested with HNO3 and HClO4 solution and the released Se was reduced to Se(IV). The concentration of Se(IV) was then determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector after treatment with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene and extraction with cyclohexane. The total Se content ranged from 0.05 to 2.80 mg kg-1 with geometric and arithmetic means of 0.43 and 0.51 mg kg-1, respectively. The overall data showed a log-normal distribution. In terms of soil type, volcanic soils and peat soils had relatively high Se content and regosols and gray lowland soils had relatively low Se content. In terms of land use, upland soils had significantly higher Se content than paddy soils. Among regions, soils in the Kanto, Tohoku, Hokkaido and Kyushu regions had relatively high content. The total Se content had a significant positive correlation with the organic carbon content (P < 0.01) and the equation for the estimation of total Se content with organic carbon suggested that on average approximately 48% (0.24 mg kg-1) of the total Se was in inorganic forms and approximately 52% (0.25 mg kg-1) was in organic forms. Soil pH, on the contrary, did not show a significant relationship with the total Se content. In conclusion, the organic matter content, in combination with volcanic materials, was the main determining factor of the total Se content of agricultural soils in Japan.

AB To evaluate quantitatively the changes in corneal curvature, including irregular astigmatism, after scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. Methods. In 29 eyes of 29 patients undergoing scleral explant surgery, videokeratographic measurements were carried out before and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. Using Fourier harmonic analysis, dioptric data on mire rings were decomposed into spherical, regular astigmatic, and irregular astigmatic (decentration and higher order irregularity) components. Results. The irregular astigmatic component significantly increased at 1 week postoperatively but returned to the preoperative level 1 month after surgery. The regular astigmatism also displayed a transient in crease up to 1 month after surgery. The increases in regular astigmatism were significant in eyes that had scleral buckling of less than or equal to 180 degrees but not in eyes with buckles extending >180 degrees. Conclusion. Changes in irregular astigmatism after retinal detachment surgery were quantitatively evaluated. The scleral buckling surgery causes a transient increase in irregular astigmatism as well as regular astigmatism.

AB Background: Humic substances (HS) are compounds with a complicated structure, present in the humus soil layer, water, lake sediments, peat, brown coal and shales. Due to their similar physicochemical properties to DNA, they may have an adverse effect on the subsequent use of the isolated material. The main aim of this research was to examine the effect of HS on DNA isolation depending on the soil type and land use, taking into account the spectroscopic full characteristics of HS fractions.
   Methods: The research was conducted on eight types of soil sample. Soils represented the most important Soil Reference Groups for temperate climates: Fluvisols, Regosols, Cambisols, Arenosols, Histosols and Luvisols. Soil samples were also collected from areas diversified in terms of use: arable land, grassland and forest. The extraction of HS fractions was performed using the procedure recommended by the International HS Society. The fractional composition of HS was characterized by UV-Vis and fluorescence methods. Soil DNA is extracted by direct cell lysis in the using a CTAB-based method with a commonly-used commercial soil DNA isolation kit. The basis for assessing the quantity and quality of extracted DNA was the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction since the analysis of soil DNA often relies on the use of PCR to study soil microorganisms.
   Results: Based on the results, it can be concluded that in the presence of a high concentration of HS, the isolated DNA was low quality and the additional purification procedure was necessary. Despite the differentiation of the internal structure of HS fractions, the decisive factor in the efficiency of DNA isolation from soil samples was the total carbon content in HS. Reduced DNA yields can significantly constrain PCR detection limits to levels inadequate for metagenomic analysis, especially from humus-rich soils.

AB This paper shows how, with the aid of computer models developed in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to quantify and map how policy decisions are likely to affect multiple ecosystem services in future. In this way, potential trade-offs and complementarities between different ecosystem services can be identified, so that policies can be designed to avoid the worst trade-offs, and where possible, enhance multiple services. The paper brings together evidence from across the Rural Economy and Land Use Programme's Sustainable Uplands project for the first time, with previously unpublished model outputs relating to runoff, agricultural suitability, biomass, heather cover, age, and utility for Red Grouse (Lagopus scotica), grass cover, and accompanying scenario narratives and video. Two contrasting scenarios, based on policies to extensify or intensify land management up to 2030, were developed through a combination of interviews and discussions during site visits with stakeholders, literature review, conceptual modeling, and process-based computer models, using the Dark Peak of the Peak District National Park in the UK as a case study. Where extensification leads to a significant reduction in managed burning and grazing or land abandonment, changes in vegetation type and structure could compromise a range of species that are important for conservation, while compromising provisioning services, amenity value, and increasing wildfire risk. However, where extensification leads to the restoration of peatlands damaged by former intensive management, there would be an increase in carbon sequestration and storage, with a number of cobenefits, which could counter the loss of habitats and species elsewhere in the landscape. In the second scenario, land use and management was significantly intensified to boost UK self-sufficiency in food. This would benefit certain provisioning services but would have negative consequences for carbon storage and water quality and would lead to a reduction in the abundance of certain species of conservation concern. The paper emphasizes the need for spatially explicit models that can track how ecosystem services might change over time, in response to policy or environmental drivers, and in response to the changing demands and preferences of society, which are far harder to anticipate. By developing such models in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to depict scenarios of real concern to those who need to use the research findings. By engaging these collaborators with the research findings through film, it was possible to discuss adaptive options to minimize trade-offs and enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services under the very different future conditions depicted by each scenario. By preparing for as wide a range of futures as possible in this way, it may be possible for decision makers to act rapidly and effectively to protect and enhance the provision of ecosystem services in the face of unpredictable future change.

AB Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of Agave Salmiana bagasse was investigated to assess the potential of hydrochar as an energy resource. The effect of operating conditions on the mass yield and the energy quality of hydrochar was examined by varying the temperature and the holding time over the ranges of 180-250 degrees C (T) and 0-60 min (t), respectively. These parameters were screened using the response surface methodology through a Doehlert design. Performances of HTC were assessed on the basis of the hydrochar mass yield higher heating value ultimate and proximate analyses. In the studied domain, the modeling results indicated that the hydrochar mass yield varies between 45% and 86% and higher heating valuesfrom18 to 23 MJ.kg(-1), which is similar to that of peat. In addition, the volatile matter and fixed carbon fractions of hydrochars ranged from 54 to 80% and between 12 and 36%, respectively. Energy yield modeling indicated that the mass yield is the most influent parameter. The maximal energy yield value was obtained at 180 degrees C with time equal to 0 min. Globally, the evolution of H/C ratio is amplified for temperatures greater than 215 degrees C by increasing the holding time from 30 to 60 min. For O/C ratio the maximal variation is below these conditions. It is concluded that increased hydrothermal carbonization conditions favor dehydration reactions, while decarboxylation reactions are favored in mild HTC conditions. The combustion characteristics such as ignition peak and burnout temperatures were significantly modified for hydrochars. The model results indicated that lowest ignition and peak temperature values are obtained at both low-temperature and low-holding time, and high-temperature and high-holding time zones. An increase in the burnout temperature was correlated with the increase of the fixed carbon content in hydrochars.

AB Solute transport and storage processes in wetlands play an important role in biogeochemical cycling and in wetland water quality functions. In the wetlands of the Everglades, there are few data or guidelines to characterize transport through the heterogeneous flow environment. Our goal was to conduct a tracer study to help quantify solute exchange between the relatively fast flowing water in the open part of the water column and much more slowly moving water in thick floating vegetation and in the pore water of the underlying peat. We performed a tracer experiment that consisted of a constant- rate injection of a sodium bromide ( NaBr) solution for 22 hours into a 3 m wide, open- ended flume channel in Everglades National Park. Arrival of the bromide tracer was monitored at an array of surface water and subsurface samplers for 48 hours at a distance of 6.8 m downstream of the injection. A one- dimensional transport model was used in combination with an optimization code to identify the values of transport parameters that best explained the tracer observations. Parameters included dimensions and mass transfer coefficients describing exchange with both short ( hours) and longer ( tens of hours) storage zones as well as the average rates of advection and longitudinal dispersion in the open part of the water column ( referred to as the " main flow zone''). Comparison with a more detailed set of tracer measurements tested how well the model's storage zones approximated the average characteristics of tracer movement into and out of the layer of thick floating vegetation and the pore water in the underlying peat. The rate at which the relatively fast moving water in the open water column was exchanged with slowly moving water in the layer of floating vegetation and in sediment pore water amounted to 50 and 3% h(-1), respectively. Storage processes decreased the depth- averaged velocity of surface water by 50% relative to the water velocity in the open part of the water column. As a result, flow measurements made with other methods that only work in the open part of the water column ( e. g., acoustic Doppler) would have overestimated the true depth- averaged velocity by a factor of 2. We hypothesize that solute exchange and storage in zones of floating vegetation and peat pore water increase contact time of solutes with biogeochemically active surfaces in this heterogeneous wetland environment.

AB Wetland restoration on peat islands previously drained for agriculture has potential to reverse land subsidence and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as peat accretes. However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest.
   IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

AB Despite the growing employment of Remote Sensing (RS) techniques in paleoenvironmental studies, the strati graphic interpretation of RS-derived paleodrainage traces is still an open issue, as their relation to subsurface is largely unexplored. Here we applied a multi-data analysis approach, including publicly available optical images from different satellites (Landsat, ASTER, Sentinel, Hyperion), LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM), soil reflectance spectra and facies core data, which succeeded in revealing a paleodrainage system buried beneath a 200-sq km wide wetland (the Mezzano Lowland-ML) of the Po coastal plain (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). Data integration in a GIS environment allowed the 3D mapping of numerous and temporally persistent meandering traces. From distal to proximal locations, the RS-derived traces show a hierarchical organization, in terms of sinuosity and width, and form a dense and dendritic pattern typical of a tidally-influenced system. Surface and subsurface cross-investigation of two meandering traces through soil reflectance spectra and core stratigraphy reveal that these landforms represent the surface expression of buried channels that eroded the underlying lagoonal succession, with lateral transition to intertidal deposits. LiDAR-detected micro-morphologies related to paleomeanders evolution strongly influenced the spatial distribution of mid-late Holocene peat-bearing lithofacies (i.e., salt marsh and swamp), and hence soil moisture distribution, inducing the sharp radiance contrasts (traces) detected by satellite sensors on the surface. On-trace areas invariably lack peat deposits and record the top of 3-4 m-thick channel-fill sands, some 2-4 m below the ground level. In contrast, out-of-trace areas are characterized by organic-rich soils that cap a 2.5-3.5 m-thick succession of intertidal-supratidal peat deposits, accumulated in depressed areas lateral to the channel-levee complex. We conclude that in the early stage of Po Delta construction, between ca. 6000-2500 cal yr BP, two distinct tidal-influenced drainage networks fed the Mezzano Lowland lagoon under a predominantly autogenic control. These findings indicate the suitability of a low-cost RS-stratigraphic approach to improve the reconstruction of past paleogeographic scenarios buried beneath deltaic lowlands, shedding new light on the evolution trends of coastal landforms, environments and sedimentary patterns under highstand conditions.

AB Aims: In this study, measurement of colour changes during solid state fermentation (SSF) are presented as one of the potential techniques that can be used to describe growth, complementary to other biomass estimation, such as weight of fungus, spores concentration, organic matter loss, glucosamine and enzyme activity, which is directly related to growth.
   Methodology and results: In this study, fungal fermentation of Aspergillus awamori and A. oryzae are carried out on complex heterogeneous solid media; wheat bran, soybean hull and rapeseed meal, which are constituted of various soluble and insoluble solid particles. Fermented mass was extracted using distilled water to obtain a cell free extract, which can be determined quickly and accurately using UV-Visible spectrophotometer measured absorbance at 300 nm. The results showed a significant correlation between colours produced from fungal SSF and the concentration of spores, weight of fungus cells, organic matter loss, glucosamine and enzyme activity. We found that the colour density proportionally increased when the studied parameters mentioned above increased. For the growth of A. awamori and A. oryzae on wheat bran, soybean hulls and rapeseed meal, it was confirmed that colour production was directly proportional to fungal growth. In general, colour-based methods seem to be the most promising approach for biomass estimation in SSF.
   Conclusions, significance and impacts of study: The theory of measuring colour changes in SSF by UV-visible spectroscopy demonstrates that the colour method gives some valuable information than just obtaining a visual observation or spore count to describe growth of fungal mycelium in SSF. The ideas obtained from this exercise might provide a quick and convenient method for quality control of fungal growth. The advantages of this method are that the procedure is simple to carry out, it is non-destructive and no special and expensive reagents are required and the process is very cheap. This new approach is an important complimentation to the existing techniques especially for basic studies.

AB The minerals found in the no. 5 coal (Late Permian) from the Zhaotong Coalfield, Yunnan Province, southwestern China, have been examined and found to consist mainly of kaolinite, pyrite, chamosite, quartz, and calcite, with trace amounts of illite and mixed-layer illite-smectite. The proportion of chamosite in clay minerals ranges from 32 to 56 wt%, with an average of 46 wt%. Chamosite is distributed not only in collodetrinite, but also occurs as cell fillings in fusinite, semifusinite, and telinite. The high content and mode of occurrence of chamosite in this mine indicate its formation by interaction of kaolinite with Fe-Mg-rich fluids during early diagenesis. Except for a minor amount of terrigenous quartz, most quartz is of authigenic origin and formed from kaolinite desilication. The calcite content of the no. 5 coal is 1.4-6.3% (with an average of 3%) and is distributed in collodetrinite and as cell fillings of coal-forming plants. Calcite originated from seawater invasion during peat accumulation. Pyrite occurs in several ways: as massive, framboidal, isolated enhedral/anhedral, and euhedral forms. In addition, the presence of a large amount of pyritized red algae provides strong evidence of seawater invasion during peat accumulation. The red algae may have played an important role in the enrichment of sulfur in the coal. The characteristic assemblage of minerals in this mine resulted from a unique basinal environment in which the mineral matter was derived from a basaltic source region, volcanic activity, and seawater transgression during coal formation.

AB Stable carbon isotope investigations have been carried out on Miocene brown coal from the Garzweiler Seam of the German Lower Rhine Embayment. Material studied included fossil wood from seven different taxa, and brown coal matrix. Isotope results from macrofossil analysis show variations of more than 6 parts per thousand within individual samples and reveal a general isotopic difference between angiosperm and gymnosperm wood specimens. According to mean carbon isotope values found for gymnosperms, angiosperms and brown coal matrix (-23.3 parts per thousand, -26.0 parts per thousand and -25.8 parts per thousand), the peat-forming vegetation of the Garzweiler Seam was dominated by angiosperm taxa. Results from brown coal matrix establish a continuous high-resolution depth profile of carbon isotope variations during the late Middle Miocene. They show a significant and characteristic isotope pattern with distinct medium- and short-term cycles (high-frequency variations) in the two main units of Garzweiler Seam (locally split into three units). The medium-term delta(13)C variations are most likely caused by varying proportions of gymnosperms within the peat-forming vegetation while high-frequency oscillations seem to be a direct signal of environmental changes. A long-term decline of carbon isotope values observed within the complete Garzweiler Seam from base to top is presumably due to a cooling trend in the Miocene. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Evaluation of the capability of aggregated oil sands mine tailings:

ID MICROBIAL BIOMASS-C; SOIL; FUMIGATION; SYSTEMS
AB An experiment was initiated in 1997 in northeast Alberta at the Syncrude Canada Ltd. Mildred Lake site to field test an innovative technique for reclamation of oil sand mine tailings. This technique was used to create an aggregated soil material from oil sand tailings. A plant community was successfully established on the soil material created by this technique. However, whether the site would be capable of supporting a self-sustainable ecosystem for the long-term remained a challenging issue. We evaluated the capability of these aggregated oil sand tailings by using biological indicators of the abundance and diversity of soil microbial biomass. Soil respiration rates and soil microbial biomass measurements were used to assess the abundance and activities of soil microbial communities. The ability of soil microbial biomass to utilize a diverse range of carbon substrates was used to assess the diversity of soil microbial communities. Soil biological activity increased with increasing growth of plant biomass and over time. Increasing the amount of peat moss or muskeg incorporated into the soil during reclamation resulted in higher organic carbon and nitrogen content and caused an increase in abundance and diversity of soil microbial biomass. These results indicate that measurements of soil respiration and substrate utilization by soil microbial communities may be used as biological indicators for assessing the capability of reclaimed soils.

   Hinggan Mountains
AB Recently, the degradation of permafrost and marsh environments in the Da and Xiao Hinggan Mountains has become a great concern as more human activities and pronounced climate warming were observed during the past 30 years and projected for the near future. The distribution patterns and development mechanisms of the permafrost and marshes have been examined both in theories and in field observations, in order to better understand the symbiosis of permafrost and marshes. The permafrost and marshes in the Da and Xiao Hinggan Mountains display discernible zonations in latitude and elevation. The marsh vegetation canopy, litter and peat soil have good thermal insulation properties for the underlying permafrost, resulting in a thermal offset of 3 degrees C to 4 degrees C and subsequently suppressing soil temperature. In addition, the much higher thermal conductivity of frozen and ice-rich peat in the active layer is conducive to the development or in favor of the protection of permafrost due to the semi-conductor properties of the soils overlying the permafrost. On the other hand, because permafrost is almost impervious, the osmosis of water in marsh soils can be effectively reduced, timely providing water supplies for helophytes growth or germination in spring. In the Da and Xiao Hinggan Mountains, the permafrost degradation has been accelerating due to the marked climate warming, ever increasing human activities, and the resultant eco-environmental changes. Since the permafrost and marsh environments are symbiotic and interdependent, they need to be managed or protected in a well-coordinated and integrated way.

ID MATTER
AB Soil management studies show that intensive arable agriculture can lead to a decline in both organic matter levels and the stability of the soil structure. It is a priority to understand how soil structure responds when fresh organic materials are added to poor quality degraded arable soils. This is of particular interest because of its implications for carbon sequestration. We investigate whether the addition of organic materials can form stable aggregates in a degraded soil. Grass or peat residues were added to samples of soil obtained from the continuous grassland and arable plots of the long-term experiment at Highfield, IACR-Rothamsted (UK) and incubated at 2 degrees and 24 degreesC, for up to 8 weeks at -5 kPa. At 1 day and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks the soil was slaked in de-ionised water and the aggregate size distributions were measured. The data was used to calculate mean weight diameters (MWD). The treatments with added grass showed increased aggregation relative to the control; the treatments with added peat did not. At 24 degreesC the value of MWD increased with the incubation period, but at VC there was no further aggregation beyond week two. Respiration measurements were made and the samples that released the most CO2 were also those which re-aggregated the most. This suggests that the process of aggregation is microbiologically mediated. The results are discussed within the broader context of the implications of soil organic matter content on soil management.

AB The research was carried out on arable soils of the region of Lublin. The aim of the study was to determine the content of Zn extractable in 1 M HCl.dm(-3) in profiles of selected types of soils and the total content of Zn (measured in aqua regia) in soil samples from the accumulative layer 0-20 cm of the soils. The investigations included 8 morphological types of soils: Rendzic Leptosols (typical rendzinas), Rendzic Leptosols (humic rendzinas), Haplic Phaeozems, Calcaric Cambisols, Haplic Luvisols, Cambic Arenosols, Haplic Podzols, Eutri-Terric Histosols. The content of zinc (Zn) was measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). In mineral soils the highest content of total Zn was found in rendzinas (48.0-55.8 mg.kg(-1) DM) and the lowest one appeared in rusty soil and in podzolic soil - about 13 mg Zn.kg(-1) each, at average 24.5 mg.kg(-1). Average concentration of available forms of zinc was 5.2 mg Zn.kg(-1). The amount of this element in soils was from 2.0 mg Zn-kg(-1) in the level Cca of typical rendzinas to 17.0 mg Zn-kg(-1) in the accumulative level of peat soil. In most profiles the highest concentration of soluble form of Zn was present in the accumulative layer and was usually decreasing deeper in the profile. The distribution of Zn in profiles was shaped by the biological accumulation of this element in the humus horizon and natural biogeochemical processes.

AB The article presents the results of research on peats, muds and sands filling a palaeocavity within alluvial fans of the Bystrzyca River valley, in the Sudetic Foreland of SW Poland. In the 534-cm deep research profile in the central part of a palaeolake, 267 samples were collected at an interval of 2 cm and lithologically (structural and textural studies), palaeobotanically (studies of diatoms, pollen plant macrofossils and fossil wood), palaeozoologically (Cladocera, Mollusca and Ostracoda), geochemically (chemical elements and isotopes) and palaeomagnetically analyzed.
   The profile consists of three parts: organic with mineral layers (lower), mineral (middle), and organic (upper). The palynological diagram was divided into three zones that represent local sets of pollen zones. This diagram, although incomplete, is clearly indicative of the younger part of the Holsteinian (Mazovian: pollen III and IV periods interglacial). The upper part of the diagram consists of four local pollen zones that are correlated with stadial and interstadial periods. Analysis of several samples of fossil wood shows the widespread presence of Pinus remains and numerous fragments of rhytidome (bark) of Betula. Development of the peat layer (1.36-0.68 m depth) started with paludification of the forest with the Betula forest. Analysis of Cladocera shows the presence of chitin armor components (species: Chydorus sphaericus, Alona rectangula and ephippia of Alona rectangula) in three samples.
   Lithological, Cladocera and palaeo-magnetic research, supported by geochemical studies, indicate the existence of at least three main phases. The lake originated during the younger part of the Holsteinian (Mazovian) Intergalcial as an oxbow within the valley, where the deposition of variously thick (up to 1.5 m depth) peats, organic and minerogenic silts (the first stage). In the second phase, a closed, fairly deep late Holsteinian lake continued to exist under relatively warm conditions with mainly mineral deposition from the slope. The lake became shallower and wider, and then more open and better oxygenated (with through-flow). In the final phase the lake was completely filled by organic sediments under interglacial conditions. The absence of diatom, molluscan and ostracod communities indicates an acid lacustrine environment at this time. The fluvial and limnic deposits are sealed by overlaying Saalian (Odranian) till.

AB Stratigraphic records extending to Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (57,000-29,000 cal yr BP) or older in Beringia are extremely rare. Three stratigraphic sections in interior western Alaska show near continuous sedimentological and environmental progressions extending from at least MIS 3, if not older, through MIS 1 (14,000 cal yr BP-present). The Kolmakof, Sue Creek, and VABM (vertical angle bench mark) Kuskokwim sections along the central Kuskokwim River, once a highland landscape at the fringe of central and eastern Beringia, contain aeolian deposition and soil sequences dating beyond 50,000 C-14 yr BP. Thick peaty soil, shallow lacustrine, and tephra deposits represent the MIS 3 interstade (or older). Sand sheet and loess deposits, wedge cast development, and very thin soil development mark the later MIS 3 period and the transition into the MIS 2 stade (29,000-14,000 cal yr BP). Loess accumulation with thicker soil development occurred between similar to 16,000-13,500 cal yr BP at the MIS 2 and MIS 1 transition. After similar to 13,500 cal yr BP, loess accumulation waned and peat development increased throughout MIS 1. These stratigraphic sequences represent transitions between a warm and moist period during MIS 3, to a cooler and more arid period during MIS 2, then a return to warmer and moister climates in MIS 1.

AB Compost-amended substrates offer the potential for management of diseases caused by soilborne as well as foliar plant pathogens. In this study, the efficacy of composed pine bark mix fortified with the biocontrol agent Trichoderma hamatum 382 (FCPB) against bacterial leaf spot of radish, lettuce, and tomato under controlled environment conditions was evaluated. Plants grown in the FCPB mix and inoculated with bacterial leaf spot pathogens were less severely diseased than plants grown in commercial peat mix or vermiculite. In some cases, plants were also grown in a composted cow manure mix or in a steam-treated compost-amended greenhouse soil, and these plants were also less severely diseased. Infected radish and tomato plants grown in these compost-amended substrates also harbored significantly smaller populations of Xanthomonas campestris pv. armoraciae and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, respectively. The disease-suppression effect of the FCPB mix was lost by autoclaving and restored by remoculating the autoclaved FCPB mix with nonautoclaved FCPB mix. However, the disease-suppression effect varied among the batches of FCPB mix used. In contrast, vermiculite and a highly decomposed sphagnum peat mix consistently failed to suppress these diseases. These results suggest that producing vegetable seedlings in FCPB mix or compost-based substrates may provide initial protection against bacterial leaf spot pathogens.

AB In this paper, we provide screening-level analysis of plausible Everglades ecosystem response by 2060 to sea level rise (0.50 m) interacting with macroclimate change (1.5 A degrees C warming, 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and rainfall that either increases or decreases by 10%). We used these climate scenarios as input to the Ecological Landscape Model to simulate changes to seven interactive hydro-ecological metrics. Mangrove forest and other marine influences migrated up to 15 km inland in both scenarios, delineated by the saltwater front. Freshwater habitat area decreased by 25-30% under our two climate change scenarios and was largely replaced by mangroves and, in the increased rainfall scenario, open water as well. Significant mangroves drowned along northern Florida Bay in both climate change scenarios due to sea level rise. Increased rainfall of 10% provided significant benefits to the spatial and temporal salinity regime within the marine-influenced zone, providing a more gradual and natural adjustment for at-risk flora and fauna. However, increased rainfall also increased the risk of open water, due to water depths that inhibited mangrove establishment and reduced peat accumulation rates. We infer that ecological effects related to sea level rise may occur in the extreme front-edge of saltwater intrusion, that topography will control the incursion of this zone as sea level rises, and that differences in freshwater availability will have ecologically significant effects on ecosystem resilience through the temporal and spatial pattern of salinity changes.

AB Intensive management for biomass production results in high rates of nutrient removal by harvesting. We tested whether wood ash generated when burning wood for energy could be used to ameliorate negative soil effects of short-rotation harvesting practices. We measured the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil nutrient properties after wood ash applications in a willow plantation in central New York State and determined the influence of wood ash application on willow growth. Wood ash was applied annually for 3 years at the rates of 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1) to coppiced willow, Salix purpurea, clone SP3. Wood ash application significantly increased soil pH in the 0-10 cm soil layer from 6.1 in the control to 6.9 and 7.1 in the 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1) treated plots. Wood ash application significantly increased soil extractable phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations. Potassium was the element most affected by wood ash treatment at all soil depths. Wood ash had no significant effect on nutrient concentrations of foliar, litter, and stem tissue. Wood ash did not affect either individual plant growth or plot biomass production, which declined over the course of the study; it did increase the size of stems, but this effect was balanced by a decrease in the number of stems. Applying nitrogen as well as wood ash might be required to maintain the productivity of this SRIC system. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An investigation was conducted to identify the best combination of proportion of vermicompost in soil-based potting mix and pot volume for the production of paper pot seedlings suitable for mechanical transplanting. The best combination of the potting mix and pot volume is the one that produces seedlings with high growth of root and shoot biomasses at the end of seedling stage, low in cost and light in weight. Cubical shaped paper pots of 50 cm(3) volume filled with potting mix of 25% vermicompost and 75% soil and sand in equal proportion by volume was found to be best for the large scale production of paper pot seedlings of tomato, eggplant, and chili peppers. The paper pots were found to be firm at the end of seedling stage and variations in their dimensions could be accommodated in fully automatic transplanters with horizontal chain conveyor type seedling feeding and metering devices.

AB The Fe1-x(N1-yCy)(x) iron carbonitrides commonly encountered with high non-metal content are the epsilon (x=0.25-0.33) and (x=0.33-0.36) phases whose structures derive from the ones existing in the binary Fe-N system by substituting N by C. As it is possible to synthesize cubic gamma" and gamma''' iron nitrides with an atomic nitrogen content x close to 0.5, we study here the possibility to substitute N by C to obtain carbonitrides close to an equiatomic non-metal content. Fe1-x(N1-yCy)(x) films were deposited on copper substrates using a triode sputtering magnetron mode with an iron target in a variable reactive Ar-N-2 and/or -CH4 mixture. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis was used to determine their composition. The as-sputtered states were identified by X-Ray Diffraction. The target being magnetic, we propose a particular geometry allowing its sputtering.
   In a pure (Ar-N-2) reactive plasma (y=0), the atomic nitrogen content x in the films increases linearly from 0 to 0.51 with the N-2 flowing rate and then stays constant. The successive nitrides, epsilon-Fe3N, xi-Fe2N and a mixture of gamma" and gamma''' can be identified. However, some diffraction peaks remain not indexed using the previous phases. In a pure (Ar-CH4) reactive plasma (y=1), the atomic carbon content x in the films increases rapidly and linearly from 0 to 0.62 as a function of the CH4 flowing rate while structure changes from alpha-Fe to X-Fe5C2 via epsilon-Fe3C and then to an amorphous compound.
   In a variable (Ar-N-2-CH4) reactive plasma, Fe1-x(N1-yCy)(x) ternary films keeping x close to 0.5 with various y values within the range 0-0.46 are obtained. The crystalline carbonitrides detected by X-Ray Diffraction evolves from a gamma''/gamma''' mixture for y=0 to for y=0.41-0.46 passing through a xi/gamma'' mixture for y=0.33. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of salinity stress on five cultivars of common bean: Bassbeer, Beladi, Giza 3, HRS 516 and RO21 were evaluated on a sand/peat medium with different salinity levels (0, 50 and 100 mM NaCl) applied 3 weeks after germination for duration of 10 days. Salinity had adverse effects not only on the biomass yield and relative growth rate (RGR(t)), but also on other morphological parameters such as plant height, number of leaves, root length and shoot/root weight ratio. Photosynthesis, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were adversely affected in all cultivars. Leaf osmotic potential and leaf turgor varied significantly among cultivars and salt levels. The interaction between cultivars and salt levels for photosynthesis, leaf osmotic potential and leaf turgor was highly significant at day 10 of salt treatment. The Na uptake among the cultivars varied in the order: HRS 516 < RO21 < Giza 3 < Bassbeer < Beladi. This suggests that HRS 516 was most tolerant cultivar because it was the only cultivar with the highest survival rate and no symptoms of salt stress. RO21 was the most susceptible to salinity as it showed severe symptoms of salt stress and very low survival rate.

AB We studied carbon balances and carbon stocks of mountain rangelands and meadows in a network of 8 eddy covariance sites and 14 sites with biomass data in Europe. Net ecosystem exchange of pastures and extensively managed semi-natural rangelands were usually close to zero, while meadows fixed carbon, with the exception of one meadow that was established on a drained peatland. When we accounted for off-site losses and inputs also the carbon budget of meadows approached zero. Soil carbon stocks in these ecosystems were high, comparable to those of forest ecosystems, while carbon stocks in plant biomass were smaller. Since soil carbon stocks of abandoned mountain grasslands are as high as in managed ecosystems, it is likely that the widespread abandonment of mountain rangelands used currently as pastures will not lead to an immediate carbon sink in those ecosystems.

DE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES; SOIL EVOLUTION; ROLE OF PLANTS IN SOIL EVOLUTION
AB Plants of the modern ecosystem influence humous content mainly to a depth of 20 cm. Therefore any climate changes that lead to succession changes of the ecosystem lead to a change in the humous content only in that layer. In deeper horizons due to global climate change, either the former humous state will be preserved or the humous reserves will diminish, which is related to mineralization of the humus or to gleying. Global climate changes also lead to a change in the water regime, which will facilitate peat accumulation (in the case of submersion) and decomposition with a more intensive water demand.

AB Hydrothermal processes are key components of permafrost dynamics and hydrological and carbon cycles in northern forest ecosystems. A forest hydrology model. ForHyM, was used to evaluate these processes by determining how the depth and duration of frost penetration into the soil would vary daily over the course of several decades. This was done for chosen upland/wetland conditions within the Mackenzie Plain south of Fort Simpson, where permafrost is currently sporadic to discontinuous. The model calculations were done using daily weather records from November 1963 to 2010, starting with a hypothetical no-frost condition within the soil and subsoil. Model performance was evaluated by comparing modeled and measured temperatures at different soil depths (upland and peat plateau modelling, R-2 = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). It was found that well-drained upland forests within the general area would experience deep and complete freeze thaw cycles each year. In contrast, poorly drained wetlands would develop gradually deepening permafrost that would at first stabilize in depth over the course of 10 to 20 y, with thaw depth limited to <1 m each year. However, recent increases in recorded air temperature (more so in winter than in summer) would destabilize the pennafrost layer, and this would especially occur in areas with insufficient surface insulation by local peat, moss, forest litter, and snow accumulations. These estimates are consistent with (i) reported thawing depths and the widening encroachment of collapse scars towards the poorly drained portions of the South Mackenzie Plain.

   SLOPE
AB Many of the physical and biological processes that characterize arctic ecosystems are unique to high latitudes, and their sensitivities to climate change are poorly understood. Stratigraphic records of land-surface processes and vegetation change in the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska reveal how tundra landscapes responded to climatic changes between 13,000 and 8000 C-14 yr BP. Peat deposition began and shrub vegetation became widespread ca. 12,500 C-14 yr BP, probably in response to the advent of warmer and wetter climate. Increased slope erosion caused rapid alluviation in valleys, and Populus trees spread northward along braided floodplains before 11,000 C-14 yr BP. Lake levels fell and streams incised their floodplains during the Younger Dryas (YD) (11,000-10,000 C-14 yr BP). A hiatus in records of Populus suggest that its geographic range contracted, and pollen records of other species suggest a cooler and drier climate during this interval. Basal peats dating to the YD are rare, suggesting that rates of paludification slowed. Immediately after 10,000 C-14 yr BP, lake levels rose, streams aggraded rapidly again, intense solifluction occurred, and Populus re-invaded the area. Moist acidic tundra vegetation was widespread by 8500 C-14 yr BP along with wet, organic-rich soils. Most of these landscape-scale effects of climatic change involved changes in moisture. Although low temperature is the most conspicuous feature of arctic climate, shifts in effective moisture may be the proximate cause for many of the impacts that climate change has in arctic regions.

AB Facies relationships in abandoned Holocene Mississippi Delta complexes are characteristic of both retrogradational transgressive systems tracts (TST) and progradational highstand systems tracts (HST). In the Barataria interlobe basin, delta-plain facies of the early Holocene Maringouin/Teche delta complex(TST), which accumulated from 7500 to 6000 yr BP, are overlain by a lagoonal facies 1 2 m thick (MFS) that accumulated during the maximum flooding event from 6000 to 3500 yr BP. Wave reworking transformed the distributary sands of retrogradational delta complexes into stratigraphically backstepping shoreline sand bodies. The most landward of these shorelines, the Teche shoreline, overlies the MFS and is, by definition, the shoreline of maximum transgression (SMT) (Penland et al. 1987a, 1987b; Kosters 1989). Relatively thick peats of high organic content, dating from 2400 to 1100 yr BP, are located immediately landward of this shoreline. Younger delta lobes. rapidly prograding since 1100 yr BP, have shifted the coastline seaward of the Teche shoreline, and form the first progradational HST parasequence. Thin, organic-poor salt marsh sediments are accumulating within this parasequence landward of the present shoreline.
   Rising relative sea level provides increased accommodation space while fresh water may be held within the delta plain, creating conditions of both groundwater and nutrients favorable to accumulation of high-quality organic facies of this type. In a subsequent progradational setting, stable relative sea level results in less accommodation space landward of the shoreline, while fresh water and nutrients are discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, forcing formation of brackish and salt marsh environments, unfavorable to accumulation of high-quality organic facies. These hypotheses may help explain the variability of some littoral high-quality coals vs. carbonaceous shales in the rock record.

AB At Phalarope Pond, western Kodiak Island, a multidisciplinary study using pollen and spores, macrofossils, stable isotopes, and carbon accumulation provides the Holocene vegetation and climate history following the deglaciation that began over 16,000 cal years ago (yr BP). Following a cold and dry Younger Dryas, a warm and wet early Holocene was characterized by abundant ferns in a sedge tundra environment with maximum carbon accumulation, similar to high latitude peatlands globally. About 8,700 cal yr BP sedge and ferns declined and climate remained warm as drier conditions prevailed, limiting carbon sequestration. The abrupt shift in D/H isotopes of about 60% indicates a shift to cooler conditions or a more distal moisture source. Neoglaciation beginning about 3,700 cal yr BP is evident from increases in Artemisia, Empetrum and Betula, signifying cooler conditions, while Alnus declines, paralleling regional trends.

AB Little is known about how exactly light plays its role in the growth of choy sum (Brassica rapa var. parachinensis), a widely cultivated vegetable in Asia. By applying a commercial soil using black peat as major constituent with 17:10:14 ratio of NPK fertilizer in this study, the growth responses of choy sum seedling to progressively increasing white LED light intensity in an indoor plant factory were investigated, where positive enhancements were observed in choy sum morphology and growth including both dry and fresh mass accumulation under higher light intensity till 400 mu mol/(m(2).s), then a reduction occurred due to light oversaturation and overheat. In indoor plant factory, the inhomogeneous distribution phenomenon of illumination level was inevitably occurred in indoor farm racks generally. For accurately evaluating the productivity of choy sum grown on such racks, a light-time-biomass response model of choy sum seedling grown at the seedling stage was thus established for the first time, which could reliably predict the production outcome of this species in indoor farming practice under various lighting condition and duration. The robustness of the model was further tested by model variation test and sufficient robustness of this model was confirmed. The new insight obtained for the light-dependence of choy sum growth and the light-time-biomass response model can be used to efficiently direct its seedling production in indoor plant factories.

In the active part of humus, weakly condensed humic acids are predominant.  The concentration of mobile forms of heavy metals (water and 1 N HCl extraction) increases in the upper horizon of the profile and in its lower part above the surface of permafrost.  The concentration of strontium as well as of water-soluble salts of magnesium, sodium, and potassium is highest in the uppermost horizon of the profile.  A hypothesis of heavy metal, strontium, and lithium uptake by soils of Spitsbergen is based on mass transport of ocean-derived aerosols.

AB Mineralogy and geochemistry of Nos.1, 9 and 10 coals in the Lingshi Deposit, Qinshui Basin, China, are investigated in this paper, using industrial analysis, total sulfur and forms of sulfur analyses, optical microscope, scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometers. The results show that the minerals in coals are mainly kaolinite, nacrite, dickite, palygorskite, calcite, pyrite, anatase, dolomite, siderite and barite. Kaolinite of terrigenous origin is commonly discovered in No. 1 coal, which results in a high concentration of SiO2 (up to 6.81%) and Al2O3 (up to 8.42%); In the process of coalification, kaolinite could be converted into dickite and nacrite in Nos. 9 and 10 coal; Pyrite, the host of W, Tl, and As, and palygorskite in Nos. 9 and 10 coals are formed under the influence of the transgression. Besides, Nos. 9 and 10 coals, affected by transgression, are similar in the element contents and distribution patterns with positive delta Y-N anomalies (up to 1.44). However, No. 1 coal, normalized by No. 10 coal, is characterized by high concentration coefficients of Co, Ni, Sb, Li, Be, Sc, V, Cu, Ga, Rb, Cs, Ba, Pb and Th (2 < CC < 10), and these elements are derived from clay minerals of terrigenous origin, which means that Permo-Carboniferous coals in the Lingshi Deposit show the evolution of a regressive process in general.

AB Land disposal of secondary secondary treated sewage effluent is being widely adopted in Australia as an alternative to tertiary treatment. At the Cleveland Waste Water Pollution Control Works, effluent has been applied to a Hapludalf at high rates (3000 mm yr(-1)) for more than 20 yr, adding an estimated 4.5 t P ha(-1) to the soil. Thus, this site pro,ides an opportunity to assess the retention of P under conditions typical of southeast Queensland, Laboratory chemical fractionation and P sorption studies of effluent irrigated and control sites Here undertaken to determine the amount and Forms of P retained within this soil and its: capacity to retain further P. Organic material (peat) which had accumulated on the surface of effluent irrigated plots, was also sampled and its P content determined. Accumulation of P was limited to the sandy surface soil, increasing total soil P content by approximate to 700 kg ha(-1), with this increase being approximately evenly distributed between inorganic and organic pools. The excessive irrigation rate used on this site, and the management adopted, has resulted in a marked podzolization of the surface horizon, apparent in reduced extractable Fe and Al concentrations. The removal of these P adsorbing materials would contribute, along with P saturation and organic ligand competition, to the much lower P sorption capacity of irrigated sites relative to the control. The largest P pool Has found to be the pest layer, containing approximately 1500 kg P ha(-1). On this site P has accumulated principally in organic forms, both within the soil and as peat on its surface, This finding throws into question the common practice of predicting disposal scheme life on the basis of P adsorption curves.

AB The paper presents the result of the studies on the properties of soil organic matter in Sapric Histosols associated with mid-forest spring niches in the valley of the Kamienna Creek, left bank tributary of the Slupia River (northern Poland). We sampled five soil profiles at the depth of every 10 cm until the mineral bed was reached. We analyzed degree of peat mass decomposition, reaction and the content of organic matter, total organic carbon and total nitrogen. Fractional composition of soil organic matter was analyzed with Schnitzer method. We measured the absorbance at wavelenghts of 280, 465 and 665 nm in 0.01% alkaline solutions of humic acids and the absorbance ratios A(2/6), A(2/4) and A(4/6) were calculated based on these data. The studied soils consisted of strongly and moderately decomposed alder and alder-sedge peat, which contained 309.7-829.0 g/kg of organic matter. The soils were moderately abundant in nitrogen and were characterized by low variability in pH (pH(H2O) 5.6-6.9). Soil organic matter was dominated by humins, contribution of which ranged from 71.5 to 91.9%. Humic acids constituted 4.9-22.1%, fulvic acids 1.9-6.7% and the most labile organic substances extracted during decalcification of samples (G(dek)) 0.2-1.1% (tab. 2). The observed relatively low degree of humification and quantitative predominance of humic acids over fulvic acids are features typical for riparian organic soils. High values of absorbance ratios of alkaline solutions of humic acids (tab. 3) indicate predominance of aliphatic structures over aromatic in their molecules, which is typical for weakly humified organic substances.

AB Korean spruce (Picea koraiensis Sieb. El Zucc.) is one of the main afforestation species in northern China. Seedling quality is a critical factor at planting time. To test whether the synergistic growth enhancement of Scotch pine (P. sylvestris var. mongolica) seedlings brought by the plant beneficial fungus Trichoderma virens (J.H. Mill., Giddens and A.A. Foster) Arx and ectomycorrhizal fungus (Suillus luteus (L.) Roussel.) can also benefit Korean spruce seedlings, we examined the effects of S. luteus and T. virens on the growth of P. koraiensis seedlings and drought resistance of P. sylvestris var. mongolica in peat soils. The two fungi were added to sterilized peat soil in pots, and the plants were grown for 4 months. Seedling growth and physiological variables, including mycorrhizal colonization rate of roots, biomass, and chlorophyll content, were examined. The colonization rate of the mycorrhizal fungus on P. koraiensis exceeded 65 %, and the synergism between S. luteus and T. virens enhanced most of the variables for P. koraiensis seedlings after inoculation with S. luteus then 30 days later with T. virens as in our published results for seedlings of P. sylvestris var. mongolica. When seedlings of P. sylvestris var. mongolica were inoculated with this sequence, they became more drought tolerant. T. virens also induced S. luteus to produce -1,3-glucanase and chitinase. This inoculation sequence at planting can thus improve the quality of P. sylvestris var. mongolica and P. koraiensis seedlings and substantiates our previous results.

AB Phosphorus loading to the northern Florida Everglades has been implicated in causing changes in vegetation, peat accretion rates, and other soil physical-chemical properties. Our study focused on determining the influence of P loading on aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophic microbial activities (measured as CO(2) and CH(4) production) in detritus and soil collected from the Water Conservation Area 2a (WCA-2a) of the Everglades. Heterotrophic microbial activities measured under both field and laboratory conditions were higher in areas impacted by P loading as compared to the unimpacted interior marsh. Microbial heterotrophic activities were higher in detritus and surface soils and decreased with depth. In field studies, CO(2) production rates in anaerobic soils were approximately 64% of those observed in aerobic soils. Additions of substrates containing C, N, and P generally enhanced heterotrophic microbial activity. In laboratory studies involving addition of various inorganic electron acceptors, increased microbial activities in the order of O(2)(-) > NO(3)(-) = SO(4)(2-) > HCO(3)(-) were observed. Microbial CO(2) production rates under denitrifying and sulfate reducing conditions ranged from 30-42% and 29-44%. respectively, of aerobic rates. Methane production rates were only up to 9% of aerobic CO(2) production rates. Both CO(2) and CH(4) production rates were significantly correlated with soil P parameters and microbial biomass. Enhanced heterotrophic microbial activities resulting from P loading has the potential to increase turnover of organic matter which may lead to increased supply of bioavailable nutrients to emergent macrophytes and periphyton and higher nutrient concentrations in the water column.

TI CHANGES IN THERMOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BIOMASS WITH DIFFERENT

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Biomass; pyrolysis; thermophysical characteristics; differential thermal
   analysis; true values
AB The work relevance is caused by the need to study the changes of biomass thermophysical characteristics in its thermal transformation in relation to the design of technological equipment and energy use.
   The main aim of the research is to study the thermophysical characteristics during slow pyrolysis of biomass with different mineralization amount.
   Objects: biomass resources with different amount of mineralization - straw (A(d)=2,8 %), nonconforming wheat bran (A(d)=6,9 %), lowland peat of the Sukhovsky deposit (A(d)=22,8 %).
   Methods. Thermotechnical characteristics of biomass samples and their carbon residue are determined according to certified methods (GOST R 54186-2010 (EN 14774-1: 2009), GOST R 56881-2016 (E1755-01), GOST 11305-2013, 11306-2013, GOST 32990-2014 (EN 15148: 2009)); values of the calorific value were determined using the ABK-1 calorimeter (RET, Russia) in accordance with GOST 147-2013 (ISO 1928-2009); elemental analysis of organic part was carried out on a Vario Micro Cube (Elementar, Germany) device; thermal processing was carried out by differential thermal analysis and physical experiment; the thermophysical characteristics of the biomass and its carbon residue were measured by laser flash method using the thermal conductivity analyzer Discovery Laser Flash 1 (DLF-1); the true density was measured using an automatic gas pycnometer Ultrapyc-1200e (Quantachrome Instruments, USA); the carbon residue structure was studied by scanning microscopy VEGA 3 SBU electron microscope (TESCAN, Czech Republic).
   Results. Straw and bran pyrolysis proceeds in two stages, differing in the average rate of decomposition - (0,38...0,41) %.degrees C-1 and 0,09 %.degrees C-1 respectively. Peat decomposition occurs in the whole temperature range (220-500 degrees C) with an average decomposition rate of 0,11 %.degrees C-1. It was found that the thermal conductivity of carbon residue from straw and bran, which have a relatively low ash content for biomass, does not significantly change up to 400 degrees C, after which this value increases. The heat capacity of these samples increases with the temperature of their production to 300 degrees C, after which it sharply decreases. The carbon residue obtained at 500 degrees C has a higher heat capacity value compared to the residue obtained at 400 degrees C. These changes can be explained by decomposition of biomass organic part components - cellulose and lignin. The heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of sukhovsky peat carbon balance have a high mineralization amount (A(d)=22,8 %), decrease in all temperature range, due to the inorganic components share increase in result of organic part decomposition, which is confirmed by the solid phase density increase.

AB In order to evaluate and protect ecosystem services provided by peat and peaty soils, accurate estimations for the depth of the surface organic horizon are required. This study uses linear mixed models (LMMs) to test how topographic (elevation, slope, aspect) and superficial geology parameters can contribute to improved depth estimates across a Scottish upland catchment. Mean (n = 5) depth data from 283 sites (representing full covariate ranges) were used to calibrate LMMs, which were tested against a validation dataset. Models were estimated using maximum likelihood, and the Akaike Information Criterion was used to test whether the iterative addition of covariates to a model with constant fixed effects was beneficial. Elevation, slope and certain geology classes were all identified as useful covariates. Upon addition of the random effects (i.e. spatial modelling of residuals), the RMSE for the model with constant-only fixed effects reduced by 24%. Addition of random effects to a model with topographic covariates (fixed effects = constant, slope, elevation) reduced the RMSE by 13%, whereas the addition of random effects to a model with topographic and geological covariates (fixed effects = constant, slope, elevation, certain geology classes) reduced the RMSE by only 3%. Therefore, much of the spatial pattern in depth was explained by the fixed effects in the latter model. The study contributes to a growing research base demonstrating that widely available topographic (and also here geological) datasets, which have national coverage, can be included in spatial models to improve organic horizon depth estimations.

DT Article
AB Thirteen selected samples on coalfields and coal exposures from different locations of Venezuela were analyzed by means of:  proximate analysis, calorific value, organic petrography, sulphur content and distribution (pyritic, sulphatic, organic, and chemical analysis of major elements in ash, using the ASTM procedures for nearly all of them.
   The high volatile matter content and calorific value and the low ash, allow the utilization of national coals as fossil fuel. However, high sulphur concentration requires a previous washing of the mineral.
   Through normative analysis in coal ash interelemental geochemical ratios and petrographic parameters, important differences can be established according to physicochemical conditions of peat accumulation, and in their possible sedimentary environment.  Thus, coals deposited during Paleocene Age (Los Cuervos and Marcelina formations) were formed in a more siliciclastic depositional environment, possibly with higher fluctuations in the peat swamps watertable, than the younger coals (post-Paleocene Age) located in the Lago de Maracaibo, Falcon and Oriental Basins.
   Coals from the Venezuelan Oriental Bosin are very similar among them, even though they show slight variations in rank.  They also show higher sulphur content and predominance of vitrinite over the remaining minerals.  Depositional environments were similar in nature (low delta plains) in active tectonic margins.
   Coals from Falcon State show geochemical and petrographic features with similarities to those from the Oriental Basin.  These consist in: Depositional environment (delta plains), organic matter type (continental in nature) and physico-chemical conditions of accumulation (lightly reductor, high sulphur content).
   The only coal manifestation in Guayana, the Cerro Impacto coals, are very different from the others.  There are distinctive features in parental organic matter, in paleoclimatic conditions of deposition and clastic sources, requiring a particular study.

   STABILITY; CAPILLARY RISE; CONTACT-ANGLE; WETTING PROPERTIES;
   PREFERENTIAL FLOW; MATTER; SURFACE
AB Hydrophobicity of organic matter is the primary factor affecting soil physical properties such as soil structural stability after drying. In horticultural production, the measurement of wettability is even more relevant due to the large use and high content of organic materials in growing media and to the large and rapid variations in water content in the media ( due to the limited volumes of pots or containers), both of which can quickly create hydrophobic conditions. This review discusses the methods used for measuring the wettability of growing media, the evolution of wettability vs. water content, ways for limiting hydrophobicity, and finally the relationships between growing media wettability and physical properties. In addition to the indirect estimation of hydrophobicity based on physical properties such as water holding capacity, contact angles obtained from capillary rise and hydration efficiency tests are the most common methods describing the changes from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity of organic growing media in relation to water content. Wetting agents and clay have been shown to reduce the water repellency of growing media under the driest conditions. A general trend of increasing water repellency during desiccation from highly decomposed peat > bark > weakly decomposed peat > wood products > coco fiber has been documented. As for water retention, hysteresis phenomena in contact angles have been shown during drying-wetting cycles. The influence of hydrophobicity on water retention characteristics has also been modeled, providing evidence that hydrophobicity is a function of the growing medium pore size domain. The reciprocal effects of physical and biological roles of roots on the wettability and physical properties of growing media should be investigated in future research.

AB A database was constructed of tree-anchorage measurements from almost 2000 trees from 12 conifer species that were mechanically overturned on 34 sites in the United Kingdom between 1960 and 2000. Anchorage was compared among species, soil groups (freely-draining mineral, gleyed mineral, peaty mineral, and deep peat) and root depth classes (shallow, < 40 cm; medium, 40-80 cm; and deep, > 80 cm) using regressions of critical turning moment against stem mass. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) was used as a benchmark because it formed the largest part of the database and was the only species with all soil-group and depth-class combinations. Anchorage of Sitka spruce was strongest on,peat and poorest on gleyed mineral soils. Deep rooting increased critical turning moments by 10%-15% compared with trees of equivalent mass with shallower roots. Significantly better anchorage than Sitka spruce was found for grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), with various rooting depths on freely draining and gleyed mineral soils and for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) on medium-depth mineral soil. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) had poorer anchorage than Sitka spruce over a range of soil groups and root depth classes. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) on shallow gleyed mineral soil, and Corsican pine (Pinus nigra subsp. laricio (Poir.) Maire) on medium depth mineral soil, also had poorer anchorage. Other combinations had similar anchorage to the equivalent Sitka spruce. These results are discussed with respect to the development of forest wind-risk models.

AB According to the synthetic analysis of coal petrology and the isotopic determinations of the organic sulfur and pyrite in the column sections of No. 9 coal seam (the high sulfur coal whose delta(34)S Of organic sulfur is from -12. 3 parts per thousand to 5. 8 parts per thousand and delta(34)S of pyritic sulfur is from -18. 7 parts per thousand to 1. 1 parts per thousand) and No. 13 coal seam (the low sulfur coal whose delta(34)S of organic sulfur is from 9. 6 parts per thousand to 11. 5 parts per thousand and delta(34)S of pyritic sulfur is from 8. 6 parts per thousand to 9. 7 parts per thousand) in Wuda coalfield, the characteristics and the genesis of sulfur isotopes in coals were discussed, and then the relationships between the organic sulfur isotope and the pyritic sulfur isotope, and delta(34)S values of organic sulfur and pyrite and total sulfur were analyzed. The study results show that there are administrative levels in the column section of the coal seam and anti-directions in the geological history in the sulfur isotope formation of the high sulfur coal. The administrative levels reflect the open degree of SO42- and H2S in a system and filtration of (SO42-)-S-32 because of the pyrite formation. The anti-direction reflects not only the contributions of Fe2+ and SO42- to the high sulfur formation in the initial stage of peat swamp accumulating, but also the major factors of the seawater influence and the Fe2+ supplying in the later period of peat swamp accumulation.

TI HUMAN IMPACT ON REGIONAL GROUNDWATER COMPOSITION THROUGH INTERVENTION IN
   NATURAL FLOW PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN LAND-USE
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; HYDROCHEMISTRY; PORTUGAL; URANIUM
AB The relations between groundwater composition, land use, soil conditions and flow patterns on a regional scale are studied for the Gooi and Vechtstreek area in the Netherlands. This densely populated area consists of a glacier-created ridge with dry sand soils bordered by the Vecht and Eem River plains with wet Peat and clay soils. R-mode factor analysis and Q-mode cluster analysis were applied to a set of 1349 groundwater analyses to determine the factors controlling groundwater composition and the main resulting water types.
   The results indicate that groundwater composition in the study area is affected on a regional scale by human activities through changes in land use and intervention in natural flow patterns. On the ridge, ground water is recharged by precipitation, which dissolves carbonates from the matrix of the sandy aquifer. Increased solute concentrations in shallow ground water, especially of nitrate, sulphate and potassium, indicate increased pollution resulting from urbanization and increasingly intensive agricultural activity over the past decades.
   In the Vecht River plain infiltration occurs as a result of drainage of polders and groundwater "traction on the ridge. Recharge occurs by precipitation and from polluted surface water to which ammonium, organic complexes and carbonic acid are added through decomposition of organic matter in the peat and clay soils. The carbonic acid results in enhanced dissolution of carbonates present in the soil and the underlying sandy aquifer. Oxygen depletion and subsequent low redox potentials result in denitrification, dissolution of manganese and iron oxides, and sulphate reduction. The flow of ground water from high-level to low-level polders causes displacement of a former stagnant brackish groundwater body under the Vecht River plain accompanied by increased mixing of fresh and brackish ground water.

   depth; root suckers; cuttings
AB Root cuttings from 10-year-old European aspen (Populus tremula L.) were rooted in decomposed Sphagnum peat and sand. The root cuttings were exposed to different temperatures (10 and 25 degrees C) and a light intensity of 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 83 days. Five levels of root depth were used: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 16 cm. Suckers of another clone of 15-year-old European aspen were exposed to different light intensities (300, 150, 75 and 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) for 120 days. The percentage of sprouting aspen cuttings was highest in the upper part of the peat (2-6 cm). The total number of suckers was highest at 4 and 6 cm root depths. Dry weights of suckers at 4 and 6 cm root depths were 4 200 and 3 840 mg at 25 degrees C and 340 and 180 mg at 10 degrees C, respectively, but were negligible at other root depths. Cuttings produced more suckers when exposed to 25 degrees C than to 10 degrees C. Most of the suckers were produced during 15-25 days after planting. Dry weights of suckers exposed to 300, 150, 75 and 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-3) were 1831, 2280, 1107 and 323 mg, respectively. A practical implication of the relation between temperature level and sucker production and height is avoiding large openings in stands where aspens have been cut. When preventing aspen suckers the aspen ought to be cut in young dense thinning stands where temperature and light intensity are lower than on open areas such as clear cuts.

AB Models of carbon storage in softwood and hardwood trees and forest soils and its emission from timber products and waste are developed and integrated with data on storage benefits to yield estimates of the value of the net carbon flux generated by afforestation. The long-term nature of the processes under consideration and the impact of varying the discount rate are explicitly incorporated within the model. A geographical information system (GIS) is used to apply carbon sequestration models to data on tree growth and soil type distribution for a large study area (the entire country of Wales). The major findings are: (1) all three elements under analysis (carbon sequestration in livewood, release from different products and waste, and storage or emission from soils) play a vital role in determining overall carbon flux; (2) woodland management has a substantial impact upon carbon storage in livewood however the choice of discount rate exerts the largest overall influence upon estimated carbon flux values; (3) timber growth rates (yield class) also have a major impact upon values; (4) tree species does affect storage values, however this is less important than the other factors listed above; (5) non-peat soils generally sequester relatively low levels of carbon. Planting upon peat soils can result in very substantial emissions of carbon which exceed the level of storage in livewood.
   The GIS is used to produce valuation maps which can be readily incorporated within cost-benefit analyses regarding optimal locations for conversion of land into forestry. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality reflects numerous environmental processes, including primary production and decomposition, redox gradients, hydrologic transport, and photochemistry. Fluorescence spectroscopy can detect groups of DOM compounds sensitive to these processes. However, different environmental gradients (e. g., redox, DOM provenance) can have confounding effects on DOM fluorescence spectra. This study shows how these confounding effects can be removed through discriminant analyses on parallel factor modeling results. Using statistically distinct end-members, we resolve spatiotemporal trends in redox potential and DOM provenance within and between adjacent vegetation communities in the patterned ridge and slough landscape of the Everglades, where biogeochemical differences between vegetation communities affect net peat accretion rates and persistence of landscape structure. Source discrimination of DOM in whole-water samples and peat leachates reveals strong temporal variability associated with seasonality and passage of a hurricane and indicates that hurricane effects on marsh biogeochemistry persist for longer periods of time (>1 year) than previously recognized. Using the DOM source signal as a hydrologic tracer, we show that the system is hydrologically well mixed when surface water is present, and that limited transport of flocculent detritus occurs in surface flows. Redox potential discrimination shows that vertical redox gradients are shallower on ridges than in sloughs, creating an environment more favorable to decomposition and diagenesis. The sensitivity, high resolution, rapidity, and precision of these statistical analyses of DOM fluorescence spectra establish the technique as a promising performance measure for restoration or indicator of carbon cycle processes in the Everglades and aquatic ecosystems worldwide.

AB The copper (Cu) resistance of 1-year-old seedlings of heather (Calluna vulgaris) was tested in a greenhouse experiment. The plant material originated from seeds collected from three peatland sites located 1.2 km to the NW, and 2.5 and 5.5 km to the NE of the Harjavalta Cu-nickel (Ni) smelter, SW Finland. The plants were watered with a nutrient solution containing five different levels of Cu (1, 10, 22, 46 and 100 mg l(-1)). Cu clearly decreased the length growth of shoots, shoot and root biomass of C. vulgaris. More than 50% of the seedlings exposed to the highest Cu treatment died. C. vulgaris accumulated high amounts of Cu, the living old roots containing a maximum of 2200 mg kg(-1) Cu and the living stems 1300 mg kg(-1) Cu. Discolouring leaves contained higher Cu concentrations than green leaves. The results indicate Cu accumulation in roots and root-to-shoot transport. Some differences were found between the responses of the three seed provenances, but none of the populations proved to be more resistant to Cu than the others in all the measured responses.

AB Subarctic and boreal emissions of CH4 are important contributors to the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and subsequently the global radiative forcing. Whilst N2O emissions may be lower, the much greater radiative forcing they produce justifies their inclusion in GHG studies. In addition to the quantification of flux magnitude, it is essential that we understand the drivers of emissions to be able to accurately predict climate-driven changes and potential feedback mechanisms. Hence this study aims to increase our understanding of what drives fluxes of CH4 and N2O in a subarctic forest/wetland landscape during peak summer conditions and into the shoulder season, exploring both spatial and temporal variability, and uses satellite-derived spectral data to extrapolate from chamber-scale fluxes to a 2 km x 2 km landscape area.
   From static chamber measurements made during summer and autumn campaigns in 2012 in the Sodankyl region of northern Finland, we concluded that wetlands represent a significant source of CH4 (3.35 +/- 0.44 mgCm(-2) h(-1) during the summer campaign and 0.62 +/- 0.09 mgCm(-2) h(-1) during the autumn campaign), whilst the surrounding forests represent a small sink (0.06 +/- < 0.01 mg Cm-2 h(-1) during the summer campaign and -0.03 +/- < 0.01 mg Cm-2 h(-1) during the autumn campaign). N2O fluxes were near- zero across both ecosystems.
   We found a weak negative relationship between CH4 emissions and water table depth in the wetland, with emissions decreasing as the water table approached and flooded the soil surface and a positive relationship between CH4 emissions and the presence of Sphagnum mosses. Temperature was also an important driver of CH4 with emissions increasing to a peak at approximately 12 degrees C. Little could be determined about the drivers of N2O emissions given the small magnitude of the fluxes.
   A multiple regression modelling approach was used to describe CH4 emissions based on spectral data from PLEIADES PA1 satellite imagery across a 2 km x 2 km landscape. When applied across the whole image domain we calculated a CH4 source of 2.05 +/- 0.61 mgCm(-2) h(-1). This was significantly higher than landscape estimates based on either a simple mean or weighted by forest/wetland proportion ( 0.99 +/- 0.16, 0.93 +/- 0.12 mgCm(-2) h(-1), respectively). Hence we conclude that ignoring the detailed spatial variability in CH4 emissions within a landscape leads to a potentially significant underestimation of landscape-scale fluxes. Given the small magnitude of measured N2O fluxes a similar level of detailed upscaling was not needed; we conclude that N2O fluxes do not currently comprise an important component of the landscape-scale GHG budget at this site.

AB In southern Quebec (Charlevoix, Canada), reconstructions of the subalpine insect assemblages were made in environments that were transformed by fire during the late Holocene (since 4500 BP). The ecological requirements of beetle species likely to be found as fossils were studied by collecting living beetles in pitfall traps in forest, subalpine and alpine environments. The late-Holocene changes of insect assemblages were reconstructed by recovering fossil insects from 13 pear sections. Modem beetle assemblages are valuable indicators of tree cover. Well-developed podzol soils under peat, as well as numerous spruce charcoal remains overlaying the podzol in all sampling sites, suggest that a dense spruce cover was present before the beginning of the accumulation of peat, and was eliminated by lire (4570-800 BP). Ground beetle and bark beetle assemblages at the base of the pear sections contained a mixture of forest and open-environment species, indicating that the postfire environment was a subalpine one with a tree cover of 30-50%. The most recent fire in the area (AD 1915) increased the openness of the landscape (tree cover <30%). Forest ground beetles and bark beetles disappeared almost completely; only open-environment species remained. The late-Holocene history of the Charlevoix mountains as reconstructed using fossil insects is similar to that reconstructed using charcoal remains. However, fossil insects add significant information (tree cover, health of trees, forest composition) that is difficult to obtain using other macrofossils. This opens up new opportunities for palaeoecological studies in the boreal forest, which was formed during the Holocene epoch, and was frequently disturbed by fire and insect outbreaks.

AB The analysis of a 10 000 calendar year (cal. ka) pollen record on the west coast of Tasmania has revealed a suite of changes that can be related to sea level, fire and people. Fire-promoted moorland has occupied the site for the entire period and challenges the long-held assumption that rainforest dominated the landscape of western Tasmania through the early to mid Holocene. Changes in wetland taxa and the occurrence of benthic marine diatoms indicate a Holocene sea-level high-stand between 6.3 and 5.8 cal. ka. A significant and sustained rise in charcoal concentration occurs after 6 cal. ka, reflecting the combined effects of anthropogenic burning and hydrological changes that were probably modulated by regional climatic forcing. Finally, European colonisation resulted in a significant decrease in charcoal, rapid peat accumulation and a suite of vegetation changes.

AB The spatial and temporal variability of a low-centred polygon on the eastern floodplain area of the lower Anabar River (72.070 degrees N, 113.921 degrees E; northern Yakutia, Siberia) has been investigated using a multi-method approach. The present-day vegetation in each square metre was analysed, revealing a community of Larix, shrubby Betula, and Salix on the polygon rim, a dominance of Carex and Andromeda polifolia in the rim-to-pond transition zone, and a predominantly monospecific Scorpidium scorpioides coverage within the pond. The total organic carbon (TOC) content, TOC/TN (total nitrogen) ratio, grain size, vascular plant macrofossils, moss remains, diatoms, and pollen were analysed for two vertical sections and a sediment core from a transect across the polygon. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the formation of the polygon started at least 1500 yr ago; the general positions of the pond and rim have not changed since that time. Two types of pond vegetation were identified, indicating two contrasting development stages of the polygon. The first was a well-established moss association, dominated by submerged or floating Scorpidium scorpioides and/or Drepanocladus spp. and overgrown by epiphytic diatoms such as Tabellaria flocculosa and Eunotia taxa. This stage coincides temporally with a period in which the polygon was only drained by lateral subsurface water flow, as indicated by mixed grain sizes. A different moss association occurred during times of repeated river flooding (indicated by homogeneous medium-grained sand that probably accumulated during the annual spring snowmelt), characterized by an abundance of Meesia triquetra and a dominance of benthic diatoms (e. g. Navicula vulpina), indicative of a relatively high pH and a high tolerance of disturbance. A comparison of the local polygon vegetation (inferred from moss and macrofossil spectra) with the regional vegetation (inferred from pollen spectra) indicated that the moss association with Scorpidium scorpioides became established during relatively favourable climatic conditions, while the association dominated by Meesia triquetra occurred during periods of harsh climatic conditions. Our study revealed a strong riverine influence (in addition to climatic influences) on polygon development and the type of peat accumulated.

ID FOREST-FIRES; EMISSIONS; VEGETATION; CYCLE; CO2
AB The burned area, fuel type, crown fire percentage, and carbon release of the southern Siberia 2003 wildfire were analysed using AVHRR, MODIS, MERIS, ASTER images and a carbon release model. More than 200 000 km2 were burned from 14 March to 8 August 2003, of which 71.4% was forest, 9.5% humid grassland, and 2.15% bogs or marshes. During 1996 to 2003, 32.2% of the forested area and 23.36% of the total area was burned, and 13.9% of the total area was affected by fire at least twice. Direct carbon emission from this 2003 fire was around 400640 Tg. The 2003 Siberian fires could well have contributed to the high increase of the atmospheric CO2 and CO concentration in 2003. The increasing human pressure coupled with intensive fire severity, recurrent fire frequency, and increasing occurrence of summer droughts will reduce the carbon sequestration potential of this important carbon pool.

TI The sequestration of terrestrial organic carbon in Arctic Ocean

AB A variety of approaches have previously been developed to estimate the fraction of terrestrial or marine organic carbon present in aquatic sediments. The task of quantifying each component is especially important for the Arctic due to the regions' sensitivity to global climate change and the potential for enhanced terrestrial organic carbon inputs with continued Arctic warming to alter carbon sequestration. Yet it is unclear how each approach compares in de. ning organic carbon sources in sediments as well as their impact on regional or pan-Arctic carbon budgets. Here, we investigated multiple methods: (1) two end-member mixing models utilizing bulk stable carbon isotopes; (2) the relationship between long-chain n-alkanes and organic carbon (ALKOC); (3) principal components analysis (PCA) combined with scaling of a large suite of lipid biomarkers; and (4) ratios of branched and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (the BIT index) to calculate the fraction of terrestrial organic matter components preserved in Arctic marine sediments.
   Estimated terrestrial organic carbon content among approaches showed considerable variation for identical sediment samples. For a majority of the samples, the BIT index resulted in the lowest estimates for terrestrial organic carbon, corroborating recent suggestions that this proxy may represent a distinct fraction of terrestrial organic matter; i.e., peat or soil organic matter, as opposed to markers such as n-alkanes or long-chain fatty acids which measure higher plant wax inputs. Because of the patchy inputs of n-alkanes to this region from coastal erosion in the western Arctic, the ALKOC approach was not as effective as when applied to river-dominated margins found in the eastern Arctic. The difficulties in constraining a marine delta C-13 end-member limit the applicability of stable isotope mixing models in polar regions. Estimates of terrestrial organic carbon using the lipid-based PCA method and the bulk delta C-13 mixing model approach varied drastically at each site, suggesting that organic matter fractions such as amino acids or carbohydrates may affect bulk organic matter composition in a manner that is not captured in the lipid-based analysis. Overall, terrestrial organic matter inputs to the Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas using the average of the methods at each site ranged from 11% to 44%, indicating that land-derived organic matter plays a substantial role in carbon dynamics in the western Arctic Ocean.

AB In a similar to 60 m long record reflecting the period from 284 ka to 27 ka we analysed grain size distributions (GSD), organic carbon content, and aquatic pollen assemblages at 1-cm increments. The 4768-points time series show with similar to 60 yr resolution the dynamic history of Lake Fuquene (2540 m alt., 4 degrees N lat.) of the northern Andes during two full interglacial-glacial cycles. GSD show proportions of clay, fine silt, coarse silt, and sand evidencing the location of the sediment source (proximal vs distal) in relation to the drilling site, and available energy to transport sediments in the catchment area. Loss-on-ignition (LOI) values reflect estimates of the abundance of organic matter (OM) in the sediments. Aquatic pollen were grouped into assemblages characteristic of deep water, shallow water, swamp, and wet lake shore environments, reflecting a hydrological gradient sensitive for lake level changes.
   The End-Member Modelling Algorithm (EMMA) showed that 4 end-members (EMs) explain an optimal proportion (70%) of the observed variation. EMMA is able to unmix GSD of lacustrine sediments in a genetically meaningful way allowing EMs to be interpreted in past depositional and environmental settings. Most unexplained variability is located in the fraction of coarse sediment. OM content was estimated on the basis of LOI data and formed a fifth EM that mainly indicates presence of peat. Changes concur with submillennial-scale variability established in other proxies from this record (Groot et al., 2011). Periods with distinct sediment compositions are 284-243 ka (mainly MIS 8), 243-201 ka (mainly MIS 7), 201-179 ka (mainly MIS 7/6 transition), 179-133 ka (mainly MIS 6), 133-111 ka, (mainly MIS 5e) 111-87 ka (mainly MIS 5d-5b), 87-79 ka (mainly MIS 5a), 79-62 ka (mainly MIS 4), and 62-27 ka (MIS 3) showing sedimentological regimes are climate driven.

AB Forest landscapes represent the major land-cover type for the watersheds of the East River, which is the source of water for 40 million people in South China. Forest soils with high levels of organic carbon are a potential terrestrial source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the East River. DOC is of great concern, since it can form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. In this study, soils from three altitudes (200, 450 and 900 m) in the Xiangtou Mountain Nature Reserve in South China, representing soils from evergreen moon forest, transitional evergreen broadleaf forest, and evergreen broadleaf forest, respectively, were evaluated for their potential contributions of DBP precursors into the East River. The water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in three forest soils was physically and chemically fractionated into particulate organic carbon (1.2-0.45 mm), colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.22 mu m), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (<0.22 mu m), hydrophobic acid (HPOA), transphilic acid and hydrophilic acid and were analysed for the formation potentials of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and chloral hydrate (CHD). Also, soils were incubated at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C for 14 d in darkness to examine the impact of temperature effects on the availability and characteristics of WEOC. The extraction study showed that the amount of WEOC was proportional to soil organic carbon content, of which about 1% was water extractable. Regardless of soil type, DOC and HPOA were the most reactive fractions in forming THMs, CHD, and HANs. Production of DOC and HPOA in WEOC increased over 14 d incubation as incubation temperature increased, but the temperature did not alter the distribution of physical and chemical fractions and their reactivity in DBP formation. Results suggest higher inputs of DOC and DBP precursors from forest watersheds into source water may result in a warmer environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pesticide pollution caused by point or diffuse sources may lead to the contamination of ground and surface water. Biobed or biofilter systems, which are filled with a variety of organic materials (soil, peat and straw), are commonly used on farm to treat pesticide remnants. The objective of this study was to assess the sorption-desorption potential of three pesticides with contrasting physico-chemical properties (bentazone, boscalid, and pyrimethanil) on novel biofilter materials based on bioenergy residues (mixtures of soil with digestate and/or biochar) in laboratory batch equilibrium experiments.
   The results show that the biomixtures of digestate and biochar with soil increased pesticides sorption potential and the 1/n(des) values were lower than the 1/n(ads) values indicating that the desorption was hysteretic for all pesticides on these materials. The adsorption and desorption of all the chemicals conformed to linear and Freundlich isotherms. Higher values of distribution [K-d (>78 L kg(-1))] and Freundlich sorption coefficient [K-f (>900 mu g(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1))] were observed for all pesticides for the digestate and biochar based mixtures compared with the blank soil, which was attributed to the lower organic carbon content of the latter. However, unlike for sorption there was no statistically significant difference between the biochar and the digestate mixtures for pesticides desorption (p > 0.05; t-test). Specific UV-absorbances at 254 nm(SUVA(254)) indicated the aromatic character of digestate (5 and 30%) and biochar (5%) biomixture, which showed the highest organic-carbon-partition coefficients (K-oc) and/or K-d values amongst all biomixtures for all pesticides. Therefore, these biomixtures were found to be the most promising substrates amongst the tested ones for a novel biobed setup and can be used as effective and alternative adsorbents for removing pesticides from percolating water in biofilters.

AB A substantial fraction of natural organic matter (NOM) consists of complex mixtures of macromolecular compounds. As a result, high-molecular weight fragments liberated during the pyrolysis of NOM often carry the most significant structural information. Their diagnostic value, however, is commonly limited by the preferential transfer of lower-boiling pyrolysis products to the GC column, compared to larger fragments.
   Non-discriminating pyrolysis is a technique that minimizes transfer losses of larger fragments, which is the problem with most conventional pyrolyzers. It allows a range of sample sizes from similar to 15 mg for the study of samples of low organic carbon content to estimated sub-microgram sizes for bacterial biomass.
   In this study, the performance of the non-discriminating pyrolysis system in the characterization of natural organic matter (NOM) was compared to the performance of a conventional Pt-filament pyrolyzer. In addition, a more limited comparison was carried out with a Curie-point system. A variety of organic materials were selected to serve as NOM models: chitin, peat, and organic matter isolated from tertiary sands. Nondiscriminating pyrolysis-GC/MS allowed for the observation of larger molecular fragments, such as traces of cholesterol in the pyrolysis of chitin. Also, the distribution of the homologous series such as that observed for alkyl benzenes was shifted towards higher molecular weight fragments with the non-discriminating system. Overall, the macromolecular structures within NOM were more pronounced when using non-discriminating pyrolysis, as shown by the higher abundance in the pyrograms of higher molecular weight fragments of various polyaromatic and long-chain aliphatic compounds. Characterization of NOM using non-discriminating Py-GC/MS reduces the ambiguity caused by mass discrimination against higher mass fragments compared to other pyrolysis approaches. This provides a better fingerprint of the organic material present in different sample types, including soils and sediments. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane emission from a wetland was measured with the eddy covariance system. The location of the system allowed observation of methane efflux from areas that were covered by different vegetation types. The data presented in this paper were collected in the period between the 13th of June and the 31st of August 2012. During the warmest months of the summer, there was no strong correlation between methane emissions and either the water table depth or peat temperature. The presence of reed and cattail contributed to a pronounced diurnal pattern of the flux and lower methane emission, while areas covered by sedges emitted higher amounts more with no clear diurnal pattern.

AB High-resolution records of greenhouse gas concentrations from the Law Dome Antarctic ice core show small fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 and CH4, including a 10 ppmv decrease in CO2 and a 50 ppbv increase in CH4 during the Little Ice Age. Explanations for the biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchanges that caused these fluctuations, and their impacts on global climate, are lacking. We produce here a wetland index derived from the North American Pollen Database and show that for most of the past two millennia, this index is negatively correlated (antiphase) with atmospheric CO2 levels measured in the Law Dome ice core. Our analysis indicates the potential for global wetlands to act as carbon sinks, contributing to small fluctuations in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and thereby influencing submillennial-scale climatic change. Although our wetland index-CO2 relationship is statistically significant, the relationship between our wetland index-CH4 curve is not, possibly due to the confounding influence of wildfires on CH4.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the behavior of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) under boron (B) excess. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in a sandy soil-peat mixture using a nutrient solution containing 0.2 (control), 10 and 20 mg L-1 B. Visible symptoms were quantified and leaf B accumulation, gas exchanges, chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence, malondialdehyde by-products and antioxidants were investigated 20 days after the beginning of the treatments. Boron toxicity induced oxidative load and leaf necrotic burns coupled with the reduction of leaf growth and biomass accumulation in both species. Boron excess resulted in a decrease of Chl a/b ratio, potential (F-v/F-m) and actual (I broken vertical bar(PSII)) PSII quantum efficiency, photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration (E) as well. A general stimulation of the antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase was observed, and a significant increase in the oxidized form of ascorbate and glutathione was evidenced for treated plants of both species. A difference between the two species was observed: C. pepo appeared to be more sensitive to B stress being damaged at all B concentration. C. sativus grown at 10 mg L-1 B in nutrient solution showed some down-regulated mechanisms, i.e. increase in Chl b content and a good photochemical PSII efficiency as well as a higher amount of constitutive antioxidant molecules, that, however, are not sufficient to contrast the negative effects of B.

AB Vermiculite, the hydrated micaceous mineral consisting of magnesium and ferro-magnesium aluminium silicates, was evaluated as a carrier material for the preparation of bacterial inoculants. Different grades of raw and exfoliated vermiculite were initially analyzed for their physical, chemical and biological characteristics and based on the results obtained, exfoliated grade V vermiculite was selected to be used as the carrier material. The material was amended with charcoal and humic: acid at 5 and 10% levels, and with lignite at 10 and 20% levels based on their organic carbon content. Evaluation of the shelf life of bacterial inoculants was conducted with two nitrogen fixing strains viz., Rhizobium COG 15 and Azospirillum lipoferum AZ 204 and a phosphobacterium strain PB 1 (Bacillus megaterium var. phosphaticum). All the three inoculants recorded more than 10(7) cells/g dry weight upto 245 days after inoculation (DAI). Maximum population of phosphobacterium PB 1 was observed in 10% humic acid amended vermiculite carrier on 210 DAI (20.66 x 10(14) cfu/g dry weight) followed by 20% lignite amended vermiculite inoculant (41.09 x 10(12) cfu/g dry weight). Population of Rhizobium COG 15 was maximum on 175 DAI in 5% humic acid amended vermiculite (28.98 x 10(13) cfu/g dry weight) followed by 20% lignite amended vermiculite carrier (27.21 x 10(13) cfu/g dry weight). In case of Azospirillum AZ 204, lignite amended treatment recorded the maximum population at both 10 and 20% levels (1.33 x 10(10) cfu and 7.67 x 10(9) cfu/g dry weight, respectively) at 245 DAL pH of the carrier did not vary significantly, whereas there was considerable moisture loss during the storage period. The results clearly indicated longer shelf life of bacterial inoculants in vermiculite for about eight months (>10(8) viable cells/g dry weight) and even better survival, when added with suitable amendments, indicating the more suitability of vermiculite as a carrier for bacterial inoculant production.

AB Sequence stratigraphy seeks to predict the depositional architecture of sediments based on the principle that their superposition and lateral arrangement are largely determined by the rate at which accommodation is made below depositional base level relative to the supply rate of sediments. Depositional base level is generally correlated with sea level which in paralic peat/coal deposits controls the position of the groundwater table above which oxidation, ablation and erosion would occur.
   The current Late Quaternary sequence is used to discuss some of the constraints on coal formation that stem from the interaction of short- and long-period modulations on sequence-forming eustatic cycles. The results show that the mid-transgressive systems tract is unlikely to produce significant coal deposits, which is supported by a survey of the relevant literature from eight different countries. It reveals a bimodal distribution of coal deposits with the strongest mode being situated in the early transgressive systems tract, while a broader, secondary mode occurs in the early and mid-highstand position. This concentration contrasts with the complete absence of any significant coal deposits in the early and mid-lowstand systems tract, and only a low occupancy of the late highstand systems tracts. The reasons for this distribution are briefly discussed, and attention is drawn to the possible over-stating of the coal-forming potential of the late lowstand systems tract.
   Following a brief discussion of the sequence-stratigraphic interpretation of coal measures, emphasis is put on the application of sequence stratigraphy to the study of coal seams and their composition at various levels of petrographic detail. While in low-rank coals, botanical affinities contribute much to the lithotype-based analysis, a genetic assessment of bituminous coal seams relies primarily on physical and chemical palaeo-environmental signatures. Simple properties, Such as maximum coal thickness, low detrital mineral content and maximum preservation of vitrinite, particularly of telovitrinite, define a good balance between the former rates of accommodation versus peat accumulation. Iso-metamorphic variations in telovitrinite reflectance and its dispersion measured by the coefficient of variation have also contributed to the palaeo-environmental interpretation.
   This paper confirms the identification within coal seams of most of the sequence-stratigraphically significant surfaces, e.g. sequence and parasequence boundaries, transgressive, flooding, and maximum flooding surfaces. It also gives examples of some new ones, referred to as accommodation reversal, non-marine flooding, give-up transgressive, terrestrialisation, and paludification surfaces. Some of these are specific to coal measures, but the give-up transgressive and accommodation reversal surfaces may have wider significance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is important that climate models can accurately simulate the terrestrial carbon cycle in the Arctic due to the large and potentially labile carbon stocks found in permafrost-affected environments, which can lead to a positive climate feedback, along with the possibility of future carbon sinks from northward expansion of vegetation under climate warming. Here we evaluate the simulation of tundra carbon stocks and fluxes in three land surface schemes that each form part of major Earth system models (JSBACH, Germany; JULES, UK; ORCHIDEE, France). We use a site-level approach in which comprehensive, high-frequency datasets allow us to disentangle the importance of different processes. The models have improved physical permafrost processes and there is a reasonable correspondence between the simulated and measured physical variables, including soil temperature, soil moisture and snow.
   We show that if the models simulate the correct leaf area index (LAI), the standard C3 photosynthesis schemes produce the correct order of magnitude of carbon fluxes. Therefore, simulating the correct LAI is one of the first priorities. LAI depends quite strongly on climatic variables alone, as we see by the fact that the dynamic vegetation model can simulate most of the differences in LAI between sites, based almost entirely on climate inputs. However, we also identify an influence from nutrient limitation as the LAI becomes too large at some of the more nutrient-limited sites. We conclude that including moss as well as vascular plants is of primary importance to the carbon budget, as moss contributes a large fraction to the seasonal CO2 flux in nutrient-limited conditions. Moss photosynthetic activity can be strongly influenced by the moisture content of moss, and the carbon uptake can be significantly different from vascular plants with a similar LAI.
   The soil carbon stocks depend strongly on the rate of input of carbon from the vegetation to the soil, and our analysis suggests that an improved simulation of photosynthesis would also lead to an improved simulation of soil carbon stocks. However, the stocks are also influenced by soil carbon burial (e.g. through cryoturbation) and the rate of heterotrophic respiration, which depends on the soil physical state. More detailed below-ground measurements are needed to fully evaluate biological and physical soil processes. Furthermore, even if these processes are well modelled, the soil carbon profiles cannot resemble peat layers as peat accumulation processes are not represented in the models.
   Thus, we identify three priority areas for model development: (1) dynamic vegetation including (a) climate and (b) nutrient limitation effects; (2) adding moss as a plant functional type; and an (3) improved vertical profile of soil carbon including peat processes.

AB Effective modern production of young Pelargonium X hortorum L.H. Bailey plants requires a reliable rooting response of shoot tip cuttings from stock plants. This study was conducted to explore the N demand and the influence of the form and dosage of N on the growth of stock plants in aerated nutrient solutions (A, Q and thin-layer peat substrates (B). The effects of three N dosages at 1, 7, and 13 mmol N l(-1) (A) or 0.5, 1.5, and 4.0 g N m(-2) week(-1) (B) were examined. Futhermore, at uniform dosages of 7 mmol N l(-1), graduated substitutions of NO3- by NH4+ were investigated using six NH4+:NO3- ratios of 0: 100, 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, and 100:0 (C). The quality, survival and rooting capacity of cuttings were determined in response to NH4+ or NO3- alone (A), NH4+ and NO3- fertigation (B), or the NH4+:NO3- ratio (C). Natural irradiation and different shading regimes during Spring and Summer cultivation ensured adequate light [photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) = 314 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)], while limiting light during Autumn (PPFD = 135 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) interfered with the N treatments. The N status, survival rate, and rooting of cuttings were examined in samples of cuttings provided by propagators worldwide. In solution-culture, NH4+:NO3- ratios of 20:80 and 40:60 provided optimised growth and quality of cuttings at 7 mmol N, regardless of light level. Compared with NO3- -only nutrient solutions, these ratios enhanced the branching of stock plant roots, NO3- absorption in shoot tissues, overall cutting yield, and adventitious root formation in cuttings. Although NH4+:NO3- ratios above 60:40 impaired fresh weight and the number of tip cuttings per plant, the rooting capacity of such cuttings was promoted further, as long as adequate light was available. We hypothesise that the ratio of N form shifts hormone levels and carbon fluxes which, in turn, influence the root and shoot morphology of stock plants, as well as the rooting of cuttings. Cultivation in peat substrate resulted in the highest yields and best rooting of cuttings at weekly N doses of 1.5 g N m-2. The high dose of N (4 g) did not enhance yield, but rather reduced the rooting of cuttings at adequate light levels. This dose also resulted in increased NO3--N and salt accumulation in the peat. Moreover, while reduced rooting at a low N dose (i.e., 0.5 g) indicated N limitation, the impaired rooting seen at a high N dose may have been induced by osmotic stress to the stock plants.

AB Carbon dioxide fluxes between ecosystems of the Earth are presented. It was shown that intensifying its absorption of terrestrial ecosystems by 3.2% would prove sufficient to neutralize carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production. It was shown that Polish forests absorb 84.6 million tons of CO2/year, that is 26% of emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production, while agricultural crops absorb 103 million tons of CO2/year. Total carbon dioxide sequestration by forests and agricultural crops amounts to 187.5 million tons of CO2/year, which is tantamount to 59% of emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. Forestation of marginal soils would further increase carbon dioxide absorption in Poland by 20.6 million tons of CO2/year. Moreover, if plants were sown in order to produce green manure - instead of leaving soil fallow - sequestration could still be boosted by another 6.2 million tons of CO2/year.

AB This paper examines the implications of imposing a climate tax on food consumption in Sweden combined with refunding of the tax revenues to farmers for selected agricultural activities enhancing ecosystem services: restoration of drained peatland (carbon sequestration), maintenance of grassland (biodiversity), and construction of wetlands (nutrient regulation). A partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector is used to assess economic and environmental effects. The results show that the introduction of a climate tax corresponding to the existing Swedish CO2 tax of 115 euros per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent reduces total emissions from food consumption by 4.4% without any refunding of tax revenues. Refunding with payments for all ecosystems enhances the carbon sink by an amount equivalent to 57% of CO2e emissions from food consumption, and results in net benefits in the tax refund system for the agricultural sector as a whole, but is regressive where farmers in regions with relatively high incomes receive proportionally much of the net benefits.

AB We are investigating the late Holocene rise in CO2 by performing four experiments with the climate-carbon-cycle model CLIMBER2-LPJ. Apart from the deep sea sediments, important carbon cycle processes considered are carbon uptake or release by the vegetation, carbon uptake by peatlands, and CO2 release due to shallow water sedimentation of CaCO3. Ice core data of atmospheric CO2 between 8 ka BP and preindustrial climate can only be reproduced if CO2 outgassing due to shallow water sedimentation of CaCO3 is considered. In this case the model displays an increase of nearly 20 ppmv CO2 between 8 ka BP and present day. Model configurations that do not contain this forcing show a slight decrease in atmospheric CO2. We can therefore explain the late Holocene rise in CO2 by invoking natural forcing factors only, and anthropogenic forcing is not required to understand preindustrial CO2 dynamics.

DE Carbon capture and sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Climate

ID UNCERTAINTIES; PERCEPTIONS
AB Although a potentially useful climate change mitigation tool, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) efforts in the United States remain mired in demonstration and development. Prior studies suggest numerous reasons for this stagnation. This article empirically assesses those claims. Using an anonymous opinion survey completed by 229 CCS experts, we identified four primary barriers to CCS commercialization: (1) cost and cost recovery, (2) lack of a price signal or financial incentive, (3) long-term liability risks, and (4) lack of a comprehensive regulatory regime. These results give empirical weight to previous studies suggesting that CCS cost (and cost recovery) and liability risks are primary barriers to the technology. However, the need for comprehensive rather than piecemeal CCS regulation represents an emerging concern not previously singled out in the literature. Our results clearly show that the CCS community sees fragmented regulation as one of the most significant barriers to CCS deployment. Specifically, industry is united in its preference for a federal regulatory floor that is subject to state-level administration and sensitive to local conditions. Likewise, CCS experts share broad confidence in the technology's readiness, despite continued calls for commercial-scale demonstration projects before CCS is widely deployed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Energy dispersive x-ray microanalyses and total diatom counts of sediments from the remote Loch Hellisdale on South Uist reveal a pattern of soil changes, erosion and acidification that matches sequences identified elsewhere in upland Britain. The changes are the results of the interactions of climatic fluctuations, soil maturation, vegetation changes, peat spread and soil acidification and human impacts in the catchment. Chemical changes in the loch's sediments also appear to reflect biological activity and decay processes within the loch. The abundances in the core of the infrequently studied elements Vanadium and Titanium appear to be indicative of physical erosion of sediments or soils in the catchment.

AB Water extracts from soils of the Barents Sea coast (the Khaipudyr Bay) were analyzed for the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen by the method of high-temperature catalytic oxidation with non-dispersive IR registration; the contents of low-molecular-weight acids, carbohydrates, and alcohols were determined by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry. The mass fraction of inorganic carbon (HCO3-) was measured potentiometrically, and the content of inorganic nitrogen (N-NO3-, N-NH4+) was determined by photometry. In marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols (Arenic or Loamic, Epiprotosalic)), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 0.1-0.8, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.01-0.05 g/kg, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.06 omega(C-org)(H2O) + 0.01, and (C/N)(H2O) = 7-21. The content of individual components does not exceed 20 mg/kg, including carbohydrates (50-90%), acids (10-50%), and alcohols (<3%). In peat horizons of tundra soils (Cryic Histosols and Histic Cryosols), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 4-10, omega(N-org)(H2O) similar to and (C/N)(H2O) = 25-56. Litter and peat horizons accumulate both individual humus components and total dissolved organic carbon. The total weight of the identified substances is 200300 mg/kg, 80-90% of them are carbohydrates, 10-20% are acids, and 0-9% are alcohols. The accumulation of (C-org)(H2O) and (N-NH4+)(H2O) takes place above the permafrost table. It is argued that the ratios of organic forms of carbon and nitrogen in soil water extracts and the content of low-molecular weight organic compounds in soils can be used as indicators of pedogenic processes in the Far North.

AB Recent revision of the eastern boundary of the last glaciation of Eurasia opened new perspectives in the search of the paleopedological records in the north of Eastern Europe and Western Siberia. We studied paleosol-sedimentary sequences in the Upper Volga and Middle Ob basins as a regional paleoecological record for the Late Pleistocene thermochrons.
   Two key sections Cheremoshnik and Belaya Gora containing MIS3 and MIS5 paleosol units and additional section Koskovo 2 with polycyclic MIS3 paleosol were investigated. Their timescale are based on C14 and U/Th datings as well as on stratigraphic and paleobotanical correlations. Macro-, meso- and micromorphological observations together with fossil insects and plant macrofossil were used as paleoenvironment proxy. MIS3 paleosols show abundant redoximorphic and cryogenic features that allow interpreting them as gleyic Cryosols. Sub-fossil insects and plant macrofossil reflect the cold climate conditions. Three incipient Ah horizons in Koskovo 2 pedocomplex point to multiple phases of pedogenesis, correlative to the MIS3 paleosol levels in different sections of the Eurasian loess belt and to the major interstadials of the Middle Pleniglacial of the NW Europe MISS paleosols are also characterized by gleyzation and peat accumulation, in this case we suppose geomorphological control on hydromorphic pedogenesis; however paleosol in Belaya Gora has clear signs of polygenesis including the phase of clay illuviation. Insect and plant remains from the lower paleosol level of the Belaya Gora section show the transition from cold (terminal phase of MIS6) to warm first, and then to a moderately cold climate (within MIS5). The obtained results contribute to understanding of soil and landscape zonality in the largest plains of Eurasia mostly during the warm phases of Late Pleistocene. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB The response of landscape biotic components of the western slope of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains (Bikin River middle flow) to the Middle-Late Holocene climate changes is discussed. The paleoreconstruction object was the Krasny Yar mari, which developed under the control of multidirectional short-term climatic changes. The last millennium was marked by particularly rapid and frequent changes in the local landscapes. The closely spaced orographic barrier strongly affected the development of biotic components and changes in the swamp hydrological regime. The moisture dynamics within the river catchment considerably controlled the development and change of the peat-forming plants. Several stages of the mari development were reconstructed; each began from the accumulation of eutrophic peat. It was followed by the transitional eutrophic-mesotrophic stage, with a higher role of atmospheric supply. The larch forests appeared in this part of the valley within the Atlantic-Subboreal cooling period. Korean pine developed in the forest vegetation in the low mountain relief at the beginning of the Subboreal and became one of the leading trees similar to 2.6-2.3 ka BP. The lower role of the Korean pine and birch forest expansion in the first half of the Subatlantic could be related to the fires. The broadleaf-Korean pine forests became widespread in the Medieval Warm Period. Local swamp landscapes changed dramatically in the Little Ice Age, while the slope vegetation was not subject to any major changes. The landscapes were also affected by the fires, which became more frequent. The derivative communities with birch appeared on the mari. Moreover, this part of the valley was occasionally subject to heavy flooding.

AB Mangroves receive increasing quantities of nutrients as a result of coastal development, which could lead to significant changes in carbon sequestration and soil subsidence. We hypothesised that mangrove-produced tannins induce a nitrogen (N) limitation on microbial decomposition even when plant growth is limited by phosphorus (P). As a result, increased N influx would lead to a net loss of sequestered carbon negating the ability to compensate for sea level rise in P-limited mangroves. To examine this, we quantified the short- and long-term effects of N and P enrichment on microbial biomass and decomposition-related enzyme activities in a Rhizophora mangle-dominated mangrove, which had been subjected to fertilisation treatments for a period of fifteen years. We compared microbial biomass, elemental stoichiometry and potential enzyme activity in dwarf and fringe-type R. mangle-dominated sites, where primary production is limited by P or N depending on the proximity to open water. Even in P-limited mangroves, microbial activity was N-limited as indicated by stoichiometry and an increase in enzymic activity upon N amendment. Nevertheless, microbial biomass increased upon field additions of P, indicating that the carbon supply played even a larger role. Furthermore, we found that P amendment suppressed phenol oxidase activity, while N amendment did not. The possible differential nutrient limitations of microbial decomposers versus primary producers implies that the direction of the effect of eutrophication on carbon sequestration is nutrient-specific. In addition, this study shows that phenol oxidase activities in this system decrease through P, possibly strengthening the enzymic latch effect of mangrove tannins. Furthermore, it is argued that the often used division between N-harvesting, P-harvesting, and carbon-harvesting exoenzymes needs to be reconsidered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the Miocene numerous sedimentary basins formed on the territory of Bulgaria as a result of the extensional tectonic settings related to the post-orogenic development of the late Alpine orogen. In this study, we review the petrographic composition and biomarker assemblage of two adjacent basins in western Bulgaria, i.e. Beli Breg and Staniantsi basins. Both contain lignite formed during late Miocene (c. 6 Ma). Despite similar tectonic settings and depositional environments, the lignite seams possess different petrographic and organic geochemical characteristics, reflecting differences in the peat forming palaeo-communities and fades variations. The peat-forming vegetation in Bell Breg Basin was dominated by decay resistant coniferous plants, as indicated by abundant fossil wood remains, very good tissue preservation and a biomarker assemblage dominated by diterpenoids. In contrast, Staniantsi lignite is poor in fossil wood and contains a significant amount of triterpenoid biomarkers, suggesting the predominance of angiosperm plants in the swamp.
   The results of the biomarker analyses are consistent with palaeobotanical and palynological data from the literature. The lignite seams in both basins formed under frequently changing Eh conditions, as indicated by the severe degradation of the non-gymnosperm tissues, the low gelification index values and the variations in pristane/phytane ratio, probably as a result of seasonal drying of the swamps and changes of the ground water table. Hopanoid contents in Bell Breg lignite are very low and are consistent with the abundance of decay-resistant vegetation. In contrast, bacterial activity was obviously higher in the Staniantsi swamp, however, resulting only in slightly enhanced gelification of plant tissues. The geochemical data suggest that the diagenetic changes of the organic matter were mainly governed by thermal degradation, rather than bacterial activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In arid zones, the use of compost for plant production in forest nurseries is hindered by a lack of water. The main objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the physical stability of composts produced from shredded branches of Acacia cyanophylla and A. cyclops subjected to a repeated drying and wetting cycles, similar to those used at the operational scale in nurseries in arid regions and to compare these composts with a standard peat-vermiculite (PV) substrate; (2) to identify the relevant substrate physical variables that correlate with seedling growth. Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) was cultivated during a production cycle of 27 weeks in a completely randomized block experiment. Substrate physical variables were measured at the beginning, middle and end of the experiment. Seedling growth variables were evaluated over the course of the production cycle, while gas exchange and water-relation variables were measured during a wetting and drying cycle at the end of the experiment. All three substrates produced vigorous seedlings with well-developed root systems that colonized the entire root plug. The growth of seedlings produced in the PV substrate was better than those grown in the compost-based substrates. No significant differences in gas exchange capacities and water relation variables were observed among the three substrates at the end of experiment with the exception of net photosynthesis, which was higher for the PV substrate at high substrate matric potential. Excessive drainage was negatively correlated with growth variables while water availability in the early growth phase and air porosity towards the end of experiment were positively correlated. Performance of the two composts could be increased by improving their initial structure and stability and by adjusting the irrigation regime.

AB Routine observations made at the Franklin Bluffs research station (Alaska) and four meteorological stations located in northern and central Siberia were used to perform a series of experiments with a one-dimensional model of heat and moisture transfer in the soil-vegetation-snow system. The model is shown to be capable of reproducing qualitative and quantitative features of the thermal conditions in permafrost soil. The accuracy of simulated surface temperatures is estimated. The ground temperature and the depth of seasonal thaw are shown to be highly sensitive to processes that affect snow densification. The thickness of the active layer is shown to be highly sensitive to variations in the moss-lichen-peat cover depth, which is relatively small in nature.

AB The relevance of the research is caused by the need to determine the conditions of rare earth elements (REEs) accumulation in coals, to design the model of formation and identification of criteria for predicting rare metal mineralization in coal deposits.
   The aim of the research is to study and evaluate the content, the patterns of distribution and REEs concentration conditions in coals from different deposits and basins of North Asia.
   Research methods: testing coal seams, fields and basins, formed in various geological and geochemical environments; analytical studies by INAA, ICP-MS; processing the results by mathematical statistics methods.
   Results. Coals of North Asia are characterized by contents of REEs close to the coal Clark. Higher levels of the REEs content are typical for coals of northern China, Hurengol and Hotgor coalfields in eastern Mongolia and Kurai coalfield in southern Siberia. The individual coal seams or areas of ones enriched by REEs are set within certain basins at peri-background average content of REEs. Mechanism of REEs concentration in coal seams is caused by the peculiarities of nutrition composition of ancient peat accumulation basin with almost synchronously forming volcanism and hydrogeochemistry features of the region. Epigenetic processes lead to redistribution of REEs without impacting significantly their content in fields and coal seams. Formation of anomalies and complex rare metal ores is caused by the presence of specialized arrays of rocks rich in REEs among the underlying sediments or, more often, by almost synchronously forming volcanic alkali or acid compositions together with coal accumulation. Convertion of paleo-ashes in aggressive environment conditions of peat fields results in removal and redeposition of REEs near tonsteins with formation of contrasting anomalies. In some cases, these complex anomalies may be of industrial interest.

AB BACKGROUND: In this study, the biofiltration of air streams laden with monochlorobenzene (MCB) vapours was investigated using a trickling biofilter operated co-currently. The device was filled with ceramic material and inoculated with an acclimated microbial culture. A neutralization process was carried out in a separate unit using crushed oyster shells. Long-term biofilter performance was evaluated over a 10-month period of continuous experiments under different influent pollutant concentrations from 0.10 to 1.75 g m-3, sequentially stepped up through three different apparent air residence times of 60, 30, and 15 s. RESULTS: Pollutant removal was shown to be complete at influent concentrations up to 1.25, 0.75 and 0.20 g m-3, and apparent air residence times of 60, 30, and 15 s, respectively. The maximum elimination capacity was found to be 95.0 g mPM-3 h-1 for an influent concentration of 1.0 g m-3 and an apparent air residence time of 30 s, corresponding to a loading rate of 120.0 g mPM-3 h-1. Monochlorobenzene and biomass concentration profiles along the biofilter evidenced the dependence of microbial concentration distribution on the pollutant loading rate and the existence of a linear relationship between biomass concentration and specific pollutant removal rate, regardless of the operating conditions applied. A macrokinetic analysis shows that the MCB removal rate is zeroth order for low values of MCB concentration. A critical value of MCB concentration exists at all superficial air velocity at which the biomass growth is inhibited. A simple kinetic model is developed which is able to describe the inhibition behaviour under any operating conditions. CONCLUSION: The experimental results indicated that the system was effective and stable under various working conditions and over a long operating period, provided that the loading conditions corresponding to substrate inhibition of microbial growth are not exceeded.

AB One of the biggest challenges in predicting ecohydrologic fluxes is scaling from easily measured variables to more difficult, often emergent patterns and processes. This is especially true in spatially heterogeneous systems such as black spruce (Picea mariana)-dominated boreal forests containing excessive and low soil moisture conditions. Traditional hypotheses suggest that transpiration is controlled by hydraulic responses to vapor pressure deficit (D) and soil moisture; however, these may potentially be misinformed because of omission of soil drainage gradients. Thus, we predict that 1) spatial heterogeneity in tree transpiration along a soil drainage gradient is positively correlated with D, 2) sap flux (J(S)) and leaf-level transpiration (E-L) are higher and whole-tree transpiration (E-C) lower in the poorly drained than well-drained stands, and 3) spatial heterogeneity of E-C is regulated primarily by tree-related covariates such as sapwood and leaf area and secondarily by environmental covariates including peat and moss depth. With the use of 122 black spruce sap flux measurements, the range of autocorrelation (inverse of spatial variation) decreased from 20m at low D (<0.7kPa) to 2m at midday D values (>0.9kPa). J(S) and E-L were significantly greater and E-C less in poorly drained than well-drained stands; controlled primarily by tree-related covariates (sapwood and leaf area) representing long-term growth conditions and secondarily by soil moisture and spatially sampled D reflecting shorter-term environmental variation. Quantification of spatial heterogeneity informs predictive models of the distance at which homogeneity can no longer be assumed and will improve mechanistic predictions of transpiration at multiple spatial scales.

AB This study is mainly concerned with sulfur isotope (delta S-34) values of inorganic sulfur species associated with the North Thrace Basin's coals (Saray and Pinarhisar coalfields). Sulfur isotope analyses were performed on pyritic sulfur, native sulfur, sulfate sulfur (rozenite) and the precipitated sulfate (P-BaSO4) (leached sulfate from the coal). The delta S-34 values of pyritic sulfur, rozenite, native sulfur and P-BaSO4 samples in Saray coals ranging from -6.9 parts per thousand to -37.3 parts per thousand are comparable to the delta S-34 values of Pinarhisar coals which change from -1.1 parts per thousand to - 59.3 parts per thousand. A wide range of strong negative delta S-34 values in both coalfields, particularly in Pinarhisar site, indicate that bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) and subsequent pyrite formation were the key processes in the peat depositional environments. As in the delta S-34 values of both coalfield sites, comparable Sr/Ba and Th/U ratios and pyrite forms (cleat filling and partly massive) of the coals imply that besides marine sulfate hydrothermal solutions, originated from volcanism being active during peat accumulation in the basin, also contributed to the sulfur pools in the coal depositional environments.
   Overall, the delta S-34 values of inorganic sulfur species, and the largest sulfur isotope fractionation between delta S-34 (P-BaSO4) and the delta S-34(pyrite), obtained for the first time for the Thrace Coal Basin, suggest that bacterial reduction of sulfate, possibly marine and hydrothermally derived, and subsequent pyrite formation and its fast burial may have been contributed to sulfur budget in the basin.

   Europe
ID POLLEN RECORD; STRATIGRAPHY; PALYNOLOGY
AB Analysis of numerous pollen diagrams from north and central Germany and from the adjacent lowlands of The Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Belarus have facilitated a regional comparison of the vegetation and climatic evolution from the beginning of the Early Weichselian glaciation to the Weichselian pleniglacial. Data from geological studies and analysis of fossil beetles and plant macroremains have been used to supplement the palaeoclimatic reconstruction.
   Up to the end of the Oerel Interstadial the palaeoclimate was characterised by increasing of Quaternary Science continentality. The winter temperatures in particular tended to fall continuously during the stadials and the interstadials of the Early Weichselian and early Pleniglacial. In the Brorup and Odderade Interstadials summer temperatures where sufficiently high to enable boreal forests to grow, whereas in the Oerel Interstadials summer temperatures were such that tree growth was inhibited. It is probable that falling sea-level and the consequent extension northwards of the North Sea coast were the main causes of increasing continentality.
   In the latter part of the Pleniglacial, peat accumulation frequently took place and humic silts were deposited under lacustrine conditions. Correlation between various sites is extraordinarily difficult. Pollen diagrams from the so-called interstadials of the Glinde, Moershoofd Complex, Hengelo and Denekamp are similar to those of the known Early Weichselian stadials. It is proposed therefore that these interstadials should be called intervals, and that the term interstadial be reserved for climatic variations that result in distinctive pollen assemblages and which, in turn, reflect distinctive vegetation dynamics. Interstadials should be capable of being characterised on a biostratigraphical basis and it should be possible to establish correlations over considerable distances. According to this definition, the first three warm oscillations of the Weichselian glaciation in the central European lowlands are the Brorup, Odderade and Oerel Interstadials. All other pleniglacial peat layers should be assigned the rank of interval. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The sequestration of nutrients from surface waters by aquatic macrophytes and sediments provides an important service to both natural and constructed wetlands. While emergent species take up nutrients from the sediment, submerged and floating macrophytes filter nutrients directly from the surface water, which may be more efficient in constructed wetlands. It remains unclear, however, whether their efficiency is sufficient for wastewater purification and how plant species and nutrient loading affects nutrient distribution over plants, water and sediment. We therefore determined nutrient removal efficiencies of different vegetation (Azolla filiculoides, Ceratophyllum demersum and Myrio-phyllum spicatum) and sediment types (clay, peaty clay and peat) at three nutrient input rates, in a full factorial, outdoor mesocosm experiment. At low loading (0.43 mg Pm(-2)d(-1)), plant uptake was the main pathway (100 %) for phosphorus (P) removal, while sediments showed a net P release. A. filiculoides and M. spicatum showed the highest biomass production and could be harvested regularly for nutrient recycling, whereas C. demersum was outcompeted by spontaneously developing macrophytes and algae. Higher nutrient loading only stimulated A. filiculoides growth. At higher rates (>= 21.4 mg Pm(-2)d(-1)), 50-90% of added P ended up in sediments, with peat sediments becoming more easily saturated. For nitrogen (N), 45-90% was either taken up by the sediment or lost to the atmosphere at loadings >= 62 mgN m(-2) d(-1). This shows that aquatic macrophytes can indeed function as an efficient nutrient filter but only for low loading rates (polishing) and not for high rates (purification). The outcome of this controlled study not only contributes to our understanding of nutrient dynamics in constructed wetlands but also shows the differential effects of wetland sediment types and plant species. Furthermore, the acquired knowledge may benefit the application of macrophyte harvesting to remove and recycle nutrients from both constructed wetlands and nutrient-loaded natural wetlands.

AB Simulation models are widely used to assess the impacts of management and environmental variables on soil organic matter dynamics, to address questions on ecosystem sustainability and carbon cycling under global change. We tested the Century ecosystem model for two long-term experiments in north-eastern Italy: one (SF) comparing nutrient management treatments in small confined plots containing widely contrasting soil types (i.e., sandy, clay and peat) and the other (CR) involving a field study with crop rotation, nutrient, and management intensity variables. The organic matter changes in the SF experiment, showed a strong, linear relationship with C inputs from crop residues and added manures in the sand and clay soils, which was closely mimicked by the model. There was a net loss of soil C for all treatments in the peat soil, but the rate and overall magnitude of C losses were accurately simulated by the model, which suggested that treatment effects on soil C inputs was the major determinant of SOC dynamics in all three soils. In the CR experiment the model reasonably simulated the large initial decline (averaging about 30% of initial levels) in SOC observed in all treatments, as well as mean treatment effects over the course of the experiment. The model predicted a general pattern of higher SOC in the high management intensity, high fertility treatment combinations and lower SOC in the low management intensity, low fertility treatments; however, observed soil C did not show a clear pattern related to the treatments. Simulated soil C contents were linearly related to C input levels in the different treatments while there was no significant relationship between measured soil C and C inputs based on observed data.

TI Riparian Lowlands in Clay Till Landscapes Part II: Nitrogen Reduction

AB Riparian lowlands are known to control catchment nitrogen (N) balances. This study examined the role of agricultural tile drainage systems, often present in clay till landscapes, on the transport, transformation, and mass balance of N species in four riparian peat lowland transects receiving agricultural tile drainage water. Monitoring of N speciation of drain, stream, and groundwater, combined with a previously established water balance, enabled the determination of N mass balances for different flow paths including groundwater, subsurface drain water, and overland flow for each piezometer transect. The type of overland flow largely affected nitrate-N (NO3-N) removal efficiency, as determined by the total N output from a transect relative to the NO3-N loading (%). Infiltration and subsurface flow followed by exfiltration (short return flow) allowed an efficient removal of NO3-N (71-94%), while direct overland flow strongly lowered NO3-N removal (25%) in one transect. The hydraulic loading rate versus the lowland infiltration capacity determined the transport pathways and thus the resulting NO3-N removal efficiency. For all transects there was a net export of organic N and/or ammonium, associated with in situ N release from peat decomposition, through overland flow and groundwater discharge. These exports partly counterbalanced NO3-N removal and significantly reduced the overall total N removal for the riparian lowlands. However, the N removal efficiencies remained positive (1-56%). The study indicates that N budgets for riparian lowlands need to account for overland flow as a transport pathway for N.
   Key Points
   Nitrate (NO3-) removal in riparian lowlands (RLs) depends on the infiltration of NO3- into organic riparian lowland sediments. Direct overland flow, bypassing the RL soil and sediment, decreases nitrate removal. RLs may be sinks or sources of nitrogen (N) depending on the balance between removal of nitrate and release of ammonium and organic N.

AB The Fuxin Basin is one of the major coal-bearing basins in northeastern China with the coal seams mainly preserved in the Lower Cretaceous Fuxin Formation. The sequence stratigraphy, palaeogeography, basin evolution, and coal accumulation of the lacustrine coal-bearing sequences in the Fuxin Formation were analysed based on borehole cores, well logs, and outcrop sections. Fifteen distinct lithofacies types were recognized with lithologies ranging from conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones to coals. Lithofacies are arranged into five facies associations representing alluvial fan, braided fluvial, meandering fluvial, fan delta, and lacustrine depositional systems. These facies associations collectively revealed a continental faulted basin setting. Based on the regional unconformities, basal scour surfaces of the incised valley fills sandstones, paleosols, or seat earths of coal seam on interfluves, and surfaces that mark abrupt depositional facies shifts, the Fuxin Formation was subdivided in two third-order sequences. Palaeogeographic maps of each sequence have been reconstructed based on the contours of lithological parameters. The palaeogeographic units include alluvial fan, alluvial plain, channel (braided and meandering fluvial), fan delta, and lake. Preferred coal-forming environments were mainly developed in the fan delta plain and fluvial back-swamp. Compared with Sequence 1, the activity of basin-margin faults and basement subsidence of the Sequence 2 gradually decreased, resulting in the lower rate of potential accommodation and less favourable conditions for peat accumulation. This background provided a basic understanding for the lacustrine basin evolution and coal accumulation. A six-phase evolution model was proposed, which includes lowstand systems tract, early transgressive systems tract, late transgressive systems tract, early highstand systems tract, late highstand systems tract, and falling stage systems tract. The early and late TST of Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 were relatively beneficial stages for peat accumulation and coal development in the Fuxin Basin.

AB This study investigates the post-glacial development of four small river-lake systems in the Weichselian belt of northern central Europe. The valleys investigated are part of an immature drainage system characterized by frequent and abrupt changes in flow direction and the presence of numerous stagnant-ice depressions in the valley course. The depressions contain thick sedimentary sequences which provide excellent archives for the reconstruction of the post-glacial valley development. Study results indicate that the valleys reuse segments of former subglacial meltwater channels. During the Late Pleniglacial these channels carried meltwater streams. Stagnant-ice melting occurred in stages from the Oldest Dryas to the early Holocene and was often followed by the formation of lakes in the valley course. Flow reversals occurred during the Late-glacial-Holocene transition and were in response to general base-level lowering caused by stagnant-ice melting, headwater erosion and lake overspills. Lacustrine deposition typically started during the early Late-glacial comprising mainly silicate gyttjas, whereas organic gyttjas and peats accumulated during the Allerod. The Younger Dryas is associated with a marked increase in fluvial and aeolian sedimentation, and lake-level high stands. This was followed by early Holocene lake-level low stands and a subsequent stabilization phase with decreasing silicate input and increasing organic lacustrine deposition. In general, dramatic changes in Late Pleniglacial to early Holocene sedimentation suggest that small-scale catastrophic events played a more important role in triggering geomorphic changes then previously recognized. Infilling continued until peat accumulation and terrestrialization of lake basins became widespread during the mid- to late Holocene. Beginning in the late Holocene anthropogenic influences become important mainly involving an increase in sediment supply due to forest clearing and land use, followed by mill stowage, river course correction and anthropogenic lake-level manipulations.

TI Permafrost-derived dissolved organic matter composition varies across

SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS

DT Article
DE dissolved organic matter composition; permafrost; FT-ICR MS
AB Organic matter, upon dissolution into the aqueous state as dissolved organic matter (DOM), can undergo mineralization by microbes. There has been increasing effort to characterize DOM released from thawing permafrost because it may perpetuate a permafrost carbon feedback. Permafrost-derived DOM often has a composition that can be highly susceptible to mineralization by microbes, but most studies to date that characterize permafrost-derived DOM have been limited to select regions, and tend to focus on a single type of permafrost (sometimes unspecified) that reflects a particular deposit type. Importantly, diversity in the nature of the deposit, formation of permafrost, and thaw modification processes leads to spatial and stratigraphic variability in its properties, but our understanding of variation in the composition of DOM derived from differing permafrost types (end-members) is poor. Here, we used ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize DOM composition derived from a series of permafrost end-member types that are commonly found within the thaw-vulnerable western Canadian Arctic, including: tills (glacially deposited), diamicton (thawed and remobilized material of mixed origin), lacustrine (lake basin sediments into which permafrost has aggraded), peat (partially decomposed organic material), and Yedoma (syngenetic silty loess) deposits. We identified marked variation in DOM composition among permafrost end-member types. Tills were compositionally dissimilar to all other permafrost end-members. Compounds unique to Yedoma were predominantly aliphatic, while compounds unique to peat, lacustrine, and diamicton spanned saturation and oxygenation gradients. All permafrost leachates were generally higher in aliphatics, lower in aromatics, and less oxygenated than active layer leachates. Compositional differences appear to reflect variation in permafrost parent materials, and particularly strong effects from past modification processes while in the unfrozen or thawed state. Constraining DOM composition and assessing its stratigraphic variability will become more pressing as the spatial and stratigraphic extent of thaw increases with future warming.

AB Land use patterns are changing and the environment has become more vulnerable in an agro-pastoral ecotone in Inner Mongolia. Modeling studies can be done through studying the relationships between the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and the influencing factors in differing land uses such as cropland, forest and grassland. Such studies can provide the basis for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and using land resources efficiently. Therefore, the relationships between the SOCD of surface soils and the influencing factors, such as soil type, slope and elevation, were selected for a study in differing land uses of Duolun County, Inner Mongolia. The results showed that: (1) The variation in SOCD among the soil types followed the same order in the three land uses: chernozems > meadow soils > bog soils > castanozems > gray-cinnamon soils > eolian soils. The sensitivity of SOCD to land use change was different for the six soil types. Both the degradation of grassland and the application of the government policy of returning forest from cropland induced the greatest variation in SOCD. (2) SOCD correlated significantly with soil type and elevation in each land use. There was a significant correlation between SOCD and slope in the forest. (3) Statistical models showing SOCD and the influencing factors were developed and provided the basis for predicting SOC stocks in Duolun County, Inner Mongolia.

TI Application of CORINE land-cover mapping to estimate carbon stored in

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DE CORINE; land cover; vegetation-carbon stores; Ireland
ID UK
AB The CORINE land cover database for Ireland (in ARC/INFO) is used to estimate the amount of carbon stored (tonnes) by each land-cover (vegetation) type. Carbon store is the area of each CORINE land-cover type multiplied by its carbon density (t C ha(-1)). Derivations of these carbon densities are described and limitations of data and other empirical evidence discussed. The total vegetation-carbon stores are calculated for Northern Ireland (3.81 Mt), the Republic of Ireland (19.27 Mt) and Ireland (23.08 Mt). Carbon densities are grouped into classes and their distributions across Ireland are mapped. The vegetation-carbon store is taken to include stems, branches, foliage and roots. It does not include litter, microbial biomass and organic carbon in the soil. Forests store 49% of the vegetation carbon on less than 5% of the total CORINE land area, with a further 22% in other semi-natural vegetation. In contrast, pastures account for 56% of the land-cover area, but only 19% of the carbon store. High carbon densities are found in the west and in uplands, reflecting the distribution of forests and semi-natural vegetation, particularly peatland and moors. The inventory of vegetation-carbon stores is an important first step in attempts to monitor changes in carbon sequestration from, and emissions to, the atmosphere by terrestrial vegetation. Greenhouse gas fluxes, including CO2, and climate warming are global issues which require responses by all countries. Inventories of carbon stores and fluxes therefore need to be comparable between countries so that agreed reductions can be targetted. CORINE land-cover data are available for 19 European Union and adjacent countries and could be used to provide an inventory of carbon stores, and through updating of CORINE, changes in those stores. Commonality in determining the carbon densities of CORINE classes would be required. This study exemplifies how that was achieved in two countries using their national data. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB The late Holocene landscape and environment at Sandhavn in Greenland's Eastern Settlement are considered in the light of recent palaeoentomological investigations. Samples dating to post-Norse peat accumulation suggest that Norse activity had no lasting effect on the beetle fauna and environment at Sandhavn after its abandonment in the Medieval period. The faunas recovered may be assumed to be characteristic of the surrounding environment, and indicate that the site was situated in an area of wetland and heath. The assemblages are discussed in the context of the sub-fossil and modern coleopteran faunal history of the North Atlantic islands, and as evidence for post-abandonment environmental conditions in Greenland.

AB Volcanic ashes in coal and coal-bearing sequences typically occur as persistent bands within coal seams (generally as tonsteins, but in a few cases as bentonites, K-bentonites, or as clay-free partings), as an intimate mixture with organic matter, as host rocks (such as roof and floor strata), or as thick layers in coal-bearing strata that are stratigraphically separated from coal seams, including those of thick, laterally persistent tuffs, and in the broader sense fragmental clay rocks and flint clays. Altered volcanic ashes have been found in numerous coals with rank ranging from lignite through various bituminous coals to anthracite, as well as in all the continents where coal beds are present.
   The main primary minerals in volcanic ash that survive post-depositional alteration include high-temperature quartz, plagioclase, sanidine, zircon, apatite, monazite, micas, rutile, and anatase. Alteration of volcanic glass and less stable primary minerals may result in the formation of kaolinite, smectite, illite, mixed-layer I/S and, in some cases, chlorite and zeolites. In addition to mineralogical and petrographic characteristics, identification of the parent magma type is commonly based on relatively immobile elements rather than the total alkali-silica contents, which are often affected by post-depositional alteration. Four types of volcanic ashes have been identified in coal and coal-bearing sequences, namely felsic, mafic, intermediate, and alkali. Altered mafic volcanic ashes are characteristically enriched in Sc, V, Cr, Co, and Ni; have positive Eu anomalies; and are of a medium-REE enrichment type. Altered alkali volcanic ashes are unique in their significant high concentrations of rare metals such as Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, REE, and Ga, and are characterized by distinct negative Eu anomalies. Compared with altered alkali volcanic ashes, felsic tonsteins have relatively lower REE concentrations and less pronounced negative Eu anomalies, but a greater fractionation between light and heavy REEs. The compositional variation of different types of altered volcanic ashes is attributed to the tectonic framework and geodynamic controls.
   Volcanic ashes in coal may serve as chronostratigraphic markers to identify and correlate coal seams, and can also be used for radiometric age determination. The ashes may have provided terrigenous materials that served as substrates for peat development; and may have terminated peat accumulation if volcanic ash in large quantities fell into the peat swamp; they can also be used to indicate the geodynamic processes of coal formation; and perhaps explain mass extinction events. Admixed volcanic ash may lower the quality of the coal if not removed in the preparation plant. From a practical viewpoint, alkali volcanic ashes may be significantly enriched in rare earth elements, Y, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and Ga, which have potential economic significance. This paper reviews the distribution, geochemical and mineralogical compositions, and the significance and applications of volcanic ashes in coal and coal-bearing sequences.

AB Soil carbon (C) is a dynamic and integral part of the global C cycle. It has been a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) since the dawn of settled agriculture, depleting more than 320 billion metric tons (Pg.) from the terrestrial pool, 78 +/- 12 Pg of which comes from soil. In comparison, approximately 292 Pg C have been emitted through fossil-fuel combustion since about 1750. However, terrestrial pools can act as a sink for as much as 50 parts per million of atmospheric CO2 for 100 to 150 years. The technical sink capacity of US soils is 0.288 Pg C per year; Earth's terrestrial biosphere can act as a sink for up to 3.8 Pg C per year. The economic potential of C storage depends on its costs and cobenefits, such as global food security, water quality, and soil biodiversity. Therefore, optimally managing the soil C pool must be the basis of any strategy to improve and sustain agronomic production, especially in developing countries.

AB Climate warming perturbs ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, causing both positive and negative feedbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, we began a tidal marsh field experiment in two vegetation communities to investigate the mechanisms by which whole-ecosystem warming alters C gain, via plant-driven sequestration in soils, and C loss, primarily via methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we report the results from the first 4 years. As expected, warming of 5.1 degrees C more than doubled CH4 emissions in both plant communities. We propose this was caused by a combination of four mechanisms: (i) a decrease in the proportion of CH4 consumed by CH4 oxidation, (ii) more C substrates available for methanogenesis, (iii) reduced competition between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and (iv) indirect effects of plant traits. Plots dominated by Spartina patens consistently emitted more CH4 than plots dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, indicating key differences in the roles these common wetland plants play in affecting anaerobic soil biogeochemistry and suggesting that plant composition can modulate coastal wetland responses to climate change.

AB The objectives of this synthesis are (1) to review the factors that influence the ecological, geographical, and palaeoecological distributions of plants possessing C-4 photosynthesis and (2) to propose a hypothesis/model to explain both the distribution of C-4 plants with respect to temperature and CO2 and why C-4 photosynthesis is relatively uncommon in dicotyledonous plants (hereafter dicots), especially in comparison with its widespread distribution in monocotyledonous species (hereafter monocots). Our goal is to stimulate discussion of the factors controlling distributions of C-4 plants today, historically, and under future elevated CO2 environments. Understanding the distributions of C-3/C-4 plants impacts not only primary productivity, but also the distribution, evolution, and migration of both invertebrates and vertebrates that graze on these plants. Sixteen separate studies all indicate that the current distributions of C-4 monocots are tightly correlated with temperature: elevated temperatures during the growing season favor C-4 monocots. In contrast, the seven studies on C-4 dicot distributions suggest that a different environmental parameter, such as aridity (combination of temperature and evaporative potential), more closely describes their distributions. Differences in the temperature dependence of the quantum yield for CO2 uptake (light-use efficiency) of C-3 and C-4 species relate well to observed plant distributions and light-use efficiency is the only mechanism that has been proposed to explain distributional differences in C-3/C-4 monocots. Modeling of C-3 and C-4 light-use efficiencies under different combinations of atmospheric CO2 and temperature predicts that C-4-dominated ecosystems should not have expanded until atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached the lower levels that are thought to have existed beginning near the end of the Miocene. At that time, palaeocarbonate and fossil data indicate a simultaneous, global expansion of C-4-dominated grasslands. The C-4 monocots generally have a higher quantum yield than C-4 dicots and it is proposed that leaf venation patterns play a role in increasing the light-use efficiency of most C-4 monocots. The reduced quantum yield of most C-4 dicots is consistent with their rarity, and it is suggested that C-4 dicots may not have been selected until CO2 concentrations reached their lowest levels during glacial maxima in the Quaternary. Given the intrinsic light-use efficiency advantage of C-4 monocots, C-4 dicots may have been limited in their distributions to the warmest ecosystems, saline ecosystems, and/or to highly disturbed ecosystems. All C-4 plants have a significant advantage over C-3 plants under low atmospheric CO2 conditions and are predicted to have expanded significantly on a global scale during full-glacial periods, especially in tropical regions. Bog and lake sediment cores as well as pedogenic carbonates support the hypothesis that C-4 ecosystems were more extensive during the last glacial maximum and then decreased in abundance following deglaciation as atmospheric CO2 levels increased.

AB The observed increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming, have raised interests in identifying sources and sinks of carbon in the environment. Terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Particularly, wetland systems function primarily as long-term reservoirs for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and as sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of carbon reservoirs in two high-altitude wetlands in the central Andean mountain of Colombia. Carbon cycle in both systems is related mainly with the plant biomass dynamics from the littoral zone. Thus, total organic carbon concentrate an average up to 329 kg of N ha(-1) and 125 kg of P ha(-1) every year vs only 17 kg N ha(-1) and 6 kg P ha(-1) in the water column of the limnetic zone in the wetland, evidencing spatial differences in carbon concentrations for these types of ecosystems. Results revealed that these systems participate in the balance and sequestration of carbon in the Colombian Andes.

AB Extensive agricultural systems have been promoted all over Europe. Most studies of such systems have focused on plant species composition, while few studies have looked at soil effects. We report on an experiment at three upland sites where soil carbon, nitrogen and pH were measured twice a year for 12 years. There were four grazing treatments: no grazing, grazed to maintain a sward height of 8 cm, grazed to maintain 4 cm (all without fertiliser) and grazed to maintain 4 cm with the addition of fertiliser. There was no significant effect of treatment, but there were differences between sites over time. A simulation model, CENTURY, was adapted to the data. It also predicted little difference between treatments, but the fit to data was not very good. It was necessary to assume that the soils contained a store of undecomposed organic matter or peat that was now slowly decomposing as a result of liming. The need to modify the model to include a pH effect on decomposition in the model is highlighted.

AB Two terrestrial sections have been studied in order to reconstruct the Holocene glacial and colluvial history in Leirungsdalen, eastern Jotunheimen. The interpretation of individual sedimentary units is based on the grain-size distribution and compared with modern analogue samples collected in the respective streams and at sites close to the present glaciers. Stages of enhanced debris flow or glacial activity are recognized as sand and silt layers, respectively, while periods of low colluvial and glacial activity in the catchment are characterised by continuous peat accumulation. Age/depth curves based on radiocarbon dates from the Svarthammarbu and Steinflybekken sections indicate debris flow activity > 7500, 7300-6800,6600-5500, 5800, 5700, 5300-4900,4700, 4500,4300, 2300, 2100-1500, 1300, 700-600 and 500-400 cal. yr BP. The first Holocene glacial signal is detected ca. 5300 cal. yr BP. The frequency of glacial events seems to have increased during the Late Holocene, especially during the last 1500 cal. yr BP. Periods of enhanced debris flow activity back to 7000-6000 cal. yr BP, are largely in agreement with a similar record obtained from Leirdalen, western Jotunheimen.

AB The viability of co-composting as a treatment approach for sewage sludge with organic wastes was investigated in the context of management aspects and the agricultural value of the final product. Two composting cycles (P1 and P2) were performed, in which sewage sludge (SS) was used to form two mixtures either with olive mill waste (OMW) or with green waste (GW), respectively. Co-composting of SS with both used organic wastes allowed obtaining hygienic compost with sufficient agronomic quality. Phenols accumulation from the mixture containing OMW caused an important decrease of pathogens within the compost. These products were characterized by a content of P and K that meet similar quality compared to commercial composts and showed an advanced maturation useable directly in agriculture. FTIR analyses and phytotoxicity tests were assessed to evaluate compost maturity. In fact, the germination index (GI) values for maize and tomato seeds, treated with P1, were 79.68% and 97.36%, respectively. However, they decreased to 74.45% and 81.45%, respectively using P2. Furthermore, compost application in peat amended at ratios equal to 30% and 50% improved the growth speed and fresh biomass of maize and tomato plants.

AB Variation in the organic matter content associated with suspended particulate matter (SPM) is an often overlooked component of carbon cycling within freshwater riverine systems. The potential biogeochemical reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) that affect its interactions and fate, i.e. respired and lost to the atmosphere along river continua or ultimately exported to estuarine and oceanic pools was assessed.
   Eleven contrasting sites draining nested catchments (5-1837 km(2)) in the River Dee basin, NE Scotland were sampled during summer 2008 to evaluate spatio-temporal variations in quantity and quality (biogeochemical reactivity) of SPM during relatively low flow conditions. Mean SPM concentrations increased from 0.21 to 1.22 mg L-1 between the uppermost and lowest mainstem sites. Individually, POC concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 0.55 mg L-1 and accounted for ca. 3-15% of total aqueous organic carbon transported. The POC content was partitioned into autotrophic (2.78-73.0 mg C g(-1) SPM) and detrital (119-388 mg C g(-1) SPM) biomass carbon content. The particulate respired CO2-C as a % of the total carbon associated with SPM, measured by MicroResp (TM) over 18 h, varied in recalcitrance from 0.49% at peat-dominated sites to 3.20% at the lowermost mainstem site. Significant (p<0.05) relationships were observed between SPM biogeochemical reactivity measures (% respired CO2-C; chlorophyll alpha; bioavailable-phosphorus) and arable and improved grassland area, associated with increasing biological productivity downstream.
   Compositional characteristics and in-stream processing of SPM appear to be related to contributory land use pressures, that influence SPM characteristics and biogeochemistry (C:N:P stoichiometry) of its surrounding aqueous environment. As moorland influences declined, nutrient inputs from arable and improved grasslands increasingly affected the biogeochemical content and reactivity of both dissolved and particulate matter. This increases the potential for recycling of the organic matter that is either transported from upstream or entering further along the riverine continuum. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Assemblages of cyclic components in bitumens help to verify some assumption based of linear structures interpretation and supply relevant information for the generative potential of the region and palaeoenvironment of deposition. Hopanes and steranes determine immature Type III to mixed Type II/III kerogen for the Bulgarian part of the Thrace Basin. The view for Type III kerogen is additionally supported by the signatures for triterpenoids (TTs) abundance. In bitumen fractions monounsaturated, aromatized, C-3 functionalised or partly destructed TTs are identified. All these components unequivocally attest angiosperm taxa contribution to the palaeoenvironment. Consistent with the composition of the products from TTs destruction or aromatization it is assumed that oleanane type TTs strongly prevail ursane/lupane structures. Saturated diterpenoids were practically absent in bitumen extracts. Cross-plots of Pr/Ph vs. C-29/C-27 regular steranes attest deposition in anoxic/sub-oxic environment. Positions of samples in the diagram confirm the assumption for mixed type of OM (algae/bacteria and from land plants). Plots of steranes in tertiary diagram depict OM formation in open water environment (bay or estuarine) in lacustrine-fluvial/deltaic environments. A decrease in MPI-3 values with depth parallel to T-max changes was observed. It might be a hint for redeposition of more mature OM. This surmise was not supported by the changes in biomarker parameters, i.e. T-s/(T-s+T-m), hopane ratio, homohopane index, sterane C-29 beta beta/(alpha alpha+beta beta) and C29 20S/(20S+20R) ratios and positions in Pr/nC(17)vs. Ph/nC(18) diagram, all attesting maturity increase with depth. More samples and additional study are needed to verify this assumption. Rock Eval data and cyclic biomarker assemblages give us a confidence to denote that samples from the shale interval of the shale-marl formation in the Bulgarian territories and analogues to the Yenimuhacir group in the Turkish part of the Thrace Basin, can be regarded as "gas-prone" source rocks capable to generate biogenic gas. Although based on limited number of samples, some of them with low total organic carbon content, the current study is informative for a region where geochemical data are practically absent.

AB Mimicking the natural heterogeneity of wetland substrates, e.g. by roughening surface soil or constructing hummocks, has been shown to facilitate wetland plant establishment. We asked if incorporating substrate heterogeneity could also help plants withstand variation in moisture levels. In a wetland with Carex stricta (tussock sedge) as the main restoration target, we manipulated substrates to create different soil moisture environments for planted C. stricta plugs. Our artificial mounds mimicked tussocks formed by C. stricta in natural meadows (circa 10-40 cm in height); we also varied mound compositions and created shallow depressions. Monitoring demonstrated variation in soil moisture among our treatments and natural differences in soil moisture between experimental blocks. Additionally, rainfall varied from severe drought in year 1 to extreme rainfall in year 2. Plug survival, flowering, cover, biomass, leaf length, and growth rate all varied with treatment, block, and/or year. Interactions among those factors were common. Planting plugs in shallow depressions exacerbated stress in a wet block during a wet year, causing low survival. Planting plugs in moisture-retaining peat pots allowed them to survive and sustain growth even in a dry block during a dry year. We conclude that heterogeneous substrates can be used to hedge against environmental variability by widening the range of microsites available within a restoration site and thereby moderating stressful conditions in some areas.

AB The objective of the present study was to asses the effect of watertable level on N mineralization in a Histosol and a Humic Gleysol profile under natural meadows in Ljubljana marsh, Slovenia. The two soils differ significantly in organic matter content (27-40 % in Histosol and 14-20 % in Humic Gleysol) but not in C : N ratio (13-20) and pH (6.5-7.0). For each soil, the watertable was maintained at two levels (above or below 50 cm from the soil surface) for approximately one year. The four main plots, according to soil carbon content and watertable level were divided into 4 subplots, according to 4 fertilization treatments (unfertilized control, PK, PK + 50 kg N ha(-1), PK + 3 X 50 kg N ha(-1)). Net N mineralization in unfertilized subplots was estimated from indices of N mineralization obtained by incubation of soil samples in the laboratory and by seasonal dynamics of mineral N content in the field. Annual uptake of N in herbage under the 4 fertilization treatments was also measured. Total mineral N content in topsoil was 20-80 % higher in Histosol than in Humic Gleysol. Similarly, aerobic N mineralization potentials along the entire soil profile (0-90 cm) were 20-130 % higher in Histosol than in Humic Gleysol. By contrast, anaerobic N mineralization potentials in subsoil were 10-60 % lower in Histosol than in Humic Gleysol. Both, aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization potentials strongly depended on watertable levels at sampling time. Seasonal dynamics of soil mineral N content as well as N mineralization potentials indicated that the N mineralization in the Histosol could be 10-40 % higher at low than at high watertable level. In the Humic Gleysol the N mineralization could be 10-100 % higher at big watertable level. Higher N availability in Histosol at low watertable and in Humic Gleysol at high watertable was also reflected in higher N uptake in herbage. These results indicate that N mineralization in Histosol and Humic Gleysol, was proportional to soil organic matter content, whereas in both soils. higher N mineralization rates can be expected at watertable levels between 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface, than at higher/lower watertable levels.

AB Maceral analyses along with proximate and elemental analyses were undertaken in order to determine the features of the Amynteo coal deposit and its depositional environment. The Amynteo coal has an eu-ulminite B reflectance of Rr = 0.21%, and in terms of lithotype belongs to matrix lignite. Huminite is the most abundant maceral group, consisting mostly of detrohuminite. Inertinite has relatively low percentages whereas liptinite concentrations are rather high. A ternary plot was applied as an indication of the depositional paleoenvironment. The results from the majority of the samples indicate origin in a topogenous setting. The peat accumulation was governed by a high groundwater level (wet telmatic to limno-telmatic facies). The depositional environment can be characterized as a reed-marsh environment, with occasional establishment of forest swamps.

AB The rates of CO2 production and decomposition of C-13-enriched Lolium perenne leaves and roots in soil from the surface five cm of two upland stagnohumic gley soils were measured in laboratory experiments. One of the soils had been limed (pH 6.8) 13 years earlier. The other was unlimed (pH 3.7). Liming increased the rate of CO2 release from soil to which no L. perenne had been added. About 30% of the C-13 in L. perenne leaves remained in both limed and unlimed soil after 224 days. By contrast, less C-13 remained in the limed soil amended with L. perenne roots (44%) than in the limed soils (55%). Although the daily rate of CO2 from the plant material-amended soils was initially greater in the improved than in the unimproved soil, it subsequently declined more rapidly.

AB Industrial humic products (HPs) manufactured from various organic matter resources, including fossils, peat, lake-bottom sediments and organic waste materials, have found multiple applications in soil environments. Fungi play a crucial role in the turnover of humic substances (HSs). However, the data on the biological effects of HSs on soil fungi are contradictory. Revealing mechanisms of how HSs interact with soil filamentous fungi is essential for understanding a sustainable soil system. Here we study the responses of phytopathogenicAlternaria alternataand the potential antagonistTrichoderma harzianum, to exogenic HPs (from leonardite and lignosulfonate) at two concentrations (0.1 and 0.02%) in growth media with varying sucrose concentrations (0, 3 and 30 g/L). We assessed the fungal growth endpoints including the mycelium biomass accumulation, fungal colony size and conidia production. Our results demonstrate the significant relationships between the extent of inhibitory/stimulation effect of HPs on the investigated fungi and the carbon status of the growth medium, some features of the fungal species, as well as the type and concentration of the introduced HPs. The responses of plant pathogens correlated specifically with various types of HPs. HP from lignosulfonate exhibited a more stimulating effect on A. alternatacompared to the effect of HP from leonardite.

AB It has widely been documented that nitrogen (N) stimulates plant growth and net primary production. But how N affects net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) is still dispute. We conduct an experimental study to assess the response of NEE to N addition in a freshwater marsh. Experimental treatments involved elevated N and control treatments on triplicate 1 m(2) plots. Gas exchange, air temperature, plant biomass and leaf area as well as N% of leaf were measured from 2004 to 2005. The results indicated that N addition initially decreased the CO2 sequestration but the trend changed in the second year. It was concluded that N addition enhanced the greenhouse effect in marshland as far as global warming potential (GWP) is concerned. This increase was attributed to a substantial increase in CH4 and N2O emissions after N addition. We recommended long-term studies to further clarify the effect of N addition on NEE.

AB Ice-sheet reconstructions for the last glacial maximum in northern Eurasia range from nearly complete coverage by a contiguous marine-based ice sheet to large unglaciated areas. Stratigraphic records from Yamal Peninsula, Russia, provide new insight on the eastern limit of the Eurasian ice sheet in the Kara Sea. Radiocarbon and infrared stimulated luminescence ages from coastal cliff sections date the emplacement of the Kara diamicton as older than ca. 40 ka, reflecting regional glaciation, Ice-wedge growth, peat accumulation, and eolian and fluvial deposition characterized the past similar to 40 k.y. and do not support coverage of Yamal Peninsula by an ice sheet or proximity to a glacier margin. Thus, the late Weichselian Eurasian ice sheet was largely confined to Parents Sea and its global sea-level contribution is reduced to similar to 7 m of sea-level equivalent.

TI Lake-tilting, a method for estimation of glacio-isostatic uplift
SO BOREAS
LA English
DT Article
ID SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; SWEDEN
AB A non-uniform glacio-isostatic uplift can result in differential uplift for different parts of a lake. If the lake outlet is situated in the area of the greatest rate of uplift, then remote parts of the lake will be continuously transgressed. Ancient lake levels can be estimated by dating transgressed peat at different depths in such lakes. Four lakes in southern Sweden have been investigated using this method and the course of the glacio-isostatic uplift has been determined empirically. This investigation shows that the difference in uplift between the outlet and the sampling site can be expressed as an arctan function relating the difference in uplift over time to: half of the difference of the total uplift between the outlet and the sampling site, the time for the maximal rate of the uplift and a declining factor.

AB The storage of low level radioactive waste in trenches overlying an unconfined groundwater how system in sands has generated a contaminant plume (with chemical characteristics of dilute sanitary landfill leachate) containing C-14 both as dissolved inorganic and organic C. In the groundwater, dissolved organic compounds account, on average, for 22% of the total C and 10% of the C-14. Approximately 300 m from the waste management site, the groundwater discharges to the surface in a wetland containing up to 3 m of peat and an extensive tree cover. Drainage from the wetland passes through a gauged stream. Radiocarbon input to the groundwater discharge area in 1991 was determined to be between 3.3 and 4.2 GBq, based on data from a line of sampling wells along the groundwater input boundary of the wetland, with control provided by water and tritium balance data. During the 1991 study year, only 1.5-2% of both the inorganic and organic C-14 inputs left the wetland in surface water drainage. Vegetation growth in the wetland during the study year contained 8-10% of the released radiocarbon. If the rate of C accumulation in the peat has been constant, 7-9% of the annual radiocarbon input has been retained in the organic soil. Much of this soil accumulation can be attributed to litter from standing vegetation, making distribution coefficients an inappropriate model for C-14 partitioning between groundwater and soil. The plant/soil C-14 concentration ratio was 24 to 33, but application of a concentration ratio to describe the transfer of radiocarbon to plants is also believed to be inappropriate. This study indicates that over 80% of the groundwater radiocarbon is rapidly lost to the atmosphere when the groundwater comes to surface, and we infer that most of the C-14 accumulation in vegetation occurs by CO2 transfer from the air to the plant.

AB The study compares the local and regional Holocene vegetation dynamics of two sites in eastern Latvia. Both sites show similar trends in vegetation change. Differences were found in local abundances of Betula, Pinus and Picea. Lower amounts of Betula at the local site suggest stronger regional pollen influx into the regional site. The continuous presence of conifer stomata indicates the development of a stand-scale conifer forest at the local site since 5000 cal yr BP. Similar presence and dynamics in thermophilous tree species at both sites suggest that the pollen values of the regional site may truly show the local presence of thermophilous tree taxa. Apart from general vegetation succession, the strongest cause for the vegetation differences at both sites were water-level changes, as shown by the peat decomposition rate.

AB The compositions of lignin degradation products, fatty acids as well as opal phytoliths of peaty sediments were correlated with the environmental and climatic changes of a wetland which has been formed continuously since 32,000 yBP in Central Japan. Determination of phenolic and lipid compounds provided information on the aerobic and anaerobic conditions of the wetland as well as the types of vegetation. Palmitic and stearic acids were more decomposable and their contents reflected well the changes in the state of the wetland. These trends agreed well with the field-observation of the characteristics of the profile and with the results of opal phytolith analysis. The combination of organic chemical analysis and plant phytolith analysis was found to be effective for elucidating the paleo-environment surrounding the wetland.

ID MANAGEMENT; BUDGETS
AB Background, Aim and Scope. Coastal and river plains are the surfaces of depositional systems, to which sediment input is a parameter of key-importance. Their habitation and economic development usually requires protection with dikes, quays, etc., which are effective in retaining floods but have the side effect of impeding sedimentation in their hinterlands. The flood-protected Dutch lowlands (so-called dike-ring areas) have been sediment-starved for up to about a millennium. In addition to this, peat decomposition and soil compaction, brought about by land drainage, have caused significant land subsidence. Sediment deficiency, defined as the combined effect of sediment-starvation and drainage-induced volume losses, has already been substantial in this area, and it is expected to become urgent in view of the forecasted effects of climate change (sea-level rise, intensified precipitation and run-off). We therefore explore this deficiency, compare it with natural (Holocene) and current human sediment inputs, and discuss it in terms of long-term land-use options.
   Materials and Methods. We use available 3D geological models to define natural sediment inputs to our study area. Recent progress in large-scale modelling of peat oxidation and compaction enables us to address volume loss associated with these processes. Human sediment inputs are based on published minerals statistics. All results are given as first-order approximations.
   Results. The current sediment deficit in the diked lowlands of the Netherlands is estimated at 136 +/- 67 million m(3)/a. About 85% of this volume is the hypothetical amount of sediment required to keep up with sea-level rise, and 15% is the effect of land drainage (peat decomposition and compaction). The average Holocene sediment input to our study area (based on a total of 145 km(3)) is similar to 14 million m(3)/a, and the maximum (millennium-averaged) input similar to 26 million m(3)/a. Historical sediment deficiency has resulted in an unused sediment accommodation space of about 13.3 km(3). Net human input of sediment material currently amounts to similar to 23 million m(3)/a.
   Discussion. As sedimentary processes in the Dutch lowlands have been retarded, the depositional system's natural resilience to sea-level rise is low, and all that is left to cope is human countermeasure. Preserving some sort of status quo with water management solutions may reach its limits in the foreseeable future. The most viable long-term option therefore seems a combination of allowing for more water in open country (anything from flood-buffer zones to open water) and raising lands that are to be built up (enabling their lasting protection). As to the latter, doubling or tripling the use of filling sand in a planned and sustained effort may resolve up to one half of the Dutch sediment deficiency problems in about a century.
   Conclusions, Recommendations and Perspectives. We conclude that sediment deficiency-past, present and future-challenges the sustainable habitation of the Dutch lowlands. In order to explore possible solutions, we recommend the development of long-term scenarios for the changing lowland physiography, that include the effects of Global Change, compensation measures, costs and benefits, and the implications for long-term land-use options.

AB Results of a geomorphologic study as well as radiocarbon and pollen analyses of sediments in small basins of the Jaslo-Sanok Depression (Western Carpathians) are summarised. Floors of these basins, carved in soft shale-sandstone Krosno Beds, are covered with channel fluvial deposits and oxbow-lake sediments with lake chalk and peat accumulated in the Late Vistulian and Holocene. Since the early Atlantic Phase (ca 8,400-7,900 BP) the apparent acceleration of overbank (flood) deposition intermitting the peat accumulation is observed. The plant succession includes the Late Glacial (pre-Allerod, Allerod and Younger Dryas) with coniferous park forests, through mixed deciduous forests of the Holocene with elm, hazel, oak and lime as well as spruce-elm forests with alder in wetlands, up to present-day hornbeam forests (Tilio-Carpinetum of various types) and extra-zonal Carpathian beech forests (Dentario-Glandulosae-Fagetum). Abies alba (fir) is frequent in both these association types. First evidences of synanthropic plants that prove presence of prehistoric man appeared in the Subboreal Phase. The oldest radiocarbon date 13,550 +/- 100 BP (Gd-7355) [16,710-16,085 b2k], from a bottom part of the Humniska section is probably overestimated. This is indicated by palynological data, which suggest attribution of this section to the older Allerod. Small thickness of gravel blanket from the Plenivistulian termination and the beginning of the Late Vistulian, as well as large areas devoid of weathering and solifluction covers indicate that during the Plenivistulian weathering processes and removal of silt-clay material predominated in the basins. In that time the deflation was among important processes, which is proved by deflation troughs, faceted cobbles and thick covers of the Carpathian type of loess. The Besko Basin has pre-Vistulian tectonic foundation, while landforms of its floor are of erosion-degradation origin and formed during the last Scandinavian glaciation. In the Holocene the basin floors were overbuilt with fluvial deposits up to 8 m thick.

AB This paper considers regularities governing the formation of automorphic tundra soils on glacial loamy deposits containing relict organic matter mainly represented by very fine plant detritus. Drainage, microtopography, and cryoturbation activity are the major controls of the development of these soils. With an increase in drainage, the following pedogenetic trend is observed on the surface of yedoma (Ice D<inverted exclamation>omplex) areas: gleyzem-cryozem-cryometamorphic soil. The climate change in the Holocene induced quick transformation of topography and general landscape situation and promoted formation and development of cryogenic soil complexes in the considered territory. Upon the low intensity of pedogenesis, the features and properties of previous soil formation stages are often preserved in the soil profiles; these are: gleyzation, peat accumulation, and cryoturbation.

AB Flooding of the southern part of the North Sea occurred between 9000 and 8000 BP, when the rate of relative sea-level rise was on the order of 0.7 cm per year for the Dover Strait Region and 1.6 cm per year for the area north of the Frisian Islands, forcing the shoreline to recede rapidly. When relative sea-level rise decelerated after 7000 BP for the Belgian coast and 6000 BP for the central Netherlands coast, sediment supply by the tidal currents balanced the creation of accommodation space in the estuaries and other back-barrier basins. Consequently, the barrier started to stabilize, and the tidal basins and their inlets silted up. Between 5500 and 4500 BP, the Belgian coastal plain changed into a freshwater marsh with peat accumulation, and the same happened 500-1000 years later in the western provinces of the Netherlands. The E-W running barrier/back-barrier system of the Frisian Islands in the northern Netherlands stayed open until today, however, because of lower sediment supply.
   The period between 4000 and 2000 BP was relatively quiet due to the strong deceleration of the rate of sea-level rise; peat cushions developed behind the barriers, which were straightened by erosion of the headlands. Major and often catastrophic flooding occurred in the Middle Ages, when the estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands formed.
   About 226 (+/- 15%) x 10(9) m(3) sediment, mostly sand, is stored in the barriers and back-barrier basins of the Netherlands, 70% of which was deposited prior to 5000 BP. About 10% of the stored sediment is estimated to be of alluvial origin. Most of the sediment is derived by the erosion of the Pleistocene basement during recession of the barriers, but tide-induced cross-shore transport from the North Sea forms an additional source for the barriers and back-barriers of the west-facing coast of the Netherlands.

AB Compelling evidence is presented for the process of,lipid sulfurisation in humic coal-forming environments. The production of reduced inorganic sulfides by sulfate-reducing bacteria during a marine transgression, which occurred during early diagenesis, enabled the selective sequestration of functionalised lipids in the polar and asphaltene fractions from the Eocene, marine-influenced Heartbreak Ridge lignite deposit, southeast Western Australia. Nickel boride desulfurisation experiments conducted on these fractions released small but significant quantities of sulfur-bound hydrocarbons. These comprised mostly higher plant triterpanes, C-29 steranes and extended 17beta(H),21beta(H)-hopanes, linked by one sulfur atom at, or close to, functionalised sites in the original natural product precursors. These sulfurised lipids mostly derive from the same carbon sources as the free hydrocarbon lipids, the exception being the sulfurised extended hopanoids, which may be partially derived from a different bacterial source compared to that of the free hopanoids. These results indicate that the selectivity and nature of steroid and hopanoid vulcanisation in coal-forming mires is akin to that observed in other sedimentary environments. However, the diversity of higher plant triterpanes that can be sulfurised in marine transgressed coals is greater than that typically reported in immature terrestrial coals. This preservation mechanism explains the formation of the structurally related biomarkers in more mature sulfur-rich humic coals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB FEN1 cleaves 5' flaps at their base to create a nicked product for ligation. FEN1 has been reported to enter the flap from the 5'-end and track to the base. Current binding analyses support a very different mechanism of interaction with the flap substrate. Measurements of FEN1 binding to a flap substrate show that the nuclease binds with similar high affinity to the base of a long flap even when the 5'-end is blocked with biotin/streptavidin. However, FEN1 bound to a blocked flap is more sensitive to sequestration by a competing substrate. These results are consistent with a substrate interaction mechanism in which FEN1 first binds the flap base and then threads the flap through an opening in the protein from the 5'-end to the base for cleavage. Significantly, when the unblocked flap length is reduced from five to two nucleotides, FEN1 can be sequestered from the substrate to a similar extent as a blocked, long flap substrate. Apparently, interactions related to threading occur only when the flap is greater than two to four nucleotides long, implying that short flaps are cleaved without a threading requirement.

AB Petrographic analyses were carried out on thin coals and coaly sediments from the Lower Carboniferous Mattson Formation at Clausen Creek and Jackfish Gap-Yohin Ridge in the northern part of the Liard Basin, northern Canada. The composition and optical characteristics indicate that the coals are high-volatile bituminous B, predominantly sapropelic (canneloid) and accumulated subaquatically.
   The coals are dominantly composed of inertinite-rich and exinite-rich durites with subsidiary inertites and clarodurites; vitrite is minor and liptite is rare. The inertinite-rich microlithotypes are dominated by semifusinite, but micrinite, semimacrinite and ?resino-inertinites are abundant. Sporinite, comprising megaspores, crassispores, tenuispores and miospores, is the dominant liptinite maceral with subsidiary cutinite and minor alginite. Except for pyrite, mineral matter is minimal.
   Three populations of telocollinite are observed: a low-reflectance variety (I), commonly associated with micrinite (as vitrinertite), displays weak brown fluorescence and a reflectance some 0.4-0.5% lower than type II; type II is non-fluorescing telocollinite, with intermediate reflectance (0.67-0.74% R(o)m), it occurs as vitrite and is also associated with micrinite; and a higher-reflectance telocollinite (III), having no fluorescence or association with micrinite, has variable reflectance (0.74-0.8% R,rn) implying higher oxidation or gelification levels.
   The abundance of semimacrinite, macrinite and ?resino-inertinites in inertites and durites (I) suggests that much of the peat accumulated subaquatically. Furthermore, fluorescing vitrinite and an abundance of micrinite (derived by oxidation or coalification of bituminite), suggest that the coal accumulated under anaerobic conditions. The predominance of semifusinite in humic laminae and micrinite in sapropelic layers suggests extensive surface or near-surface oxidation of the peat. Oxidised sporinites suggest that they were wind-borne.
   Depositional environment is interpreted as marginal marine, perhaps in shallow lakes in the middle to upper delta plain. Feat accumulations probably began subaquatically at the oxygen-hydrogen sulphide interface, but periodic subaerial exposure and natural oxidation gave rise to the high inertinite coals. Upper Mattson coals are interbedded with algal laminites and probably accumulated in a lagoonal-setting.

AB Sea-level rise associated with climate change presents a major challenge to plant diversity and ecosystem service provision in coastal wetlands. In this study, we investigate the effect of sea-level rise on benthos, vegetation, and ecosystem diversity in a tidal wetland in west Wales, the UK. Present relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were investigated through 50 plots at which vegetation (species and coverage), hydrological (surface or groundwater depth, conductivity) and soil (matrix chroma, presence or absence of mottles, organic content, particle size) data were collected. Benthic communities were sampled at intervals along a continuum from saline to freshwater. To ascertain future changes to the wetlands' hydrology, a GIS-based empirical model was developed. Using a LiDAR derived land surface, the relative effect of peat accumulation and rising sea levels were modelled over 200 years to determine how frequently portions of the wetland will be inundated by mean sea level, mean high water spring and mean high water neap conditions. The model takes into account changing extents of peat accumulation as hydrological conditions alter.
   Model results show that changes to the wetland hydrology will initially be slow. However, changes in frequency and extent of inundation reach a tipping point 125 to 175 years from 2010 due to the extremely low slope of the wetland. From then onwards, large portions of the wetland become flooded at every flood tide and saltwater intrusion becomes more common. This will result in a reduction in marsh biodiversity with plant communities switching toward less diverse and occasionally monospecific communities that are more salt tolerant.
   While the loss of tidal freshwater wetland is in line with global predictions, simulations suggest that in the Teifi marshes the loss will be slow at first, but then rapid. While there will be a decrease in biodiversity, the model indicated that at least for one ecosystem service, carbon storage, there is potential for an increase in the near future.

ID ROOT
AB The ability of seedlings of Eucalyptus tereticornis Smith to accumulate Cs-137 and Sr-90, characteristic radioisotopes of nuclear fallout, from contaminated growth medium was tested. All seedlings were grown for 3 months in 165 cm(3) of sphagnum peat moss - perlite (1:1 v/v) in a growth chamber before treatment with an isotope. After 1 month of exposure, seedlings had accumulated 31.0% of the Cs-137 and 11.3% of the Sr-90 originally present in the growth medium, with bioconcentration ratios of 54:1 for Cs-137 and 13:1 for Sr-90. Accumulation of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in plant tissue was correlated curvilinearly with increasing time of exposure and with increasing concentration of radioisotope in the growth medium. Because seedlings of E. tereticornis accumulate these radioisotopes rapidly, they may be valuable in remediation of contaminated soils.

   2. The limited use of fertilizer on the Somerset Moors, designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area has enabled the impact on vegetation of applying a range of nitrogen levels to be investigated using a randomized block experiment with large plots at Tadham Moor.
   3. From 1986 to 1990, the plot measurements each year included the individual percentage cover of some 100 species; these enabled the derivation of a number of measures of plant community structure.
   4. The applications of fertilizer encouraged grasses (notably Lolium perenne and Holcus lanatus) which came to dominate the sward at the expense of most other species. All measures of species diversity declined significantly and the sward became taller in plots receiving high levels of nitrogen. Only a very few forbs (e.g. Rumex acetosa) maintained or increased their cover with increased nitrogen.
   5. All Carex species, Juncus species and mosses became significantly less common in plots treated with nitrogen, producing an apparently more mesotrophic sward. Short-lived species and low-growing wetland forbs also declined with nitrogen, perhaps due to shading by tall grasses. Legumes were suppressed by high levels of nitrogen, but were common in plots receiving 25 kg ha-1 year-1 N, where replacement levels of phosphorus and potassium were applied after cutting.
   6. Except for grasses, many species common in the experimental site in 1986 declined in cover, particularly in plots receiving high levels of nitrogen. However, the data showed no instances of extinction by 1990. The application of 25 kg ha-1 N encouraged the spread of agriculturally productive grasses within 2 years and 50 kg ha-1 year-1 N significantly reduced species richness in 3 years.
   7. Certain detailed findings from this large-scale study of nitrogen application in meadows enable contrasts with previous results to be identified.

AB Non-protein amino acids are a significant store of organic nitrogen in many ecosystems, but there is a lack of knowledge relating to them. Research has indicated that they play important roles as metabolites, as allelopthic chemicals, in nutrient acquisition, in signalling and in stress response. They are also thought to be responsible for significant medical issues in both invertebrate and vertebrate animals. This review attempts to appraise the literature related to non-protein amino acids, both in terms of their metabolism, plant-soil interactions and at the level of the ecosystem, where they are seen as significant drivers of structure and function. Finally, important areas for future research are discussed.

AB In late 2009 we conducted a refraction-and-reflection-seismic survey across the Salzach Valley in the Eastern Alps near Zell-am-See. The goal was to image the structure of the sedimentary infill, and the depth to bedrock. In this study we present the refraction data and first results from kinematic inverse modeling of first-arrival traveltimes. We use a damped matrix inversion to constrain the velocity for an irregular grid that is adapted to the resolving power of the data. According to our results, the valley is largely symmetric with a maximum depth to bedrock of similar to 400 m. Overall slow P-wave-velocities of the valley fill indicate that it is mostly unconsolidated sediments. A pronounced low velocity zone at similar to 100 m depth is interpreted as peat layer.

AB Sea-level dynamics, sediment availability, and marine energy are critical drivers of coastal wetland formation and persistence, but their roles as continental-scale drivers remain unknown. We evaluated the timing and spatial variability of wetland formation from new and existing cores collected along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. Most basal peat ages occurred after sea-level rise slowed (after similar to 4,000 years before present), but predominance of sea-level rise studies may skew age estimates toward older sites. Near-coastal sites tended to be younger, indicating creation of wetlands through basin infilling and overwash events. Age distributions differed among regions, with younger wetlands in the northeast and southeast corresponding to European colonization and deforestation. Across all cores, wetland age correlated strongly with basal peat depth. Marsh age elucidates the complex interactions between sea-level rise, sediment supply, and geomorphic setting in determining timing and location of marsh formation and future wetland persistence.
   Plain Language Summary Marshes, a type of coastal wetland, form under stable, slow rates of sea-level rise (SLR). Although many marshes along the East Coast of the United States formed after the most recent slowing of SLR (approximately 4,000-6,000 years ago), there is evidence that sediment erosion from colonial deforestation expanded marshes. This study uses sediment cores to determine when and where marshes formed to understand what drives modern marsh formation. We found that most marshes did form following SLR slowing after around 4,000 years ago. We also found evidence of marshes forming during European colonization in the northeastern and southeastern United States. Finally, we found recent formation of marshes closest to the coast, possibly driven by storm events and associated overwash. Through this study, we outline a novel way to easily determine marsh age and to better understand why marshes form through future research.

AB Three upper Pictured Cliffs Sandstone tongues in the northern part of the San Juan Basin record high-frequency transgressive episodes during the Late Cretaceous and are inferred to have been caused by eustatic sea level rise coincident with differential subsidence. Outcrop and subsurface studies show that each tongue is an amalgamated barrier strand-plain unit up to 100 ft (30 m) thick. Successive upper Pictured Cliffs tongues display an imbricate relation and are offset basinward, reflecting net shoreline progradation northeast-ward. Upper Pictured Cliffs barrier strand-plain sandstones underlie and bound thickest Fruitland coal seams on the seaward side. Controls on Fruitland coal-seam thickness and continuity are a function of local facies distribution in a coastal-plain setting, shoreline positions related to transgressive-regressive cycles, and basin subsidence. During periods of relative sea level rise, the Pictured Cliffs shoreline was temporarily stabilized, allowing thick, coastal-plain peats to accumulate. Although some coal seams in the lower Fruitland tongue override abandoned Pictured Cliffs shoreline deposits, many pinch out against them. Differences in the degree of continuity of these coal seams relative to coeval shoreline sandstones are attributed to either differential subsidence in the northern part of the basin, multiple episodes of sea level rise, local variations in accommodation and progradation, stabilization of the shoreline by aggrading peat deposits, or a combination of these factors. Fruitland coalbed methane resources and productivity are partly controlled by coal-seam thickness; other important factors include thermal maturity, fracturing, and overpressuring. The dominant production trend occurs in the northern part of the basin and is oriented northwestward, coinciding with the greatest Fruitland net coal thickness. Similar relationships between trends of thick coal seams of coeval origin with stacked shoreface sandstones exist in other Western Interior basins in the United States and serve as models for coalbed methane exploration in other basins of the world.

AB Detailed petrographic analyses of the Barrett Coal, an Upper Permian high-volatile bituminous coal in the Hunter Coalfield, Australia, reveal cycles of peat formation defined by the Tissue Preservation Index. These cycles correspond to coal plies that are separated by dirtbands. The petrographic cyclicity is also manifested by a corresponding stratigraphic cyclicity in the biomarker composition of the extracted aliphatic hydrocarbons. Higher amounts of hopanes and lower Carbon Preference Index values (n-C-22 to n-C-30) show greater bacterial contribution in samples characterised by low values of Tissue Preservation Index. The inherited biodegradation signal from the diagenetic stage has now been partially diluted by the generation of new hydrocarbons from the macromolecule. The C-31 alpha beta (22S/ 22S + 22R) hopane and C-29 alpha alpha alpha (20S/20S + 20R) sterane ratios show least variation through the seam. The homohopane epimer ratios have attained equilibrium, whilst the hopane/moretane ratios are typical of coals with unsupressed vitrinite reflectance of >0.65%. However, other hopane and sterane maturity ratios appear slightly affected by the degree of preservation of organic matter. The C-29 (alpha beta beta/alpha beta beta + alpha alpha alpha) and C-29 alpha alpha alpha (20S/20S + 20R) sterane ratios were not found to be useful for maturity comparisons with other coals because of the low values (average 0.18 and 0.43, respectively) due to heating-rate effects. These and other biomarker distributions are syndepositional features of the coal precursor and therefore are controlled by the environmental conditions during the stage of peat accumulation and its subsequent coalification. All these changes are evident in a coal member only 2.2 m in thickness. The petrographic and geochemical evidence suggest that the environmental affinity of the Barrett Coal is that of a delta-plain depositional setting. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon dating, and pollen and plant macrofossil analyses establish the origin and developmental history of a kettle near Georgetown, Ontario. The early inorganic sediments contain redeposited fossils, particularly from local vegetation. Fossils in peat younger than 10 000 BP largely represent past wetland plant communities in the basin. Although the fossil record probably began about 1300 years after deglaciation of the site, an additional 1700 years passed before the dead ice block melted; only then did sedimentation and biological activity stabilize in the basin and produce an accurate fossil record of past vegetation. Truncated fossil records, illustrated further here by a pollen diagram from nearby Heart Lake, should be expected from kettle-hole deposits, and the radiocarbon ages and fossils from the earliest parts of such sequences should be interpreted with caution.

AB A method is proposed to partition the variation of species abundance data into independent components: pure spatial, pure environmental, spatial component of environmental influence, and undetermined. The new method uses pre-existing techniques and computer programs of canonical ordination. The intrinsic spatial component of community structure is partialled out of the species-environment relationship in order to see if the environmental control model still holds. The method is illustrated using oribatid mites in a peat blanket, forest vegetation data, and aquatic heterotrophic bacteria. In this latter example, the new method is shown to be complementary to another approach based on partial Mantel tests.

AB The spatial patterns of soil nutrients at the sampling scales are the interweaving of local and structured variances. In order to unravel the structured variation of soil nutrients from the original data, two-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (2DEMD) was used to decompose their spatial variability into different scales across a typical watershed. The results suggested that the 2DEMD could separate the local variation represented by IMF1 and structured variation represented by IMF2-4 and residue. Both variance percentages of each IMF and geostatistical parameters of structured variances (IMF2-4) indicated that majority of soil nutrient variations occurred within the local (< 3.2 km) and largest scales (60-90 km for SOM, SAP and SAK, and 219 km for STN km). Climatic factors controlled the soil nutrients under natural land use types, and the topographic factors mainly affected the soil nutrients under cultivated land use types at the largest structured variance. Therefore, at the largest scales, management practices considering slope or elevation are needed to improve the level of soil nutrients under cropland or orchard land in mountainous areas.

AB The article presents results of the study of rare metal ores that were identified in the seam XI of the Kemerovo suite in the southern part of the Kuznetsk basin. The coals in the seam XI represent polymetallic ores of of Nb-Ta-Zr-Hf-Y-REE-Ga composition. Their formation is associated with the thick (6-15 ) non-coal layers, contrastively enriched with Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Y, REE, Ga, Th, U, Sn and other lithophylic elements, in the coal seam. Geochemical characteristics of these layers and the composition of relict minerals allows connecting these horizons with the input of acid volcanic pyroclastic material of alkaline composition during peat accumulation. The restored composition shows the correspondence of the volcanogenic pyroclastics to comendites-pantellerites. A possible source are pantellerite ashes of Mongolia and south-east of Siberia. They are contrastively enriched with Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Y, REE, Ga, Th and U. We have established that the process of coalification was accompanied by redistribution of these elements in the coal seam and the formation of rare metal mineralization. The redistribution occurred in the early stages of coalification with the participation of soda water. Distribution of main ore elements in the vertical section of the coal seam emphasizes their connection with the volcanogenic pyroclastic horizon and reflects the geochemical zonation due to the chemical elements migration with the participation of aqueous solutions. This is particularly evident for REE and well expressed on the chondrite- and upper continental crust normalized diagrams of the elements distribution. Several elements (Ta, Hf, and Ga) of the ore spectrum are characterized by weak migration capacity in these conditions and accumulate in or in the immediate vicinity of the volcanogenic layer. The ore substance is concentrated predominantly in finely dispersed mineral phase, represented mainly with Zr-Nb-Ti-Fe oxides, fine- grained zircon, REE carbonates (bastnesite) and phosphates (monazite, xenotime, goyazite). Some elements are found in the scattered form in organic matter. The epigenetic genesis of most minerals is clearly visible by their distribution in the coal matrix, confinedness to the pore volume, micro-veins and parts directly connected to the volcanic layer.
   The studies allow to develop a model of formation with similar mineralization in coals and to offer a set of search criteria for its discovery. The characteristic feature of such ores is the layer of volcanic pyroclastic rocks of alkaline composition, characterized by increased radioactivity. This feature allows finding such horizons with gamma-ray logging even at the preliminary stage of coal-bearing areas study. The connection of complex NB-Ta-Zr-Hf-Y-REE-Ga mineralization with volcanogenic pyroclastics of alkaline composition significantly expands the perspectives for the detection of such mineralization in the coals of East and Central Asia. The high volcanic activity of this period along with the manifestation of alkaline magmatism contributed to the formation of metal-bearing ash horizons. At the places of ashes burial in peatlands the complex rare-metal-coal deposits formed. Fragmented locations of such ores, established on a vast territory in China and Russia, give a reason to assume that a systematic study of sedimentary basins of this age can help to find a number of such deposits.

AB Thermokarst lakes are widespread and diverse across permafrost regions, and they are considered significant contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions documenting the inception and development of these ecologically important water bodies are generally limited to Pleistocene-age permafrost deposits of Siberia, Alaska, and the western Canadian Arctic. Here we present the gradual transition from syngenetic ice-wedge polygon terrain to a thermokarst lake in Holocene sediments of the eastern Canadian Arctic. We combine geomorphological surveys with paleolimnological reconstructions from sediment cores in an effort to characterize local landscape evolution from a terrestrial to freshwater environment. Located on an ice and organic-rich polygonal terrace, the studied lake is now evolving through active thermokarst, as revealed by subsiding and eroding shores, and was likely created by water pooling within a pre-existing topographic depression. Organic sedimentation in the valley started during the mid-Holocene, as documented by the oldest organic debris found at the base of one sediment core and dated at 4.8 kyr BP. Local sedimentation dynamics were initially controlled by fluctuations in wind activity, local moisture, and vegetation growth and accumulation, as shown by alternating loess (silt) and peat layers. Fossil diatom assemblages were likewise influenced by local hydro-climatic conditions and reflect a broad range of substrates available in the past (both terrestrial and aquatic). Such conditions likely prevailed until similar to 2000 BP, when peat accumulation stopped as water ponded the surface of degrading ice-wedge polygons, and the basin progressively developed into a thermokarst lake. Interestingly, this happened in the middle of the Neoglacial cooling period, likely under colder-than-present but wetter-than-average conditions. Thereafter, the lake continued to develop as evidenced by the dominance of aquatic (both benthic and planktonic) diatom taxa in organic-rich lacustrine muds. Based on these interpretations, we present a four-stage conceptual model of thermokarst lake development during the late Holocene, including some potential future trajectories. Such a model could be applied to other formerly glaciated syngenetic permafrost landscapes.

AB 1. A range of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer treatments was applied for 4 years in a randomized block experiment to a species-rich hay meadow on peat soil, within the Somerset Moors and Levels Environmentally Sensitive Area.
   2. The percentage composition of each species present was recorded in May and October each year on plots cut for hay, followed by further cuts of aftermath growth. The effects on species richness, diversity and dominance were analysed, and ordination techniques were used to investigate the effects of fertilizers on plant community composition. Data for mean annual biomass production are also presented.
   3. Botanical results were compared with those of a concurrent experiment where aftermath growth was grazed.
   4. P was more important than N in determining both biomass production and botanical change, In both cases, the effects were small when substantial amounts of N and K were applied without P, but when high rates of P were included biomass increased very significantly and species diversity was severely reduced, with Holcus lanatus, Rumex acetosa and Lolium perenne dominating.
   5. Lolium perenne was not increased by N and modest rates of P in the absence of aftermath grazing, but dominated all fertilized plots when aftermath grazing was maintained. Agrostis canina came to dominate plots receiving 200 kg ha(-1) of N with modest rates of P and K in the absence of aftermath grazing, but was negatively associated with N where the aftermath was grazed.
   6. Trifolium pratense became very abundant where P and K were applied with nil or 25 kg ha(-1) of N each year, both with and without aftermath grazing, but all legumes were suppressed at high rates of N, particularly in conjunction with high P.
   7. Substantial botanical change occurred on unfertilized plots as a result of the cessation of aftermath grazing. These plots became dominated by Plantago lanceolata, with significant increases in Leontodon hispidus and L. autumnalis.

AB Evaluate the efficiency of Populus alba clone Villafranca in the uptake and translocation of Zn from contaminated soils.
   The effects of 48 days of zinc treatment (Zn (t) ) on the growth and the photosynthetic activities of P. alba L. clone Villafranca were studied using ZnSO4 (375 ppm per unit of soil dry weight) added in sand and peat moss substrate at the beginning of the treatment (T (0)) and again after 30 days (T (1)) in order to reach a target Zn concentration of 375 ppm at T (0) and 750 ppm at T (1) per unit of soil dry weight.
   Zn uptake in the different organs was analyzed after 30 (T (1)) and 48 days (T (2)) from the beginning of treatment, showing the following order: root ae << leaves ae<yen> woody cutting = stem. The leaf area increased by 12 % in comparison to control plants at the end of second treatment (48 days). Cutting radial growth showed a high synchronicity in the growth rate fluctuation among control and Zn (t) plants, but a higher increase in radial diameter of Zn (t) cutting was observed starting from day 38 (after 8 days of second Zn (t) ) reaching after 48 days 38 % higher than control plants.
   Although our data of leaf Zn concentration were in the range usually reported as toxic for plants, Villafranca clone in Zn (t) substrate were unaffected in terms of net CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance to water vapor.

AB This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Gymnadenia conopsea (L.) R. Brown s.l. (Fragrant Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Most available information was published before recent revisions in taxonomy split what had been known as Gymnadenia conopsea into three separate species, now designated G. borealis (Druce) R.M. Bateman, Pridgeon & M.W. Chase, G. conopsea (L.) R. Brown and G. densiflora (Wahlenb.) Dietrich. Although the three newly accepted species have at least partial reproductive isolation, they have numerous morphological and ecological similarities. Some recent work still refers to G. conopsea s.l. because of difficulties in distinguishing between the species, and inertia in adoption of the new taxonomy. Wherever possible, differences between G. borealis, G. conopsea s.s. and G. densiflora are highlighted. Gymnadenia conopsea s.l. is a perennial, terrestrial orchid that is widely distributed across Eurasia. The three segregate species are all considered native. G. conopsea s.s. (Chalk Fragrant Orchid) occurs mainly in the southern half of Britain, where it is most commonly observed in dry calcareous grasslands and pastures. G. densiflora (Marsh Fragrant Orchid) occurs in damp calcareous marshes, fens and dune slacks in England and Wales; it is rare in Scotland but frequent in Ireland. G. borealis (Heath Fragrant Orchid) is mainly found on hill pastures in Wales, northern England and Scotland. The three species all avoid shade, being most abundant in open habitats. Although the three segregate species cannot always be reliably distinguished on the basis of morphological characteristics, diagnostic features include plant height, leaf width and disposition, density of flowers in the inflorescence, shape of the labellum, spur width, and odour and colour of the flowers. Additionally, several cytotypes within G. conopsea s.s. have been observed in Central Europe. These often grow in mixed-ploidy populations; in contrast, the species appears to be predominantly diploid in Britain. Gymnadenia conopsea s.l. is a non-bulbous geophyte. Leaves emerge in spring, and flowering takes place between the end of June and the beginning of August. Vegetative adult dormancy the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent years has been observed. Such dormancy rarely lasts longer than 1 year. The flowers of G. conopsea s.l. are arranged in a spike. The species is self-compatible but dependent on pollinators for successful pollination and fruit set. The most frequent pollinators are diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera. Pollinators are rewarded with abundant nectar produced within the long floral spur. In many populations, fruit set is > 90%. Although G. conopsea s.l. is widely distributed and can be locally abundant, the number of populations and size of populations in Britain have declined markedly during recent decades, mostly due to habitat destruction, ploughing of old fields and drainage. Because the distribution of the segregate species has been poorly documented, their conservation status is not well known.
   Conservation of remaining populations and restoration of degraded populations require reinstatement of appropriate management regimes (late summer/autumn mowing or grazing), combined with more detailed inventories of the three species.

AB Land use and the management of our natural resources such as soils and water offer great opportunities to sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change. Actions on forestry, soil carbon and damaged peatlands each have the potential to reduce Scottish emissions in 2020 by hundreds of thousands of tonnes. Most actions to reduce emissions from land use have beneficial effects on other ecosystem services, so if we can cut emissions we can in many circumstances improve the environment. The cost of reducing emissions through land use change can be low in relation to other means of cutting emissions. The Scottish Land Use Strategy and the Ecosystem Approach it calls for, employing the concept of ecosystem services, offers a way of balancing environmental, social and economic demands on the land. Scotland's land, soils, forests and waters are all likely to be significantly altered by future climate change. Each of these components of the land-based environment offers opportunities for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The emerging new imperatives for securing food, water and energy at a global level are equally important for Scotland, and interact with the need for environmental security and for dealing with climate change.

AB After isostatic correction for their sedimentary fill, the depths of two small oceanic basins in the southern Scotia Sea suggest that both started to open in mid to late Eocene times. Models of the short magnetic anomaly profiles across the basins provide support for these determinations. The location of the basins, adjacent to the present-day Drake Passage marine gateway, and the timing of continental stretching leading up to their opening, during the Ypresian (early Eocene) onset of global cooling, mean that their importance is potentially far greater than their small size implies. Extension in the region of the two basins would have opened Drake Passage to shallow or intermediate depth oceanic circulation between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans for the first time. This coincided with a reorganisation of vertical mixing patterns in the global ocean, a shift in the site of carbon sequestration from coal swamps and peatlands to ocean sediments, and the onset of a long decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Cenozoic global cooling may therefore have begun as a result of the shallow opening of Drake Passage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the lifetime of regional flux networks approach twenty years, there is a growing number of papers that have published long term records (5 years or more) of net carbon fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Unanswered questions from this body of work are: 1) how variable are carbon fluxes on a year to year basis?; 2) what are the biophysical factors that may cause interannual variability and/or temporal trends in carbon fluxes?; and 3) how does the biophysical control on this carbon flux variability differ by climate and ecological spaces? To address these questions, we surveyed published data from 59 sites that reported on five or more years of continuous measurements, yielding 544 site-years of data.
   We found that the standard deviation of the interannual variability in net ecosystem carbon exchange (162 gC m(-2) y(-1)) is large relative to its population mean (-200 gC m(-2) y(-1)). Broad-leaved evergreen forests and crops experienced the greatest absolute variability in interannual net carbon exchange (greater than 300 gC m(-2) y(-1)) and boreal evergreen forests and maritime wetlands were among the least variable (less than 40 gC m(-2) y(-1)).
   A disproportionate fraction of the yearly variability in net ecosystem exchange was associated with biophysical factors that modulated ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. Yet, there was appreciable and statistically significant covariance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Consequently, biophysical conditions that conspired to increase ecosystem photosynthesis to from one year to the next were associated with an increase in ecosystem respiration, and vice versa; on average, the year to year change in respiration was 40% as large as the year to year change in photosynthesis. The analysis also identified sets of ecosystems that are on the verge of switching from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. These include sites in the Arctic tundra, the evergreen forests in the Pacific northwest and some grasslands, where year to year changes in respiration are outpacing those in photosynthesis.
   While a select set of climatic and ecological factors (e.g. light, rainfall, temperature, phenology) played direct and indirect roles on this variability, their impact differed conditionally, as well as by climate and ecological spaces. For example, rainfall had both positive and negative effects. Deficient rainfall caused a physiological decline in photosynthesis in temperate and semi-arid regions. Too much rain, in the humid tropics, limited photosynthesis by limiting light. In peatlands and tundra, excess precipitation limited ecosystem respiration when it raised the water table to the surface. For deciduous forests, warmer temperatures lengthened the growing season, increasing photosynthesis, but this effect also increased soil respiration.
   Finally, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the detection limit of trends; we computed the confidence intervals of trends in multi-year carbon fluxes that need to be resolved to conclude whether the differences are to be attributed to randomness or biophysical forcings. Future studies and reports on interannual variations need to consider the role of the duration of the time series on random errors when quantifying potential trends and extreme events.

AB The assessment of carbon balance in forest soils of the Leningrad administrative area (south boreal sub-zone of east European plain) has been carried out using: (1) previous data on carbon pools of forest soils without considering mires area as initial data (organic layer plus 50 cm soil); (2) inventory data on forest stands that has been converted into biomass and data on litter input; (3) meteorological data concerning the mean monthly air temperature and precipitation. The most recent model version of soil organic matter (SOMM) dynamics was applied for a 100-year simulation of carbon dynamics in the 3.22 x 10(6) ha of forest soils of the Leningrad area considering a constant forest-age structure and climate. The results demonstrate unique carbon dynamics in various soils, and an 8% increase of the total carbon pool of the area's forest soils during the 100-year simulation (from 266 to 286 million tons of carbon). The total carbon input to the soil, in the form of litter carbon, was 8.3 million tons annually, and the carbon emission, in the form of carbon dioxide released from the soils, was 8.1 million tons annually at the end of simulation.

AB Purpose. To quantitatively evaluate thr influence of pterygium and its removal surgery on both regular and irregular corneal astigmatism, Methods. In 19 eyes of 19 patients undergoing pterygium surgery, videokeratographic measurements were taken before and 1 month after surgery. Using Fourier harmonic analysis, dioptric data on mire rings were decomposed into spherical, regular astigmatism, and irregular astigmatism (decentration and higher order irregularity) components. The distance between the line of sight and the advancing edge of pterygium was measured, and the eyes were classified into two groups: large pterygium group (the distance <2.0 mm, n = 7) and small pterygium group (greater than or equal to 2.0 mm, n = 12). Fifteen eyes of 15 subjects served as age-matched normal control eyes. Results. Before surgery, the magnitudes of regular astigmatism and higher order irregular astigmatism showed significant correlation with the size of pterygium. Regular astigmatism, asymmetry, and higher order irregularity in the large pterygium group were significantly greater than those of normal control eves. The pterygium removal surgery significantly improved these changes, but regular astigmatism and higher order irregularity in the large pterygium group still remained significantly greater than those in the normal control eves. Conclusion. Pterygium induces a significant amount of regular and irregular astigmatism in proportion to its size. The removal surgery can improve these changes, but corneal distortion does not normalize completely in eyes with advanced pterygium.

AB The amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the high Arctic is generally poorly constrained. Because of periglacial processes such as frost churning and sequestration in frozen soils, a substantial amount of SOC is typically not inventoried. This study provides a detailed study of SOC content by depth in 55 soil pits in a high Arctic ecosystem of northwest Greenland. Sampling sites spanned ecosystems from mires to polar deserts, from sea level to the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and across various periglacial features. The amount of SOC in the various ecosystems was mapped using a correlation of SOC with high-resolution ASTER satellite imagery and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) classes from the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map. On the basis of this correlation, the total carbon was extrapolated to greater areas of the high Arctic. Our study found the amount of SOC in the high Arctic has typically been grossly underestimated, remarkably by the greatest amount in the most barren environments of the polar desert. We estimate that the high Arctic contains about 12 Pg SOC, a factor of over 5 times greater the most cited values previously reported. Since our estimate was only assessed in seasonally frozen ground, additional carbon frozen in the permafrost is likely present and potentially available in the event of permafrost thawing due to warming of the Arctic.

AB The most comprehensive investigations of N and P dynamics in Great Lakes coastal wetlands have been done at Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve (OWC), whether OWC is a good general model of coastal fresh water wetlands remains to be shown. This wetland is probably a nutrient sink, storing P in sediments (at least temporarily) and releasing N by dissimilatory denitrification. Also, its biotic community transforms dissolved inorganic N and P inputs into organic dissolved and particulate outputs, thereby altering nutrient availability to Lake Erie communities. Nutrient dynamics in coastal wetlands probably differs greatly from that of inland marshes (where slow decomposition rates permit peat to accumulate as a nutrient sink) and estuaries (where high salinity alters sediment nutrient dynamics). A conceptual model specific for coastal wetlands is presented that accounts for the wide range of redox potentials encountered over the short vertical span of the shallow OWC wetland ecosystem. Future studies need to be conducted within the context of testable hypotheses generated from this model. Future investigations should focus attention on annualized nutrient budgets, sediment-water nutrient exchanges and their dependence on organic matter generated within the ecosystem.

AB Wetlands are among the most important natural resources on earth. They are the sources of cultural, economic and biological diversity. With their wealth of stored carbon, wetlands provide a potential sink for atmospheric carbon, but if not managed properly could become sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. Two important long-term uncertainties have initiated much debate in the scientific community. These are global wetland area and the amount of carbon stored in it. Compilation of relevant databases could be useful in setting up a long-term strategy for wetland conservation. It has been difficult to estimate the net carbon sequestration potential of a wetland, because the rate of decomposition of organic matter and the abundance of methanogenic micro-organisms and fluxes from the sediment are extremely complex, and there are often gaps in relevant scientific knowledge. The present discussion on density distribution of soil organic C in global wetlands could well be instrumental in formulating efficient strategies related to carbon sequestration and reduction of GHG emissions in wetland ecosystems. Effective assessment of wetlands will only take place when the available information becomes accessible and usable for all stakeholders.

AB The present area of European wetlands is only a fraction of their area before the start of large-scale human colonization of Europe. Many European wetlands have been exploited and managed for various purposes. Large wetland areas have been drained and reclaimed mainly for agriculture and establishment of human settlements. These threats to European wetlands persist. The main responses of European wetlands to ongoing climate change will vary according to wetland type and geographical location. Sea level rise will probably be the decisive factor affecting coastal wetlands, especially along the Atlantic coast. In the boreal part of Europe, increased temperatures will probably lead to increased annual evapotranspiration and lower organic matter accumulation in soil. The role of vast boreal wetlands as carbon sinks may thus be suppressed. In central and western Europe, the risk of floods may support the political will for ecosystem-unfriendly flood defence measures, which may threaten the hydrology of existing wetlands. Southern Europe will probably suffer most from water shortage, which may strengthen the competition for water resources between agriculture, industry and settlements on the one hand and nature conservancy, including wetland conservation, on the other.

AB Pisolithus tinctorius is an ectomycorrhizal fungus, edible in early stages, of great relevance in the inoculation of plants with forestal importance. Three strains of fungus were isolated from fruit bodies collected in tropical eucalyptus and pine forest plantations. An in vitro characterization of these strains was carried out on three solid media at 28 degrees C. Mycelial growth in modified Melin Norkrans (MNM) liquid medium and on a vermiculite-peat mixture was assessed for all strains. In all cases, assessments were conducted at pH 4.7 and 5.7. In solid medium, greater growth in diameter and increase in biomass were observed on potato-dextrose-agar and MNM than on malt extract. The greatest increases in biomass in liquid culture medium were recorded for the strain from Oaxaca at pH 5.7. In the liquid culture, darkening of the original color of the medium was observed, as revealed by an analysis of absorbance in a mass spectrometer. Also, a morphological characterization of ectomycorrhiza synthesized with Eucalyptus urophylla and Pinus greggii was made. Because of variations in growth of the EMC fungi under different culture conditions, the characterization of ECM strains is compulsory before commercial scale production of ECM inoculum to be used in forest nurseries.

AB Micropropagated banana plantlets represent a good planting material to establish new growing areas or replace old plantations. The plantlets are devoid of pathogens but also of beneficial root inhabitants (e.g., endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]) that may help plants withstand stresses. Mycorrhization of banana is usually conducted at the hardening/post-hardening phases. Only a few studies have reported their application in vitro, and none have investigated the subsequent impact on ex vitro acclimatization. Here, we report for the first time the effects of in vitro mycorrhization of banana plantlets on growth following transfer to soil. Banana plantlets were pre-mycorrhized under autotrophic conditions. During in vitro culture, heavy root colonization of the banana plantlets was observed. At 5 and 7 wk after transfer to a peat-sand soil substrate, the root system remained highly colonized. The growth (pseudostem height) and biomass were significantly higher than those of control plants grown on media without AMF. The mean shoot dry weight of the pre-mycorrhized plants at 5 wk after transplanting was 66.7 and 34.6% greater than those of non-mycorrhized plantlets grown on modified Strullu-Romand (MSR) and Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, respectively, and was also greater at week 7 (by 64.7 and 40%, respectively). In vitro mycorrhization under autotrophic culture conditions thus represents a promising tool for the pre-adaptation of micropropagated banana plantlets to ex vitro conditions.

AB Coastal lowlands of northeastern Siberia are composed of the Pleistocene ice-rich organic-containing loamy sediments of the Ice Complex (yedoma) and products of their transformation in the Holocene. In the tundra zone, three major trends of modern pedogenesis depending on the geomorphic position and age of particular landforms have been identified. On the interfluves affected by thermokarst processes in the Holocene, somewhat elevated remains of the Late Pleistocene Ice Complex alternate with vast thermokarst depressions (alases) with lakes. Cryozems are developed in automorphic plain positions and on the upper parts of slopes. The profiles of these soils are strongly affected by cycles of frost boiling and cryoturbation; under their influence, specific suprapermafrost accumulative organomineral horizons are formed. Gleyzation predominates in the soils of the low- and middle-level Holocene terraces of alases. Peat accumulation is progressively developed in the bottoms of alas depressions.

AB The distribution of REEs and rare metals in the Paleocene and Lower-Middle Miocene brown coals of the Zeya-Bureya Basin is analyzed. The migration of minor elements on the NW flank of the basin (the Sergeevskoe deposit), in the mode of the static state of orogens in the Paleocene and Miocene, in the course of active expansion of the sedimentation area occurred with uniform development of denudation plains and with the steady processes of peat accumulation. The high dynamic activity of the region on the SE margin of the Zeya-Bureya Basin (the Yerkovetskoe deposit) provided contrasting forms of coupling in the flexure-uplift system and an uneven character of localization of ore components. It is shown that coals of the Sergeevskoye deposit are enriched in Be, Sc, V, Ga, Rb, Nb, Ta, and REE + Y and may be considered as a promising complex rare-metal raw material.

AB The organic rich sediments (coals and coaly shales) record particular events in the delta plain sedimentation history. Reconstructing their depositional environment gives palaeoecological and sedimentological information permitting the use of these coals and shales as regional isochronous markers.
   There is a wide variety of diagrams used for reconstructing the depositional settings of coals and coaly shares. They all are based on two types of petrographic analysis, rarely used in combination: maceral and microlithotype analyses.
   This synthesis work is based on a large number of combined analyses (575 samples) and takes into account the sedimentologic and sequential context. We propose an updating of the most commonly used diagrams, as well as the guides to their interpretation and give the example of a regional study of the Brent Group fluvial-deltaic series (Mid Jurassic, North Sea).

AB Quantifying the contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to C sequestration in soils requires knowledge about extent and rate of its biodegradation. Since degradation experiments are time consuming, estimating the biodegradability of DOM by more easily measurable properties seems valuable. Our goal was therefore to investigate the biodegradation of DOM of different origin and to relate its extent and rate to properties such as UV absorbance, synchronous and emission scan fluorescence, XAD-8 sorption chromatography and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. We extracted DOM from 13 different samples (maize straw, forest floors, peats, agricultural soils) and carried out a 90-day liquid incubation experiment. DOM biodegradation was quantified by CO(2) evolution. Rapidly and slowly mineralizable portions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a measure of labile and stable DOC and the respective mineralization rate constants and half-lives were calculated by a double exponential model. The extent and rate of DOM biodegradation from less humified organic material (straw, litter and fermentation layers of forest floors) were high resulting in 61-93% of DOC being mineralized. The labile fraction comprised 59-88% of total DOC. DOM extracted from agricultural soils was of an intermediate biodegradability with a CO(2) evolution comprising 17-32% of total DOC. Labile DOC represented 14-25% of total DOC. DOM extracted from peats and Oa forest floor layers was relatively stable (mineralization of 4-9% of total DOC, labile DOC: 3-6%). The half-life of the labile DOC pool was short (2-5 days), whereas that of the stable DOC pool ranged from 0.2 years (DOM from less humified material) to 8.6 years (DOM from the Oa layer under spruce). Extent and rate of DOM biodegradation were closely but nonlinearly related to DOM properties. Solutions exceeding a threshold value of UV absorbance, aromaticity, XAD-8 adsorbable C or of humification indices derived from fluorescence spectra or having carbohydrate contents below a certain level were stable against biodegradation. Relatively simple methods like UV spectroscopy, XAD-8 fractionation and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were suitable to estimate the biodegradation of DOM.

AB In this study, pine needles were converted to biochar (BC) at different pyrolysis temperatures of 300, 500, and 700 degrees C to sorb trichloroethylene (TCE), and the changes in BC properties with each temperature were evaluated. Pyrolysis temperature showed a pronounced effect on BC properties. Decreases in molar H/C and O/C ratios resulted from removing O- and H-containing functional groups with increasing temperature, and produced high aromaticity and low polarity BCs. BCs produced at higher temperature showed greater TCE removal efficiency from water due to their high surface area, micro-porosity, and carbonized extent. The performance of various BCs for TCE removal was assessed by the Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption models, among which the Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich models best described TCE adsorption onto various BCs, indicating prevailing sorption mechanism as pore-filling.

AB Small spherical structures commonly termed sporocarps are widespread elements in Carboniferous permineralized peat. While sporocarps today are generally interpreted as fungal, their precise systematic affinities largely remain unknown. A specimen of the sporocarp-type Traquairia from the Lower Coal Measures (Lower Pennsylvanian) of Great Britain demonstrates a heretofore unknown feature in the form of a preformed aperture from which emerges a fascicle of radially oriented structures that are constricted sub-distally: transverse septa are present in the constricted areas of some of the structures. The outgrowths are morphologically similar to conidiophores bearing terminal conidia of certain extant fungi in the order Entomophthorales, and thus might suggest affinities of Traquairia with the Zygomycota. Alternatively, the outgrowths might represent sporulating hyphae of a parasitic or saprotrophic blastocladalean fungus or a peronosporomycete that used Traquairia as a nutrient source.

AB The study of six bulk coal samples from the Early Permian Vryheid Formation of the Karoo Basin, South Africa has revealed the importance of wildfire in this coal-forming environment. Inertinite is a major constituent of these coals and was predominantly produced by wildfire. The accumulation of the peat in this setting was both autochthonous and hypautochthonous/allochthonous, conditions varying between the occurrence of standing water and desiccation. Woody gymnosperms and also lycopods were important components of the coal swamp vegetation, of which the diversity and abundance of the lycopods may be tentatively assessed by the distribution of megaspores in the coals. Consistent with lycopod reproductive strategy, these megaspores are more abundant and diverse where the vitrinite content is greater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of maceral and mineral content and huminite reflectance for the Rosebud coal at the Absaloka, Big Sky, and Rosebud mines provides information on the variation of coal composition and rank probably caused by variation in depositional environments and coalification. Huminite reflectance indicates that rank is gradational from lignite at the Absaloka and Rosebud mines to subbituminous C at the Big Sky mine. Amounts of minerals and huminite, inertinite, and liptinite group macerals vary vertically at Absaloka and Big Sky, defining lithologic layers and suggesting changes in type and style of peat accumulation. Direct correlation of huminite reflectance with huminite abundance and inverse correlation with inertinite abundance suggests a possible relationship with coalification, depositional environment, and/or original floral characters. Depositional environment is initially interpreted as a swamp with mixed vegetation, or a swamp alternating from arboreal to herbaceous vegetation.

AB Twenty-one samples of sub-bituminous coal and 1 sample of coaly shale have been collected from different coal seams, representing the Cenozoic coal basins widely distributed in the region of Primorye and Sakhalin (Russia), and NE China (Hunchun deposit). The seams belong to lower Miocene-upper Oligocene (Sineutesovsky), Oligocene-upper Eocene (Pavlovsky), upper Eocene (Ust-Davydovsky), lower Eocene (Uglovsky), and upper Paleocene (Kivdinsky) local chronostratigraphic units.
   Terpenoid biomarker compositions indicate the contribution of conifers and angiosperms to peat formation. The results are in agreement with paleobotanical data from sedimentary successions closely associated with the seams, highlighting abundant conifers of the taxodioid Cupressaceae and Pinaceae families, as well as Betula, Alnus, Fagus, and Ulmus during Cenozoic in the Far East. In contrast to previous findings about changes in peat-forming vegetation in central Europe, the terpenoid biomarker ratios revealed increased contributions of angiosperms during the Oligocene and gymnosperm domination during Eocene and Miocene. The different evolution may be related to differences in temperature and precipitation distribution, as well as in geomorphology and landscape evolution.
   A positive relationship between the di-/(di- + tri-)-terpenoid biomarker ratios and delta C-13 of Oligocene samples indicates the role of varying gymnosperm/angiosperm influences on the delta C-13 of coal. Differences in vegetation and climate are most probably responsible for the different trends in delta C-13 of terpenoid biomarkers over the Cenozoic, beside their general variation coupled to the evolution in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2.
   Lower delta H-2 values of plant-derived lipids during the Oligocene were most probably caused by lower temperatures during coal formation. This conclusion is supported by the results of recent paleobotanical studies, yielding lower mean annual temperatures (MAT) during the Oligocene but comparable values for mean annual precipitation (MAP) during the Eocene and Oligocene in the Primorye region. Pimarane-type diterpenoids are significantly depleted in H-2. The results are in agreement with previous studies identifying different sources of hydrogen and/or different biosynthetic pathways during their formation.

AB China is, and in the coming decades should continue to be, the largest producer and user of coal in the world. The high volume of coal usage in China has focused attention not only on the toxic trace elements that may be released from coal combustion but also on the valuable elements that may occur in the coal and associated ash. Valuable elements in several coals (or coal ashes) and some coal-bearing strata in China (e.g. Ge, Ga, U, rare earth elements and Y, Nb, Zr, Se, V, Re, Au, and Ag, as well as the base metal Al) occur at concentrations comparable to or even higher than those in conventional economic deposits. Several factors are responsible for these elevated concentrations: (1) injection of exfiltrational solutions during peat accumulation or as part of later epigenetic activity; (2) injection of infiltrational epigenetic solutions; (3) introduction of syngenetic alkali volcanic ashes into the peat-forming environment or into associated non-coal-forming terrestrial environments; (4) input of terrigenous materials into the coal-forming environment; (5) leaching of non-coal partings by groundwater/hydrothermal solutions; and (6) mixed processes involving both hydrothermal solutions and volcanic ash. The valuable elements in Chinese coals may be associated with either the organic matter or mineral matter, or have a mixed organic- and inorganic-affinity. For example, the Ge and U in coal-hosted ore deposits dominantly occur in the organic matter, with only traces of U-bearing minerals being present; gallium mainly occurs in boehmite and kaolinite, and to a lesser extent, in the organic matter. Rare earth elements and Y occur as carbonate-minerals (e.g. florencite, parisite), phosphate-minerals (e.g. rhabdophane, silico-rhabdophane, and xenotime), and in part are associated with the organic matter. Some metals (e.g. Ge, Al, Ga) have been successfully extracted at an industrial scale from Chinese coals, and others have significant potential for such extraction. Major challenges remaining for coal scientists include the development of economic extraction methods from coal ash, and the control of toxic elements released during the metal extraction process to protect human health and to avoid environmental pollution.

AB This paper presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of the climate change in Caotanhu wetland using pollen, phytolith and charcoal records, and the data of loss of ignition (LOI), grain size analysis, and susceptibility. Results reveal that between 4550 and 2500 cal. a BP, a dry climatic condition was not favorable for the accumulation of peat. Since 2500 cal. a BP, the climate became humid and the wetland developed with abundant freshwater aquatic plants, which contributed to peat accumulation. Nevertheless, alternate periods of rain and dry climate occurred during that period. Between 2500 and 1810 cal. a BP (550 BC-140 AD), the climate was more humid than at present. A lot of emerged plants, such as Phragmites, Typha and Sparganium, and freshwater green algae grew in the wetland which was surrounded by desert-steppe vegetation composed mainly of Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia, Compositae and Thalictrum. However, from 1810 to 1160 cal. a BP (140-790 AD), the water level started to decrease and hydrophyte species reduced greatly, but some Phragmites still grew in the wetland and around it was desert vegetation with high proportion of Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia. Then from 1160 to 650 a BP (790-1300 AD), it entered a period of desert-steppe with abundant mesic and xerophytic plants. And a lot of aquatic plants prevailed in the wetland. Here, what is noticeable is that percentages of arboreal pollen, consisting mainly of Betula and Picea, increased greatly and reached a maximal value of 27.2%, in which, Betula percentages rose to 23.2%. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that Betula grew in the highland of the wetland, or Picea timberline shifted downward resulting in the increase of percentages of Betula and Picea pollen, which were transported into the wetland by flood or wind. But since 650 cal. a BP, desert vegetation prevailed around the wetland again with dominant Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia, and the climate was similar to modern one. Despite some aquatic plants still growing in the wetland at that time, their amounts diminished greatly.

AB Modern deltas are understood to have initiated around 7.5-9 ka in response to the deceleration of sea-level rise. This episode of delta initiation is closely related to the last deglacial meltwater events and eustatic sea-level rises. The initial stage or the Mekong River delta, one of the world's largest deltas, is well recorded in Cambodian lowland sediments. This paper integrates analyses of sedimentary facies, diatom assemblages, and radiocarbon dates for three drill cores from the lowland to demonstrate Holocene sedimentary evolution in relation to sea-level changes. The cores are characterized by a tripartite succession: (1) aggrading flood plain to natural levee and tidal-fluvial channel during the postglacial sea-level rise (10-8.4 ka); (2) aggrading to prograding tidal flats and mangrove forests around and after the maximum flooding of the sea (8.4-6.3 ka); and (3) a prograding fluvial system on the delta plain (6.3 ka to the present). The maximum flooding of the sea occurred at 8.0 + 0.1 ka. 2000 years before the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand, and tidal flats penetrated up to 20-50 km Southeast of Phnom Penh after a period of abrupt similar to 5 m sea-level rise at 8.5-8.4 ka. The delta progradation then initiated as a result of the sea-level stillstand at around 8-7.5 ka. Another rapid sea-level rise at 7.5-7 ka allowed thick mangrove peat to be widely deposited in the Cambodian lowland, and the peat accumulation endured until 6.3 ka. Since 6.3 ka, a fluvial system has characterized the delta plain, and the fluvial sediment discharge has contributed to rapid delta progradation. The uppermost part of the sedimentary succession, composed of flood plain to natural-levee sediments, reveals a sudden increase in sediment accumulation over the past 600-1000 years. This increase might reflect an increase in the sediment yield due to human activities in the upper to middle reaches of the Mekong, as with other Asian rivers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Holocene history of Lagoa Grande (1360m a.s.l; northwest Spain) has been investigated through the analyses of diatom remains found in a sediment core. Changes in the lake have been interpreted in terms both of climatic variability and major changes in the catchment area. The diatom record begins at about 9800 yr BP and exhibits three marked changes at 8200, 6000, 4200 and at 2600 yr BP, which are interpreted as responses to climatic changes detected by marine and other terrestrial palaeoclimatic records. The initial lake was shallow and Aulacoseira species characteristic of acidic and oligotrophic waters were dominant. The early Holocene is characterised by the presence of Aulacoseira ambigua, which suggests an increase in water depth and nutrient levels. Throughout the Holocene, diatom assemblages underwent several changes linked to fluctuating limnological conditions. These changes in lake characteristics coincide with the regional succession of vegetation, suggesting that climate forcing initiated these limnological changes. During the last 2000 years catchment processes appear to be the major factor controlling lake characteristics in Lagoa Grande site. Diatom responses reflected the progressive peatland development and growth of littoral vegetation in the lake, and not only a change in the regional environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Methods to estimate soil carbon stocks and changes in Northern Ireland in relation to land cover change over the periods 1939-2000, 1939-1990 and 1990-2000 are described. Land cover for 1939 was derived from the Land Utilisation Survey and for 1990 and 2000 frorn interpretation of satellite imagery. Although in 1939 there was more mixed farming than at present, with a reduction of almost 60% in arable land, there has been little change in soil carbon stock (385.9 Mt in 1939, 385.43 Mt in 2000). In recent years the rate of carbon loss appears to have increased partly through greater suburbanization. However, more local field data on carbon densities of peat, of mineral soils under different cover types and after land-cover change, are required to support further iterations of the study.

AB In this study, three pentachlorophenol (PCP) laboratory-spiked and one field-contaminated soil were amended with 2.0% char, humic acid (HA) and peat, respectively. The amended soils were aged for either 7 or 250 days. After amendment, CaCl2 extractability of PCP was significantly decreased. Desorption kinetics indicated that the proposed amendment could lead to a strong binding and slow desorption of PCP in soils. Amendment with char reduced the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of PCP most significantly for earthworms (Eisenia fetida) in all soils studied. The results of both physicochemical and biological tests suggested that amendment reduced PCP bioavailability quickly and enduringly, implying that carbonaceous material amendment, especially char amendment, was a potentially attractive in situ remediation method for sequestration of PCP in contaminated soil.

AB The Obed-Marsh coal deposit is of Late paleocene age, and contains over 200 million tons of subbituminous-B to high-volatile bituminous-C coal.
   Petrographic analysis of three sections from seams 1 and 2 reveals high amounts of huminite and relatively low amounts of liptinite and inertinite, with the exception of some intervals in both seams.  The persistent high ratio of huminite to liptinite and inertinite indicates a relatively reducing environment, a feature also expressed by the relatively low inertinite content.  Examination of the in-seam profiles also indicates undisturbed peat accumulation over long periods of time.
   The Obed coals, similar in rank and composition to the Hat Creek coals of British Columbia, formed in a freshwater environment and can be used as feedstock for combustion/gasification.  Furthermore, the intervals rich in liptinite and petroleum-like substances may be utilized for liquefaction (hydrogenation).

AB Increased resource supply commonly facilitates invasion by exotic plants, raising concerns over atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition; fast-growing annual invaders may have exceptional abilities to outperform native perennials in response to N pulses. However, it remains unclear whether this advantage is due to growth differences or to shifts in competitive outcomes, and whether annual invaders are favored by N deposition in their introduced range over native range. We conducted an experiment to compare the growth and competitive ability of Bromus tectorum and its native perennial grasses either at three different N regimes or between China and North America. The soil used in this experiment was from mountain grasslands as a neutral growth medium. The total biomass of three natives from China and North America did not increase along the N deposition gradient. Nitrogen addition enhanced the growth of North American B. tectorum instead of Chinese B. tectorum. Nitrogen addition increased the competitive ability of B. tectorum, but had no effect on that of natives. North American B. tectorum was bigger and had greater competitive ability and root weight ratio than Chinese B. tectorum. In contrast, North American natives were less competitive than Chinese natives. There was a significantly positive correlation between the growth of B. tectorum grown alone and its competitive ability. These findings suggest that N deposition may enhance the B. tectorum invasion through disproportionally increasing the growth and maintaining inherent competitive advantages of North American B. tectorum, further increasing threats to introduced ranges. There were differences in the growth and competitive ability of B. tectorum and natives between China and North America, which explains why B. tectorum is a minor component at home and becomes a successful invader abroad.

AB Shifts in moss communities may affect the resilience of boreal ecosystems to a changing climate because of the role of moss species in regulating soil climate and biogeochemical cycling. Here, we use long-term data analysis and literature synthesis to examine the role of moss in ecosystem succession, productivity, and decomposition. In Alaskan forests, moss abundance showed a unimodal distribution with time since fire, peaking 30-70 years post-fire. We found no evidence of mosses compensating for low vascular productivity in low-fertility sites at large scales, although a trade-off between moss and vascular productivity was evident in intermediate-productivity sites. Mosses contributed 48% and 20% of wetland and upland productivity, respectively, but produced tissue that decomposed more slowly than both nonwoody and woody vascular tissues. Increasing fire frequency in Alaska is likely to favor feather moss proliferation and decrease Sphagnum abundance, which will reduce soil moisture retention and decrease peat accumulation, likely leading to deeper burning during wildfire and accelerated permafrost thaw. The roles of moss traits in regulating key aspects of boreal performance (ecosystem N supply, C sequestration, permafrost stability, and fire severity) represent critical areas for understanding the resilience of Alaska's boreal forest region under changing climate and disturbance regimes.

AB Detailed carbon budgets from 2008 to 2010 were created for two 1-ha flow-through riverine wetlands created in 1994 adjacent to a third-order stream in central Ohio. Measurements were taken of dissolved non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOM), and coarse particulate organic carbon (CPOM). Methane emissions, soil sequestration, aquatic primary productivity, and macrophyte aboveground net primary productivity were also included in the carbon budget. The carbon budget successfully balanced inputs (1838 +/- 41 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and export/sequestration (1846 +/- 59 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with only a 0.5 % over estimation of export in relation to input; 12.8 % of the inflow was sequestered into the wetland soil. FPOM and CPOM concentrations and exports were positively correlated with hydrologic flow under most circumstances; NPOC and DIC concentrations were usually negatively or poorly correlated with hydrologic flow. In all seasons, except winter, the change of total carbon (NPOC, DIC, FPOM, and CPOM) concentration between inflow and outflow increased with increased hydrologic flow. Although carbon concentrations increased from inflow to outflow, the total surface water export of carbon is less than the inflow due to groundwater recharge from these perched wetlands.

AB Phytoremediation is a promising technology for cleaning soil and water from toxic heavy metals. It is known that humic substances possess the capability of increasing the intensity of metal absorption by plants. In this connection, the effect of humic preparation from peat on the accumulation of lead by wheat plants was studied for lead nitrate concentrations increasing up to 500 mu M / l in a model vegetation experiment in aquatic culture. A significant increase in the accumulation of lead in wheat shoots (above 1000 mg / kg) was established under the progressive action of lead nitrate in comparison with the pronounced effect, indicating the possibility of using wheat as a phytoremediant. Humic preparation strengthened the phytoremediation properties of wheat, estimated by the coefficient of biological absorption: up to 5.4 times with a pronounced effect and up to 2.6 times at a gradual level, which confirms the possibility of using humic substances as phytoextraction effector.

AB The physical and chemical properties of ten organic (i.e., five types of wood mulch, two types of compost, peat, sludge, and soil) and one inorganic (i.e., activated carbon) biofilter media were evaluated. The density, porosity, pH, total carbon, total nitrogen, organic matter content, particle size distribution, and airflow resistance of each medium and their mixtures were tested by using standard methods. Airflow resistance of each medium was tested in a 1.0 m x 0.6 m x 0.6 m (L x W x H) testing chamber, and the results were fitted into a standard equation. It was observed that particle size, moisture content, compaction, and bed thickness of media have significant effects on airflow resistance. Based on these results, an empirical "de-rating" modification was developed to improve the equation used to predict pressure drop across biofilters. This research aims to provide a useful database of widely used media for biofilter design.

AB The mineralogy and geochemistry of a superhigh-organic-sulfur (SHOS) coal of Late Permian age from the Yanshan Coalfield, Yunnan Province, southwestern China, have been studied using optical microscope, low-temperature ashing plus X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, a sequential chemical extraction procedure, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The M9 Coal from the Yanshan Coalfield is a SHOS coal that has a total sulfur content of 10.12%-11.30% and an organic sulfur content of 8.77%-10.30%. The minerals in the coal consist mainly of high-temperature quartz, sanidine, albite, muscovite, illite, pyrite, and trace amounts of kaolinite, plagioclase, akermanite, rutile, and dawsonite. As compared with ordinary worldwide (bituminous coals and anthracite) and Chinese coals, the M9 Coal is remarkably enriched in B (268 mu g/g), F (841 mu g/g), V (567 mu g/g), Cr (329 mu g/g), Ni (73.9 mu g/g). Mo (204 mu g/g), and U (153 mu g/g). In addition, elements including Se (25.2 mu g/g). Zr (262 mu g/g), Nb (20.1 mu g/g), Cd (2.07 mu g/g), and TI (2.03 mu g/g) are also enriched in the coal. Occurrence of high-temperature quartz, sanidine, muscovite, and illite in the M9 Coal is evidence that there is a volcanic ash component in the coal that was derived from acid volcanic ashes fallen into the swamp during peat accumulation. Occurrence of albite and dawsonite in the coal and strong enrichment of some elements, including F, S, V, Cr, Ni, Mo and U, are attributed to the influence by submarine exhalation which invaded along with seawater into the anoxic peat swamp. Abundances of lithophile elements, including rare earth elements, Nb, Y, Zr, and TiO2, indicate that the silicate minerals in the coal were derived from the northern Vietnam Upland to the south of the basin.

   FUTURE; FLUXES; SOILS; SEA
AB Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects (sometimes referred to as "Blue Carbon"), through preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane (CH4) and CO2 emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given that GHG emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of an equal quantity of fossil fuel GHG. Thus, as a landuse-based climate change intervention, reducing CH4 emissions is an entirely distinct concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.

AB The refractive status of the posterior corneal surface has not been well studied. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the regular and irregular astigmatism of the posterior corneal surface. In 50 normal human eyes, topography of the anterior and posterior corneal surface was measured with the scanning-slit videokeratoscope. Using Fourier series harmonic analysis, dioptric data on a mire ring were decomposed into spherical component, regular astigmatism, asymmetry (tilt or decentration), and higher order irregularity, The obtained values for the central 3.0 mm of the posterior corneal surface were -6.55+/-0.32 D (spherical component), 0.18+/-0.16 D (regular astigmatism), 0.40+/-0.22 D (asymmetry), and 0.02 +/- 0.02 D (higher order irregularity). The posterior to anterior ratios of these parameters were 13.6 +/- 0.6%, 35.0 +/- 41.3%, 45.8 +/- 56.9%, and 39.9 +/- 39.8%, respectively. The ratio of the spherical component was significantly lower than the other three parameters (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating that non-spherical components (regular and irregular astigmatism) of the posterior corneal surface are not negligible in the optical quality of the cornea. The current results can serve as the control data and reference for the future clinical studies of optical characteristics of the cornea as a whole. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Three stages of deposition are distinguished in thermokarst-lake-basin sequences in ice-rich permafrost of the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, western arctic Canada: (1) widespread retrogressive thaw slumping around lake margins that rapidly transports upland sediments into thermokarst lakes, forming a distinctive basal unit of impure sand and/or diamicton; (2) a reduction or cessation of slumping-because of the pinching out of adjacent ground ice, slump stabilization or climatic cooling, that reduces the input of elastic sediment, permitting reworking of sediment around lake margins and suspension settling, principally in basin centres; (3) lakes drain and deposition may continue by gelifluction and accumulation of in situ peat or aeolian sand.
   Radiocarbon dating of detrital peat and wood from a progradational sequence (basal unit) defines a lateral younging trend in the direction of progradation. A progradation rate is calculated to be similar to 4 cm yr(-1), consistent with rapid deposition during stage (1) above. The nonuniform nature of the bend is attributed to episodic influxes of old organic material by slumping and reworking by waves and currents.
   In comparison with thermokarst-lake-basin sequences previously described in Alaska, Canada and Siberia, the middle unit of those in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands is similar, whereas the basal unit is generally thicker and, by contrast, often contains diamicton. These differences are attributed, respectively, to larger-scale resedimentation of upland sediments by retrogressive thaw slumping and debris-flow deposition in thermokarst lakes in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands. Compared with the sediments within supraglacial lakes in areas of moderate to high relief, the middle unit of thermokarst-lake-basin sequences in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands lacks elastic varves and the basal unit is much thinner and texturally less variable. These differences are attributed to higher relief and larger volumes of meltwater and glacigenic sediment in supraglacial lakes, which promote more suspension settling and resedimentation of glacigenic sediment than in thermokarst lakes in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands.
   It may be impossible to distinguish glacial and periglacial thermokarst-lake-basin sediments in permafrost areas of incomplete deglaciation. Not only is it often difficult to distinguish intrasedimental and buried glacier ice, but the depositional processes associated with thaw of both ice types are presumably the same and the host sediments very similar.

AB The Holocene sedimentary record in southeastern Australia is present in a range of landscape settings, such as upland swamps (dells). internally drained lake basins, alluvial fans, and mid-catchment and lowland floodplains. An assessment of the best-constrained basal radiocarbon dates in valley-fill locations between 30 and 42 degrees S and upstream of last-glacial eustatic influences yields an intriguing pattern. The record for fluvial sites with catchment areas >30 km(2) exhibits a distinct gap in the alluvial record between 8 and 4ka BP (10-4.5 ka). In contrast, data for eleven upland-swamp sites with catchment areas <50 km(2) exhibit a broader spectrum of basal ages. albeit with some reduction of activity during the alluvial gap. We suggest that the period 8-4 ka BP in the sedimentary record at the fluvial sites reflects the early tc mid-Holocene climatic optimum independently recognized in proxy climate data in the region. It was a period of enhanced water discharges, stable well-vegetated catchments and low sediment yields, and therefore greatly limited sediment sequestration, and it has been termed the Nambucca Phase. In upland swamps, however. threshold-driven processes produce an episodic landscape responses during much of the Holocene. Contrasting results in upland compared with middle and lower basin locations demonstrate the non-uniform landscape response to climatic changes during the Holocene in southeastern Australia.

TI Carbon cycle dynamics during episodes of rapid climate change
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Past climate records reveal many instances of rapid climate change that are often coincident with fast changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, suggesting links and positive feedbacks between the carbon cycle and the physical climate system. The carbon reservoirs that might have played an important role during these past episodes of rapid change include near-surface soil and peatland carbon, permafrost, carbon stored in vegetation, methane hydrates in deep-sea sediments, volcanism, and carbon stored in parts of the ocean that are easily ventilated through changes in circulation. To determine whether similar changes might lie in store in our future, we must gain a better understanding of the physics, biogeochemistry, dynamics, and feedbacks involved in such events. Specifically, we need to ascertain the main natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane linked to rapid climate events in the paleoclimate record, and understand the mechanisms, triggers, thresholds, and feedbacks that were involved. Our review contributes to this focus issue by synthesizing results from nine studies covering a broad range of past time episodes. Studies are categorized into (a) episodes of massive carbon release millions of years ago; (b) the transition from the last glacial to the current interglacial 19 000-11 000 years ago; and (c) the current era. We conclude with a discussion on major remaining research challenges and implications for future projections and risk assessment.

AB Tussock-forming plants are globally widespread and enhance ecosystem services. We hypothesized that tussocks of Carex stricta store carbon (C) in addition to enhancing microtopography and biodiversity. We characterized tussock size, composition, and carbon pools associated with three undisturbed C. stricta-dominated tussock meadows in the Upper Midwest, USA. Remnant meadow tussocks were tall (17.2 cm), voluminous (4,113 cm(3)), and largely organic (95 %), indicating their ability to accumulate organic matter and store carbon. Tussocks were the second largest C pool (next to soil) in these ecosystems; they comprised 41-62 % of total biomass C. Using bomb C-14 dating, we estimated that reference-site tussocks were over 50 years old. Their long-term persistence is consistent with lower leaf decomposition rates on tussocks (k = 0.26 years(-1)) than in tussock interspaces (k = 0.39 years(-1)). An urban tussock meadow had tussocks that were shorter than those of remnant sites, but less dense than a restored meadow. The restored meadow (a parts per thousand currency sign15 years) had smaller, structurally distinct tussocks that stored less C. Among the five sites, C stocks were lowest in the urban and restored meadows, supporting the need to conserve existing C stores in remnant meadows and to restore tussock sedge for multiple ecosystem services.

AB Temporal trends in inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) export in the stream water between 1979 and 2006 were studied in eight forested headwater catchments in eastern Finland, where an increasing air-temperature trend and a decreasing N-deposition trend has been observed since the 1980s. The Seasonal Kendall test was conducted to study if the stream water N concentrations have changed concurrently and a mixed model regression analysis was used to study which catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological variables were related to the variation in stream water N. The annual concentrations of total organic N (TON) increased at two catchments and the concentrations of nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) decreased at three and four catchments, respectively. The main factor explaining variation in concentrations and export of N was percentage of peatlands in a catchment. The NH4-N concentrations were also related to the N deposition, and the exports of NO3, NH4, and TON to precipitation. Quantitative changes in both the N concentrations and exports were small. The results suggested relatively small changes in the N concentrations and exports between 1979 and 2006, most probably because the effects of increased air and stream water temperatures largely have been concealed behind the concurrent decrease in N deposition.

AB We examined opportunities for avoided loss of wetland carbon stocks in the Great Plains of the United States in the context of future agricultural expansion through analysis of land-use land-cover (LULC) change scenarios, baseline carbon datasets and biogeochemical model outputs. A wetland map that classifies wetlands according to carbon pools was created to describe future patterns of carbon loss and potential carbon savings. Wetland avoided loss scenarios, superimposed upon LULC change scenarios, quantified carbon stocks preserved under criteria of carbon densities or land value plus cropland suitability. Up to 3420 km(2) of wetlands may be lost in the region by 2050, mainly due to conversion of herbaceous wetlands in the Temperate Prairies where soil organic carbon (SOC) is highest. SOC loss would be approximately 0.20 +/- 0.15 megagrams of carbon per hectare per year (MgC ha(-1) yr(-1)), depending upon tillage practices on converted wetlands, and total ecosystem carbon loss in woody wetlands would be approximately 0.81 +/- 0.41 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1), based on biogeochemical model results. Among wetlands vulnerable to conversion, wetlands in the Northern Glaciated Plains and Lake Agassiz Plains ecoregions exhibit very high mean SOC and on average, relatively low land values, potentially creating economically competitive opportunities for avoided carbon loss. This mitigation scenarios approach may be adapted by managers using their own preferred criteria to select sites that best meet their objectives. Results can help prioritize field-based assessments, where site-level investigations of carbon stocks, land value, and consideration of local priorities for climate change mitigation programs are needed.

AB The intensive human impact on the environment leads to a significant change in the components of landscapes, in general, as well as the soil cover in particular. Currently, areas with undisturbed soils are mainly preserved within specially protected natural areas. The characteristics of reference soils serve as a starting point for environmental monitoring. One of these objects is Polistovsky Reserve in Pskov region, created to protect the upper marshes. On the territory of the reserve among the wetlands, unique landscapes are present, i.e. mineral islands, formed by postglacial morainic deposits, not buried under a layer of peat, on which soils, that are unusual for the given terrain, developed under mixed forests. Automorphic soils, formed within the boundaries of these isolated formations, remain poorly understood. The relevance of the presented research is due to the importance of mineral island soils as one of the key components of the natural systems of the Polistovo-Lovatsky bog massif. Data on the composition and properties of autonomous soils can be used in the planning of environmental protection measures, as well as to predict their stability in the intensification of anthropogenic impact. The aim of this research is to identify accumulation and distribution of total content and mobile forms of Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb in various types of automorphic soils in Polistovsky State Nature Reserve.
   The automorphic soils of Polistovsky Reserve (57 degrees 10'N, 30 degrees 30'E), formed within the mineral islands, were investigated: Eutric Cambisol, Haplic Luvisol, Rendzic Leptosol and Rubic Arenosol (See Fig. 1). We studied soils using profile and genetic methods based on the Classification and Diagnostics of Russian Soils (Shishov LL et al., 2004). International names are given according to the World Reference Base of Soil Resources, version 2015 (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). The following soil properties were determined: particle size fractions by pipet analysis (Katschinski NA, 1956, Burt R, 2011), organic carbon content by bichromate oxidation method according to IV Tyurin, exchangeable bases by complexometric method, cation exchange capacity by ammonium acetate method, KCl pH and pH of aqueous suspension by potentiometric method (Vorobeva LA, 2006; Burt R, 2011). The total content of Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb was determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis using a spectrometer Spectroscan MAX-GV "Spectron" (Russia), and the content of mobile forms extracted from the soil by ammonium acetate buffer (Motuzova GV et al., 2014) was determined by atomic absorption using a spectrometer NOVAA300 "Analytik Jena" (Germany). Clarkes of concentration and Clarkes of dispersion of elements in the studied soils were calculated relative to the clarke of elements in the soils according to AP Vinogradov (1957). A correlation analysis was carried out to evaluate the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of soils and the content of elements with the calculation of Spearmans rank order correlation coefficient.
   In this research, we found out that the lithological heterogeneity of the soil-forming rocks of mineral islands leads to a significant differentiation of soils both by morphological features and by physicochemical properties. Eutric Cambisols form on moraine loams on the slopes under oak forests with thin grass cover, while Haplic Luvisols are characteristic of spruce forests. Rubic Arenosols are common in binomial deposits under a mixed birch and spruce forest. Rendzic Leptosols are confined to sandy sediments. The considered soils are quite different in a range of parameters (See Table 1). The typical differentiation of the profile according to the content of physical clay is characteristic of Eutric Cambisols and Haplic Luvisols. In terms of pH values, Eutric Cambisols and Haplic Luvisols are defined as acidic soils, Rubic Arenosols are slightly acidic or neutral, and Rendzic Leptosols are slightly or moderately alkaline. The organic carbon content in the horizon AY of Rendzic Leptosols is 2 times lower, while in Eutric Cambisols and Haplic Luvisols it is 4-7 times lower than in Rubic Arenosols. The studied soils are differentiated by the content and profile distribution of elements (See Table 2). With the depths, the total content of elements in Haplic Luvisols and Rubic Arenosol increases, while in Rendzic Leptosol it decreases. It was established that the total content of elements in automorphic soils was reduced in the following order: Fe> Mn> Zn> Ni> Cu> Pb. The proportion of mobile forms relative to the total content was minimal for Fe (0.002-0.08%), especially in Rendzic Leptosols (0.003-0.02%), for other elements it varied from 0.3 to 10.7%. The total content of Ni, Pb and Fe is higher in Rubic Arenosols than in a Haplic Luvisols and Rendzic Leptosols (See Table 3). The chemical composition and physical properties of moraine deposits determine the conditions for migration and accumulation of elements (See Table 4). An increase in the total content of Ni, Cu, Zn, and Fe is linked with an increase in the proportion of silty particles in the soils; their maximum values are noted in the lower horizons of the soil. Mn accumulation was observed in sandy horizons with high humus content. High pH values lead to accumulation of mobile forms of Ni and Mn, while low values lead to accumulation of mobile forms of Fe. Mobile forms of Mn, Fe, Ni and Pb are accumulated in the organogenic horizons. It was revealed that Fe and Mn in the soils of the considered landscapes were typomorphic elements whose content significantly influences the behavior of Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb. The results show that the soils of autonomous positions, even despite the limited distribution area within Polistovsky Reserve, demonstrated significant diversity. Differences in the composition and properties of rocks affect soil properties, the severity of soil-forming processes, and the contrast of geochemical differentiation of the profile, which should be taken into account when planning environmental monitoring of both the lands protected and affected by human activity in the territory under consideration.

AB The aging at room temperature (RT) and the tempering behavior in the temperature range 293 to 973 K of ternary iron-nickel-carbon martensite (containing 14.4 at. pet Ni and 2.35 at, pet C) was investigated principally by using X-ray diffractometry to analyze changes in the crystalline structure and differential scanning calorimetry to determine heats of transformation and activation energies. These techniques also were used in the parallel study performed in this work of the tempering behavior of FeC martensite (containing about 4.4 at. pet C) in the temperature range 298 to 773 K. Analysis of the structural changes revealed that in both FeNiC and FeC the following processes occurred: (1) formation of carbon enrichments and development of a periodic arrangement of planar carbon-rich regions up to 423 K; (2) precipitation of epsilon/eta transition carbide and transformation of a part of the austenite into ferrite under simultaneous enrichment with carbon of the remaining austenite (between 423 and 523 K); (3) decomposition of the retained austenite into ferrite and cementite between 523 and 723 K (only partly for FeNiC); (4) precipitation of cementite between 523 and 723 K; and (5) for FeNiC, reformation of austenite from ferrite and cementite above 773 K. A short comparative discussion concerning the first stage of martensite decomposition for FeC, FeNiC, FeN, and FeNiN martensites is given.

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB The twin pressures of climate change and biodiversity loss mean that it is imperative to manage land in ways that benefit carbon storage and biodiversity conservation. We focus on a set of UK habitats of recognised conservation value, first quantifying the carbon stored in the vegetation and top 30 cm of soil in these areas. We estimate that these areas store 0.55 gigatonnes of carbon in vegetation and soil to a depth of 30 cm, approximately 30% of the UK terrestrial carbon store to a similar depth, on 20% of the land area. Most of these high carbon, high conservation value habitats are in upland areas, with particularly notable extents and mass of carbon in Scotland. In their current condition, we estimate these areas to exert a net sequestration effect of more than 8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year. Furthermore, restoration of these habitats from their current, generally poor condition could result in an extra 6-7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year, in the context of the UK's total emissions of 455.9 million tonnes CO(2eq )in 2017. Restoration of degraded bogs would avoid significant annual emissions (currently negating significant sequestration by woodlands and coastal habitats) and should be a particular priority.

AB Although microbes mediate much of the biogeochemical cycling in freshwater, the categories of carbon and nutrients currently used in models of freshwater biogeochemical cycling are too broad to be relevant on a microbial scale. One way to improve these models is to incorporate microbial data. Here, we analyze both genes and genomes from three metagenomic time series and propose specific roles for microbial taxa in freshwater biogeochemical cycles. Our metagenomic time series span multiple years and originate from a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota) and a humic lake (Trout Bog Lake) with contrasting water chemistry. Our analysis highlights the role of polyamines in the nitrogen cycle, the diversity of diazotrophs between lake types, the balance of assimilatory vs. dissimilatory sulfate reduction in freshwater, the various associations between types of phototrophy and carbon fixation, and the density and diversity of glycoside hydrolases in freshwater microbes. We also investigated aspects of central metabolism such as hydrogen metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, methylotrophy, and sugar degradation. Finally, by analyzing the dynamics over time in nitrogen fixation genes and Cyanobacteria genomes, we show that the potential for nitrogen fixation is linked to specific populations in Lake Mendota. This work represents an important step towards incorporating microbial data into ecosystem models and provides a better understanding of how microbes may participate in freshwater biogeochemical cycling.

AB The Lck protein tyrosine kinase associates noncovalently with the cytoplasmic domain of CD4. Upon ligand engagement of the TCR, CD4-associated Lck is rapidly activated and recruited to the TCR complex, Coupling of this complex to an intracellular signaling pathway mag. result in T cell proliferation, Previously, we reported that thymocytes from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (greater than or equal to 6 wk of age) exhibit a proliferative hyporesponsiveness after TCR stimulation, which is associated with defective TCR-mediated signaling along the protein kinase C/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway of T cell activation, Here, we investigated whether differential association of Lck with TCR or CD4 mediates the control of NOD thymocyte hyporesponsiveness. We demonstrate that less CD4-associated Lck is recruited to the TCR in activated NOD thymocytes than in control thymocytes. This CD4-mediated sequestration of Lck from the TCR correlates with the increased binding of CD4-associated Lck through its Src homology 2 domain to free TCR zeta and CD3 gamma epsilon chains on the plasma membrane, Sequestration of Lck by CD4 does not occur in activated thymocytes from 3-wk-old NOD mire and is only apparent in thymocytes from NOD mice >5 to 6 wk of age, This diminished recruitment of CD4-associated Lck to the TCR is not mediated by an increase in the amount of CD4-associated Lck, Thus, impaired recruitment of CD3-associated Lck to the TCR complex may represent an early event that results in deficient coupling of the TCR complex to downstream signaling events and gives rise to NOD thymocyte hyporesponsiveness.

AB Soil salinity is one of the major environmental constraints to crop productivity worldwide. Therefore, the development of cost-effective and environment-friendly techniques allowing increased crop productivity and soil fertility under saline conditions is rather urgent today. The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of mixtures containing natural silicates (analcite, bergmeal, and potassium silicate) and organic fertilizers (sapropel, peat) in corn (Zea mays L.). We specifically evaluated tolerance of corn to salinity stress and certain characteristics of saline soil (viz., redox potential, conductivity, and phytotoxicity) using a factorial pot experiment, modeling NaCl salinity levels of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mM under greenhouse conditions. Growth, water balance, photosynthesis, catalase activity, and accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (flavonoids and anthocyanins) were measured and evaluated. Salinity stress reduced shoot and root biomass by 8-49%, photosynthetic pigment content in leaves by 15-30%, deteriorated water balance, and activated nonspecific adaptive reactions (i.e., accumulation of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants) in the corn seedlings. All the tested silicon-containing mixtures stimulated corn seedling resistance to salt stress and reduced soil phytotoxicity. This was reflected in the stimulation of growth of the corn seedlings (accumulation of shoot biomass, and formation and growth of lateral roots). The content of photosynthetic pigments, flavonoids, anthocyanins, catalase activity increased 1.3-2 times compared with plants that received NaCl only. The difference between treatments and control was most pronounced at moderate levels of salinity (100-150 mM). The mixture containing silicon minerals and sapropel (9: 1 proportion) showed the highest protective effect against salinity stress.

AB Disease suppression against Pythium root rot can be influenced by management practices applied in ornamental bulb culture. Different levels of suppression were established in sandy soil after several soil treatments. Percentage of infection in Iris caused by Pythium macrosporum was lowest in untreated soil and progressively increased in sterilized soil amended with 1% compost, fumigated soil (methylisothiocyanate) and flooded soil (fumigation and flooding corresponding to the same level of disease severity) and was highest in sterilized soil. The relationship between the level of disease incidence, Pythium growth rate through soil, and various microbial parameters was investigated. Soil microbial biomass and, after amendment of glucose as a non-selective carbon source, dehydrogenase activity, glucose uptake and respiration were determined. By using C-14-labelled glucose, measurement of uptake and assimilation of amended carbon could be distuingished from soil organic matter decomposition. All microbial parameters were negatively associated with Pythium growth rates, indicating that high microbial biomass and activity induced suppression of Pythium growth through soil. However, with neither of the quantitative microbial parameters could chances in disease incidence be fully explained. It is hypothesized that competition for carbon may not be the main mechanism in disease suppression. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetable growers require vigorous transplants in order to reduce the period of transplant shock during early stand establishment. Organic media containing solid humic substances (HS) are amendments that have not been comprehensively explored for applications in containerized vegetable transplant production systems. In this study, HS (1%v/v) were applied to a peat-based growth medium to evaluate pre- and post-transplant growth modulation of four economically important vegetable species. Those were: pepper, tomato, watermelon, and lettuce. Seeding for all species was performed in two periods in order to evaluate their post-transplant yield performance under drought (water deficit vs. well-watered) and heat (hot vs. cool season) stresses. Compared with control, HS-treated plants had: (1) increased leaf and root biomass after transplanting due to faster growth rates; (2) lower root/shoot ratio before transplanting, but higher after 10 days of field establishment; and (3) increased root length and surface area. The negative effects of heat and drought stresses on crop yield were more prominent in control plants, while HS-treated transplants were able to mitigate yield decreases. The results clearly demonstrated the benefits of using solid HS as a management input to improve transplant quality in these crop species.

AB Effects of pregnancy and lactation on lipid metabolism in mouse mammary fat pads and nonmammary adipose tissues have been studied. In order to address the question whether the influence of hormonal milieu on lipid metabolism in mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation is the same as in fat cells, we have studied the mobilization of lipids and metabolism of fatty acids in the intact mammary glands, parenchyma-free mammary fat pads and in the perimetrial rat tissues of virgin, pregnant and lactating mire. Compared to parenchyma-free mammary fat pads, the perimetrial adipose tissues accumulated 5-fold higher levels of triglycerides during pregnancy. Mammary fat cells maintained overall lipid levels during pregnancy and lactation (16-20 mu g/fat pad). In contrast, lactation depleted total lipid stores from 108 +/- 5 to 24 +/- 4.5 mu g/fat pad in perimetrial fat pads. Results of comparative analysis of fatty acid composition of mammary fat pads, with and without epithelial tissue, from virgin and lactating mice showed stimulation of 18:2 omega 6 metabolism leading to 130% increase in the ratio 20:4 omega 6 to 18:2 omega 6 in the epithelial compartment. Pregnancy and lactation resulted in the elevation of 20:406 levels probably due to a 4-fold increase in Delta 5 desaturase activity and a decrease in oxidative degradation of 18:2 omega 6. These results suggest that, unlike other adipose tissues, the metabolic pathways in mammary fat cells are not dedicated to sequestration and accumulation of dietary lipids during pregnancy. Lactation favors mammary epithelial cell-stimulated production of precursors of eicosanoids which are known to have agonist-like effect on mammary epithelial cells.

AB A palynological study of the Upper Cretaceous vertebrate site of Chera (Valencia, Spain) has been carried out. The occurrence of diversified Normapolles including various species of Vancampopollenites, Papillopollis and Pseudoromeinipollenites suggest a late Campanian-?early Maachtrichtian age. The palynological assemblages suggest an azonal vegetation involving peat-mosses, sedges and palms colonizing wetlands with ephemeral or semi-permanent pools and lakes. The abundant and diverse Normapolles reflect the regional presence of woodlands or other open vegetation communities with prominent Fagales. The pollen and spore associations of Chera and the contemporary palaeobotanical data from SW Europe are indicative of the co-existence of numerous, structurally different and taxonomically individualized plant communities. The suggested palaeofloral heterogeneity is compatible with the current palaeogeographical reconstructions of SW Europe and probably enhance the appearance of the highly diverse fauna with insular characteristics of the latest Cretaceous.

AB P>Effects of nitrogen (N) enrichment on the heathland lichen Cladonia portentosa were quantified to test the hypothesis that modified N : phosphorus (P) relationships observed in this species in N-polluted natural environments are a direct effect of increased N deposition, and to evaluate potential confounding effects of N form and P availability.
   Cladonia portentosa was harvested from experimental plots in lichen-rich peatland vegetation (background total N deposition of 8 kg N ha-1 yr-1) treated for 4 yr with additional wet N deposition at 0, 8, 24 and 56 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as either NH4+ or NO3-, and with or without P added at either 0.6 or 4 kg P ha-1 yr-1.
   Nitrogen enrichment increased thallus N concentration, N : P mass ratio and phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity by factors of up to 1.3, 1.4 and 1.7, respectively, effects being independent of N form. Phosphomonoesterase activity was tightly related to thallus N : P ratio with additions of P at 4 kg ha-1 yr-1 depressing PME activity by a factor of 0.4.
   Nitrogen enrichment induces P-limitation in C. portentosa with attendant changes in chemical and physiological characteristics that could be used as sensitive biomarkers with which to detect low levels of N pollution.

AB Carbon balances were calculated for the summer stratification period of 2001 for the hydroelectric reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet (created in 1989) and the natural L. Ortrasket, and estimated on annual basis for both lakes. The reservoir and the lake have similar chemical characteristics and are located in adjacent catchments in the northern part of Sweden. Our main hypothesis was that the CO2 Production and emissions from the reservoir, L. Skinnmuddselet, would be greater than in the natural L. Ortrasket, due to the decomposition of flooded vegetation and peat.
   The carbon balances showed that the total production Of CO2 per unit lake surface area during the summer was very similar in the natural lake and the reservoir (31.3 g C m(-2) in L. Ortrasket and 25.3 g C m(-2) in L. Skinnmuddselet). The sediments were the major CO2 source in the reservoir, while most of the mineralization in the natural lake occurred in the water column. On annual basis the natural L. Ortrasket produced and emitted more CO2 per unit of lake surface area than the reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet since mineralization proceeded during winter when L. Skinnmuddselet was emptied for electricity production. Therefore, the potential for CO2 emission was not greater in the reservoir than in the natural lake. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB The Ibar-basin, situated in the southwest of Serbia, contains several small coal basins of Tertiary age. The rank of the different coals was studied in the past and was determined again in this paper. Vitrinite reflectance (R(r)), fluorescence measurements of extracts and the liptinite maceral exsudatinite, as well as organic-geochemical investigations have shown a higher rank for the northernmost deposit of Usce (high volatile bituminous A coal) and lower rank in the deposits situated in the centre of the basin near Tadenje and in the south at Jarando, where the coal is of high volatile bituminous B/A rank. This relatively high rank for Tertiary coals is due to thermometamorphism.
   The petrography and geochemistry of Tadenje coal shows an extraordinary composition. This is explained by relatively enhanced oxidizing conditions during deposition.
   The low rank of the kerogen within the magnesite of Bela Stena in the south of the Ibar-Basin indicates that the magnesite deposition is younger than the peat accumulation. The magnesite is less affected by the andesite and dazite intrusions than the coal.

AB Frond and leaflet residues from pruning of oil palm which are applied as mulch on oil palm plantation will decompose and can be source of organic matter and some essential nutrients. Information about how much the released nutrients from the decomposition processes of frond and leaflet of oil palm is limited. The objective of this research was to study the period (two years) patterns of nutrient release and decomposition of frond and leaflet of oil palm at different burial depth (0 to 30 cm) in peat soil. Decomposition of frond and leaflet of oil palm did not have a different pattern in mass loss, chemical content changes of C/N, N content, P content, P released, however, it has different pattern in N released. During two years of decomposition, frond and leaflet lost 88% and 86% of its initial weight and released 51% and 83% of N, also it released P 87% and 93% respectively. Frond and leaflet from pruning of oil palm should be returned to plantation area for one source of nutrients beside fertilizer.

TI DISTRIBUTION OF ARSENIC IN COALS OF YUNNAN PROVINCE, CHINA, AND ITS
   CONTROLLING FACTORS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The As concentration and its distribution patterns in Southwestern Chinese coal beds of two of the most important coal-forming periods, Late Permian and Neogene, are analyzed.  More than 700 samples from 26 mining districts have been collected and tested for As concentration.  The As content and distribution in coal can be significantly changed by the combined effects of many factors, including the geochemistry of the source region and the tectonic and depositional environment of the basin and surrounding paleo-watershed.  The As distribution in Neogene coals of Yunnan Province reflects to some extent their primary distribution patterns during peat accumulation.
   Because As is a sulphophile element, two As distribution types can be distinguished, based on the correlation coefficient between As and total S contents.  In the high-rank Permian coals, especially those affected by hydrothermal and tectonic activities, significant secondary As enrichment in coal is likely to occur.  Thus, to optimally utilize coal resources, it is important to investigate the distribution, occurrence and concentration of As in coal during resource exploration and evaluation to identify As-rich zones in the coal beds.

ID HISTORY; RECORD; RISE
AB Understanding how Holocene sea levels influenced coastal wetland development in the Caribbean will aid wetland management in the context of predicted sea level rise. Nine radiocarbon dates from the Maracas and Nariva Swamps on wave-dominated coasts from Trinidad, show sea level was -9 in approximately 7000 yr BP, and rose gradually to -2 m by 2000 yr BP. Since then there may have been isostatic readjustment. Wetlands developed with a transgression of dry upland habitats by rising seas and the facultative halophyte Rhizophora colonized the new brackish water environment. A freshwater plant community gradually replaced the Rhizophora as the marine influence decreased. At Maracas, higher sea levels caused wetland retreat as beach and lagoon habitats migrated inland. Sand ridges in Nariva Swamp indicate that, as in Maracas Swamp, sea level rise created beaches and lagoons, but that these landforms prograded as additional nearshore sediments were deposited. Basins were also filled with sediment delivered by streams that drain the watershed, and by mangrove peat accumulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL FORMATION
AB Organic-accumulative horizons above the permafrost table have been described in the profiles of cryozems developing on interfluve surfaces in the tundra zone of northern Yakutia. The organic matter content in these suprapermafrost horizons is comparable with or even exceeds the organic matter content in the surface horizons. The dynamics of seasonal thawing specify the annual involvement of the material of these horizons into the zone of active pedogenesis or its exclusion from it in the case of their frozen state. The analysis of the morphology of cryozems of the Kolyma Lowland along a 1000-km-long sublatitudinal transect shows that the accumulation and migration of raw organic materials (predominantly, differently decomposed peat) above the permafrost table take place upon the particular combinations of local factors (the soil moistening, ice content, freezing-thawing conditions, nanotopography of the permafrost table, etc.) at the lower boundary of the active layer. The well-pronounced accumulation of the raw organic material in the suprapermafrost horizons can be reflected in the substantive characteristics of these horizons and should be taken into account in classification decisions.

AB Significant climate risks are associated with a positive carbon-temperature feedback in northern latitude carbon-rich ecosystems, making an accurate analysis of human impacts on the net greenhouse gas balance of wetlands a priority. Here, we provide a coherent assessment of the climate footprint of a network of wetland sites based on simultaneous and quasi-continuous ecosystem observations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Experimental areas are located both in natural and in managed wetlands and cover a wide range of climatic regions, ecosystem types, and management practices. Based on direct observations we predict that sustained CH4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (i.e., several centuries) typically offset by CO2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the "cost" of CH4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulseresponse radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland. Our results quantify the role of human activities on the climate footprint of northern wetlands and call for development of active mitigation strategies for managed wetlands and new guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) accounting for both sustained CH4 emissions and cumulative CO2 exchange.

AB Eutrophication and the formation of phytoplankton blooms in freshwaters can be detrimental to water quality and biological health and produce organic matter that can be difficult to remove during water treatment processes. With the frequency of phytoplankton blooms increasing, remediation solutions are becoming increasingly popular. This study investigated the use of a peat-based floating treatment wetland (FTW) for reducing phytoplankton growth in eutrophic waters. Over a four-week period, the FTWs were able to reduce chlorophyll a concentrations by 80%, through sequestration of nitrate and phosphate and possibly due to the direct inhibitory properties of phenolic compounds. Although there are concerns about the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the FTWs, this may be more than offset by the beneficial suppression of phytoplankton growth and the resulting reduced input of `untreatable' low molecular weight DOC.

AB St. Catherines Island consists of a complex association of Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. The geographic location of the island at the center of Georgia Bight, a prominent re-entrant in the coastline of the southeastern USA, has resulted in the development of a very complex depositional and erosional history. For over 40,000 years the island has experienced a variety of physical, biological, and anthropological changes brought about by climatic, biotic, depositional, and anthropogenic events. Sedimentary deposits have been studied using diverse research tracks including palynology, dendrology, sedimentology, geophysics, and radiocarbon chronology, as well as archaeological techniques. This research focused on the interpretation of environments of deposition of strata that are exposed within the present surf zone, yet which bear the distinct signatures of upland/inland environments of deposition. Data derived from Late Pleistocene and Holocene accumulations of peat and mollusc- and wood-bearing muddy strata of certain on-shore and near-shore origins reveal diverse events relating to shoreline dynamics, plant community changes, and net shoreward migration of this island during the Late Holocene.

AB Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

AB The interior depressions in the Olsztyn area are characterized by high biodiversity. On the basis of floral surveys of 32 small water bodies, 200 species of vascular plants and 10 species of bryophytes were recorded. Phytosociological analysis indicated 45 plant associations. Among the phytocoenoses described, some communities require more attention, including Wolffietum arrhizae, Riccietum fluitantis, Charetum fragilis, the pondweeds Potametum nitentis and P. commpressi as well as communities with Potamogeton trichoides and P. pusillus.
   In light of their significant natural value, some of the basins studied units should be protected as ecological grounds. Reservoirs located in the Jaroty District, in the vicinity of Lake Track or some reservoirs located within the Gutkowo and Kortowo districts are important points of peat-water or water accumulation. These small water bodies limit the nutrient and pollutant input into the numerous lakes located in the Olsztyn area. Some basins are of a recreational character, including the reservoir located in the central quarter of the town and the water bodies of the Kortowo District. The remaining reservoirs need restoration and litter collection to restore their recreational functions.

AB Recently in humid tropical Asia, human activities have begun to extend toward the coastal lowland areas where widespread peat swamps are distributed. Draining peat swamp areas for agricultural uses creates a high risk of sulfuric acidification. The research site in this paper was a strand plain comprising beach ridges, swales on inter-ridges, and peaty backswamps in southeast Thailand. Thus, the actual and potential acid sulfate soil in the peaty backswamps is a major problem there, but sandy podzols on older beach ridges are also considered an agricultural problem soil. To establish an agricultural landscape plan encompassing the whole of the strand plain, we studied the land characteristics associated with the landforms and soils, their spatial variability related to landscape evolution, and the status of present plant resources in terms of biomass and species diversity for local farmers on peaty backswamps and beach ridges. We found that all spatial attributes of the two soils, such as the locations, profiles, and chemical and physical properties, were closely related to the geomorphic formation process or chronosequence: the landward or older backswamp has ripe clay and the seaward or younger one partly has unripe clay; the degree of spodic horizon development with ortstein is highest in the most landward beach-ridge system and decreases seaward; and the profile positions of the spodic horizons were related to the fluctuations of marine sand sediments, as revealed in a fine-scale survey. Finding these spatial regularities is useful for predicting land characteristics in areas outside of detailed research sites, reducing time and cost as well as forming the basis of landscape planning. Plant resources presently utilized by local farmers on the strand plain are Melaleuca cajuputi forests on both the peaty backswamps and the beach ridges, and home gardens of tropical fruit trees around settlements. Ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass of M. cajuputi was not significantly different among soil types in the strand plain, but the growth rate and potential biomass of the species appears to be highest in thick, water-saturated peaty backswamps with acid sulfate soils. By comparing the species composition of home gardens in different areas, we found that oil the beach ridges, although the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass for several types of fruit trees appears lower, a great number of species particular to the shrub layer are maintained. Based on the spatial variability of land characteristics and the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass, we identified separate land units and suggested future land-management and land-use systems appropriate to each unit.

AB Loss of coastal wetlands is occurring at an increasingly rapid rate due to drainage of these wetlands for alternative land-uses, which also threatens carbon (C) storage in these C-rich ecosystems. Wetland drainage results in water table drawdown and increased peat aeration, which enhances decomposition of previously stabilized peat and changes stable C isotope profiles. The effect of water table drawdown on the pool size and delta C-13 signature of plant C, soil organic C (SOC), and microbial biomass C (MBC) across a range of organic and mineral soils has not previously been reported in coastal freshwater forested wetlands. To this end, litter, roots, and soils were collected from organic and mineral soil horizons in two coastal freshwater forested wetlands in North Carolina with different hydrological regimes: (1) a natural bottomland hardwood forest (natural); and (2) a ditched and drained, intensively-managed wetland for loblolly pine silviculture (managed). We found that hydrology and soil horizon, and to a lesser degree micro-topography, was important in shaping observed differences in size and C-13 signature of soil and microbial pools between the natural and managed wetland. The natural wetland had higher SOC and MBC concentrations in the litter, surface organic, and mineral horizons compared to the managed wetland. In the managed wetland, C-13 of SOC was enriched across most of the soil profile (Oa and mineral soil horizons) compared to the natural wetland, suggesting enhanced decomposition and incorporation of microbially-derived inputs into stable SOC pools. Root C concentration decreased with soil depth, while root C-13 signature became enriched with soil depth. In the litter and Oe horizon of the natural wetland, MBC was higher and C-13 of MBC and SOC was enriched in hummocks compared to hollows. The C-13 of MBC and SOC tended to be enriched in upper soil horizons and depleted in lower soil horizons, particularly in the managed wetland. We conclude that drainage of these coastal wetlands has enhanced the breakdown of previously stabilized C and has the potential to alter regional C storage, feedback to climate warming, and ecosystem response to changing environmental conditions.

AB The Late Permian coals in the Heshan Coalfield of southern China are preserved within marine carbonate successions and characterized by super-high organic sulfur (5.13-10.82%). Minerals identified in the coals include quartz, kaolinite, illite, mixed layer illite/smectite, albite, pyrite, marcasite, calcite, and dolomite, along with trace amounts of smectite, fluorite, strontianite, REY-bearing carbonate minerals, jarosite, and water-bearing Fe-oxysulfate. The coals are very rich in trace elements including F (up to 3362 mu g/g), V (up to 270 mu g/g), Se (up to 24.4 mu g/g), Mo (up to 142 mu g/g), U (up to 111 mu g/g), and, to a lesser extent, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Cd, Cs, heavy rare earth elements, Hf, Ta, W, Hg, and Th.
   Previous studies attributed the high organic sulfur and elevated trace elements to the seawater influence or the formation of soil horizons before the accumulation of peat in the basin. However, mineralogical and geochemical data presented in this study have shown that the sediment-source region and multi-stage hydrothermal fluids are the dominant influences on the mineralogical composition and elevated trace elements in the coal, although seawater influence also contributed to the composition of the mineral matter.
   For example, a large proportion of the quartz and clay minerals, as well as almost all the albite, in both the coal benches and the parting mudstones were derived from detrital materials of terrigenous origin in the Yunkai Upland. High concentrations of lithophile trace elements were also derived from the sediment source region. Minerals including fluorite, calcite, dolomite, strontianite, and REV-bearing carbonate minerals were derived from multi-stage hydrothermal activities. High concentrations of V, Mo, and U that occur through the coal seam sections were probably derived from hydrothermal solutions during peat accumulation or at the early diagenetic stages. The hydrothermal fluids also corroded the syngenetically-formed minerals (quartz, albite, and pyrite) and caused re-distribution of lithophile elements from partings to the underlying coal benches, resulting in higher key element ratios (Yb/La, Nb/Ta, and Zr/Hf) and more abundant heavy rare earth elements in the coal benches than in the immediately overlying partings.

AB Many lowland rivers across northwest Europe exhibit broadly similar behavioural responses to glacial-interglacial transitions and landscape development. Difficulties exist in assessing these, largely because the evidence from many rivers remains limited and fragmentary. Here we address this issue in the context of the river Kennet, a tributary of the Thames, since c. 13,000 cal BP. Some similarities with other rivers are present, suggesting that regional climatic shifts are important controls. The Kennet differs from the regional pattern in a number of ways. The rate of response to sudden climatic change, particularly at the start of the Holocene and also mid-Holocene forest clearance, appears very high. This may reflect abrupt shifts between two catchment scale hydrological states arising from contemporary climates, land use change and geology. Stadial hydrology is dominated by nival regimes, with limited winter infiltration and high spring and summer runoff. Under an interglacial climate, infiltration is more significant. The probable absence of permafrost in the catchment means that a lag between the two states due to its gradual decay is unlikely. Palaeoecology, supported by radiocarbon dates, suggests that, at the very start of the Holocene, a dramatic episode of fine sediment deposition across most of the valley floor occurred, lasting 500-1000 years. A phase of peat accumulation followed as mineral sediment supply declined. A further shift led to tufa deposition, initially in small pools, then across the whole floodplain area, with the river flowing through channels cut in tufa and experiencing repeated avulsion. Major floods, leaving large gravel bars that still form positive relief features on the floodplain, followed mid-Holocene floodplain stability. Prehistoric deforestation is likely to be the cause of this flooding, inducing a major environmental shift with significantly increased surface runoff. Since the Bronze Age, predominantly fine sediments were deposited along the valley with apparently stable channels and vertical floodplain accretion associated with soil erosion and less catastrophic flooding. The Kennet demonstrates that, while a general pattern of river behaviour over time, within a region, may be identifiable, individual rivers are likely to diverge from this. Consequently, it is essential to understand catchment controls, particularly the relative significance of surface and subsurface hydrology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Paleoenvironmental reconstruction combining data from diatom, pollen, macrophytic, and archaeological analyses had not been attempted previously for coastal Peru. We analyzed two radiocarbon-dated sediment cores extracted from the "sacred" Urpi Kocha Lagoon at the pre-Hispanic religious center of Pachacamac (ca. AD 350-1533). near Lima, to characterize the paleoenvironment of the site. The data reveal an environmental history characterized by alternating periods of severe drought and catastrophic flood. Recurrent pulses with distinctive sediment, diatom, pollen, and macrophytic characteristics reflecting variations in water depth, substrate, turbidity and salinity, usually contain a thick basal sandy storm deposit overlain by thin organic accumulations of peat, gyttja, and snails. The most intense of these disturbance pulses, when correlated with pollen, plant macrofossils, radiocarbon dates, and regional proxy data, provide local evidence of four major floods associated with sustained, catastrophic El Nino events, tsunamis and/or severe storms in the Andean highlands over the last 2000 years.

AB In order to study the accumulation mechanism of "barkinite", eight Late Permian channel benches (approximately 15-cm across and 10-cm deep) were taken from the Jinshan Mine, Anhui Province, China. The samples were analyzed by microscopical and geochemical methods. The microscopical observations indicate that the occurrence modes of "barkinite" in this area are different from those in other areas of China. The ratios of structureless "barkinite" are much higher in the Jinshan Mine, probably due to the flow-water and marine influenced environments. Furthermore, vitrinite macerals also show a strong fluorescence. The vitrinite fluorescence characteristics have not been observed in the Permian "barkinite" coals from northern China. The composition and variation of minerals in the column section also showed that the swamps in the study area were seriously influenced by seawater in the early and late stage during the peat accumulation.

AB In arctic streams, depth of thaw beneath the stream channel is likely a significant parameter controlling hyporheic zone hydrology and biogeochemical cycling. As part of an interdisciplinary study of this system, we conducted a field investigation to test the effectiveness of imaging substream permafrost using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). We investigated three sites characterized by low-energy water flow, organic material lining the streambeds, and water depths ranging from 0-2 to 2 m. We acquired data using a 200 MHz pulsed radar system with the antennas mounted in the bottom of a small rubber boat that was pulled across the stream while triggering the radar at a constant rate. We achieved excellent results at all three sites, with a clear continuous image of the permafrost boundary both peripheral to and beneath the stream. Our results demonstrate that GPR can be an effective tool for measuring substream thaw depth. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Historically, the Florida Everglades was characterized by a corrugated landscape of shorter hydroperiod, elevated sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) ridges and longer hydroperiod, deep water slough communities. Drainage and compartmentalization of the Everglades have fundamentally altered this pattern, and sawgrass ridge communities have expanded at the expense of deep water slough communities throughout much of the landscape. In this study we provide a simple isotopic and nutrient characterization of major components of the slough ecosystem to elucidate physiological and nutrient differences among species and to suggest pathways for organic matter decomposition that contribute to peat development in deep water sloughs. We examined carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes and C, N and phosphorus (P) concentrations of the floating-leaved macrophytes Nymphaea odorata and Nymphoides aquatica, the emergent macrophyte Eleocharis elongata, and the submerged species Utricularia foliosa and Utricularia purpurea, as well as soil and flocculent material from the southern Water Conservation Area 3-A. Flocculent material and soils had the highest N content (4.5 +/- 0.2%) and U.foliosa and N. odorata had the highest P content (0.13 +/- 0.01% to 0.12 +/- 0.01%). The range for delta N-15 average +/- SE values was 5.81 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand (U.foliosa) to -1.84 +/- 0.63 parts per thousand (N. odorata), while the range for delta C-13 values was -23.83 +/- 0.12 parts per thousand (N. odorata) to -29.28 +/- 0.34 parts per thousand, (U. purpurea). Differences of up to 10 parts per thousand in C isotopic values of U. foliosa and N. odorata suggest fundamental physiological differences between these species. Along a degradation continuum, enrichment of C-13 and N-15 and extent of decomposition was negatively related to phosphorus concentrations. A two end-member C-13 mixing model suggested that Utricularia species were the primary organic source for flocculent materials, whereas organic matter derived from root decomposition of N. odorata contributed to the progressively enriched delta C-13 values found with depth in soils. These results illustrate the fundamentally important roles of Nymphaea and Utricularia species in ecosystem dynamics of deep water sloughs. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Coal samples from Florina (Vevi), Lava, Moschopotamos and Kalavryta basins, Greece, have been subjected to petrographic and organic geochemical analysis. The reflectance of the samples ranged from 0.26% to 0.42%, which ranks them as soft brown coals and sub-bituminous C coals. Lower reflectance values were encountered in the Florina and Kalavryta coals, whereas higher values were obtained for Lava and Moschopotamos samples.
   Muceral composition of the samples from the Florina area shows a high concentration of textinite A and texto-ulminite A. The samples from the Lava and Moschopotamos area are comparatively rich in humodetrinite. Samples from Florina are rich in resinite, whereas samples from Lava are rich in liptodetrinite.
   Rock-Eval pyrolysis data show that the samples from Florina and Kalavryta have generally high HI, SI and S2 and low T-max, values. The coal samples from Moschopotamos and Lava show the opposite, having low PII, S1 and S2 values. These distinct differences are related to the maceral composition (tissue rich in resinitic material) and rank of the coals. Gas chromatography of the saturate fraction indicates that the samples from the Lava and Moschopotamos are rich in n-alkanes from n-C-23 to n-C-33. In contrast, the samples from Florina are rich in diterpanes, whereas those from Kalavryta are rich in sesquiterpenoids.
   Gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry of the saturate fraction reveals that the diterpenoids present in the lignites from Kalavryta are derivatives of abietanic acid and pimaric acid, which are found in Pinaceae. The lignites from Florina mainly contain the diterpane, phyllocladane, which implies an input from Cupressaceae and/or Taxodiacaea. The difference in the composition of these xylitic lignites may be attributed to differences in gymnosperm input as a response to climatic change, as the Kalavryta coals are of Pliocene age, whereas the Florina coals are of Miocene age.
   The study suggests that the petrology and organic geochemistry of these coals are related to the different peat-forming plant communities that were present in the Florina, Kalavryta, Lava and Moschopotamos basins. A mainly non-woody, angiosperm-dominated vegetation made up the peat that went to form the coal deposits of Lava and Moschopotamos, while the Florina and Kalavryta lignites were formed by peals derived mainly from gymnosperms.

AB The protection and regeneration of wetlands has been of crucial importance as a goal in ecological research and in nature conservation for some time and is more important than ever now. Knowledge about the biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation retrieved from satellite images enables us to improve the monitoring of these unique areas, which are otherwise very often impenetrable and therefore difficult to examine, analyze and assess by means of site visits. The Biebrza Wetlands are Situated in the North-East part of Poland and are one of the largest areas made LIP of marshes and swamps in the entire EU. This is still one of the wildest areas and one of the least destroyed, damaged or changed by human impact. However, in the recent decades there have been attempts made to intensify and overexploit the natural resources of the region and implement new agriculture practices in the area. In this period, drainage canals have been built, and a good deal of the area has been drained. The area of this precious ecosystem covers 25494 ha. This valuable area of peat with unique vegetation species and with very special birds is one of the most valuable areas in Europe and in 1995 was added to the list of Ramsar sites. The investigation of wetlands in the Biebrza River Valley has been carried out at ground level by taking measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, Leaf Area Index, wet and dry biomass and the levels of ground water and meteorological parameters. Also examined were radiative temperature, detailed vegetation mapping, and APAR. For some years the deterioration of peat lands has been noticed due to the drying out of the area and the frequent outbreak of fires. The consequence is the succession of new vegetation and the appearance of new ecosystems. The Remote Sensing Centre in the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography has undertaken the investigation by applying ERS-2.SAR and ENVISAT ASAR of IS2 and IS4 and VV, HH, HV polarization for the purpose of modeling soil moisture and humidity changes of the area under investigation. The investigation also aimed at finding the best biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation to characterize marshland habitats and its changes. At the same time as registering the microwave data, the optical data from Landsat ETM+, SPOT VEGETATION, ERS-2.ATSR. ENVISAT MERIS, and NOAA/AVHRR have been registered and information about the biomass and heat fluxes as sensible and latent heat has also been calculated. The vegetation indices are calculated from EO satellite data taking into account jointly the features of vegetation responsible for reflection in various bands and combining this information from several spectral bands. Also, the changes in the humidity of the area have been examined by extracting the backscattering coefficients from two SAR images that were taken at a similar period of the year but with a gap of 5 years. The information about soil moisture as retention, soil moisture changes, heat fluxes and evapotranspiration are all very important for estimates of CO2 sequestration. The ENVISAT images have been obtained for the ESA AO-ID122 project. Also the SMOS and ALOS data will be applied for the Biebrza Wetlands in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A history of vegetation for the mid-late Holocene was extracted from the southern margins of Whanganui Inlet and Mangarakau Swamp. These two sites represent very different pollen sinks with the estuary being dominated by fluvially transported material and the swamp by in situ pollen rain. They are, however, located very close to each other and therefore provide a unique study area to investigate how differing source environments affect pollen signals. A vegetation change from podocarps to beech forest is recorded in both settings at around 4000 years CalBP which is similar to that recorded at higher altitudes in the region. Robust palynomorphs were found in greater abundance in the inlet while the swamp contained a higher proportion of wetland species. Despite these differences both environments appeared to record a similar regional vegetation Signal. This shows that estuarine environments, often characterised by material that has been transported, can provide accurate reconstructions of vegetation change.

AB The root system of individual layerings excavated in an 8 m diameter, approximately 500-year-old clonal island of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) on the forest-tundra near Churchill, Manitoba, consisted of roots in accumulating litter and peat within the island and one or two main roots up to 12.25 m long extending into the surrounding lichen-heath. One of the latter, recently dead, was 280 Fears old with an initial extension rate similar to roots of the early 1900s. Needle mass, wood surface area, sapwood volume and current annual mass of wood were measured as estimates of carbon allocation in one layering. Below ground, wood surface area and sapwood volume constituted 74% and 84% respectively of the totals for woody material, substantially more than the 47% of current wood production. Based on the size and distribution of roots, the island may be composed of 30-40 individual layerings, most of which developed in the last 100 years.

AB We used a biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), to study the net methane (CH4) fluxes between Alaskan ecosystems and the atmosphere. We estimated that the current net emissions of CH4 (emissions minus consumption) from Alaskan soils are; similar to 3 Tg CH4/yr. Wet tundra ecosystems are responsible for 75% of the region's net emissions, while dry tundra and upland boreal forests are responsible for 50% and 45% of total consumption over the region, respectively. In response to climate change over the 21st century, our simulations indicated that CH4 emissions from wet soils would be enhanced more than consumption by dry soils of tundra and boreal forests. As a consequence, we projected that net CH4 emissions will almost double by the end of the century in response to high-latitude warming and associated climate changes. When we placed these CH4 emissions in the context of the projected carbon budget (carbon dioxide [CO2] and CH4) for Alaska at the end of the 21st century, we estimated that Alaska will be a net source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere of 69 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr, that is, a balance between net methane emissions of 131 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr and carbon sequestration of 17 Tg C/yr (62 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr).

AB One major challenge to the improvement of regional climate scenarios for the northern high latitudes is to understand land surface feedbacks associated with vegetation shifts and ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. We employed a customized, Arctic version of the individual-based dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to simulate the dynamics of upland and wetland ecosystems under a regional climate model-downscaled future climate projection for the Arctic and Subarctic. The simulated vegetation distribution (1961-1990) agreed well with a composite map of actual arctic vegetation. In the future (2051-2080), a poleward advance of the forest-tundra boundary, an expansion of tall shrub tundra, and a dominance shift from deciduous to evergreen boreal conifer forest over northern Eurasia were simulated. Ecosystems continued to sink carbon for the next few decades, although the size of these sinks diminished by the late 21st century. Hot spots of increased CH4 emission were identified in the peatlands near Hudson Bay and western Siberia. In terms of their net impact on regional climate forcing, positive feedbacks associated with the negative effects of tree-line, shrub cover and forest phenology changes on snow-season albedo, as well as the larger sources of CH4, may potentially dominate over negative feedbacks due to increased carbon sequestration and increased latent heat flux.

AB Microbial precipitation of calcium carbonate is a widespread environmental phenomenon that has diverse engineering applications, from building and soil restoration to carbon sequestration. Urease-mediated ureolysis and CO2(de)hydration by carbonic anhydrase (CA) are known for their potential to precipitate carbonate minerals, yet many environmental microbial community studies rely on marker gene or metagenomic approaches that are unable to determinein situactivity. Here, we developed fast and cost-effective tests for the field detection of urease and CA activity using pH-sensitive strips inside microcentrifuge tubes that change colour in response to the reaction products of urease (NH3) and CA (CO2). The urease assay proved sensitive and useful in the field to detectin situactivity in biofilms from a saline lake, a series of calcareous fens, and ferrous springs, finding relatively high urease activity in lake samples. Incubations of lake microbes with urea resulted in significantly higher CaCO(3)precipitation compared to incubations with a urease inhibitor, showing that the rapid assay indicated an on-site active metabolism potentially mediating carbonate precipitation. The CA assay, however, showed less sensitivity compared to the urease test. While its sensitivity limits its utility, the assay may still be useful as a preliminary indicator given the paucity of other means for detecting CA activity in the field. Field urease, and potentially CA, activity assays complement molecular approaches and facilitate the search for carbonate-precipitating microbes and theirin situactivity, which could be applied toward agriculture, engineering and carbon sequestration technologies.

AB The distribution of modern diatom assemblages in surficial sediments of 64 Labrador (Canada) lakes across broad vegetational biomes was studied in order to explore species-environment relationships and to develop transfer functions for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The study sites were situated along a latitudinal gradient (51degrees27' to 57degrees37' N) and classified according to six catchment vegetation types: wetland (peatland) forest, spruce/fir forest, lichen woodland, forest-tundra, coastal tundra, and tundra. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that among 28 environmental variables determined for each site, water colour and alkalinity accounted for most of the variance in the diatom data. Using weighted-averaging partial least squares techniques, we developed transfer functions for inference of water colour (CLR) (r(jack)(2) = 0.85, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.18log(CLR + 1) or 1.51 Pt units) and alkalinity (ALK) (r(jack)(2) = 0.63, RMSEP = 0.25log(ALK + 1) or 1.78 mueq.L-1) from the percent abundance of the 132 most abundant diatom taxa. By determining diatom distribution in relation to more detailed vegetation types within the boreal forest zone (wetland forest, spruce/fir forest, and lichen woodland), this calibration data set demonstrated the potential of these assemblages for revealing more subtle changes in lake catchment vegetation over time.

AB The loss of carbon storage and sequestration capacity has been increasingly assessed and analyzed worldwide as among the factors causing or amplifying climate change. Solutions that contribute to decreasing the release of carbon and increasing its sequestration, without compromising currently threatened ecosystems, are required, especially for small territories. This study focuses on the strategies to increase the resilience of small islands to these losses, including spatial management to prevent and adapt to climate change while preserving biodiversity. Changes in carbon storage on Pico Island (Azores, Portugal) between 1998 and 2013 were assessed using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) Carbon Storage and Sequestration model. Changes in carbon stocks caused by changes in land use during this period, and the stocks' relationships with protected areas and the quality of natural habitats on Pico Island, were analyzed. Bogs and Azorean endemic Macaronesian heaths store more carbon per ha. Alien species are invading natural areas, and their carbon values need to be carefully addressed. Results, however, indicated that simultaneously increasing carbon stocks (economical value) and protecting biodiversity (environmental value) is possible by adapted and discussed management actions. This study supports the strategies that promote the potential of the conservation of biodiversity for mitigating climate change. The proposed management guidelines can be applied to other Macaronesian islands and, with local adaptations, to other outermost regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbonate concretionary bodies were encountered during mining of the Beulah-Zap lignite seam in the Coteau Properties' Freedom mine, Mercer County, North Dakota. Preliminary studies show that areal and vertical distribution of the concretions are variable. All concretions examined are composed almost entirely of calcite. They occur as thin tabular bodies, as more or less elliptical forms, or as tear shaped bodies, and may occur individually or as clusters of buff-colored, poorly consolidated to solidly crystalline material. The carbonate masses vary in size from a few millimeters to tens of centimeters. Bedding in the lignite may display some compactional folding over dense spheroidal to elliptical concretions, indicating formation of the concretions prior to compaction. Internal morphology of the concretions is complex, and includes cone-in-cone structure, cross-cutting calcite veinlets, and multiple generations of calcite. Carbon isotope values suggest the concretions are composed of biogenic carbonate, probably related to early diagenesis and decomposition of organic matter(peat); oxygen isotope values are light, and consistent with a freshwater origin.

AB The effects of engineered natural organic amendments on two measures of the environmental "availability" of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with soil and sediment samples are assessed. Two soils spiked with pyrene alone and a sediment spiked with a mixture of 4 PAH compounds were amended with raw or superheated-water processed peat or soybean stalks, then aged for periods of either 62 or 105 days. The aged soils were then examined with respect to bioaccumulation of spiked pyrene by earthworms (Eisenia foetida), and to its human bioaccessibility as measured by extraction with simulated gastrointestinal fluid. Additions of processed amendments reduced both measures of availability by factors ranging from 7.6 to 27.0 for earthworm bioaccumulation and from 2.3 to 8.8 for gastrointestinal extractability. All PAH compounds spiked to the sediment were reduced to varying extents in their availabilities to E. foetida and leachabilities by water by both processed and raw organic amendments.

AB Shifts from N limitation to P or K limitation in wetlands (e.g. due to mowing and high atmospheric N deposition) are reflected by increased N:P and N:K ratios of plant biomass and changes in species composition. So far, the implications of increased N:K ratios for wetland vegetation have hardly been investigated. We examined how the supply of N and K influences the growth of three wetland grass species (Holcus lanatus, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Deschampsia caespitosa) to determine at what N:K ratios growth is likely to be K limited, how N:K ratios influence biomass allocation and nutrient uptake, and whether the responses to high N:K ratios vary among species. Plants were grown in sand at six N: K supply ratios ranging from 0.17 to 40.5 and combined with two levels of fertility in a factorial design. In 15 weeks of growth, plant biomass increased with increasing N:K supply ratios, indicating that growth was mostly limited by N and not by K across the entire range of N:K ratios. However, there were indications of K deficiency at the highest N:K supply ratio, such as increased leaf mortality and strong reduction of K concentrations during leaf senescence. The response of total plant biomass to nutrient treatments did not differ among the three species. However, other plant traits, such as biomass allocation to roots, leaf senescence and N concentrations, Suggested that D. caespitosa is better adapted to extremely low K availability than the other two species.
   The short-term responses of the three wetland grass species to N and K supply were similar to those found in previous experiments testing different N:P supply ratios. In both cases, growth depended mainly on N supply, despite high N:K or N:P supply ratios and very low K or P concentrations in plant biomass. In those previous experiments, P supply became more important in the second year. There are indications that the same could also be true for K in a longer-term experiment. Hence, the so-called 'critical' values for N:K ratios of plant biomass in the field might be lower than indicated by our short-term experiment. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB Aboveground vegetation biomass in northern treeless landscapes - peatlands and Arctic tundra - has been modelled with spectral information derived from optical remote sensing in several studies. However, synthesized overviews of biomass patterns across circumpolar sites have been limited. Based on data from eight study sites in Europe, Siberia and Canada, we ask (1) how biomass is divided between plant functional types (PFTs) and (2) how well biomass patterns can be detected with widely available, moderate spatial resolution (3-10 m) satellite imagery and topographic data. We explain biomass patterns using random forest regressions with the predictors being spectral bands and indices calculated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery and topographic information calculated from ArcticDEM data. Our results indicate that there are notable differences in vegetation composition between northern landscapes with mosses, graminoids and deciduous shrubs being the most dominant PFTs. Remote sensing data detects biomass patterns, but regression performance varies between sites (explained variance 36-70%, normalized root mean square error 9-19%). There is also variability between sites whether Sentinel-2 or PlanetScope data is more suitable to detect biomass patterns and which the most important predictors are. Topographic information has a minor or negligible importance in most of the sites. Our results suggest that there is no easily generalizable relationship between satellite-derived vegetation greenness and biomass.

AB Loss of tidal wetlands is a world-wide phenomenon. Many factors may contribute to such loss, but among them are geochemical stressors such as exposure of the marsh plants to elevated levels on hydrogen sulfide in the pore water of the marsh peat. Here we report the results of a study of the geochemistry of iron and sulfide at different seasons in unrestored (JoCo) and partially restored (Big Egg) salt marshes in Jamaica Bay, a highly urbanized estuary in New York City where the loss of salt marsh area has accelerated in recent years. The spatial and temporal 2-dimensional distribution patterns of dissolved Fe2+ and H2S in salt marshes were in situ mapped with high resolution planar sensors for the first time. The vertical profiles of Fe2+ and hydrogen sulfide, as well as related solutes and redox potentials in marsh were also evaluated by sampling the pore water at discrete depths. Sediment cores were collected at various seasons and the solid phase Fe, S, N, C, and chromium reducible sulfide in marsh peat at discrete depths were further investigated in order to study Fe and S cycles, and their relationship to the organic matter cycling at different seasons. Our results revealed that the redox sensitive elements Fe2+ and S2- showed significantly heterogeneous and complex three dimensional distribution patterns in salt marsh, over mm to cm scales, directly associated with the plant roots due to the oxygen leakage from roots and redox diagenetic reactions. We hypothesize that the oxic layers with low/undetected H2S and Fe2+ formed around roots help marsh plants to survive in the high levels of H2S by reducing sulfide absorption. The overall concentrations of Fe2+ and H2S and distribution patterns also seasonally varied with temperature change. H2S level in JoCo sampling site could change from 5 mM in fall season, reflecting significantly seasonal variation in the rates of bacterial oxidation of organic matter at this marsh site. Solid phase Fe and S showed that very high fractions of the diagenetically reactive iron at JoCo and Big Egg were associated with pyrite that can persist for long periods in anoxic sediments. This implies that there is insufficient diagenetically reactive iron to buffer the pore water hydrogen sulfide through formation of iron sulfides at JoCo and Big Egg.

AB The relative abundances of Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) and total arboreal pollen in pollen spectra from the Lake Baikal region and calculation of a steppe-forest vegetation index place constraints on the past climatic conditions related to permafrost, summer temperatures, precipitation and soil moisture availability. Here we review the data on Picea pollen in sub-recent spectra, the present-day distribution of Picea obovata, and sedimentary records from a number of sites to arrive at a coherent picture of evolution of regional vegetation since the late glacial. The expansion of Siberian spruce along with steppe vegetation dates back to the undivided Bolling-Allerod interval, when this species became dominant in arboreal vegetation. Steppe landscapes persisted in a large part of the Lake Baikal watershed prior to 9.2-9 ka when the expansion of arboreal vegetation took place. Following the Younger Dryas (which seems to have had little effect on regional vegetation and peat accumulation), the role of Siberian spruce steadily declined until 8.6-6.8 ka. In the late Holocene, the abundance of P. obovata rarely exceeded the present-day ratio of ca 2% total arboreal pollen. Departures towards higher Picea abundance and higher steppe-forest index at ca 6-5 and 3-2.5 ka in Selenga Delta area appear to reflect periods with decreased temperatures and higher moisture availability in the southern part of the Lake Baikal watershed.

AB To interpret past vegetation and climate changes from pollen data, we need to reveal the degree of similarity between modern analogues and fossil pollen spectra, which would help us predict the future climate and vegetation. Ninety surface pollen samples across six vegetation zones along an altitudinal gradient from 460 to 3510 m and 44 fossil samples at Caotan Lake were collected in the central Tianshan Mountains, northern Xinjiang, China. Discriminant analyses results, fossil pollen and phytolith assemblages were then used to reconstruct palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate in the area. The 90 surface samples were divided into six pollen zones (alpine cushion, alpine and subalpine meadow, montane Tianshan spruce forest, forest-steppe ecotone, Artemisia desert, typical desert), corresponding to the major vegetation types in the area. These zones follow a climatic gradient of increasing precipitation with increasing elevation. Paleovegetation reconstructed from 44 fossil pollen assemblages through discriminant analysis reflects the regional vegetation shifted from typical desert to Artemisia desert since 4640 cal. year BP in the Caotan Lake wetland. The fossil pollen and phytolith record also reveal the arid climate has not fundamentally changed in the period. But a dry-wet-dry local climate oscillation since 2700 cal. year BP has a fundamental influence on local wetland vegetation dynamics and peat accumulation of the Caotan wetland. Modern wetland landscape and surface pollen assemblages from the Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve provide further evidence for ferns and Betula growing in the Caotan Lake wetland during the historical period.

AB Background and Aims In a cost-benefit framework, plant carnivory is hypothesized to be an adaptation to nutrient-poor soils in sunny, wetland habitats. However, apparent exceptions to this cost-benefit model exist, although they have been rarely studied. One of these exceptions is the carnivorous subshrub Drosophyllum lusitanicum, which thrives in Mediterranean heathlands on dry sandstone soils and has relatively well-developed, xeromorphic roots. Here, the roles of leaf (carnivory) and root (soil) nutrient uptake in growth promotion of this particular species were assessed.
   Methods In a greenhouse experiment, plants were fed with laboratory-reared fruit flies (Drosophila virilis) and received two concentrations of soil nutrients in a factorial design. Above-ground plant growth and final above- and below-ground dry biomass after 13 weeks were recorded. Nutrient uptake via roots was also evaluated, using stable nitrogen isotope analysis.
   Key Results Insect feeding resulted in significantly higher growth and above- and below-ground biomass compared with soil fertilization. No additional benefits of fertilization were discernable when plants were insect-fed, indicating that roots were not efficient in nutrient absorption.
   Conclusions The first evidence of strong reliance on insect prey feeding in a dry- soil carnivorous plant with well-developed roots is provided, suggesting that carnivory per se does not preclude persistence in dry habitats. Instead, the combination of carnivory and xeromorphic root features allows Drosophyllum to thrive on non-waterlogged soils. New evidence is added to recent research emphasizing the role of root systems of carnivorous plants in explaining their distribution, partly challenging the cost-benefit hypothesis.

ID SOUTHERN ENGLAND
AB In 1996 all of the heathland in south-east Dorset, southern England, was surveyed using the same recording protocols as those used in surveys in 1978 and 1987. This approach enabled the extent of the heathlands, the degree of fragmentation, and the composition of the vegetation to be compared at a landscape scale over a period of 18 years. Between 1987 and 1996 the number of heathland patches increased from 142 to 151 and the total area of heathland decreased by 552 ha from 7925 ha in 1987. The principal cause of this loss is succession to scrub and woody vegetation, which continues at a rate of 1.7% per year despite conservation management. The most significant vegetation change was a decline in the area of the vegetation types, wet heath and peatland. These had remained constant between 1978 and 1987, but declined by 376 ha (45%) and 150 ha (25%) respectively between 1987 and 1996. Although there is no direct evidence, it is speculated that changing weather patterns or pollution might be the cause. These heaths, like many in Western Europe, are subject to a wide range of national and international legislative instruments designed to ensure their conservation. These measures call for the monitoring of the status of the conserved areas. This study, which has extended over almost 20 years, provides an insight in to the problems of monitoring change in a biotope of high conservation status. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB European walnut (Juglans regia) plants were grown in pots, on peat soil contaminated with lead (Pb), for four years. European walnut was chosen because it grows in Mediterranean climates, it yields a high biomass, and a fine quality wood. In the above ground parts Pb concentration was 1000 times lower than in roots: in 50 g roots there was 450 mg of Pb. Microanalysis of roots found in periderm, more than 50% of the total root Pb. Pb L-III EXAFS spectroscopy was performed on: root powder from Pb-exposed plants, Pb-impregnated cellulose and lignin. Comparison of plant material with lignin and cellulose helped to envisage a plant disposal strategy for Pb. This may consist in establishing links with large organic molecules, which are abundant constituents of cell walls. EXAFS spectroscopy evidenced the presence of Pb-O bindings within the ligno-cellulosic structure in roots. Lead was scantly conveyed to the shoots, giving to walnut plants an added asset in Pb phytostabilization. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Silkstone Rock (Westphalian A, Langsettian) is a major multistorey channel sandstone formed in a delta plain environment with minimal marine influence. It occupies up to three interseam intervals in the east Pennine coalfield, England, and exceeds 50 m in thickness and 15 km in width at its maximum development, which is larger than many Westphalian channel sand bodies. The high ash content of coal adjacent to the channel belt indicates that regional peat accumulation took place contemporaneously with the existence of the channel system. The major channel system fed a number of minor channels during different interseam intervals, and conducted sediment and water into nearby delta plain lakes, via lacustrine delta and crevasse splay systems. These minor channels: which show a range of fills, are sub-parallel and show lateral offset stacking, suggesting that differential compaction was an important control on their location. The major channel belt acted as a long-lived distributary system that flowed towards the east, away from the overall basin depocentre, with its position being controlled mainly by deltaic processes.

AB We reconstructed the late Holocene vegetation of the Nain region (northern Labrador, northeastern Canada) in order to assess the influence of climate and historic land use on past shifts in forest composition. Chronostratigraphy was used in combination with macrofossil and pollen data from monoliths sampled from four peatlands. Paleoecological reconstructions produced a vegetation history spanning 4900 years for the Nain region that is largely concordant with other studies in Labrador. An initial open forest tundra phase was followed by an increase in tree cover at around 2800 cal yr BP. Paludification began similar to 200 cal yr BP. A decline in Picea and its subsequent disappearance from most of the sites occurred similar to 170 cal yr BP (AD 1780) in a period of relatively mild conditions during the Little Ice Age. This event was followed by the establishment of Larix laricina in the region. Local anthropogenic factors are likely responsible for these later developments, as they were not observed in other regional studies. The period around AD 1780 corresponds to the establishment of the Moravian missionaries on the Labrador coast, which increased the need for fuel and lumber. We conclude that changes in land use are reflected in the patterns of vegetation and hydrological change at the study sites. (C) 2016 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to metal (oxy)hydroxide mineral surfaces is a critical step for C sequestration in soils. Although equilibrium studies have described some of the factors controlling this process, the molecular-scale description of the adsorption process has been more limited. Chemical force spectroscopy revealed differing adhesion strengths of DOM extracted from three soils and a reference peat soil material to an iron (oxy)hydroxide mineral surface. The DOM was characterized using ultrahighresolution negative ion mode electrospray ionization Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The results indicate that carboxyl-rich aromatic and N-containing aliphatic molecules of DOM are correlated with high adhesion forces. Increasing molecular mass was shown to decrease the adhesion force between the mineral surface and the DOM. Kendrick mass defect analysis suggests that mechanisms involving two carboxyl groups result in the most stable bond to the mineral surface. We conceptualize these results using a layer-by-layer "onion" model of organic matter stabilization on soil mineral surfaces.

AB Perennially frozen loess deposits in the Klondike goldfields include paleosols formed in full-glacial environments, correlated by Alaskan distal tephra with Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 2 and 4. Patterns of organic and inorganic carbon and clay distribution, microstructures, and profile morphologies indicate that soil formation occurred in a base-rich environment in which organic matter accreted predominantly as root detritus. At sites approximately 20 kin apart, the expression of cryoturbation and ice wedge development decreases in strength upward in loess-paleosol sequences correlated with MIS 4, suggesting increasing aridity. Configurations of cryoturbation features and ice-wedge thaw unconformities, the presence of numerous ground squirrel burrows, and an absence of peat accumulation suggest that these substrates were predominantly well-drained, with active layers of equal or greater thickness than in modem soils on similar sites in the west-central Yukon. Some characteristics of these paleosols are similar to those of modem steppe and tundra soils, consistent with plant macrofossil evidence for local ecological diversity during full-glacial conditions in eastern Beringia.

AB The dating of landslide-buried organic materials potentially indicates non-stationary seismicity in northern Finland attributable to the release of lithospheric stresses during and after retreat of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet. The landslide age data reveals three episodes of increased slope instability and formation of landslides, from 9000 to 11 000cal BP, from 5000 to 6000cal BP, and from 1000 to 3000cal BP. While a seismogenic origin cannot be unequivocally established, we interpret that at least the early Holocene episode reflects increased seismic activity in northern Finland in association with late-glacial and postglacial faulting. The foci of slope instabilities changes through time, implying that different segments of the postglacial fault systems were active at different times during the Holocene. We also show that the correlation of landslide ages with the surface roughness and backwall slope is complicated. The morphology of landslide scarps is significantly affected by thickness of glacial sediments, liquefaction during landslide formation, and accumulation of peat upon landslide scars and deposits, and thus, the time-dependent erosional smoothing of the surfaces should be considered as descriptive and non-qualitative.

AB In this study we successfully enhanced surface activity of natural humic substances (HS) with respect to mineral surfaces by functionalization with organosilanes. Of particular importance was that modification was conducted in water. Humates from coal and peat and 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) were used as starting materials. Atomic force microscopy showed silanized HS produced self-assembled adsorption monolayers at the water-solid interface. These adlayers caused an increase in the surface hydrophobicity with contact angles equaling 56 degrees. Application of silanized HS for treatment of different soil compartments including mineral soil separates and soil aggregates revealed an efficacy with respect to both re-assembly of soil aggregates and restoration of their water stability. Furthermore, field trials on the treatments of native sod-podzolic soil with silanized HS indicated improvements in soil structure as compared to non-treated soil or treatment with the non-functionalized humate. Results demonstrating the use of silanized HS as ecologically-safe, nature-inspired soil conditioners were promising. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mangroves are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on the planet. The capacity of mangroves to store and accumulate carbon has been assessed and reported at regional, national and global scales. However, small-scale sampling is still revealing 'hot spots' of carbon accumulation. This study reports one of these hotspots, with one of the largest-recorded carbon stocks in mangroves associated with sinkholes (cenotes) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, sequestration rates and carbon origin of deep peat soils (1 to 6 m). We found massive amounts of SOC up to 2792 Mg C ha(-1), the highest value reported in the literature so far. This SOC is primarily derived from highly preserved mangrove roots and has changed little since its deposition, which started over 3220 years ago (+/- 30 BP). Most cenotes are owned by Mayan communities and are threatened by increased tourism and the resulting extraction and pollution of groundwater. These hot spots of carbon sequestration, albeit small in area, require adequate protection and could provide valuable financial opportunities through carbon-offsetting mechanisms and other payments for ecosystem services.

AB The Dubiciai glaciolacustrine basin was studied by means of geomorphological, lithological and cartographic methods in order to reconstruct water level changes during postglacial time. The formation of the basin and respective sedimentation processes began immediately after the deglaciation. Glaciolacustrine terraces in the Dubiciai basin formed during the Frankfurt (Gruda) Stage of the last glaciation, and during the DryasAllerod, Boreal and Subatlantic chronozones. Intense evolution of the basin took place at the end of the Late Pleistocene and in the Early Holocene. The greatest changes in the topography were due to thermokarst processes which began in the Allerod and continued until the Boreal. Climate became warm and moist at the beginning of the Preboreal and thus created good conditions for accumulation of gyttja, peat and freshwater lime. The latest stage in the development of the Dubiciai basin occurred in the 19th century. In 50 years the area of the basin decreased by 10 times: from 221 ha in 1850 to 20 ha in 1900. The last major change in the hydrographic network of the basin occurred in 195859 when an artificial drainage project was completed.

TI Polar aromatic biomarkers in the Miocene Maritza-East lignite, Bulgaria
SO ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY

DT Article
ID CONIFERS
AB Aromatic and polar compounds of lignite lithotype bitumens (Maritza-East) were analyzed. Diterpenoid phenols and ketophenols, i.e., mainly ferruginol, sugiol, hinokione, and products of their diagenetic transformations, were identified as the dominant biomarkers. A variety of sesquiterpenoids was present as well. These compounds provided evidence for the assumption that members of the Cupressaceae s. l. are the coal precursors. Polar triterpenoids, i.e., lupeol, lupenone, adiantone and hopanones were present in subordinate quantities in the humoclarain sample. These biomarkers support an input of deciduous (angiosperm) vegetation to the peat swamp source matter. Three diagenetic transformation schemes for the diterpenoid phenols/ketophenols are proposed: (1) ferruginol and/or sugiol alteration through dehydrogenation,. demethylation and ring-B-cleavage; (2) hinokione aromatization to simonellite; and (3) 7-ketototarol change through 7-ketototar-5-enol to 20-nor-3-oxo-totara-5(10),6-dienol. The identified diterpenoids demonstrated the presence of Gymnospermae in the coal forming community. Furthermore, the phenolic diterpenoids indicated a specific input of organic matter from conifers of the Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae or Podocarpaceae as the most abundant trees in the coal forming swamp.

AB Dunefields of the Great Plains contain stratigraphic records of episodic Holocene aeolian activity, potentially providing a valuable record of climatic change. It has been difficult to establish unambiguous links between activity at specific sites and regional palaeoclimate, however. Here we demonstrate that widespread late-Holocene aeolian activity in the Nebraska Sand Hills, the largest dunefield on the Great Plains of North America, occurred during a period of hydrological drought. Aeolian sand sheets are interbedded with peat that accumulated in interdunes throughout much of the Holocene. The youngest of these sand sheets was deposited between 950 and 650 cal. BP, about the same time as the most recent major episode of aeolian activity at upland sites up to 120 kin apart. Sand sheets could only have advanced across the interdunes if the local groundwater flow systems that maintain interdune wetlands were temporarily reduced or eliminated by a reduction in recharge. Both reduced recharge and upland aeolian activity are best explained by regional megadrought.

AB The Neogene Soma Basin, western Turkey, hosts three coal seams (kM2, kM3 and kPl) and several altered tuff layers within the Miocene sequences. This study focuses on the evaluation of coal-petrography, mineralogical and elemental compositions, as well as the Rock-Eval pyrolysis of the three coal seams from Eynez, Isiklar and Denis sectors, and to identify the mineralogy of altered tuff layers within kM2 and kPl seams. The routine coal quality analyses show that coal samples from the kM2 seam are characterized by lower ash yields and total S contents, and higher gross calorific values than kM3 and kPl seams. The mineralogical composition of the bulk coal samples varies between all three seams. The statistical treatment implies that major elements in bulk coal samples such as Al, Fe, K, Mg and Na, and the vast majority of minor and trace elements have inorganic affinity. The trace element contents and elemental enrichments in the coal samples are generally changeable from seam to seam, which could be related to differences in ash yield and mineralogy. Altered tuff layers, or tonsteins were identified in kM2 and kPl seams. The tonsteins are clay rich, and certain trace elements (e.g. As and Zr) are enriched in the coal layers beneath the tuff layers in the kM2 seam. This might be related to penetration of leached pore water into these layers and precipitation of epigenetic minerals.
   The coal-petrography composition and the coal-facies diagrams show that the precursor peat of the kM2 seam was accumulating under telmatic, mesotrophic, anoxic conditions, whereas the water level was high and stable. The relatively low ash yields and thicker coal beds suggest a lower clastic input from the basin margins, and water table fluctuations resulted in calcareous intercalations in the kM3 and kPl seams. These imply the development of limno-telmatic conditions whereas fluvial activity affected during peat accumulation of both seams. Considering the maceral composition along with the coal thickness, coal seams in the Soma Basin might display oil generation potential; however, the pyrolysis analysis shows that the studied coal seams are mainly gas-prone and only certain coal beds have mixed-hydrocarbon generation capacity. All data presented in this study indicates that lithological features, differences in coal qualities and elemental contents in the Soma Basin were mainly controlled by changes in the depositional conditions and the detrital input during Miocene.

AB In this study, we present estimated ranges in carbon (C) sequestration per kg nitrogen (N) addition in above-ground biomass and in soil organic matter for forests and heathlands, based on: (i) empirical relations between spatial patterns of carbon uptake and influencing environmental factors including nitrogen deposition (forests only), (ii) N-15 field experiments, (iii) long-term low-dose N fertilizer experiments and (iv) results from ecosystem models. The results of the various studies are in close agreement and show that above-ground accumulation of carbon in forests is generally within the range 15-40 kg C/kg N. For heathlands, a range of 5-15 kg C/kg N has been observed based on low-dose N fertilizer experiments. The uncertainty in C sequestration per kg N addition in soils is larger than for above-ground biomass and varies on average between 5 and 35 kg C/kg N for both forests and heathlands. All together these data indicate a total carbon sequestration range of 5-75 kg C/kg N deposition for forest and heathlands, with a most common range of 20-40 kg C/kg N. Results cannot be extrapolated to systems with very high N inputs, nor to other ecosystems, such as peatlands, where the impact of N is much more variable, and may range from C sequestration to C losses.

AB Key pathways for the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) have remained elusive, particularly in organic rich ecosystems. In this work, the occurrence of AOM driven by humus-catalyzed dissimilatory iron reduction was investigated in sediments from a coastal mangrove swamp. Anoxic sediment incubations supplied with both goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and leonardite (humic substances (HS)) displayed an average AOM rate of 10.7 +/- 0.8 mu mol CH4 cm(-3) day(-1), which was 7 and 3 times faster than that measured in incubations containing only goethite or HS, respectively. Additional incubations performed with C-13-methane displayed Pahokee Peat HS-mediated carbonate precipitation linked to (CH4)-C-13 oxidation and ferrihydrite reduction (similar to 1.3 mu mol carbonate cm(-3) day(-1)). These results highlight the role of HS on mitigating greenhouse gases released from wetlands, not only by mediating the AOM process, but also by enhancing carbon sequestration as inert minerals (calcite, aragonite and siderite).

   DRAINAGE EVOLUTION; CLIMATIC-CHANGE; TSODILO HILLS; MANTLE PLUMES; RIVER
   SYSTEM; PEAT FIRE
AB The Okavango Delta is southern Africa's largest wetland ecosystem and probably the most pristine large wetland ecosystem in the world. Alex du Toit was the first to recognize the role of faulting in the origin of the Delta, proposing that the Delta lies within a graben structure related to the East African Rift Valley system. The history of its rivers is more ancient, extending back to the breakup of Gondwana.
   Two mantle plumes initiated the breakup of Gondwana: the 140 Ma Karoo plume and the 130 Ma Parana-Etendeka plume. Domical uplift and rifting associated with these plumes created two major river systems: the Okavango-Zambezi-Limpopo system and the Vaal-Orange system. The climate at the time of breakup was hot and humid and the interior experienced extensive erosion, so much so that by the Oligocene (ca. 30 Ma), the sub-continent had been planed, to base level, rising only a few hundred metres above sea level and mantled by thick, leached soils (now known as the African Erosion Surface).
   Warping in the continent interior created uplifted arches and depressions, most notably the Kalahari basin. Arching severed the link between the lower Limpopo and its central African headwaters (Zambezi-Okavango), and a large lake formed in the Kalahari depression (Lake Palaeo-Makgadikgadi). This lake gradually disappeared, partly due to sedimentation but mainly due to the increasing dry climate.
   The East Africa Rift system commenced in the Afar about 30 Ma ago and began to propagate southwards. In southern Malawi and especially in Zambia, the path of rifting has not yet been clearly established and the region is characterized by numerous horsts and grabens. One of these grabens passes through the Okavango Delta. The formation of these grabens has profoundly affected the courses of the rivers in the region.
   The Okavango River debouches into the graben forming a large alluvial fan. Lakes have periodically existed at the toe of the Okavango fan where it abuts the bounding fault scarps, but these are not permanent. Some Okavango water discharges across the bounding fault scarps and flows into the Makgadikgadi depression to the southeast.
   The Okavango River catchment is largely underlain by Kalahari sand, which forms the major particulate sediment carried by the river. Consequently, sediment carried by the river is mainly fine sand, with little silt and mud. The dissolved solid concentration in the river water is low (ca. 40 mg/L) and consists mainly of silica and calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. However, the volume of water entering the Delta each year is large and hence the solutes constitute the largest component of the sediment carried into the Delta.
   The Okavango River discharges onto the alluvial fan where water is carried in channels that form the major primary distributaries. Channel margins are formed by vegetal material and are permeable, leaking water which sustains permanent swamps in the upper portion of the alluvial fan. The arrival of the seasonal flood increases the rate of channel leakage, forming the seasonal swamps on the lower fan. The advance of the flood water across the seasonal swamps is slow, as much of it infiltrates the ground, taking four to five months to traverse the 250 km length of the fan.
   Bedload is confined to channels and as water leaks through the channel margins, channel beds aggrade, increasing leakage, which further promotes bed aggradation. Channels eventually fail and water diverts elsewhere. Channel formation and failure results in a constant shift in the distribution of water across the Delta surface. The demise of a channel system results in desiccation of the surrounding peat, which is then destroyed by slow-burning peat fires. Nutrients and fine particulate material accumulated in the peat is released, enriching the soil.
   Most of the water delivered to the Delta annually is lost to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration because of the semi-arid climate. Transpiration of groundwater by terrestrial plants is the dominant means of water loss. The high transpiration rate of trees is particularly important: trees grow on islands and their transpiration lowers the water table beneath islands so there is a net flow of water towards islands. Solutes, especially silica and carbonates of calcium and magnesium, precipitate, leaving only the very soluble sodium carbonate in solution. Its concentration rises and impacts on the vegetation, resulting in a zonation in the distribution of plant species on islands. The salinity of the groundwater ultimately rises to the point where gravity induced advection occurs, thus transferring the sodium carbonate to the deep groundwater. This process prevents the formation of surface saline brine in the Delta and surface water remains fresh. The accumulation of precipitated solutes results in expansion and this form of chemical precipitation is the major mechanism of sedimentation in the distal regions of the Delta. Islands are mainly initiated as a consequence of termite activity during dry periods. Sand ridges which form by channel bed sedimentation may also result in islands.
   Constant changes in the distribution of water across the fan due to channel failure have profound effects on the ecology of the Delta: regions of swamp may revert to dry land, when rain flushes accumulated salts from the island soils; and formerly dry areas become seasonally or even permanently flooded. Such constant changes, operating on time-scales of decades to centuries, underpin the immense habitat diversity of the Okavango Delta.

TI Fingerprints and age models for widespread New Zealand tephra marker

AB The role of tephras in the NZ-INTIMATE project is a critical one because most high-resolution palaeoclimatic records are linked and dated by one or more tephra layers. In this review, first we document eruptive, distributional, and compositional fingerprinting data, both mineralogical and geochemical, for 22 key marker tephras erupted since 30,000 years ago to facilitate their identification and correlation. We include new glass compositional data. The selected marker tephras comprise 10 from Taupo and nine from Okataina volcanoes (rhyolitic), one from Tuhua volcano (peralkaline rhyolitic), and one each from Tongariro and Egmont volcanoes (andesitic). Second, we use four approaches to develop 2 sigma-age models for the tephras (youngest to oldest): (1) calendar ages for Kaharoa and Taupo/Y were obtained by wiggle-matching log-derived tree-ring sequences dated by C-14; (2) Whakaipo/V was dated using an age-depth model from peat; (3) 14 tephras in the montane Kaipo peat sequence (Waimihia/S, Unit K, Whakatane, Tuhua, Mamaku, Rotoma, Opepe/E, Porormi/C, Karapiti/B, Okupata, Konini, Waiohau, Rotorua, Rerewhakaaitu) were dated by simultaneously wiggle-matching stratigraphic position and 51 independent C-14-age points against IntCal04 using Bayesian probability methods via both OxCal and Bpeat; and (4) the five oldest tephras, erupted before ca 18,000 cal. yr BP, were dated by calibrating limited numbers of C-14 ages using IntCal04 (Okareka) or comparison curves of the expanded Cariaco Basin sequence (Te Rere, Kawakawa/Oruanui, Poihipi, Okaia). Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra, the most widely distributed marker tephra, was erupted probably ca 27,097 +/- 957 cal. yr BP. Potential dating approaches for the older tephras include their identification in Antarctic ice cores (if present) or annually laminated sediments for which robust calendar-age models have been constructed, high-precision AMS C-14 dating on appropriate material from environmentally stable sites, systematic luminescence dating, or new radiometric techniques (e.g. U-Th/He) if suitable minerals are available and errors markedly reduced. Further application of Bayesian age-modelling to stratigraphic sequences of C-14 ages, possibly augmented with luminescence ages, may help refine age models for pre-Holocene tephras with the largest errors. Finally, we discuss the critical role these marker tephras play in the ongoing construction of an event stratigraphy for the New Zealand region, which is a key objective of Australasian and Southern Hemisphere INTIMATE projects.

AB This review covers selected aspects of recent international efforts to measure and model greenhouse gas emission from northern wetlands, to identify the environmental factors that control gas emission, and to investigate wetlands' responses (particularly with respect to gas emission) to global change. Both bottom-up and top-to-bottom approaches, based respectively on local observations plus inventory of gas fluxes and inverse modelling of global circulation, agree on the size of the high latitude (>60 degrees N) contribution to global methane, which should be about 13% or 70 Tg/year. It has been shown that winter and spring fluxes are an essential part in the annual budget of CH4 and especially CO2 exchange (varying from 5 to 50%). Soil micro-organisms were shown to be able to respire during winter even at -16 degrees C. In comparison to aerobically respiring organisms, anaerobic methanogenic bacteria were less active in frozen soil, although they are subjected to significant stimulation by soil freeze-thaw cycles. The absence of immediate coupling of methanogenesis with plant photosynthesis implies that substrates for methane formation are derived from peat decomposition rather than from root exudation.

   CHRONOLOGY
AB A 198-m-long core was obtained from Lake Poukawa, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand for paleoclimatic analysis. A chronology extending back to ca. 120 ka has been developed using a combination of tephrostratigraphy, radiocarbon, optical, and U-Th disequilbrium dating. The core contains a new record of tephra beds, including temporal intervals poorly recorded elsewhere, and revises the dispersal for some known events. Thirty macroscopic tephra beds were identified, comprising 20 rhyolites with compositions consistent with previously studied tephra from Taupo and Okataina calderas, and 10 andesites-dacites compositionally similar to Tongariro and Egmont centre eruptions. Electron microprobe data provides evidence for a total of 24 rhyolite eruptions amongst the 20 macroscopic beds. Four widespread rhyolitic marker beds: Whakatane (4.6 ka), Kawakawa (22.6 ka), Tahuna (ca. 43 ka), and Rotoehu (ca. 50 ka) provide temporal constraints for the upper 40 in of the core. The occurrence of Opepe (9 ka) and Okaia (23 ka) tephra beds in this core extends their known dispersal to southern North Island. A previously unrecognised and chemically distinct rhyolite tephra (ca. 35 ka) was also found in the sequence. Twelve rhyolitic tephra occur in the interval 50-120 ka, a period in which the timing and nature of volcanic events is poorly understood at proximal sites of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The Lake Poukawa core provides evidence for widely dispersed tephra-producing eruptions from Egmont volcano and Tongariro centre back to about 120 ka. The tephra are glassy, unlike many proximal deposits, and can be geochemically fingerprinted, thus providing an opportunity to develop a framework for eruptions not assessable in proximal localities. The pre-50 ka, high-K Egmont tephra are compositionally similar to younger (post-30 ka) proximal pyroclastics, but differ from contemporaneous low- and medium-K rocks that characterise the proximal ring-plain of the volcano. An average Holocene peat accumulate rate of 1.5 m/ka and an average post-50 ka sedimentation rate of 0.78 m/ka are implied from the ages of interbedded tephra. However, the depositional history of the core is complex because tephra at a depth of 40 m, and optical and U-Th disequilbrium ages at ca. 103 in are the same age within analytical uncertainties. This implies either rapid alluvial sedimentation or unrecognised problems in the dating methods. U-Th disequilbrium ages, together with paleoecological information, suggest that a peat interval at 143-146 m depth formed during the last interglacial maximum (oxygen isotope substage 5e).

AB Florida climate in highly sensitive to both high and low latitude climate perturbations due to its latitudinal position surrounded by water masses that transport heat northward. A well-studied aspect is that middle Holocene conditions became significantly wetter in Florida, initiating widespread peat accumulation in the Everglades. This environmental change has been attributed to various climate forcings, such as migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), increases in tropical storm intensity, position of the Bermuda High, intensification of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and post glacial sea level rise (SLR). Discerning between these forcings is only possible with quantitative reconstructions from a transect of sites that are affected differentially. Application of a transfer function on a north-to-south gradient of pollen records from Florida lakes here shows that the pattern of increasing precipitation during the middle Holocene cannot be explained by SLR, but that ENSO intensification is an important contributing factor. Seasonal-resolved proxy records with improved age models are urgently needed to further solve these issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assessed the use of delta C-13, TOC and C/N values of bulk sedimentary organic matter (OM) to reconstruct paleoenvironmental and relative sea-level change from mangrove environments in Puerto Rico. The modern distribution of delta C-13, TOC and C/N values was described from 63 vegetation and 59 surface sediment samples collected from three sites containing basin and riverine mangrove stands, and was compared to microfossil (foraminiferal and thecamoebian) assemblages. Four vertically-zoned environments were identified: tidal flat (delta C-13: -18.6 +/- 2.8 parts per thousand; TOC: 10.2 +/- 5.7%; C/N: 12.7 +/- 3.1), mangrove (delta C-13: -26.4 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand; TOC: 33.9 +/- 13.4%; C/N: 24.3 +/- 6.2), brackish transition (delta C-13: -28.8 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand; TOC: 40.8 +/- 11.7%; C/N: 21.7 +/- 3.7), and freshwater swamp (delta C-13: -28.4 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand; TOC: 42.8 +/- 4.8%; C/N: 17.0 +/- 1.1). These environments had distinct delta C-13, TOC and C/N values, with the exception of the brackish transition and freshwater swamp zones that were difficult to distinguish on a geochemical basis alone. The foraminiferal assemblages were complicated by a group that did not show a relationship to elevation due to the presence of calcareous foraminifera occurring above mean higher high water (MHHW), likely resulting from washover or transport by storms. However, the ratio of foraminifera to thecamoebians (F/T) along with delta C-13, TOC and C/N values refines the distinction between brackish and freshwater environments. Using linear discriminant analysis, we applied the delta C-13, TOC, C/N and F/T distributions to a 1.7 m core containing a continuous sequence of Rhizophora mangle peat, which began accumulating at similar to 1650-1930 CE. Together, microfossils, delta C-13, TOC, and C/N values, and the core chronology from Cs-137 and radiocarbon dating revealed that sediments in the core likely accumulated in response to anthropogenic sediment delivery, making it unsuitable for relative sea-level reconstruction. We caution that in the absence of detailed litho-, bio-, chemo-, or chrono-stratigraphic analyses as presented here, care should be taken in interpreting sea-level histories derived from single dates on mangrove peats.

AB In this laboratory study using microcosms with seedlings of silver birch (Betula pendula), we explored whether Cognettia sphagnetorum (Enchytraeidae) can retain its important role of accelerating decomposition processes in soils and stimulating primary production under disturbance. We established systems with or without wood ash amendment (first-order disturbance) in the soil, either in the presence or absence of C. sphagnetorum. To test whether the systems treated with wood ash are more sensitive to an additional disturbance than the ash-free systems, the microcosms were later on disturbed by drought. To determine the influence of two disturbances on the enchytraeids and populations of other fauna, and the possible changes in the system functioning, measurements were made of the growth of birch seedlings, foliar N concentration, composition and biomass of soil microbial communities and leaching of N and dissolved organic carbon from the microcosms. Both wood ash application and drought exerted a clear negative influence on the populations of C. sphagnetorum. However, populations of this species were very resilient and recovered rapidly after drought in the ash-free soils. In the ash-free soils C. sphagnetorum tended to improve birch growth, increased the N content of the birch leaves, and decreased the root to shoot ratio. However, in the ash-treated soils enchytraeids had negative effects on these parameters. C. sphagnetorum impacted on neither N and C leaching nor soil microbes, whereas wood ash decreased microbial biomasses and changed their community structure (as determined by phospholipid fatty acids method and denaturing gel electrophoresis) and substrate utilisation potential (Biolog method). It was concluded that C. sphagnetorum can retain its influential role under varying environmental conditions, but that the stimulating or retarding effects of this species on system functioning can be context dependent.

AB It has been demonstrated that simultaneous exposure of Daphnia magna to suspended solids and a carbamate pesticide potentiates the toxic response to the pesticide. The toxicodynamics between these stressors were investigated to determine possible mechanisms of interaction. Three experimental series were conducted with D. magna to determine: the effect of food availability on carbofuran toxicity; the effect of food availability on jointly administered carbofuran and suspended solids; and changes in the magnitude of effects which can occur with suspended solids of different composition. These experiments demonstrated that both carbofuran toxicity and the joint toxicity of carbofuran and suspended solids to D. magna can be modulated by food availability. While it is clear that food dilution could contribute to energy stress, it appears likely that additional interactive processes also contribute to the observed synergism between carbofuran and suspended solids. Additionally, decomposed peat was shown to be less of a stressor to these pelagic invertebrates than inorganic subsoil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ANGLESEY
AB This paper provides an assessment of existing airborne baseline geophysical data in relation to the hydrogeological characterization of protected groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems (wetlands) in Anglesey, Wales. The attenuation of the radiometric data identifies the main areas of water saturation in the very near surface. The radiometric data have the potential to identify additional areas where similar degrees of saturation exist. The data may therefore be used to help define extensions to existing site boundaries and to provide information in the assessment of new wetland areas. The radiometric data also show regional-scale transition from the Carboniferous Limestone in the east, important for water supply to the wetlands, to older more impermeable strata to the west. The conductivity data appear capable of mapping the lateral extent of clay accumulations, concealed below peat cover which can act as a confining layer to the bedrock aquifer. At the regional scale the data reveal the extent of a former Holocene lake system and the hydrogeological control of a Carboniferous limestone-sandstone contact. The data therefore provide a non-invasive spatially continuous, characterization of the sites, improving the understanding of their dynamic water balances and, potentially, guiding further ground assessments and invasive investigations.

AB New methods of sampling, preparing and identifying fossil wood fragments preserved in browncoal are presented and used to aid in reconstructions of the vegetation from the Miocene Lower Rhine Basin (Germany). The technique involves laboratory charring wood specimens followed by routine identification with reflected light microscopy. Problems concerning the taxonomic identification of the fossil wood are discussed. A list of taxa is presented for the Garzweiler Seam and the implications for reconstructing the Miocene palaeoenvironment are discussed with reference to ecological comparisons of extant taxa: the nearest living relative approach. Results indicate a dominance of conifer wood types, mostly representing members of the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae; extensive sampling is required of both small (macroscopic) and large fragments to obtain results comparable with palynological assemblages. Up to now, twenty-one taxa of gymnosperms and angiosperms have been recognized from the Garzweiler seam. Data obtained are compared with those from pollen analysis and corroborate the previously identified trend consisting of increasing concentrations of Taxodium towards the upper section of the seam.

ID NATURE-RESERVE
AB Wetlands are one of the largest carbon sinks in the world due to their large carbon storage, potential for carbon sequestration in peat formation, sediment deposition and plant biomass. However, rapid economic development is causing changes to wetland carbon storage. China has participated in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and is decreasing its carbon emissions. Analyzing the carbon changes that are caused by wetland dynamics may provide some insights regarding decreasing carbon emissions. Therefore, wetland data from 1985, 1995 and 2005 were extracted from remote sensing images. Using spatial analysis and statistics, we determined that the water body area continued to increase, whereas the swamp, floodplain and shallow areas tended to decrease during the period from 1985 to 2005. Those changes caused wetland carbon stock to decrease. The conversion of other land use categories to wetland was the primary cause of carbon stock loss. Therefore, it is more beneficial for China to decrease per capita carbon emissions by decreasing carbon emissions from the conversion of other land use categories to wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Okavango Delta is a large, low gradient (ca. 1:3400), alluvial fan situated in a graben structure which is an extension of the East African Rift system. The catchment is situated in sub-tropical central Angola (rainfall ca. 1000 mm/a), and is underlain by Kalahari sand. Okavango River water therefore has a very low dissolved solid content (ca. 40 ppm), and a very low suspended load. The main elastic sediment load consists of eroded Kalahari sand, which is transported as bedload. Base flow in the river sustains about 4000 km(2) of permanent swamps in the Panhandle and upper fan. The latter are flanked by seasonal swamps, which become inundated during advance of the seasonal flood wave. This flood wave takes four months to traverse the 250 km length of the fan. The extent of seasonal flooding is variable and can exceed 12 000 km(2). The fan is situated in a semi-arid region (rainfall 513 mm/a), in which evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall by a factor of three. Only 1.5% of inflow plus rainfall leaves the fan as surface flow, the rest being lost to the atmosphere. All of the elastic sediment load and most of the solute load is deposited on the fan. In the Panhandle region, bedload deposition occurs on point bars in a meandering river system, and produces alluvial ridges. Periodic avulsions give rise to anastomosis of the channel. Sedimentation patterns on the fan at the lower end of the Panhandle are closely tied to ecosystem function. Channel margins in the permanent swamps consist of peat, stabilised by papyrus, and are permeable. Water leaks from the channels, causing channel bed aggradation. Loss of water and aggradation in primary channels leads to channel failure, and the destruction of the accumulated peat by fire. Leaked water flows along hippo trails in the backswamps, giving rise to secondary distributary channel systems. Constant change in primary channel location creates a mosaic of wetland habitats in different successional stages, from open water to near climax aquatic grassland habitats. Little elastic sediment reaches the seasonal swamps, and the main sedimentary process is by precipitation of solutes, primarily as a consequence of transpiration. Aquatic plants induce saturation in silica in interstitial water in the root zone. Trees, which grow exclusively on islands, are responsible for intense transpirational water loss which induces saturation in calcite, the precipitation of which results in vertical expansion and hence island growth. Groundwater beneath these islands eventually becomes saline, resulting in species zonation. Islands are initiated by termites, or result from topographic inversion associated with channel failure. The resulting undulating topography creates a variety of habitats which vary in their duration of flooding, and hence in their species composition.

AB Terrestrial permafrost archives along the Yukon Coastal Plain (northwest Canada) have recorded landscape development and environmental change since the Late Wisconsinan at the interface of unglaciated Beringia (i.e. Komakuk Beach) and the northwestern limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (i.e. Herschel Island). The objective of this paper is to compare the late glacial and Holocene landscape development on both sides of the former ice margin based on permafrost sequences and ground ice. Analyses at these sites involved a multi-proxy approach including: sedimentology, cryostratigraphy, palaeoecology of ostracods, stable water isotopes in ground ice, hydrochemistry. and AMS radiocarbon and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating. AMS and IRSL age determinations yielded full glacial ages at Komakuk Beach that is the northeastern limit of ice-free Beringia. Herschel Island to the east marks the Late Wisconsinan limit of the northwest Laurentide Ice Sheet and is composed of ice-thrust sediments containing plant detritus as young as 16.2 cal ka BP that might provide a maximum age on ice arrival. Late Wisconsinan ice wedges with sediment-rich fillings on Herschel Island are depleted in heavy oxygen isotopes (mean delta O-18 of -29.1 parts per thousand); this, together with low d-excess values, indicates colder-than-modern winter temperatures and probably reduced snow depths. Grain-size distribution and fossil ostracod assemblages indicate that deglaciation of the Herschel Island ice-thrust moraine was accompanied by alluvial, proluvial. and eolian sedimentation on the adjacent unglaciated Yukon Coastal Plain until similar to 11 cal ka BP during a period of low glacio-eustatic sea level. The late glacial-Holocene transition was marked by higher-than-modern summer temperatures leading to permafrost degradation that began no later than 11.2 cal ka BP and caused a regional thaw unconformity. Cryostructures and ice wedges were truncated while organic matter was incorporated and soluble ions were leached in the thaw zone. Thermokarst activity led to the formation of ice-wedge casts and deposition of thermokarst lake sediments. These were subsequently covered by rapidly accumulating peat during the early Holocene Thermal Maximum. A rising permafrost table. reduced peat accumulation, and extensive ice-wedge growth resulted from climate cooling starting in the middle Holocene until the late 20th century. The reconstruction of palaeolandscape dynamics on the Yukon Coastal Plain and the eastern Beringian edge contributes to unraveling the linkages between ice sheet. ocean, and permafrost that have existed since the Late Wisconsinan.

AB Wetlands are valuable for their function as C sinks, water conservation and filtering, flood control, and as a recreational landscape. In the Central and Southern Andes, peatlands (a.k.a., bofedales) are also a source of good quality pastures for wild and domestic South American camelids (Vicugna pacos, Lama glama, and Virugna vicugna). In the present study, whole soil samples from seasonally and permanently flooded bofedales were analyzed using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIES) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to assess soil organic matter (SOM) stability. The results obtained by both techniques were comparable (R-2 = 0.88) and proven to be reliable indicators of increased or reduced SOM stability and thus suitable methods for assessing its humification index. The humification values determined in the permanently flooded bofedal were lower than for the seasonally flooded one. Deeper in the soil profiles of both bofedal types, the humification process of SOM attains more advanced stages, with a relative increase of more recalcitrant organic compounds. An important factor is the presence of water in permanently flooded bofedales, which slows down organic matter decomposition due to anaerobiosis. Results from a portable LIES system also showed significant correlations when compared with both the bench LIES system (R-2 = 0.88) and the EPR (R-2 = 0.62). The portable system constitutes an affordable option for the in situ characterization of SOM. This assessment is of outmost importance in agroecosystems acting as green house gases sink or sources under variable climatic conditions.

AB Understanding temporal variations in soil organic matter (SOM) is important because SOM improves soil, sustains soil productivity, and sequesters carbon. The Tibetan Plateau plays a critical role in climate change at both regional and global scales. Thus, the main objective of this study was to investigate temporal variations in SOM content in Tibetan soils as an important indicator of climate change. SOM content data were obtained from soil surveys conducted in the 1980s and resampled in the 2000s. In this study, SOM content data from the A horizon of the soil profile were compared over time, and a paired t-test was conducted to verify differences between the two datasets. The results reveal that SUM content in the A horizon decreased significantly. To determine the causes of SOM content decreases in the A horizon, soil samples were grouped into ten soil types, four land-use types, and seven physiogeographical units. SUM content in four soil types (felty soils, cambisols in the World Reference Base (WRB) for soil resources; cold calcic soils, cambisols in the WRB; bog soils, gleysols in the WRB; and meadow soils, umbric gleysols/haplic phaeozem in the WRB), pasture, and broad valleys and basins of the south Tibetan zone of montane shrubby steppe decreased significantly in the A horizon. Based on the analysis of some known realities, this change should be attributed to pasture degradation resulting from overgrazing and climate warming. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The eddy covariance method was used for continuous measurement of the seasonal courses of the following parameters of the carbon cycle in a sedge-grass marsh type of wetland ecosystem (49A degrees 01'29aEuro(3)N, 14A degrees 46'13aEuro(3)E, South Bohemia, Czech Republic, Central Europe): gross ecosystem production (GEP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and ecosystem respiration. During a 3-year series of measurements, we recorded marked fluctuations of the water table, which affected the overall water regime of the wetland studied. Between-year differences in the water regime strongly influenced the total annual carbon sequestration. The lowest annual GEP and NEP of 996 and 152 g m(-2) of carbon, respectively, were recorded in 2006, a year with two large floods, one in the spring, the other in the summer. By contrast, in the dry year of 2007, with no flood, the highest annual GEP and NEP were recorded: 1,328 and 274 g m(-2), respectively. Significant differences were found in the efficiency of solar energy use for GEP [gross radiation use efficiency, GRUE = GEP/PhAR (photosynthetically active radiation), i.e., amount of carbon gained per energy unit]. The highest GRUE was recorded immediately after the 2006 summer flood. In 2007, the GRUE decreased linearly with rising water table. A variable water regime thus markedly affects the processes of carbon accumulation and the efficiency of solar energy use for organic matter production in freshwater wetlands of the sedge-grass marsh type.

AB The peak fallout in 1963 of the radionuclide Cs-137 has been used to date lake, reservoir, continental shelf, and wetland sedimentary deposits. In wetlands such dating is used to project the ability of wetlands to keep pace with sea level rise and develop strategies for mitigating carbon pollution using biological carbon sequestration. Here we demonstrate that reliable Cs-137 profiles are increasingly difficult to obtain from wetland soils. Among 58 soil cores recently collected from a range of wetland types and Cs-137 fallout densities across the United States, 25% contain no identifiable Cs-137 peaks. Less than 40% of Cs-137 ages are consistent with Pb-210 dating. We provide a new measure of Cs-137 peak clarity (tau) for our core dataset by comparing the 50% interquartile range of data around the Cs-137 peak for "ideal" cores profiles determined using Cs-137 fallout data to that of observed core profiles. Our results show that overall is tau approximately 10 times greater for observed cores than ideal cores. The deterioration in the Cs-137 peak has occurred due to radionuclide decay, Cs-137 migration in situ, which is ubiquitous in this study, and Cs-137 amendments from surface waters. Such deterioration likely extends to both Mexican and non-permafrost, Canadian wetlands. We recommend continued use of Cs-137 only if the full bound of dating uncertainty for both Cs-137 and an additional method such as Pb-210 is propagated into estimates of wetland vertical accretion and carbon sequestration.

AB Coastal wetlands are significant components of the coastal landscape with important roles in ecosystem service provision and mitigation of climate change. They are also likely to be the system most impacted by climate change, feeling the effects of sea levels rise, temperature increases and rainfall regime changes. Climate change impacts on estuarine coastal wetlands (mangroves, saltmarsh) have been thoroughly investigated; however, the impacts on coastal freshwater wetlands (CFWs) are relatively unknown. To explore the current knowledge of the impacts of climate change on CFWs globally, we undertook a systematic quantitative literature review of peer-reviewed published literature. We found surprisingly little research (110 papers of an initial 678), the majority of which was conducted in the USA, focusing on the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on CFW vegetation or sediment accretion processes. From this research, we know that SLR will lead to reduced productivity, reduced regeneration, and increased mortality in CFW vegetation but little is known regarding the effects of other climate change drivers. Sediment accretion is also not sufficient to keep pace with SLR in many CFWs and again the effects of other climate drivers have not been investigated. The combination of unhealthy vegetation communities and minimal gain in vertical elevation can result in a transition towards a vegetation community of salt-tolerant species but more research is required to understand this process.

AB The Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain (MACP) is an ecoregion with high biodiversity that is under imminent threat from sea level rise and habitat loss. Previous studies have shown i) the area to be high in lichen biodiversity, including endemic species, ii) the most lichen species-rich sites are the most imperiled by sea-level rise, and iii) common, widespread lichens have lost significant suitable habitat and are projected to lose more due to sea-level rise. Despite this, the spatial distributions of rare species and the compositional dynamics of lichen communities has not previously been examined. Here, we evaluate the community composition of 599 lichen species in 215 sites across the MACP. We tested whether community similarity is correlated with spatial proximity or environmental conditions. We found that sites with similar environmental characteristics had similar species composition, after controlling for geographic distance. Inland swamps had the highest per-site average number of unique species (1.3) and the two coastal ecosystems, maritime forests and pocosin (a unique form of peatland vegetation), each had an average of nearly one unique species per site. Across the entire MACP, 42% of species were found at five or fewer sites and these were mostly at sites under high risk of being affected by sea level rise. While habitats and species throughout the MACP have been projected to be negatively affected by sea level rise, our results suggest that rare lichens face particularly acute threats. Lack of suitable habitat inland at higher elevations may necessitate intensive mitigation, including facilitated transplants of both lichens and their host trees.

AB Mosses and lichens are important components of boreal landscapes [Vitt et al., 1994; Bubier et al., 1997]. They affect plant productivity and belowground carbon sequestration and alter the surface runoff and energy balance. We report the use of multiresolution satellite data to map moss and lichens over the BOREAS region at a 10 in, 30 in, and I km scales. Our moss and lichen classification at the 10 in scale is based on ground observations of associations among soil drainage classes, overstory composition, and cover type among four broad classes of ground cover (feather, sphagnum, and brown mosses and lichens). For our 30 in map, we used field observations of ground cover-overstory associations to map mosses and lichens in the BOREAS southern study area (SSA). To scale up to a I km (AVHRR) moss map of the BOREAS region, we used the TM SSA mosaics plus regional field data to identify AVHRR overstory-ground cover associations. We found that: 1) ground cover, overstory composition and density are highly correlated, permitting inference of moss and lichen cover from satellite-based land cover classifications; 2) our I m moss map reveals that mosses dominate the boreal landscape of central Canada, thereby a significant factor for water, energy, and carbon modeling; 3) TM and AVHRR moss cover maps are comparable; 4) satellite data resolution is important, particularly in detecting the smaller wetland features, lakes, and upland jack pine sites; and 5) distinct regional patterns of moss and lichen cover correspond to latitudinal and elevational gradients.

AB SE Poland - the Carpathian foreland and the northern part of the Carpathian Mountains - is a marginal, easternmost part of the area settled by Magdalenian people. Several sites of this culture were investigated in this area by archaeologists and naturalists during the last decades. Based on the results of those studies, landscape of the surroundings of three Magdalenian camps (within direct penetration range) was reconstructed in detail.
   GIS spatial analysis was used for 2D and 3D visualization of topographic surface features, both primary (slope and aspect) and secondary ones. The latter (viewshed and insolation) were calculated applying algorithms, based on DEMs (Digital elevation model) and other variables. On the relief maps of the sites' surroundings there were schematically presented the extent of the main types of plant communities (tundra, steppe, meadow, mixed forest, aquatic and peatland vegetation) at the time of settlement. All mentioned communities occurred near each of the investigated sites but in different proportions depending on the site age and altitude.
   Attractiveness of the studied sites for Magdalenian hunters resulted among others from: good topoclimatic location resulting in favourable insolation of the sites, location in the leeward sides of high relief elements protecting them from the westerly winds. Moreover, a vast view over the surrounding areas enabled hunters to observe migrating animal herds and set traps, especially in the widenings of the valleys closed at both ends by narrowings. Rich dwarf or meadow steppe and patches of dwarf tundra occurring in the valleys, were good pasturage for herbivorous animals hunted by Magdalenian people.

AB To predict the response of C-rich soils to external change, models are needed that accurately reflect the conditions of these soils. Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils-Sequestration and Emissions (ECOSSE) is a model that allows simulations of soil C and N turnover in both mineral and organic soils using only the limited meteorological, land-use and soil data that is available at the national scale. Because it is able to function at field as well as national scales if appropriate input data are used, field-scale evaluations can be used to determine uncertainty in national simulations. Here we present an evaluation of the uncertainty expected in national-scale simulations of Scotland, using data from the National Soil Inventory of Scotland. This data set provides measurements of C change for the range of soils, climates and land-use types found across Scotland. The simulated values show a high degree of association with the measurements in both total C and change in C content of the soil. Over all sites where land-use change occurred, the average deviation between the simulated and measured values of percentage change in soil C was less than the experimental error (11% simulation error, 53% measurement error). This suggests that the uncertainty in the national-scale simulations will be similar to 11%. Only a small bias in the simulations was observed compared to the measured values, suggesting that a small underestimate of the change in soil C should be expected at the national scale (-4%).

AB The effectiveness of nitrogen (N) fertilization in improving tree growth in saline forest soils is poorly understood. Hence, in this study, the interactive effect of N fertilization and salt stress on seedling physiology and growth was examined to improve our understanding of possible mechanisms for fertilization to mitigate salt stress. We compared physiological characteristics, growth, and foliar and root nutrient concentrations in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings planted in a peat-mineral soil mix during a three months study with N fertilization (0 and 300 mg N seedling(-1)) and salinity (0, 50, 100, 150 mmol L-1 NaCl) in a greenhouse experiment. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased net photosynthetic rates (Pn) and N concentrations in needles and roots, resulting in improved seedling height and root collar diameter growth and total seedling biomass for both species when seedlings were subjected to low salinity (50 mmol L-1 NaCl), while it did not help tree growth under high salinity (150 mmol L-1 NaCl). The physiological responses to combined salt stress and N fertilization did not differ between the two species; however, fertilization improved the growth of pine seedlings more than that of spruce seedlings under different salinity levels. The results suggest that the effectiveness of N fertilization in mitigating the salinity effect on seedling growth was species specific. Our study demonstrates that N fertilization improves tree growth through enhanced photosynthesis and N nutrition under low salinity and provides valuable insights into strategies to manage N nutrition in saline boreal forest soils.

TI 25 years of restoration of the river Nebel (Mecklenburg): effects on the
   ecological status and on the regulative ecosystem services

LA German
DT Article
DE riverrestoration; ecological status; ecosystem services
ID CARBON; WETLANDS
AB Within the past 25 years, extensive restoration measures were implemented along the river Nebel in Mecklenburg (> 7 million (sic)). The entire project is based on conceptual principles and as it is about to be completed in constructional terms, it is time to assess the implementation success. On that account, this paper shows to what extent the ecological status could be improved and how the measures affect the ecosystem services of the aquatic environment. Using relevant quality components, the actual upgrades in terms of ecomorphological conditions are demonstrated for a generic stream segment. Moreover, simple estimates are used for the assessment of some selected regulatory ecosystem services, e.g. (1) retaining greenhouse gas/carbon sequestration, (2) flood regulation, (3) low water regulation, (4) sediment regulation, (5) soil formation in floodplains, and (6) cooling effects (waters and floodplains). These services were monetized if suitable. For this purpose, current data as well as data from the early 1990s were used for a historical comparison. It can be shown that the beneficial effects of water body restoration on humans and society have to be considered in a much broader sense than the consideration of single ecological aspects let assume. The successes of renaturation in this respect are
   a reduction of greenhouse release from the peatlands of almost 20 % (approx. -9,000 tonnes a(-1) CO2 equivalent or damage reduction of approx. 720,000 (sic) per year),
   an increase in the flood retention area by approx. 17 % (approx. + 119,000 m(3) or monetary benefit of approx. 174 million (sic)), and
   an increase in the cooling capacity of water bodies and soils by more than 12 % (+ 1,815 GWh a(-1)).

AB Submerged macrophytes enhance water transparency and aquatic biodiversity in shallow water ecosystems. Therefore, the return of submerged macrophytes is the target of many lake restoration projects. However, at present, north-western European aquatic ecosystems are increasingly invaded by omnivorous exotic crayfish. We hypothesize that invasive crayfish pose a novel constraint on the regeneration of submerged macrophytes in restored lakes and may jeopardize restoration efforts. We experimentally investigated whether the invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii Girard) affects submerged macrophyte development in a Dutch peat lake where these crayfish are expanding rapidly. Seemingly favourable abiotic conditions for macrophyte growth existed in two 0.5 ha lake enclosures, which provided shelter and reduced turbidity, and in one lake enclosure iron was added to reduce internal nutrient loading, but macrophytes did not emerge. We transplanted three submerged macrophyte species in a full factorial exclosure experiment, where we separated the effect of crayfish from large vertebrates using different mesh sizes combined with a caging treatment stocked with crayfish only. The three transplanted macrophytes grew rapidly when protected from grazing in both lake enclosures, demonstrating that abiotic conditions for growth were suitable. Crayfish strongly reduced biomass and survival of all three macrophyte species while waterfowl and fish had no additive effects. Gut contents showed that crayfish were mostly carnivorous, but also consumed macrophytes. We show that P. clarkii strongly inhibit macrophyte development once favourable abiotic conditions for macrophyte growth are restored. Therefore, expansion of invasive crayfish poses a novel threat to the restoration of shallow water bodies in north-western Europe. Prevention of introduction and spread of crayfish is urgent, as management of invasive crayfish populations is very difficult.

AB The boreal forest is the largest terrestrial biome in North America and holds a large portion of the world's reactive soil carbon. Therefore, understanding soil carbon accumulation on a landscape or regional scale across the boreal forest is useful for predicting future soil carbon storage. Here, we examined the relationship between floristic composition and ecosystem parameters, such as soil carbon pools, the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of live black spruce needles, and normalized basal area increment (NBAI) of trees in black spruce communities, the most widespread forest type in the boreal forest of Alaska. Variability in ecosystem properties among black spruce stands was as large as that which had previously been documented among all forest types in the central interior of Alaska; we found an eightfold range in NBAI and fivefold range in mineral soil carbon and nitrogen pools. Acidic black spruce communities had significantly more carbon in the organic soil horizon than did nonacidic black spruce communities, but did not differ in any other measured ecosystem parameter. We explained 48% of the variation in total soil carbon with a combination of plant community indices and abiotic and biotic factors. Plant community composition was at least as effective as any single environmental factor or stand characteristic in predicting soil C pools in Alaskan black spruce ecosystems. We conclude that among the community properties analyzed, the presence of key groups of species, overall species composition, and diversity of certain functional types, especially Sphagnum moss species, are important predictors of soil carbon sequestration in the black spruce forest type.

AB Enhancement of biomass burning-related research is essential for the assessment of large-scale wildfires impact on pollution at regional and global scale. Starting since 6 August 2010 Moscow was covered with thick smoke of unusually high PM10 and BC concentrations, considerably affected by huge forest and peat fires around megacity. This work presents the first comprehensive physico-chemical characterization of aerosols during extreme smoke event in Moscow in August 2010. Sampling was performed in the Moscow center and suburb as well as one year later, in August 2011 during a period when no biomass burning was observed. Small-scale experimental fires of regional biomass were conducted in the Moscow region. Carbon content, functionalities of organic/inorganic compounds, tracers of biomass burning (anhydrosaccharides), ionic composition, and structure of smoke were analyzed by thermal-optical analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, liquid and ion chromatography, and electron microscopy. Carbonaceous aerosol in August 2010 was dominated by organic species with elemental carbon (EC) as minor component. High average OC/EC near 27.4 is found, comparable to smoke of regional biomass smoldering fire, and exceeded 3 times the value observed in August 2011. Organic functionalities of Moscow smoke aerosols were hydroxyl, aliphatic, aromatic, acid and non-acid carbonyl, and nitro compound groups, almost all of them indicate wildfires around city as the source of smoke. The ratio of levoglucosan (LG) to mannosan near 5 confirms the origin of smoke from coniferous forest fires around megacity. Low ratio of LG/OC near 0.8% indicates the degradation of major molecular tracer of biomass burning in urban environment. Total concentration of inorganic ions dominated by sulfates SO42- and ammonium NH4+ was found about 5 times higher during large-scale wildfires than in August 2011. Together with strong sulfate and ammonium absorbance in smoke aerosols, these observations prove the formation of secondary inorganic species associated with wildfire gaseous emissions and their transformation in aged smoke. Accumulation of carbonyl compounds during extreme smoke event in Moscow resulted from photochemical aging and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the urban atmosphere. The mixture of carbonaceous particles and dust revealed multicomponent structure of Moscow smoke aerosols, pointing the difference with non-smoke ambient aerosols. The abundance of group containing soot and tar balls approached at least a half of total aerosol concentration during extreme event, relating to elevated OC, EC and SOA. Fly ash groups contained calcium sulfates and carbonates from soil entrainment by hot air convection. Small-scale open fire experiments support the identification of specific chemical features of regional biomass burning and demonstrate the strong impact of large-scale wildfires on aerosol chemistry and air quality in highly polluted megacity.

Based on biogeochemical box modeling, Merico et al. (2008) suggested that a combination of (1) glacioeustatic sea level fall-induced shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation and (2) shelf carbonate weathering can account for the carbon cycle perturbation, but this finding has been questioned. Alternative proposed mechanisms include increased ocean ventilation, decreased carbonate burial, increased organic carbon burial, increased silicate weathering, and increased ocean calcium concentration. Here we use an improved version of the biogeochemical box model of Merico et al. (2008) to reevaluate these competing hypotheses and an additional mechanism, the expansion of carbon capacitors such as permafrost and peatlands. We find that changes in calcium concentration, silicate weathering, and carbonate or organic carbon burial each yield a response that is fundamentally at odds with the form and/or sign of the paleorecords. Shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation (CCD change), plus shelf carbonate weathering, sequestration of C-12-enriched carbon into carbon capacitors, and possibly increased ocean ventilation (C-13 excursion), offers the best fit to the paleorecords. Further work is needed to understand why the EOT carbon cycle perturbation is so unique when the forcing mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible (cooling and ice growth) are not peculiar to this event.

AB In order to predict the response of carbon (C)-rich soils to external change, models are needed that accurately reflect the conditions of these soils. Here we present an example application of the new Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils - Sequestration and Emissions (ECOSSE) model to estimate net change in soil C in response to changes in land use in Scotland. The ECOSSE estimate of annual change in soil C stocks for Scotland between 2000 and 2009 is -810 +/- 89 kt yr(-1), equivalent to 0.037 +/- 0.004% yr(-1). Increasing the area of land-use change from arable to grass has the greatest potential to sequester soil C, and reducing the area of change from grass to arable has the greatest potential to reduce losses of soil C. Across Scotland, simulated changes in soil C from C-rich soils (C content >6%) between 1950 and 2009 is -63 Mt, compared with -35 Mt from non-C-rich mineral soils; losses from C-rich soils between 2000 and 2009 make up 64% of the total soil C losses. One mitigation option that could be used in upland soils to achieve zero net loss of C from Scottish soils is to stop conversion of semi-natural land to grassland and increase conversion of grassland to semi-natural land by 125% relative to the present rate. Mitigation options involving forestry are not included here because the data available to calculate losses of soil C do not account for losses of soil C on drainage of semi-natural land.

TI MYCORRHIZAE ALTER QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF CARBON ALLOCATED BELOW GROUND
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL; SEEDLINGS; HYPHAE; ROOTS; FLOW; CO2
AB PLANTS and sails are a critically important element in the global carbon-energy equation. It is estimated that in forest ecosystems over two-thirds of the carbon is contained in soils and peat deposits(1). Despite the importance of forest soils in the global carbon cycle, fluxes of carbon associated with fundamental processes and soil functional groups are inadequately quantified, limiting our understanding of carbon movement and sequestration in soils. We report here the direct measurement of carbon id and through all major pools of a mycorrhizal (fungus-root) coniferous seedling (a complete carbon budget). The mycorrhizal symbiont reduces overall retention of carbon in the plant-fungus symbiosis by increasing carbon in roots and below-ground respiration and reducing its retention and release above ground. Below ground, mycorrhizal plants shifted allocation of carbon to pools that are rapidly turned over, primarily to fine roots and fungal hyphae, and host root and fungal respiration. Mycorrhizae alter the size of below-ground carbon pools, the quality and, therefore, the retention time of carbon below ground. Our data indicate that if elevated atmospheric CO2 and altered climate stressors alter mycorrhizal colonization in forests, the role of forests in sequestering carbon could be altered.

AB Total plant biomass, shoot growth rate, and the periodicity in shoot growth and color of hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy 'Tifgreen') in response to slow-release fertilizer N sources, rates, and application frequencies were studied in two, 120-day greenhouse studies. Plugs were planted in plastic cylinders filled with a growing medium of 93 sand : 7 peat moss (w/w). The first experiment was completed under progressively increasing photoperiod (13.1 to 14.9 hours) typical of the long-day requirements for bermudagrass growth. The second experiment occurred under progressively decreasing photoperiod (13.7 to 10.7 hours) representative of autumnal growing conditions and declining growth and N demand. Urea (URE), sulfur-coated urea (SCU), and hydroform (HYD, methylene urea polymers) were broadcast at N rates of 100 or 200 kg(.)ha(-1) and at frequencies of 20 or 40 days. Bermudagrass was clipped at 3-day intervals and the average daily clipping growth rate (increase in shoot dry matter; DM) reached a maximum of 11.5 g(.)m(-1) per day. Use of the least soluble source, HYD, produced the lowest total clipping DM, and at low HYD rate and frequency, leaf color intensity was frequently below the accepted standard of 7, in the scale from 1 "tan" to 9 "dark green". A greater responsiveness of bermudagrass to N rate and application frequency (increased clipping growth rate and color intensification upon N application) occurred under increasing photoperiodic conditions as compared to decreasing photoperiodic conditions. Both clipping growth and color changed cyclically through time and mainly under long-day photoperiod (>12 hours), with greater oscillation at longer fertilization interval (40 days). With either SCU or URE, at low N rate and frequency (total N application of 0.25 g(.)m(-2) per day), clipping growth rates were above 4 g(.)m(-2) per day, and turf color was at or above the minimum quality standard through most of the growing period. Higher total SCU and URE application rates, previously shown to increase N leaching losses in these experimental conditions, produced significantly more clipping growth and did not appear to intensify color sufficient to warrant the increased risk of N loss.

AB This study investigates the functions and vulnerability of mangroves in isolated atoll settings, by showing the mangrove development and carbon storage, based on the radiocarbon ages and detrital organic-carbon contents of cores collected on Fongafale Islet, Funafuti Atoll, Tuvalu. The mangrove peat formed a thin veneer, several tens of centimeters thick, and mangrove development was constrained by the formation of the reef flat. The initial mangrove development (389 cal yr BP) was much more recent than on other islands, possibly because the island is remote and weakly connected to other source islands. However, the mangrove forests in Tuvalu have geomorphic developmental rates and carbon burial rates similar to those in other settings. The mean carbon sequestration rate is six times that calculated previously from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) data for Tuvalu. High vulnerability of the mangroves is suggested by the small sediment thickness and recent development of the mangrove forests, as well as by the past vertical accumulation rates potentially smaller than those of future sea-levels rise. The conservation and restoration of mangrove forests should be one of the key issues in sustaining low-lying atoll countries under climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures.

AB Palaeocrivironmental sequences that describe the vegetation of the last glacial maximum (LGM) and of the subsequent climatic amelioration are relatively rare in the Australian, Southeast Asian and Pacific region (SEAPAC region). Here, we present the results of a palynological investigation from Lake Baraba, located in eastern Australia, which extends beyond 43 ka. Bands of oxidised sediment prior to the LGM suggest lake level fluctuations, however, lacustrine clays continued to be deposited throughout the LGM and into the early Holocene when the deposition of peat was initiated. The vegetation, a Casuarina woodland/shrubland with a mixed understorey, remained relatively stable from > 43 kyr to the early Holocene, suggesting that this sclerophyllous vegetation was resilient to changes in climate. The vegetation of the LGM at Lake Baraba does not conform to previous descriptions of a treeless south-eastern Australia, and it is possible that it was a refugium for woodland. Myrtaceae expanded at the expense of Casuarinaceae from the early Holocene, with charcoal analyses suggesting that fire was an unlikely explanation. There was no apparent relationship between Aboriginal site usage and fire activity and hence how Aboriginal people used fire at Lake Baraba remains speculative. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the absence of a fringing reef the Pacific Harbour coast of southern Viti Levu has evolved primarily under the influence of waves generated by the prevailing southeasterly trade winds.  By c. 3800 yr B.P., a coastal embayment had been partially enclosed by the formation of a gravel storm beach ridge.  Subsequent barrier progradation followed only when longshore sediment was transported into the area from the developing Navua/Deuba to the east, resulting in the accretion of a sandy beach ridge sequence.  The estuary/lagoon system enclosed by the barrier was converted into a freshwater swamp in which up to 4 m of peat accumulated.
   Evidence indicates that Holocene sea levels in the area are unlikely to have exceeded c. 0.6 m above the present level, which is consistent with most evidence from elsewhere in Viti Levu.  However, hydro-isostatic processes may explain the apparent inconsistency between the attainment of modern sea level at c. 4000 yr B.P. in the Pacific Harbour and Lobau areas of southern Viti Levu, and prior to 4500 yr B.P. in northern Viti Levu.

AB A chronosequence of five Visean (Aleksinian-Venevian interval, C1v, 326-336 Mya) paleosols on the territory of Moscow calcareous sedimentary basin (Brontsy quarry, Kaluga region) was studied in detail. Two lowermost paleosols are coastal peat-bearing paleosols developed under mangrove vegetation. Three upper paleosols develop pedocomplexes, in which the lower part is the marine limestone altered to different degrees by weathering/pedogenesis with the formation of eroded Rendzina-type soil. It is overlain by paleosols developed from terrigenous sediments of playa origin. They are characterized by elevated concentrations of Fe, Mg, Ti, Ga, and some other elements; the formation of secondary micritic carbonates, iron oxides, and smectites; and increased values of geochemical indexes (such as CIA-K). Smectite (low-charged beidellite) predominates in these paleosols. Iron oxides are represented by goethite and lepidocrocite attesting to the predominance of oxygenic environments. Pedocomplex at the Mikhaylovian/Venevian boundary is overlain by non-marine palustrine deposits known as "black rhizoidal limestone." The paleoclimate reconstruction based on the chemical composition data attests to its polycyclic character. The Mikhaylovian time was most humid was (similar to 1000 mm/yr). Later, starting from Venevian, gradual aridization of the climate began and annual precipitation decreased to 750 mm/yr and less.

AB Mor is a typical humus form in the boreal coniferous forests, but little is known about its air permeability and pore geometry. Thirty undisturbed core samples were collected from a mor layer under a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand. Air permeability (K-a) was measured in each sample at six different air-filled porosities (epsilon(A)) using a constant-pressure air permeameter. The air permeability and the air-filled porosity were used to determine different indices of pore geometry and continuity. The average K-a increased logarithmically from 7.4 x 10(-1) to 1.3 x 10(3) mu m(2) when epsilon(A) increased from 0.1 to 0.8. Both the air permeability and pore continuity were high when compared with most other mineral soils and well-decomposed peats. The variations in air permeability and pore continuity with epsilon(A) were very large. The studied properties had a very large spatial variation in the mor layer which could be caused by the variation in the quality of the debris and the environmental factors affecting the decomposition process during the development history of the mor layer.

AB The No. 6 Coal-bed from the Heidaigou Mine, Jungar Coalfield, Inner Mongolia is a super-large Ga deposit. The dominant carrier of Ga is boehmite in coal. The study of coal facies may provide genetic enrichment information of Ga and its carrier (boehmite) in the Ga deposit. On the basis of study on coal petrology and mineralogy, it was found that the No. 6 Coal-bed from the Heidaigou Mine of Jungar was enriched in inertinites and the microlitho-types were dominated by clarodurite. The maceral morphological features and association indicate that the coal-bed was formed in a dry sedimentary environment or in a periodic dry sedimentary environment caused by the alternating variations of groundwater level. The optimum conditions for the enrichment of Ga and its particular carrier (boehmite) were dominated by four transitional conditions: (1) the upper delta plain which was the transitional zone between alluvial and lower delta plains, (2) the transitional zone between the dry and wet forest swamps, being slightly apt to the dry one, (3) the transitional tree density between the thick and loose ones, and (4) the low moor that was the transitional zone between two high moors during peat accumulation.

AB Microorganisms play vital roles in modulating organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in soil ecosystems. The enzyme latch paradigm posits microbial degradation of polyphenols is hindered in anoxic peat leading to polyphenol accumulation, and consequently diminished microbial activity. This model assumes that polyphenols are microbially unavailable under anoxia, a supposition that has not been thoroughly investigated in any soil type. Here, we use anoxic soil reactors amended with and without a chemically defined polyphenol to test this hypothesis, employing metabolomics and genome-resolved metaproteomics to interrogate soil microbial polyphenol metabolism. Challenging the idea that polyphenols are not bioavailable under anoxia, we provide metabolite evidence that polyphenols are depolymerized, resulting in monomer accumulation, followed by the generation of small phenolic degradation products. Further, we show that soil microbiome function is maintained, and possibly enhanced, with polyphenol addition. In summary, this study provides chemical and enzymatic evidence that some soil microbiota can degrade polyphenols under anoxia and subvert the assumed polyphenol lock on soil microbial metabolism. It is thought that polyphenols inhibit organic matter decomposition in soils devoid of oxygen. Here the authors use metabolomics and genome-resolved metaproteomics to provide experimental evidence of polyphenol biodegradation and maintained soil microbial community metabolism despite anoxia.

AB Properties and compositions of soils originating from different sources usually vary, depending largely on the conditions of soil forming processes and parent materials. Our previous investigations of soils from contrasting localities showed linear correlations between carbon dioxide produced by soil microorganisms and thermal mass losses of air-dried soils recorded using thermogravimetry. The correlations were observed at temperatures corresponding both to moisture evaporation and thermal degradation of soil organic matter. In this work, those soils were combined into one group and the correlation analysis was repeated using both linear and power functions. Whereas the linear dependency between respiration and water evaporation was confirmed; the connection between respiration and thermal decay of organic matter appeared to follow power function. These findings indicate the existence of fundamental unifying principles in soil forming processes, in terms of water binding and clay-dependent organic carbon sequestration, notwithstanding the fact, that soils develop under contrasting conditions. Additional soils were analyzed in order to test the applicability of obtained models for prediction of soil respiration using thermogravimetry. The results indicate a promising potential of this method mainly for soils originating from areas undisturbed by anthropogenic activity.

AB The Taralgon Formation contains by far the largest brown coal resources in the Gippsland Basin, and is probably unequalled in the World for any single basin deposit of its type. Out of an indicated resource of 345 billion tonnes (Gt), approximately 10 Gt are currently listed as economically recoverable reserves. Low ash content (ave. 2.9% db) but higher organic sulphur contents (ave. 1.72% db) largely reflect the near-coastal depositional environments under which much of the original extensive peat swamps accumulated. The contained plant matter and coal types indicate a high-latitude rainforest environment where rainfall and temperatures were higher than present, and where lithotype cycling occurs. The coals appear to have accumulated at specific high stand periods of coastal onlap towards the end of the Middle and Late Eocene, and eustatic sea-level changes play an important role in development of the coal seams. The timing for maximum coal accumulation takes place at the apogee of a greenhouse world shortly before the cooling trends into the early Oligocene. During this time over 100 Gt of carbon was sequestered into these coal deposits. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The contribution of different C inputs to organic carbon accumulation within the soil profile in the Ultuna long-term continuous soil organic matter experiment, established in 1956, was determined. Until 1999, C-3-crops were grown at the site, but since then maize (C-4) has been the only crop. The effect of a total of 10 different inorganic nitrogen and organic amendment treatments (4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) on SOC in topsoil and subsoil after 53 years was evaluated and the contribution from maize roots to SOC after 10 years of cultivation was estimated.
   Soil organic carbon (SOC) and delta C-13 signature were measured down to 50 cm depth. The C content in the topsoil (0-20 cm depth) was 1.5% at the start of the experiment. After 53 years of treatments, the average topsoil C content varied between 0.9 and 3.8% of soil dry weight, with the open fallow having the lowest and the peat amended the highest value. Nitrogen seemed to promote C accumulation in the topsoil treatment effects were smaller below 20 cm depth and only two of the amendments (peat and sewage sludge) significantly affected SOC content down to 35 cm depth. Despite this, penetrometer measurements showed significant treatment differences of compaction below 41 cm depth, and although we could not explain these differences this presented some evidence of an initial treatment-induced subsoil differentiation. Ten years of maize growth affected the delta C-13 of SOC down to 22.5 cm depth, where it varied between -25.16 and -26.33(parts per thousand), and an isotopic mass balance calculation suggested that maize C accounted for 4-8% of total SOC in the topsoil. Until less than 2500 years ago the site was a post-glacial sea floor and the C-14 data suggest that marine sediment C still dominates the SOC in deeper soil layers. Overall, the results suggest that 53 years of treatments has caused dramatic changes on the stored C in the topsoil in several of the treatments, while the changes in the subsoil is much less dramatic and a small C accumulation in the upper subsoil was found in two of the treatments.
   The contribution from roots to SOC accumulation was generally equal to or greater than the contribution from amendments. The retention coefficient of root-derived C in the topsoil was on average 0.30 +/- 0.09, which is higher than usually reported in the literature for plant residues but confirms previous findings for the same experiment using another approach. This strengthens the conclusion that root-derived SOC contributed more to SOC than above-ground crop residues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing based biomass estimates in Arctic areas are usually produced using coarse spatial resolution satellite imagery, which is incapable of capturing the fragmented nature of tundra vegetation communities. We mapped aboveground biomass using field sampling and very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images (QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3) in four different Arctic tundra or peatland sites with low vegetation located in Russia, Canada, and Finland. We compared site-specific and cross-site empirical regressions. First, we classified species into plant functional types and estimated biomass using easy, non-destructive field measurements (cover, height). Second, we used the cover/height-based biomass as the response variable and used combinations of single bands and vegetation indices in predicting total biomass. We found that plant functional type biomass could be predicted reasonably well in most cases using cover and height as the explanatory variables (adjusted R-2 0.21-0.92), and there was considerable variation in the model fit when the total biomass was predicted with satellite spectra (adjusted R-2 0.33-0.75). There were dissimilarities between cross-site and site-specific regression estimates in satellite spectra based regressions suggesting that the same regression should be used only in areas with similar kinds of vegetation. We discuss the considerable variation in biomass and plant functional type composition within and between different Arctic landscapes and how well this variation can be reproduced using VHSR satellite images. Overall, the usage of VHSR images creates new possibilities but to utilize them to full potential requires similarly more detailed in-situ data related to biomass inventories and other ecosystem change studies and modelling.

AB We examined the role of chronic low-level nutrient enrichment on the productivity of heterotrophic marsh bacteria via a marsh fertilization experiment in which we mimicked the conditions of widespread coastal eutrophication by enriching entire salt marshes to approximately 153 background nutrient concentrations. We measured the uptake of tritiated leucine, as a proxy for bacterial production, in both low and high marsh habitats in four salt marshes, two of which were enriched with nutrients. We hypothesized that adding nitrogen in these detritus-rich systems would directly stimulate bacterial decomposition of marsh peat. Contrary to our expectations, we found no response to added nutrients in high marsh habitats, where there is a significant supply of organic matter from marsh vegetation. Bacterial production did increase in the low marsh habitats, where fertilization increased the standing stock of benthic chlorophyll. Fertilization did not directly increase bacterial production by providing added nutrients that could be used to decompose organic matter derived from nutrient-poor marsh grasses. Rather, bacterial productivity was indirectly stimulated by the concomitant increase in labile benthic microalgae in low marsh habitats. Decomposition of salt marshes may therefore have a greater resilience to the threat of chronic eutrophication than has been previously recognized.

AB This paper is the outcome of a group discussion held at the Savonlinna meeting 'Management of forest ecosystems and its impact on the GHG budget'. The aim of this break-out group discussion was to 'Characterize forest management impacts on the GHG budget of forest ecosystems in different European regions'. In this paper we briefly characterize different options that a forest owner has in order to maintain or maximize forest carbon pools and carbon sequestration. These hectare scale descriptions of measures are then regarded in connection to the current state of European forests and how they can be combined with ongoing management trends and local issues. We point out the various possibilities that exist in European forests, where they are located, and where they could possibly be combined with adaptation. We identify these hotspots for largest growing stocks, largest peat areas, and, e.g. largest risks for loss of carbon due to fire or urban sprawl. We conclude that one common strategy cannot be designed. Within each region, local solutions have to be found that optimize goals and aim at integrated and sustainable land use.

AB An international overview of the extent and type of ecological restoration can offer new perspectives for understanding, planning, and implementation. The Nordic countries, with a great range of natural conditions but historically similar social and political structures, provide an opportunity to compare restoration approaches and efforts across borders. The aim of this study was to explore variation in ecological restoration using the Nordic countries as an example. We used recent national assessments and expert evaluations of ecological restoration. Restoration efforts differed among countries: forest and peatland restoration was most common in Finland, freshwater restoration was most common in Sweden, restoration of natural heathlands and grasslands was most common in Iceland, restoration of natural and semi-cultural heathlands was most common in Norway, and restoration of cultural ecosystems, mainly abandoned agricultural land, was most common in Denmark. Ecological restoration currently does not occur on the Faroe Islands. Economic incentives influence ecological restoration and depend on laws and policies in each country. Our analyses suggest that habitat types determine the methods of ecological restoration, whereas socio-economic drivers are more important for the decisions concerning the timing and location of restoration. To improve the understanding, planning, and implementation of ecological restoration, we advocate increased cooperation and knowledge sharing across disciplines and among countries, both in the Nordic countries and internationally. An obvious advantage of such cooperation is that a wider range of experiences from different habitats and different socio-economic conditions becomes available and thus provides a more solid basis for developing practical solutions for restoration methods and policies.

AB We performed system studies of age parageneses and lateral conjugation of peat and gold accumulation areas as well as the regularities of formation of noble- and rare-metal mineralization in Cenozoic coaliferous deposits in the south of the Russian Far East. The migration properties of noble metals (NMs) and their behavior in different media are considered. Based on literature data and results of experimental studies, we performed analysis and selection of the most optimal methods for the quantitative determination of NMs and trace and rare-earth elements. The experiments have confirmed the NB fugacity and have shown for the first time the scales of transportation of NMs as ultrafine particles during coal combustion. The obtained results significantly expand the notions of the migration properties of NMs and serve as the key to the solution of the problem of NM extraction in analytical and technological processes. Also, areas promising for noble- and rare-metal mineralization have been revealed in coal basins. (C) 2013, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Terrestrial sediments are generally simple to differentiate from lacustrine sediments, but the interface between the two is difficult to recognise when clean beach sand is absent. In addition, tracing the dispersal of pollutant trace metals at this interface can be a major problem because toxic and natural metal cycles often take the same path. To solve these problems, we studied the natural geochemical processes in a wetland along the shore of Lake Taupo, New Zealand to characterise the surficial sediments that could be used as indicators of shoreline processes and to determine the variability of natural metals in the system. Lake Taupo is New Zealand's largest lake, The Stump Bay Wetland is part of the South Taupo Wetland, which is situated along the southern edge of Lake Taupo and has an area of 15.4 km(2). Although much of the surrounding shoreline has been modified by human activity, the Stump Bay Wetland has retained its natural configuration. To understand the variability at the terrestrial-lacustrine inter-face, we characterised the surficial sediments using shallow cores to learn the stratigraphy and geochemical make up of the sediment using X-ray Fluorescence (XR-F) for major elements and selected metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Ba). In addition, we installed shallow piezometers to relate the stratigraphy and geochemistry to groundwater flow and chemical composition (pH, alkalinity, dissolved Fe). Silt deposits derived from floods alternate with peat accumulations in shallow cores taken in the centre of the wetland. The reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron controls the South Taupo wetland groundwater pH and total alkalinity. Sediment cores from the wetland have high iron concentrations (up to 15 vvt.%). The abundance of iron in the cores does not correlate with either loss on ignition (LOI) or silica abundance, indicating that the iron is derived from a combination of decay of organic matter and leaching from volcanic rock material, Concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium and magnesium tend to increase with depth, and reflect the increasing amount of inorganic matter in the core. Sulphur concentrations in the cores are relatively low, and there is a weak correlation with LOI. Although conditions for iron sulphide precipitation are possible in the wetland sediments, it does not occur within the upper I in of the sediment. The low topographic and groundwater gradient of the wetland area has led to a close interaction between sediment build-up and the hydrochemistry of the water flowing into the lake. In particular, zones of iron-rich diagenetic alteration of sediments at the surface water-groundwater interface could be used to fix the position of the shoreline in paleo-lake studies, as long as the chemical interactions along the groundwater flow path are understood.

AB Fluvial processes play a crucial role in landscape development in periglacial regions. Geomorphological studies have yielded contrasting inferences about the importance of various environmental factors to drainage density. In this paper, 12 explanatory variables, based on relief, vegetation, soil, and rock type, were used to explain the controlling factors of drainage density in an area of 2880 km(2) subarctic Finland. Analyses were performed at multiple spatial scales (1, 4, 16, and 64 km(2)) based on two novel statistical methods, namely generalized linear modeling (GLM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP). The results of the GLM and HP analyses were broadly concordant. Most of the variation in drainage density can be explained by soil and vegetation variables. Drainage density increased with proportion of rock and gravel soils and alpine vegetation, and decreased with peat cover. Variables based on topography and rock type explained only a small amount of the variation in drainage density. The results also confirm the profound influence of the spatial scale on the geomorphologic systems: factors influencing drainage density yield different results depending on the spatial scale at which drainage density is analyzed. The large data sets and the use of rigorous statistical techniques at four different scales add the confidence and generality for the present results.

AB Denitrification (N2 production) and oxygen consumption rates were measured at ambient field nitrate concentrations during summer in sediments from eight wetlands (mixed hardwood swamps, cedar swamps, heath dominated shrub wetland, herbaceous peatland, and a wetland lacking live vegetation) and two streams. The study sites included wetlands in undisturbed watersheds and in watersheds with considerable agricultural and/or sewage treatment effluent input. Denitrification rates measured in intact cores of water-saturated sediment ranged from less-than-or-equal-to 20 to 260 mumol N m-2 h-1 among the three undisturbed wetlands and were less variable (180 to 260 mumol N m-2 h-1) among the four disturbed wetlands. Denitrification rates increased when nitrate concentrations in the overlying water were increased experimentally (1 up to 770 muM), indicating that nitrate was an important factor controlling denitrification rates. However, rates of nitrate uptake from the overlying water were not a good predictor of denitrification rates because nitrification in the sediments also supplied nitrate for denitrification. Regardless of the dominant vegetation, pH, or degree of disturbance, denitrification rates were best correlated with sediment oxygen consumption rates (r2 = 0.912) indicating a relationship between denitrification and organic matter mineralization and/or sediment nitrification rates. Rates of denitrification in the wetland sediments were similar to those in adjacent stream sediments. Rates of denitrification in these wetlands were within the range of rates previously reported for water-saturated wetland sediments and flooded soils using whole core N-15 techniques that quantify coupled nitrification/denitrification, and were higher than rates reported from aerobic (non-saturated) wetland sediments using acetylene block methods.

AB For the past 70 yr, researchers in the Soil Science/Renewable Resources Department at the University of Alberta have used isotopes to study topics of ecological importance. This review highlights the soil isotope research conducted within our department over this time, including an historical overview of studies of interest. Analytical techniques and advances in instrumentation are discussed, focusing on the measurement of light stable isotope ratios (i.e., for C, H, N, S, and O) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Early soil isotope work (1950-2000s) focused on agricultural soils and soil fertility issues. These studies included the use of radioactive isotopes such as C-14 and S-35, and (or) artificially enriched stable isotopes including N-15-labelled fertilizers. More recently (2000-present), the scope of research widened to include natural-abundance stable isotope ratio studies as higher-sensitivity IRMS systems became more prevalent. Current isotope research topics include N biogeochemistry in natural and managed ecosystems, land management effects on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon cycling in northern landscapes, paleo-reconstruction in peatlands, carbon sequestration in boreal forests, and biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Further technological progress also enabled new techniques such as compound-specific IRMS analysis, including delta C-13 and delta H-2 measurements of soil n-alkanes and phospholipid fatty acids. In conclusion, current IRMS instrumentation presents unparalleled opportunities for multidisciplinary research to track carbon, plant nutrients, and pollutants as they move through soils.

AB 1. A fertilization experiment was performed to identify the limiting nutrient for the growth of submerged vegetation in ditches of a peat-grassland system in the Netherlands, in which restoration measures involved ceasing fertilization, exporting nutrients by removal of above-ground plant mass and large-scale introduction of calcium-rich, nutrient-poor artesian water.
   2. Growth of Elodea was significantly enhanced by enrichment with nitrogen alone, and by fertilization with nitrogen in combination with phosphorus, and by nitrogen in combination with phosphorus and potassium.
   3. Plant tissue nutrient concentrations increased significantly, for nitrogen by enrichment with nitrogen alone, and with nitrogen in combination with phosphorus and potassium; for phosphorus by enrichment with phosphorus alone and with phosphorus in combination with nitrogen and potassium; tissue concentrations of potassium were not enhanced by any treatment.
   4. The elemental ratios of treated plants indicated that nitrogen, rather than phosphorus, was limiting in all treatments, except in those involving nitrogen and NK enrichment (when phosphorus was limiting).
   5. The efficiency with which plants used nutrients declined with increased supply of nitrogen and phosphorus, but was unchanged when potassium was increased. Efficiencies were similar to those of other aquatic macrophytes.

AB The oil and gas industry has grown significantly throughout the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America. A major feature of the ecological footprint of oil and gas exploration is seismic lines-narrow corridors used to transport and deploy geophysical survey equipment. These lines, which traverse forests, tundra, uplands, and peatlands, were historically up to 10 m wide. Over the past decade, seismic lines have decreased in width (in some cases down to 1.75-3m); however, their density has increased drastically and their construction is expected to continue in regions of Canada and the United States that are rich in oil and gas resources. We examine the literature related to the environmental impacts of, and restoration and reclamation efforts associated with, seismic lines in the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America. With respect to conventional seismic lines, numerous studies report significant and persistent environmental changes along these lines and slow recovery of vegetation that translates into a lasting fragmentation of the landscape. This fragmentation has many ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem processes, including significant implications for threatened woodland caribou herds. While modern, low-impact seismic lines have comparatively lower ecological effects at the site-level, their high density and associated potential edge effects suggest that their actual environmental impact may be underestimated. Seismic line restoration is a critical aspect of future integrated landscape management in hydrocarbon-rich regions of the boreal-arctic, and if widely applied, has the potential to benefit a wide range of species and maintain or re-establish key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity.

AB The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is a non-profit association promoting sustainable palm oil through a voluntary certification scheme. Two successive science-based working groups on greenhouse gas (GHG) were active in RSPO from 2009 to 2011, with the aim of identifying ways of achieving meaningful and verifiable reductions of GHG emissions. One of the outputs of the second group is PalmGHG, a GHG calculator using the life cycle assessment approach to quantify major sources of emissions and sequestration for individual palm oil mills and their supply base. A pilot study was carried out in 2011 with nine RSPO member companies that gave an average of 1.67 t CO(2)e/t crude palm oil (CPO), with a range of 0.02 to +8.32 t CO(2)e/t CPO. Previous land use and the area of peat soil used were the main causes of the variation. Further modifications to PalmGHG continue to be made in order to make the tool more flexible and comprehensive, to refine default values, and to render it more user-friendly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Unusually large and locally variable carbon isotope excursions coincident with mass extinctions at the end of the Permian Period (253 Ma) and Guadalupian Epoch (260 Ma) can be attributed to methane outbursts to the atmosphere. Methane has isotopic values ( delta C-13) low enough to reduce to feasible amounts the carbon required for isotopic mass balance. The duration of the carbon isotopic excursions and inferred methane releases are here constrained to < 10,000 yr by counting annual varves in lake deposits and by estimating peat accumulation rates. On paleogeographic maps, the most marked carbon isotope excursions form linear arrays back to plausible methane sources: end-Permian Siberian Traps and Longwood-Bluff intrusions of New Zealand and end-Guadalupian Emeishan Traps of China. Intrusion of coal seams by feeder dikes to flood basalts could create successive thermogenic methane outbursts of the observed timing and magnitude, but these are unreasonably short times for replenishment of marine or permafrost sources of methane. Methane released by fracturing and heating of coal during intrusion of large igneous provinces may have been a planetary hazard comparable with bolide impact.

AB The latest Permian extinction (252 Myr ago) was the most severe in the geologic record. On land, widespread Late Permian gymnosperm/seed-fern dominated forests appear to have suffered rapid and almost complete destruction, as evidenced by increased soil erosion and changes in fluvial style in deforested areas, signs of wildfires, replacement of trees by lower plants, and almost complete loss of peat-forming and fire-susceptible vegetation. Permian-Triassic boundary strata at many sites show two widespread palynological events in the wake of the forest destruction: The fungal event, evidenced by a thin zone with >95% fungal cells (Reduviasporonites) and woody debris, found in terrestrial and marine sediments, and the acritarch event, marked by the sudden flood of unusual phytoplankton in the marine realm. These two events represent the global temporary explosive spread of stress-tolerant and opportunistic organisms on land and in the sea just after the latest Permian disaster. They represent unique events, and thus they can provide a time marker in correlating latest Permian marine and terrestrial sequences.

AB Relationship between the phenolics content and the decomposition rate of Carex nigra, Scirpus sylvaticus, Phalaris arundinacea and Phragmites australis was evaluated in this study. The study was aimed at the selection of plants growing in the Czech Republic, that can be used for constructed wetlands treating agricultural runoff and that can also contribute to carbon sequestration. Plant decomposition was studied using the litterbag experiments lasting 365 days. One set of samples (each plant from three various location in four replicates) were taken after 81, 173, 301 and 365 days and decomposition rate was evaluated. The phenolics concentrations in aboveground biomass of selected macrophytes were varied in narrow range from 6.73 +/- 1.26 g.kg(-1) (leaves of P. arundinacea) to 14.09 +/- 3.52 g.kg(-1) (C. nigra). On the other hand, decomposition rate significantly varied among different plants and different plan parts as well. The close relationship between the concentrations of phenolics and decomposition rates was found for C. nigra, S. sylvaticus and leaves of P. arundinacea and P. australis in this study - the higher the phenolics concentration, the lower decomposition rate. The study also revealed a very strong relationship between total phenolics/total nitrogen ratio in the biomass, and therefore, the plants with high phenolics content would be more efficient in carbon sequestration. It is necessary to extend the research with the aim to find other plants naturally occurring in the Czech Republic characterized by high concentration of phenolics in the aboveground biomass, thus, having the potential of slow decomposition and high carbon sequestration.

AB Wetlands are a valued ecosystem because of their ability to improve water quality through pollutant removal, their high biodiversity, their carbon sequestration capabilities, and their ability to dampen storm hydrographs through water storage. However, wetlands also contribute to global warming, most obviously through microbial methane production. Driving the biochemical processes that enable methanogenesis is a diverse community of microorganisms under the influence of multiple environmental factors that are poorly constrained in greenhouse gas flux models. Sediments were collected from several distinct microsites across a fresh-water, constructed temperate wetland in Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A. Depth and temperature were tested for their influence on methane emission rates under two controlled temperatures. Pyrosequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate microbial communities associated with microsites and depths. Unvegetated, open-water and vegetated microsite sediments had similar potential methane flux rates when cores were separated into shallow and deeper depths. Deeper sediments lacked the ability to produce detectable methane without substrate addition. A 10 degrees C increase in temperature accelerated the rate of methane production and carbon dioxide respiration by 2-3 fold across all microsites. Methanogens were initially most prevalent in sediments collected from open-water microsite sediments, although had little effect on potential methane flux rates during incubations. These results suggest that upper limit methane emissions are similar across microsites in the absence of other field scale effects, such as redox boundaries, vegetation, or hydrologic fluctuations.

AB The Upper No. 3 coal of the Early Permian age is a major workable seam in the southwestern Shandong coalfield, which is located in the eastern part of North China. From Early Jurassic to Neogene, the coalfield was subjected to intensive tectonic processes, leading to a significant rearrangement in depth of coal seams. In this paper, three Upper No. 3 coals occurring at -228, -670 and -938 m in the Luxi, Liangbaosi, and Tangkou mines, respectively, were collected to investigate their mineralogical and geochemical characteristics, with emphasis on modes of occurrence and origin of epigenetic minerals. The three coal seams are similar in vitrinite reflectance, volatile matter yield, and maceral components, suggesting insignificant influence from the tectonic activities on coal rank. Terrigenous minerals (e.g., kaolinite and quartz) are comparable in both types and distribution patterns in the three coals. The presence of siderite and pyrite of syngenetic or penecontemporaneous origin indicate they were emplaced during peat accumulation. The distribution of epigenetic minerals (e.g., calcite, ankerite, and dolomite) are associated with the underground water activities, which were Ca (Mg, Fe)-bearing.

AB In the Northeastern U.S., salt marsh area is in decline. Habitat change analysis has revealed fragmentation, displacement of high marsh by low marsh species, and marsh drowning, while development of adjacent uplands limits upslope migration. Measures of marsh vegetation loss for eight sites in Rhode Island and New York between ca.1970 and 2011 indicate that substantial loss has occurred over past decades, with higher loss rates found for lower elevation salt marshes. Using inundation experiments, field surveys, and LiDAR datasets, we developed an elevation-productivity relationship for Spartina alterniflora specific to the U.S. Northeast, and located current salt marsh orthometric heights on this curve. We estimate that 87 % of Northeastern salt marshes are located at elevations where growth is limited by inundation. By manipulating water column nutrients, precipitation, and elevation, we further found that altered precipitation regime was associated with significant reductions in biomass, and that nutrient enrichment adversely impacts organic matter accumulation and peat formation. These results provide evidence that Northeastern U.S. marshes are vulnerable to the effects of accelerated sea level rise, and that neither precipitation changes, nor cultural eutrophication, will contribute positively to long-term salt marsh survival.

AB The highly visible coastal phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) was examined through the prism of carbon accumulation and loss. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestration in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes. Hurricanes, such as Katrina and Rita, have triggered instantaneous large carbon losses of sequestered soil carbon through the destruction of large areas of marsh. This analysis shows proposed coastal restoration efforts will not be sufficient to restore carbon losses by storms and marsh deterioration. Further, we have estimated the economic benefit of carbon sequestration for coastal wetland restoration efforts. Results show that LA coastal marshes may not serve as a net sink of carbon. These results may serve as a predictor of the impact of future predictions of increasing global sea level rise on carbon sequestration for other coastal regions.

AB Comparison of a set of paleogeographic maps of Africa for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) allows us to discuss the contribution of paleocontinental proxy-data in paleobiomass calculations and their accuracy.
   Maps show considerable shifts in the area covered by the main ecosystems. In this study we have quantified these areal changes, from the LGM to the HCO, in terms of variations in carbon storage. Each biome has been assigned a carbon density in living and soil organic matter. From desert to tropical forest the mean carbon densities vary from 0 to 20 kg m-2 for phytomass and from 0 to 13 kg m-2 for soil (peat excluded). During the world deglaciation Africa was a sink for 154 Gt (standard deviation 42 Gt) of atmospheric carbon. Since the HCO Africa has been a source of carbon. More recently human deforestation is responsible for a carbon flux towards the atmosphere which is ten times the mean annual flux due to vegetation change in response to climate change.
   Extended to a global scale this regional test shows that the paleoenvironmental approach is more appropriate for paleobiomass estimates than calculations based only on oceanic data.

AB We conducted a low-level phosphorus (P) enrichment study in two oligotrophic freshwater wetland communities ( wet prairies [WP] and sawgrass marsh [SAW]) of the neotropical Florida Everglades. The experiment included three P addition levels (0, 3.33, and 33.3 mg P m(-2) month(-1)), added over 2 years, and used in situ mesocosms located in northeastern Everglades National Park, Fla., USA. The calcareous periphyton mat in both communities degraded quickly and was replaced by green algae. In the WP community, we observed significant increases in net aboveground primary production (NAPP) and belowground biomass. Aboveground live standing crop (ALSC) did not show a treatment effect, though, because stem turnover rates of Eleocharis spp., the dominant emergent macrophyte in this community, increased significantly. Eleocharis spp. leaf tissue P content decreased with P additions, causing higher C: P and N: P ratios in enriched versus unenriched plots. In the SAW community, NAPP, ALSC, and belowground biomass all increased significantly in response to P additions. Cladium jamaicense leaf turnover rates and tissue nutrient content did not show treatment effects. The two oligotrophic communities responded differentially to P enrichment. Periphyton which was more abundant in the WP community, appeared to act as a P buffer that delayed the response of other ecosystem components until after the periphyton mat had disappeared. Periphyton played a smaller role in controlling ecosystem dynamics and community structure in the SAW community. Our data suggested a reduced reliance on internal stores of P by emergent macrophytes in the WP that were exposed to P enrichment. Eleocharis spp. rapidly recycled P through more rapid aboveground turnover. In contrast, C. jamaicense stored added P by initially investing in belowground biomass, then shifting growth allocation to aboveground tissue without increasing leaf turnover rates. Our results suggest that calcareous wetland systems throughout the Caribbean, and oligotrophic ecosystems in general, respond rapidly to low-level additions of their limiting nutrient.

AB The REVEALS model is applied in quantitative vegetation reconstruction to translate pollen percentage data from large lakes and peatlands into regional vegetation composition. The model was first presented in 2007 and has gained increasing attention. It is a core element of the Landcover 6k initiative within the PAGES project. The REVEALS model has two critical components: the pollen dispersal model and pollen productivity estimates (PPEs). To study the consequences of model settings, we implemented REVEALS in R. We use a state-of-the-art Lagrangian stochastic dispersal model (LSM) and compare model outcomes with calculations based on a conventional Gaussian plume dispersal model (GPM). In the LSM turbulence causes pollen fall speed to have little effect on the dispersal pattern whereas fall speed is a major factor in the GPM. Dispersal models are also used to derive PPEs. The unrealistic GPM produces PPEs that do not describe actual pollen productivity, but rather serve as a basin specific correction factor. A test with pollen and vegetation data from NE Germany shows that REVEALS performs best when applied with the LSM. REVEALS applications with the GPM can produce realistic results, but only if unrealistic PPEs are used. We discuss the derivation of PPEs and further REVEALS applications. Our REVEALS implementation is freely available as the 'REVEALSinR' function within the R package DISQOVER. REVEALSinR offers an environment for experimentation and analysing model sensitivities. We encourage further experiments and welcome comments on our tool.

AB On-going permafrost thaw in discontinuous permafrost regions produces significant amounts of small permafrost subsidence and depressions, while large lakes are likely to drain into streams and rivers. The intensification of permafrost thaw may alter the size distribution and chemical composition of organo-Fe-Al colloids in lakes and rivers. We used a continuum of surface water bodies, from permafrost subsidence, small depressions and thaw ponds to large lakes and rivers that drain the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), to assess OC, major and the trace element size distribution between the 20-mu m, 5-mu m, 1.2-mu m, 0.45-mu m, 0.22-mu m, 0.025-mu m and 1-kDa (similar to 1.4 nm) size fractions. This approach allowed us to distinguish the organic and organo-ferric colloids that were responsible for the transport of trace elements in surface waters and address their evolution during possible physico-chemical and biological processes. Both conventionally dissolved (<0.22 mu m) and low-molecular-weight (<1 kDa) fractions exhibited an order of magnitude decrease in DOC/Fe in the landscape continuum "depressions and permafrost subsidence -> thaw ponds -> thermokarst lakes -> streams -> rivers". Thermodynamic modeling and on-site size separation suggested that a number of trace elements (TEs), including alkaline earth elements and several micronutrients (Zn, Ba, Mn, and Ni), decreased the degree of their binding to DOM along the landscape continuum, whereas the majority of insoluble TEs (Al, Fe, Co, Cd, Cu, Pb, REEs, Th, and U) remained complexed with DOM in the LMW<1 kDa fraction. Two primary sites of colloid generation included (i) ground vegetation and peat leaching, which supplied DOM complexes of divalent metals and organo-Al entities to thaw ponds and lakes; and (ii) Fe2+ oxidation and TE co-precipitation with Fe hydroxides in the presence of surface DOM at groundwater discharge sites within the riparian/hyporheic zones of rivers. Under a warming climate scenario, an increase in the thickness of the thawing depth will intensify the input of inorganic components from deep mineral horizons and possibly underground waters thus producing the enrichment of large lakes in Fe-rich colloids and particles. The speciation of divalent metal micronutrients (Cu, Ni, and Co) and toxic metals (Al, Cd, Pb, and U) that are complexed within DOM will most likely remain conservative. Overall, the WSL's surface water colloidal composition may shift from DOM-rich and DOM-Al-rich to Fe-rich, and the export of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates from the soil to rivers will increase.

AB Mass loss, methylmercury (MeHg), and total mercury (T-Hg) concentrations were measured in sedge, spruce needles, and Sphagnum moss decomposing in a headwater bog and an impounded riparian wetland. No significant differences in the rates of decomposition were apparent for like tissues among sites. Although concentrations of T-Hg increased in some tissues, T-Hg mass was lost from most tissues during decomposition. In the reservoir, approximately 75, 50, and 45% of the initial T-Hg mass was released from the sedge, needles, and moss, respectively, compared to 45, 0, and 40% in the headwater wetland. Therefore, we propose impoundment promotes the release of T-Hg during decomposition, Concentrations, masses, and percentages of MeHg decreased in all tissue types at the headwater-dry site and MeHg concentrations increased in all tissue types at the headwater-wet and impounded sites. At the headwater-wet site, the mass of MeHg only increased in the moss (500%) and T-Hg occurring as MeHg averaged 6% in sedge, 1% in needles, and 7% in moss compared to initial values of 4, 0.5, and 1%, At the impounded sites, the amount of MeHg in the needles and moss increased by approximately 700 and 500%, respectively. Also, T-Hg occurring as MeHg averaged 12% in sedge, 6% in spruce needles, and 17% in moss. We conclude that decomposition of fresh plant tissue under anoxic conditions increases their MeHg mass and impoundment promotes this process, This increase in tissue MeHg mass is must likely the result of in situ methylation of previously accumulated inorganic Hg.

AB Previous observations of Eriophorum vaginatum L. growing in its natural habitats suggest that this perennial graminoid is highly tolerant of aluminum (Al). Eriophorum vaginatum is unusually productive in the bogs surrounding Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) where many years of intensive mining and industrial activities resulted in strong acidification of the environment and wide-scale deposition of metals including highly phytotoxic Al, which in acidic soils is readily available for biological uptake. The ability to accumulate Al within the plant body might be the way of detoxification and can play an important role in Al tolerance by E. vaginatum. To detect Al distribution in leaves, corms and roots of E. vaginatum, plants were collected from a highly polluted site and the fluorescence intensity from the Al-lumogallion complex was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). A strong fluorescence signal was detected, demonstrating dense Al accumulation mainly within the cell walls of the analysed plant tissues. It suggests that E. vaginatum can sequester the phytotoxic Al away from the metabolically active tissues so it cannot interfere with the normal cellular activity. Additionally, a hydroponics study was conducted to examine Al effects on root growth and recovery using in vitro regenerated E. vaginatum plants not previously exposed to Al. Root growth was stimulated by 5 and 10 ?M Al, but was inhibited by 50 and 100 ?M Al. However, all roots returned to control growth rates within 48 h after being transferred to Al-free media, regardless of initial exposure concentration. Based on the ability of this species to tolerate and sequester Al, our results support investigation into E. vaginatum to phytoremediate metal polluted wetlands.

AB The objective of the study was to ascertain the relationship of thinning intensity of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stands with height, crown, and diameter development as well as pulpwood, stem volume, and biomass increment using long-term (20-30 years) field experiments. Diameter growth of birches increased with thinning intensity during the first 15 years from thinning in all development phases, though after that it did so only for the youngest stands. The thinning response was low. Thinning intensity had no influence on increase in height. In terms of stem volume with bark, the mortality in unthinned stands during the study period was 30-45 m(3) ha(-1). The mean stem number in unthinned birch thickets fell from 25 000 ha(-1) at a dominant height of 7 m to 3000 ha(-1) at 18 m. The stem volume increment over the first 15 years was highest (5-6 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) on the very lightly thinned or unthinned plots, but later there was no significant difference between initial thinning intensities. The maximum above-ground leafless biomass (over 100 Mg ha(-1)) was achieved on very lightly thinned plots. Also, the total production (including thinning removal) of biomass or stem volume or even the production of pulpwood increased with stand density, with these values being greatest for very lightly thinned or unthinned plots. During 50-year rotation, the highest leafless above-ground biomass production was 2.5 Mg ha(-1) a(-1) as a mean value from the experiments. The highest mean annual production of pulpwood (d>6.5 cm) was 3.2 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), and, in practice, no saw timber or veneer timber was produced, because of the small size and low quality of the stems. A thinning in downy birch stands increased slightly the size of stems to be removed in future cuttings, but with exception for very light thinning it decreased the production of biomass and merchantable wood.

AB Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

AB Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

AB L'augmentation des quantites de carbone organique accumulees dans la biomasse des ecosystemes terrestres constitue un moyen efficace pour reduire les emissions anthropogenes nettes de gaz a effets de serre dans l'atmosphere. On peut atteindre cet objectif en conservant les reservoirs ecologiques de carbone organique existants, en maintenant ou en augmentant le taux de sequestration, et en restaurant les reserves qui ont ete epuisees par les utilisations passees des territoires. La plupart des systemes de compensation des gaz a effet de serre reconnaissent la validite des projets conduisant a des compensations ecologiques et leur permettent de vendre des credits de carbone dans un marche emergent visant ces nouveaux biens marchands. Bien que les projets ecologiques de compensation du carbone aient ete critiques selon differentes perspectives, on peut mitiger de facon satisfaisante, la plupart des supposes problemes. En plus de compenser les emissions de gaz a effets de serre, les projets ecologiques qui accumulent des credits de carbone peuvent presenter des liens etroits avec la conservation de valeurs naturelles, qui en soi constituent une action importante que doit entreprendre la societe. Cependant, cette consideration s'applique moins aux projets bases sur des activites anthropogeniques comme les systemes de culture sans labour et les plantations forestieres, qui rapportent relativement peu de benefices a la biodiversite indigene et peuvent meme s'eloigner de l'objectif, si on les applique a des habitats naturels recemment convertis. De plus, les regles existantes pour les systemes de compensation du carbone excluent certains types de projets ecologiques du marche boursier, meme s'ils permettraient d'eviter des emissions ou augmenter la sequestration de carbone organique. A mesure que les marches emergents des compensations en carbone s'accroissent, il deviendra important de comprendre les cobenefices et les effets secondaires des projets de compensation de valeurs autres que le carbone, incluant la biodiversite indigene.

AB Abandoned surface mine voids are often left to flood, forming pit lakes. Drawing simple but important lessons from experiences with compost-based passive remediation systems for acidic mine waters, an alternative end-use for open pit mine voids is proposed: gradual infilling with organic material, which can serve as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2, whilst ameliorating or eventually eliminating sustained evaporative water loss and acidic water pollution. Key to the success of this approach is the suppression of methane release from organic sediments flooded with sulfate-rich mine waters: the presence of modest amounts of sulfate (which is typically abundant in mine waters) inhibits the activity of methanogenic bacteria. This explains why gas release studies of mine water treatment wetlands never report methane emissions; CO2 is the only greenhouse gas emitted, and this is clearly not at levels sufficient to undo the benefits of wetlands as net CO2 sinks. While the compete infilling of open pits with organic sediments might take a very long time, only minimal maintenance would be needed, and if carbon trading markets finally mature, a steady income stream could be obtained to cover the costs, thus extending the economic life of the mine site far beyond cessation of mining.

AB The contribution of the agricultural sector to emissions of climate change gases is becoming better understood. At the same time, the potential role of the sector as a means through which to tackle climate change, widely neglected in the past, is becoming more widely acknowledged. The absorption potential of agricultural soils could contribute significantly to constraining growth in greenhouse gas emissions, while also contributing to improvements in soil quality in some areas. In addition to the measures listed above, other benefits of compost application may have some relevance. Some of these measures include replacement of chemical fertilizers (implying avoidance of greenhouse gases related to their production) reduced use of pesticides (avoiding emissions associated with their production), improved tilth and workability (less consumption of fuels). Typically, life-cycle analyses (LCAs) exhibit limitations related to assessing the effects of 'time-limited' carbon sequestration in soils. This has tended to obscure the potentially important effect of composting, in which biogenic carbon is held in soils for a period of time before the carbon is released. The paper seeks to understand these effects and offers comments on the contribution of biological treatments to tackling climate change issues. Key issues include the replacement of fertilizers, reduction of N2O emissions, and peat replacement.

AB A near-natural coastal dune system in NW Jutland, Denmark was investigated. The area contains a gradient in natural soil mobility with the highest values in dynamic white dunes dominated by Ammophila arenaria, and low mobility in fixed decalcified dune heath with Empetrum nigrum and Calluna vulgaris. A total of 267 plots was investigated and presence of mosses and rooted vascular plants recorded. Cluster analysis identified five communities: white dune, grey dune, outer dune heath, inner dune heath and humid dune heath. These communities were ordered along two main axes in a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The relationship between DCA axes and several environmental variables, including soil characteristics and Ellenberg indicator values, were investigated by correlation. Two major complex gradients underlying compositional variation were identified; one short coenocline with an underlying steep gradient in habitat maturity, soil stability and nutrient-limited productivity, and one longer gradient in water-limited productivity and peat accumulation only applying to the older successional stages. Distance from the coast was an important correlate of several of the measured variables. Microclimatic indices, i.e. heat index and wind index, had limited value as descriptors of community patterns as they were not correlated with the DCA axes or with other environmental variables. However, within communities the microclimatic indices correlated with several explanatory variables.

AB Coal basins in the Cantabrian Mountains were formed synorogenically during late Carboniferous times.  The older coal-bearing successions of Upper Namurian and Westphalian age, which occur in the San Emiliano-Teverga, La Camocha, Quiros, Central Coal Basin and La Marea-Coballes coalfields, we discussed here.
   During the Carboniferous these coalfields formed a single foreland basin in front of the developing mountain chain.  As the orogenic front advanced, the basin was progressively deformed and, as a result, the principal coal-bearing sequences are younger in the direction of the orogenic movement.
   Deposition occurred by the progradation of delta and fan-delta systems into shallow to deep water.  Five broad groups of facies can be distinguished:  (1) conglomerates of fan-deltaic origin interbedded with fluvio-deltaic sandstones and minor marine mudstones; (2) deltaic sandstones prograding onto a shallow muddy shelf; (3) shallow marine mudstones interfingering with limestones and subordinate deltaic sequences; (4) bioclastic and algal-bound limestones forming shallow shelf sequences and (5) basinal shales with local turbiditic episodes and olistolites, which record a shallowing upward trend.
   The most important coal seams were formed by the accumulation of peat on abandoned delta and fan-delta lobes.  Other locations, for example overbank areas of the delta plains and back-barrier lagoons, developed a less extensive seams.

AB The Jurassic plant fossil record of Gondwana is generally meagre, which renders phytogeographic and palaeoclimatic interpretations difficult to date. Moreover, plant fossil assemblages mainly consist of impressions/compressions with rather limited palaeobiological and palaeoecological significance. We here present a detailed survey of new Early Jurassic plant assemblages from the Pliensbachian Shafer Peak Formation, north Victoria Land, Transantarctic Mountains. Some of the well-preserved fossils yield cuticle. The floras consist of isoetalean lycophytes, sphenophytes, several ferns, bennettitaleans, and conifers. In addition, three distinct kinds of conifer shoots and needles were obtained from bulk macerations. The composition of the plant communities is typical for Jurassic macrofloras of Gondwana, which underscores the general homogeneity of Southern Hemisphere vegetation during the mid-Mesozoic. Altogether, the plant fossil assemblages indicate humid and warm temperate conditions, which is in contrast to recent palaeoclimatic models that predict cool temperate climates for the continental interior of southern Gondwana during the Jurassic. However, there is no evidence for notable soil development or peat accumulation. The environmental conditions were apparently very unstable due to intense volcanic activity that resulted in frequent perturbation of landscape and vegetation, hampering the development of long-lived climax communities. Cuticles of bennettitaleans and conifers show xeromorphic features that may have been beneficial for growth in this volcanic environment.

AB Ebullition (bubbling) from climate-sensitive northern lakes remains an unconstrained source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Although the focus of many recent studies, ebullition is rarely linked to the physical characteristics of lakes. In this study we analyze the sediments of subarctic postglacial lakes and investigate how sediment properties relate to the large spatial variation in CH4 bubble flux, quantified over multiple years using bubble traps. The results show that the sediments from our lakes are rich in total organic carbon, containing 37 kg/m(3) on average. This number is roughly 40% higher than the average for yedoma deposits, which have been identified as high CH4 emitters. However, the quantity of total organic carbon is not a useful indicator of high emissions from the study lakes. Neither is the amount of CH4 in the sediment a reliable measure of ebullition potential. Instead, our data point to coarse detritus, partly from buried submerged aquatic vegetation and redeposited peat as spatial controls on fluxes, often in combination with previously established effects of incoming solar radiation and water depth. The results once again highlight the climate sensitivity of northern lakes, indicating that biological responses to warmer waters and increased energy input and heating of organic sediments during longer ice-free seasons can substantially alter future CH4 emissions.

AB This study identifies a full range of ecosystem services that could be affected by a restoration project in the central Everglades and monetizes the economic value of a subset of these services using existing data. Findings suggest that the project will potentially increase many ecosystem services that have considerable economic value to society. The ecosystem services monetized within the scope of this study are a subset of the difference between the future-with the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) and the future-without CEPP, and they totaled similar to $1.8 billion USD at a 2.5% discount rate. Findings suggest that the use of ecosystem services in project planning and communications may require acknowledgment of the difficulty of monetizing important services and the limitations associated with using only existing data and models. Results of this study highlight the need for additional valuation efforts in this region, focused on those services that are likely to be impacted by restoration activities but were notably challenging to value in this assessment due to shortages of data.

AB The presence of mangroves in small Caribbean islands such as Providencia and Santa Catalina is important because they act as a barrier against sporadic storms and hurricanes. Mangroves, in turns, require the input of sediments for their maintenance and growth. In absence of allochthonous sources, the sediment supply in these islands is acquired by the mangrove's leaf decomposition. The main purpose of this study was to quantify the rate of leaf decomposition in three mangrove species in the most representative island's wetlands, in different decomposition substrates: water, peat and forest surface. The decomposition rate in each site was faster during the first three weeks, where the highest biomass lost was registered, followed by a slow decomposition period that continued until the end of the sampling period. The exponential model, calculated with the remaining weight data along the 11 experimentation weeks, showed the better adjustment to the decomposition dynamic. The repeated measurements ANOVA showed significant differences among species; leafs of Rhizophora mangle decomposed at a slower rate (K = 0.020 +/- 0.007) than those of Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa (K = 0.021 +/- 0.01; K = 0.022 +/- 0.006, respectively). These decomposition rates provide valuable information about circulation of vegetal material in each studied mangrove and the contribution of species to the environment.

AB We asked whether different stakeholders perceive ecosystem services in similar ways and how these perceptions relate to measured ecosystem properties. Farmers and conservationists were asked to state (1) their preference for ecosystem services and (2) their perception about the value of several grassland vegetation units in providing these services. Additionally, biophysical parameters were collected on 46 plots. Structural equation models were applied to test which stakeholder perceptions corresponded to the data.
   For conservationists, the services regional belonging and soil fertility were related to conservation value, whereas farmers associated them with forage production. Conservationists' perception of forage production was related to biomass removal, groundwater level and income from forage production, whereas farmers focused on the potential of ecosystems to produce forage, rather than the actual land use. The conservation perception of farmers was related to low land use intensity, whereas the conservationists associated it with endangered meadow birds. Conservationists associated carbon sequestration with below-ground peat formation, but farmers with above-ground plant productivity.
   We conclude that perceptions of ecosystem services are strongly influenced by social contexts, involving livelihoods, interests and traditions. Use of stakeholder assessments to establish sustainable land management should consider the fact that stakeholders interpret ecosystem services with different meanings.

AB Changes in Holocene coastal paleo-environment and sea-level variations have been recorded in estuary sediments from Macassa Bay, southern Mozambique. Methods include analysis of fossil diatoms, sediment stratigraphy, mineral magnetic properties, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition and carbon and nitrogen content. The chronology, based on six AMS C-14 dates, suggests a basal age of the sediment core of c 6600 cal BP (calibrated years Before Present). The multi-proxy dataset implies two phases when the site was experiencing marine conditions and tentative sea-level high-stands: 1) between c 6600-6300 cal BP which is contemporary with the last phase of the global transgression and the Holocene climatic optimum, and 2) between c 4700-1000 cal BP, a period when sea level curves from the region suggest occasional minor sea level high-stands. Between these phases (c 6300-4700 cal BP), the environment within the Macassa Bay estuary was less influenced by marine processes, and studied proxies indicate a freshwater phase associated with relatively low sea levels. After c 1000 cal BP, a terrestrial environment prevailed at the site, probably as a result of a combined effect of sea level lowering and high accumulation of organic peat within the estuary.

AB Soil respiration (R-s) is the largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) next to photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems. With the absorption of atmospheric methane (CH4), upland soils become a large CO2 source and CH4 sink. These soil carbon (C) fluxes are key factors in the mitigation and adaption of future climate change. The Asian region spans an extensive area from the northern boreal to tropical regions in Southeast Asia. As this region is characterised by highly diverse ecosystems, it is expected to experience the strong impact of ecosystem responses to global climate change. For the past two decades, researchers in the AsiaFlux community have meaningfully contributed to improve the current understanding of soil C dynamics, response of soil C fluxes to disturbances and climate change, and regional and global estimation based on model analysis. This review focuses on five important aspects: 1) the historical methodology for soil C flux measurement; 2) responses of soil C flux components to environmental factors; 3) soil C fluxes in typical ecosystems in Asia; 4) the influence of disturbance and climate change on soil C fluxes; and 5) model analysis and the estimation of soil C fluxes in research largely focused in Asia.

AB The Bolsovian-age Radnice Member of the West and Central Bohemian Coal Basin in the Czech Republic has yielded eight species of imparipinnate neuropteroid fronds, four of which are endemic to the basin. They mostly belong to the fossil-genera Laveineopteris, Macroneuropteris and a previously unrecognised genus named here Havlenaea; unlike the contemporary macrofloras of the lowland paralic basins, Neuropteris sensu stricto is absent from the Radnice Member. Havlenaea represents a group of neuropteroid species with distinctive stomata that are only found in intramontane basins. Laveineopteris loshii is identified here for the first time from an intramontane basin, but only from peat substrate vegetation; in the clastic substrate habitats, the genus is mainly represented by Laveineopteris tenuifolia. A palaeobiogeographcial analysis confirms the distinctiveness of the mid-Westphalian medullosaleans of Western and Central Bohemia, which probably reflects the relatively high elevation of the basin. Many of the species show features that superficially suggest adaptations to xeric conditions, but in fact are probably adaptations to facilitate water run-off from the foliage, and thus to improve the transpiration stream in a high-humidity tropical environment. There are also numerous holes in the cuticles probably representing hydathode pores, which are another adaptation to growth in high-humidity tropical conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Abundant fossil plant remains are preserved in deposits of Middle Miocene age of the Ballast Brook Formation on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Intact seed cones, logs, and stumps are preserved in situ as mummified remains and present an opportunity to reconstruct the composition, structure, and productivity of a Pinaceae-dominated forest that once grew north of the Arctic Circle (paleolatitude ca. WN). We mapped and measured 78 tree stumps exposed in three dimensions on a 0.12 ha peat layer. An analysis of the wood anatomy and seed cones indicates that a haploxylon pine dominated this lowland forest, although species of both Picea and Glyptostrobus were growing in the swamp as well. Stump diameters ranged from 7 cm to 108 cm (average=42 cm). We utilized allometric relationships to predict tree heights based on the stump diameters in the fossil forest. Our results indicate that the average tree height of this Miocene forest may have been as large as 21 m. We used stump diameter data and predicted tree height to calculate the parabolic stem volume and stem biomass for the exposed area of fossil forest. Stem biomass (assuming an average wood density of 410 kg m(-3)) may have been as great as 259 Mg ha(-1) or as little at 202 Mg ha(-1). The annual ring width of the stem wood sampled in the field was 1.26 mm for Pinus, 1.20 mm for Picea and 0.21 mm for Glyptostrobus. Based on these growth rates, our estimate of biomass sequestered aboveground as wood is at most 3.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Based on our estimates, these lowland forest communities were of moderate biomass and productivity typical of modem cool temperate forests in North America. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Alterations in fire activity due to climate change and fire suppression may have profound effects on the balance between storage and release of carbon (C) and associated volatile elements. Stored soil mercury (Hg) is known to volatilize due to wildfires and this could substantially affect the land air exchange of Hg; conversely the absence of fires and human disturbance may increase the time period over which Hg is sequestered. Here we show for a wildfire chronosequence spanning over more than 5000 years in boreal forest in northern Sweden that belowground inventories of total Hg are strongly related to soil humus C accumulation (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.001). Our data clearly show that northern boreal forest soils have a strong sink capacity for Hg, and indicate that the sequestered Hg is bound in soil organic matter pools accumulating over millennia. Our results also suggest that more than half of the Hg stock in the sites with the longest time since fire originates from deposition predating the onset of large-scale anthropogenic emissions. This study emphasizes the importance of boreal forest humus soils for Hg storage and reveals that this pool is likely to persist over millennial time scales in the prolonged absence of fire.

AB Multiproxy analysis (grain size, mineral magnetics, pollen, diatoms and radiocarbon dates) of deep (20 m+) cores collected from the Rye area of the Romney Marsh region are used to reconstruct coastal evolution between ca. 7000 and 2000 yr ''conventional radiocarbon'' B.P. A rapid phase of sea-level rise and tidal flat sedimentation occurred between ca. 7000 and 6000 ''conventional radiocarbon'' yr B.P., after which peat accumulation took place as a coastal barrier of sand and gravel extended eastward across Rye Bay and the rate of sea-level rise fell. Marine conditions returned to these areas at ca. 3000-2000 yr B.P. Erosion and landward migration of the barrier accompanied this return, heralding a change in the stability of the barrier and its ability to afford protection to back-barrier areas of the Romney Marsh region. Comparison with other sites in the central and eastern English Channel and the Thames estuary suggests that the prolonged removal of marine conditions from the study site accompanying barrier establishment reflects an ample sediment supply and the large volume of material within the barrier, which would have provided considerable scope for internal re-organisation when faced with changing coastal processes.

AB Sorption of pyrene on various types of natural organic matter (NOM) varying in chemical composition (e.g. high aliphaticity or aromaticity) was examined in batch sorption studies. The NOM samples (cuticle, humin, humic acid, degraded lignin, peat and lignite) were characterized by elemental analyses and solid-state C-13 NMR spectra. Previous studies on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) sorption on soils and sediments led to the conclusion that aromatic component of the NOM determines the binding of nonionic compounds and that the polarity of the NOM reduces the binding coefficient of the aromatic NOM moieties. In this study we tested the hypothesis that aliphatic moieties of NOM derived from soils or sediments can contribute significantly to the binding of PAHs in aqueous media. Cuticle and a humin sample from an algal deposit exhibited the highest distribution coefficients (K-oc). Both samples were rich in aliphatic structures and had very low aromaticity (4.6 and 8.8% for cuticle and humin samples, respectively). A positive trend was observed between the K-oc level and the aliphaticity of the NOM, calculated from the C-13 NMR spectra. This study demonstrates that aliphatic NOM compounds significantly sorb pyrene in aqueous solution, thus leading to the conclusion that the contribution of these groups to the sorption of aromatic nonionic pollutants in complex NOM matrices can be significant.

AB A lake sediment core from the eastern Tibetan Plateau was investigated by multi-proxy geochemical, sedimentological and magnetic analyses and its age determined using C-14 AMS dating in an approach to use short-lived climate periods for a spatial assessment of the Holocene climate history on the Tibetan Plateau. Six cold events were identified from the Lake Ximencuo record which occurred between 10.3-10.0, 7.9-7.4, 5.9-5.5, 4.2-2.8, 1.7-1.3 and 0.6-0.1 cal ka BP. A comparison with previously published Holocene records from lake and peat sections, ice cores and glacial remains of the Tibetan Plateau revealed that the cold event starting around 4.2 cal ka BP had the most significant and widespread impact on almost all of the examined sites. This cold event lasted about a millennium in the western and central part of the Tibetan Plateau and possibly several hundred years longer at some sites in its eastern realm. The cold event inferred between 7.9 and 7.4 cal ka BP from Lake Ximencuo was recorded at a number of sites on the eastern Tibetan Plateau too and probably corresponds to a cold event identified around 8.2 cal ka BP at the sites on the western and central Tibetan Plateau. The coincidence with the 8.2 ka event of the North Atlantic region implies that the latter exerted a significant environmental impact on the Tibetan Plateau too. The cold spell between 10.3 and 10.0 cal ka BP was recorded at some marginal sites of the Tibetan Plateau but had apparently a less significant environmental impact. The more irregular pattern of cold events between about 7 cal ka BP and the onset of the cold event after 4.2 cal ka BP might be related to the catchment-specific response of the lake sediment and peat accumulation to the termination of the Holocene 'climatic optimum' on the Tibetan Plateau. The final two cold events between 1.7 and 1.3 cal ka BP and in the last several hundred years representing the Little Ice Age are more widely seen on the Tibetan Plateau although they did not reach the significance of the cold event at 4.2 cal ka BP. However, the three cold periods since 4.2 cal ka BP are apparently coeval with the decline and establishment of Chinese Dynasties implying a remarkable impact on the social systems in eastern China. The consistent inference of cold events around 8.2 cal ka BP or a few hundred years later and starting at 4.2 cal ka BP is evidence for a temporary trans-regional climatic response on the Tibetan Plateau in the Holocene regardless of the catchment-specific response of complex natural systems.

AB A remarkable fossil assemblage-fifteen 'in situ' stumps standing at their original position-was explored at the opencast lignite mine at Bukkabrany, N Hungary. The stumps occupying an area of about 50 x 100 m have been preserved in Upper Miocene grey sands overlying the lignite seam. The height of the trunks ranges from 2 up to 5.2 m, their perimeter at the base reaches up to 8.8 m. The age of the fossil remains is estimated to about 7 Ma according to the regional stratigraphy. The fossil forest is the remains of a swamp forest which is also corroborated by the palaeogeography of the fossil site as the area of the former Lake Pannon. Fossil leaf and fruit assemblages indicating the typical swamp vegetation in the close vicinity of Lake Pannon have already been reported from the site. Wood anatomy of some of the stumps is diagnostic for Taxodioxylon germanicum (Greguss) Van der Burgh which is related to modern Sequoia Endlicher and was an important element of peat forming vegetation during the Neogene. Some other stumps are comparable to Glyptostrohoxylon Conwentz emend. Dolezych & Van der Burgh. The organic rich sediments underlying and embedding the stumps provided a high abundance of Glyptostrobus Endlicher remains, foliage, cones and seeds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Trees are known to modify their growth in windy climates, but these responses have not previously been linked to alterations in anchorage strength. The effects of stem mass, soil group, rooting depth and wind exposure (Detailed Aspect Method of Scoring (DAMS)) on anchorage were modelled using data from experiments where Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) trees had been mechanically overturned. Regressions of critical turning moment against stem mass were performed on combinations of soil group (mineral, gleyed mineral, peaty mineral and deep peat) and rooting depth (< 40, 40-80 and > 80 cm), with DAMS as an additional factor. Correlations of DAMS with critical turning moment were positive for all combinations, and DAMS had a positive effect on the slope of all critical turning moment against stem mass regressions. When DAMS was added to the model, it increased the variance accounted for, from 66.5 to 71.2 per cent. When revised anchorage coefficients were applied to the ForestGALES wind risk model, critical wind speeds and associated return times for a 55-year-old stand were reduced on a relatively sheltered DAMS 14 site and increased on a wind-exposed DAMS 18 site. The implications of trees developing stronger anchorage in locations with greater wind exposure are discussed in relation to management of wind risk.

AB The most dramatic permafrost degradation is expected to occur at the southern edge of permafrost distribution, which is difficult to detect directly on a large scale. Ecological indicators can be used to provide an early signal of changes in terrestrial ecosystems for regional near-surface permafrost habitats and potentially to monitor near-surface permafrost degradation. In this study, plant composition and community structure indicate the near-surface permafrost distribution at the southern edge of the boreal forest and permafrost in northeastern China. The plant species composition and structure of aboveground vegetation were linked to the belowground near-surface permafrost distribution in order to find indicators of changes in vegetation features from permafrost melting. These indicators are essential for assessing changes in permafrost vegetation systems under climate change. Carex schmidtii and C. appendiculata in the herb layer and Benda fruticosa in the shrub layer were found to be specific near-surface permafrost plant indicator species, especially for the wetland permafrost. Shrub cover, moss mat thickness and tree canopy cover are also strongly correlated with near-surface permafrost distribution. The active layer thickness (ALT) showed negative correlations with moss thickness and shrub cover because these features may act as buffers for regional climate warming. We chose the cover of each indicator species, near-surface permafrost-specific community features and geographical information as independent variables to predict the possible distribution of near-surface permafrost in our study region using logistic regression. The results showed that the prediction model had good performance and accuracy. Our study sheds light on early caution of deepening of regional-scale permafrost active layer with vegetation indicators that can further be identified from satellite images.

AB This paper provides an update on the fast-evolving field of the induced polarization method applied to biogeophysics. It emphasizes recent advances in the understanding of the induced polarization signals stemming from biological materials and their activity, points out new developments and applications, and identifies existing knowledge gaps. The focus of this review is on the application of induced polarization to study living organisms: soil microorganisms and plants (both roots and stems). We first discuss observed links between the induced polarization signal and microbial cell structure, activity and biofilm formation. We provide an up-to-date conceptual model of the electrical behaviour of the microbial cells and biofilms under the influence of an external electrical field. We also review the latest biogeophysical studies, including work on hydrocarbon biodegradation, contaminant sequestration, soil strengthening and peatland characterization. We then elaborate on the induced polarization signature of the plant-root zone, relying on a conceptual model for the generation of biogeophysical signals from a plant-root cell. First laboratory experiments show that single roots and root system are highly polarizable. They also present encouraging results for imaging root systems embedded in a medium, and gaining information on the mass density distribution, the structure or the physiological characteristics of root systems. In addition, we highlight the application of induced polarization to characterize wood and tree structures through tomography of the stem. Finally, we discuss up- and down-scaling between laboratory and field studies, as well as joint interpretation of induced polarization and other environmental data. We emphasize the need for intermediate-scale studies and the benefits of using induced polarization as a time-lapse monitoring method. We conclude with the promising integration of induced polarization in interdisciplinary mechanistic models to better understand and quantify subsurface biogeochemical processes.

AB We measured the change in above- and below-ground carbon and nutrient pools 11 years after the harvesting and site preparation of a histic-mineral soil wetland forest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The original stand of black spruce (Picea mariana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and tamarack (Larix laricina) was whole-tree harvested, and three post-harvest treatments (disk trenching, bedding, and none) were randomly assigned to three Latin square blocks (n = 9). Nine control plots were also established in an adjoining uncut stand. Carbon and nutrients were measured in three strata of above-ground vegetation, woody debris, roots, forest floor, and mineral soil to a depth of 1.5 m. Eleven years following harvesting, soil C, N, Ca, Mg, and K pools were similar among the three site preparation treatments and the uncut stand. However, there were differences in ecosystem-level nutrient pools because of differences in live biomass. Coarse roots comprised approximately 30% of the tree biomass C in the regenerated stands and 18% in the uncut stand. Nutrient sequestration, in the vegetation since harvesting yielded an average net ecosystem gain of 332 kg N ha(-1), 110 kg Ca ha(-1), 18 kg Mg ha(-1), and 65 kg K ha(-1). The likely source for the cations and N is uptake from shallow groundwater, but N additions could also come from non-symbiotic N-fixation and N deposition. These are the only reported findings on long-term effects of harvesting and site preparation on a histic-mineral soil wetland and the results illustrate the importance of understanding the ecohydrology and nutrient dynamics of the wetland forest. This wetland type appears less sensitive to disturbance than upland sites, and is capable of sustained productivity under these silvicultural treatments. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Artificial wetlands are constructed around the globe for a variety of services, including wastewater treatment and carbon storage. To become a carbon sink, a newly constructed wetland must have a fully developed vegetation, consisting of species that can produce more organic matter than is being lost through decomposition. However, the effects of environmental conditions on the overall balance between production and decomposition might be complex. In this study, two large-scale field litterbag experiments were performed in a three-year old constructed wetland in the Netherlands, to separate the effects of litter characteristics and environmental conditions on decomposition rates of aquatic pioneer vegetation. Dimension reduction by principal component analysis was used to limit the number of variables for subsequent analyses in linear models. When transplanted to one common environment, litter characteristics alone could explain 52% and 26% of the variation in decomposition after 6 and 12 months, respectively. When both litter characteristics and environmental conditions were tested simultaneously and litter was decomposed in its original environment, 37% and 23% of the variation could be explained after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Both experiments showed two phases of decomposition: the initial leaching phase with an important role for litter characteristics and microbial communities in the model, and the second, slower phase, which is predominantly determined by litter characteristics and environmental conditions such as water quality. Model results could not be extrapolated to a fully developed reference area. Optimization of conditions in order to limit decomposition rates seems difficult and therefore we suggest using management options to influence biomass production and thereby fully exploit the use of newly constructed wetlands for carbon storage.

AB The effects of artificially applied acid precipitation on growth and nutrient concentrations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) seedlings were investigated in a long-term acid irrigation experiment in field conditions. Seedlings of northern and southern origin were planted in boxes containing peat and composted soil rich in nutrients, and sprinkler irrigated with water acidified with nitric and sulphuric acids to pH 3 or pH 4 for periods varying from two to three and a half growing seasons during 1986-1989. Water irrigated (pH 5.4-7.6) and non-irrigated groups of seedlings were also included in the experiment. At the end of the experiment needles, main and lateral shoots and roots were collected from the seedlings for the determination of height growth and biomass partitioning, and for the analysis of S, N, Mg, P, K, Ca, Mn and Fe concentrations. The treatment effects compared to the irrigated control were studied using multivariate analyses of variance and covariance. In the pine seedlings the total dry matter production increased by 25-70% compared with the irrigated controls when the total wet deposition to the seedlings exceeded 67 kg S ha(-1) and 36 kg N ha(-1) (e.g. after two growing seasons' exposure of the pH 3 treatment) The increase was mainly due to an increase in needle dry weight (54-72% greater at pH 3) and root weight (20-65% greater at pH 3), whereas the height growth or shoot weight growth were less affected. The northern provenance pine seedlings responded more clearly to the pH 3 irrigation than the southern ones. The treatments had no consistent effects an any of the growth variables studied in the spruce seedlings, however. The pines had higher root and foliage Ca concentrations as a result of the acid irrigation, whereas in spruce, acid rain decreased the Ca concentration in needles and shoots. Root Mn and Fe concentrations were higher in both species as a result of the pH 3 treatment. A higher soil conductivity and Ca concentration resulted from the prolonged pH 3 treatment. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the long-term growth and nutrient allocation response of conifers to acid precipitation is dependent both on the tree species and on the nutritional status of the sail.

TI Is the decline of soil microbial biomass in late winter coupled to
   changes in the physical state of cold soils?

AB During winter when the active layer of Arctic and alpine soils is below 0 degrees C, soil microbes are alive but metabolizing slowly, presumably in contact with unfrozen water. This unfrozen water is at the same negative chemical potential as the ice. While both the hydrostatic and the osmotic components of the chemical potential will contribute to this negative value, we argue that the osmotic component (osmotic potential) is the significant contributor. Hence, the soil microorganisms need to be at least halotolerant and psychrotolerant to survive in seasonally frozen soils. The low osmotic potential of unfrozen soil water will lead to the withdrawal of cell water, unless balanced by accumulation of compatible solutes. Many microbes appear to survive this dehydration, since microbial biomass in some situations is high, and rising, in winter. In late winter however, before the soil temperature rises above zero, there can be a considerable decline in soil microbial biomass due to the loss of compatible solutes from viable cells or to cell rupture. This decline may be caused by changes in the physical state of the system, specifically by sudden fluxes of melt water down channels in frozen soil, rapidly raising the chemical potential. The dehydrated cells may be unable to accommodate a rapid rise in osmotic potential so that cell membranes rupture and cells lyse. The exhaustion of soluble substrates released from senescing plant and microbial tissues in autumn and winter may also limit microbial growth, while in addition the rising temperatures may terminate a winter bloom of psychrophiles. Climate change is predicted to cause a decline in plant production in these northern soils, due to summer drought and to an increase in freeze-thaw cycles. Both of these may be expected to reduce soil microbial biomass in late winter. After lysis of microbial cells this biomass provides nutrients for plant growth in early spring. These feedbacks in turn, could affect herbivory and production at higher trophic levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental changes feedback to climate through their impact on soil functions such as carbon (C) and nutrient sequestration. Abiotic conditions and the interactions between above- and belowground biota drive soil responses to environmental change but these (a)biotic interactions are challenging to study. Nonetheless, better understanding of these interactions would improve predictions of future soil functioning and the soil-climate feedback and, in this context, permafrost soils are of particular interest due to their vast soil C-stores. We need new tools to isolate abiotic (microclimate, chemistry) and biotic (roots, fauna, microorganisms) components and to identify their respective roles in soil processes. We developed a new experimental setup, in which we mimic thermokarst (permafrost thaw-induced soil subsidence) by fitting thawed permafrost and vegetated active layer sods side by side into mesocosms deployed in a subarctic tundra over two growing seasons. In each mesocosm, the two sods were separated from each other by barriers with different mesh sizes to allow varying degrees of physical connection and, consequently, (a)biotic exchange between active layer and permafrost. We demonstrate that our mesh-approach succeeded in controlling 1) lateral exchange of solutes between the two soil types, 2) colonization of permafrost by microbes but not by soil fauna, and 3) ingrowth of roots into permafrost. In particular, experimental thermokarst induced a similar to 60% decline in permafrost nitrogen (N) content, a shift in soil bacteria and a rapid buildup of root biomass (+33.2 g roots m(-2) soil). This indicates that cascading plant-soil-microbe linkages are at the heart of biogeochemical cycling in thermokarst events. We propose that this novel setup can be used to explore the effects of (a)biotic ecosystem components on focal biogeochemical processes in permafrost soils and beyond.

AB Aims: The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the plant species composition of five different wetland types found on the Maputaland Coastal Plain (MCP), to determine whether the vegetation patterns can be related to the major substrate types, and to determine the relationship between environmental variables and plant communities in order to elucidate the delineation of wetland and wetland zones in this area. Location: The MCP in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) is known for its biodiversity, diverse ecosystems, high density of wetlands, and highest proportion of all South Africa's peatlands. Yet there is insufficient wetland vegetation research in the region. Additionally, the delineation of wetlands in this area is widely regarded as problematic due to complex wetland soils. It is believed that an understanding of the vegetation composition of wetland zones in different types of wetlands can aid the understanding of wetland types and wetland zone delineation on sandy coastal aquifers as is found in northern KZN. Methods: Twenty wetlands from five wetland types were surveyed. The vegetation of each wetland was sampled along a transect following the Braun-Blanquet approach. The software packages Turboveg for Windows 1.97, JUICE 7.0, TWINSPAN, and PC-ORD 5 were used to analyse the data. Both Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) as well as Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were applied to the data. Results: The results indicated that the strongest correlation with wetland plant communities on the MCP is the substrate type and hydrological regime, with the wetland type as the finer classification factor. Specific plant communities are best associated with specific wetland types. Conclusions: Vegetation composition cannot be used to distinguish between each and every unique wetland zone, but it can be successfully used to differentiate between the different topographical positions on a slope, which can be correlated to the hydrological regime.

AB Investigating the spatial and vertical patterns of wetland soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc) is important for understanding the regional carbon cycle and managing the wetland ecosystem. By integrating 160 wetland soil profile samples and environmental variables from climatic, topographical, and remote sensing data, we spatially predicted the SOCc of wetlands in China's Western Songnen Plain by comparing four algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) for regression, inverse distance weighted (IDW), and ordinary kriging (OK). The predicted results of the SOCc from the different algorithms were validated against independent testing samples according to the mean error, root mean squared error, and correlation coefficient. The results show that the measured SOCc values at depths of 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm were 15.28, 7.57, and 5.22 g.kg(-1), respectively. An assessment revealed that the RF algorithm was the most accurate for predicting SOCc; its correlation coefficients at the different depths were 0.82, 0.59, and 0.51, respectively. The attribute importance from the RF indicates that environmental variables have various effects on the SOCc at different depths. The land surface temperature and land surface water index had a stronger influence on the spatial distribution of SOCc at the depths of 0-30 and 30-60 cm, whereas topographic factors, such as altitude, had a stronger influence within 60-100 cm. The predicted SOCc of each vertical depth increased gradually from south to north in the study area. This research provides an important case study for predicting SOCc, including selecting factors and algorithms, and helps understanding the carbon cycles of regional wetlands.

AB Questions: What are the water economy strategies of the dominant subarctic bryophytes in terms of colony and shoot traits? Can colony water retention capacity be predicted from morphological traits of both colonies and separate shoots? Are suites of water retention traits consistently related to bryophyte habitat and phylogenetic position?
   Location: Abisko Research Station, North Sweden.
   Methods: We screened 22 abundant subarctic bryophyte species from diverse habitats for water economy traits of shoots and colonies, including desiccation rates, water content at field capacity, volume and density (mg cm(-3)) of water-saturated and oven-dried patches, evaporation rate (g . m (2) . s (1)) and cell wall thickness. The relationships between these traits and shoot and colony desiccation rates were analysed with Spearman rank correlations. Subsequent multivariate (cluster followed by PCA) analyses were based on turf density, turf and shoot desiccation rate, cell wall thickness and amount of external and internal water.
   Results: Individual shoot properties, i.e. leaf cellwall properties, water retention capacity and desiccation rate, did not correspond with colony water retention capacity. Colony desiccation rate depended on density of water-saturated colonies, and was marginally significantly negatively correlated with species individual shoot desiccation rate but not related to any other shoot or colony trait. Multivariate analyses based on traits assumed to determine colony desiccation rate revealed six distinct species groups reflecting habitat choice and phylogenetic relationships.
   Conclusions: General relationships between shoot and colony traits as determinants of water economy will help to predict and upscale changes in hydrological function of bryophyte-dominated peatlands undergoing climate-induced shifts in species abundance, and feedbacks of such species shifts on permafrost insulation and carbon sequestration functions.

AB Recent studies using vegetation plots have demonstrated that habitat type is a good predictor of the level of plant invasion, expressed as the proportion of alien to all species. At local scale, habitat types explain the level of invasion much better than alien propagule pressure. Moreover, it has been shown that patterns of habitat invasion are consistent among European regions with contrasting climates, biogeography, history and socioeconomic background. Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe.
   European Union and some adjacent countries.
   We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class. We projected the levels of invasion on the CORINE land-cover map of Europe, extrapolating Catalonian data to the Mediterranean bioregion, Czech data to the Continental bioregion, British data to the British Isles and combined Czech-British data to the Atlantic and Boreal bioregions.
   The highest levels of invasion were predicted for agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes, low levels for natural and semi-natural grasslands and most woodlands, and the lowest levels for sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands. The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe.
   High level of invasion is predicted in lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe and low level in the boreal zone and mountain regions across the continent. Low level of invasion is also predicted in the Mediterranean region except its coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land.

TI FeO2 and FeOOH under deep lower-mantle conditions and Earth's

AB The distribution, accumulation and circulation of oxygen and hydrogen in Earth's interior dictate the geochemical evolution of the hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere(1). The oxygen-rich atmosphere and iron-rich core represent two end-members of the oxygen-iron (O-Fe) system, overlapping with the entire pressure-temperature-composition range of the planet. The extreme pressure and temperature conditions of the deep interior alter the oxidation states(1), spin states(2) and phase stabilities(3,4) of iron oxides, creating new stoichiometries, such as Fe4O5 (ref. 5) and Fe5O6 (ref. 6). Such interactions between O and Fe dictate Earth's formation, the separation of the core and mantle, and the evolution of the atmosphere. Iron, in its multiple oxidation states, controls the oxygen fugacity and oxygen budget, with hydrogen having a key role in the reaction of Fe and O (causing iron to rust in humid air). Here we use first-principles calculations and experiments to identify a highly stable, pyrite-structured iron oxide (FeO2) at 76 gigapascals and 1,800 kelvin that holds an excessive amount of oxygen. We show that the mineral goethite, FeOOH, which exists ubiquitously as 'rust' and is concentrated in bog iron ore, decomposes under the deep lower-mantle conditions to form FeO2 and release H-2. The reaction could cause accumulation of the heavy FeO2-bearing patches in the deep lower mantle, upward migration of hydrogen, and separation of the oxygen and hydrogen cycles. This process provides an alternative interpretation for the origin of seismic and geochemical anomalies in the deep lower mantle, as well as a sporadic O-2 source for the Great Oxidation Event over two billion years ago that created the present oxygen-rich atmosphere.

AB The economic value of carbon storage associated with British woodland is calculated. Models were developed to estimate C flux associated with live trees, forest floor litter, soils, wood products, harvest, fossil fuel. used in manufacturing and C displacement from biofuels and products for representative British plantation species: Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). Map databases of publicly and privately owned woodlands were compiled for Great Britain. Carbon flux was determined for individual woodland sites, and monetised using candidate parameters for the social discount rate (1, 3, 3.5 or 5%) and social value of carbon (US$109.5, $1, $10 or $17.10/t). A conventional discount function was applied. Final results are expressed as Net Present Values, for the base year 2001, with discounting commencing in 2002. The minimum suggested NPV (discount rate = 3% and social value of carbon = $1) of GB woodlands already existing in 2001 is $82 million, with a further $72 million that might be added by future afforestation. These figures rise dramatically if a discount rate of 1% and social value of sequestered carbon = $109.5/t are assumed. The calculated total value of C stored in British woodland depends significantly on parameter assumptions, especially about appropriate discount rate and social value of sequestered carbon, Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   NOVA-SCOTIA, CANADA
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
ID LAKE
AB Numerous deposits of organic, shallow-pond sediments and wetland peat accumulations buried by minerogenic sediments have been discovered throughout Nova Scotia. They are interpreted as representing a late-glacial climatic oscillation correlative with the Allerod/Younger Dryas event of Europe and the North Atlantic Ocean.
   The organic deposits began forming during the warm or warming interval following deglaciation and often record a transition to colder conditions. The climatic reversion recorded in many deposits began about 10.8 ka BP and continued or sustained cooling culminated in the burial of the organic deposits by minerogenic sediments indicative of solifluction and mass-wasting processes. Some deposits provide strong evidence for regeneration, or rejuvenation of local glaciers. As the organic deposits are not as susceptible as lake sediments to contamination by old carbon, they provide a more reliable chronological framework for deglaciation and late-glacial vegetational history.
   Palynological evidence shows that pioneer herb tundra communities colonized some areas shortly after 13 ka BP. Willow and birch shrubs followed soon after. Spruce woodlands had migrated into the region prior to 10.8 ka BP but had not yet reached the northeast mainland and Cape Breton Island. Cooling after 10.8 ka BP decimated tree populations and favoured a return to shrub and herb communities. The record in die buried deposits was then truncated by deposition of minerogenic sediments, and lake sediment sequences from deeper basins with continuous sedimentation are required to complete the record.

AB Data collected recently from select areas within the eastern, central and western English Channel are used to reconstruct the Holocene evolution and sea-level history of the southern coast of England. Rapid sea-level rise in the early Holocene produced a ubiquitous vertical and lateral expansion in the marine influence. From ca. 6800 cal. (calendar) yr BP the rate of sea-level rise declined and a shift from minerogenic to organogenic sedimentation is also widely recorded. A further decline in the rate of sea-level rise occurred in the late Holocene, during which time the eastern and central English Channel experienced coastal inundation and a return to minerogenic sedimentation. Explanations for this apparent contradiction include the effects of this decline on the accumulation of minerotrophic peat and changes in sediment supply. Sea-level index points from the eastern Channel generally plot below those from the central and western Channel, indicating differential crustal movement, although sediment compaction and tidal range also may be responsible for apparent altitudinal variation between these areas. Despite an increase in the quantity and quality of the data available from this region over the past 20 yr these, and a number of other important issues, require further clarification.

AB The study was aimed at determining the origin and geological evolution of lignites from the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field (Kostolac Basin, Serbia). The possibility of a rational utilization of the coal was also considered. For this purpose, numerous organic geochemical analyses were applied to representative lignite samples. The obtained results showed that the coal from the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field is a typical humic coal. The peat-forming vegetation was dominated by gymnosperm plants. The coal-forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae, Phyllo-cladaceae and Pinaceae. Other precursors of organic matter (OM) were microbial biomass ferns and angiosperms. It was established that peatification occurred in a neutral to slightly acidic, fresh water environment Under anoxic to suboxic redox conditions. The maturity of the OM is low, in the phase of intense diagenetic processes. The biomarker compositions and values of the corresponding parameters revealed that the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field, the Drmno field (Kostolac Basin) and the "A" field (Kovin deposit) represent a part of a unique lignite basin. The results of this study suggest possible rational utilization of the Smederevsko Pomoravlje lignites in thermal power plants. This is particularly related to samples from coal seam I. A significant amount of gas could be generated from lignites at higher maturities. Eight samples met the basic assumptions for effective gasification.

AB Permafrost landscapes experience different disturbances and store large amounts of organic matter, which may become a source of greenhouse gases upon permafrost degradation. We analysed the influence of terrain and geomorphic disturbances (e.g. soil creep, active-layer detachment, gullying, thaw slumping, accumulation of fluvial deposits) on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage using 11 permafrost cores from Herschel Island, western Canadian Arctic. Our results indicate a strong correlation between SOC storage and the topographic wetness index. Undisturbed sites stored the majority of SOC and TN in the upper 70cm of soil. Sites characterised by mass wasting showed significant SOC depletion and soil compaction, whereas sites characterised by the accumulation of peat and fluvial deposits store SOC and TN along the whole core. We upscaled SOC and TN to estimate total stocks using the ecological units determined from vegetation composition, slope angle and the geomorphic disturbance regime. The ecological units were delineated with a supervised classification based on RapidEye multispectral satellite imagery and slope angle. Mean SOC and TN storage for the uppermost 1m of soil on Herschel Island are 34.8kg C m(-2) and 3.4kgNm(-2), respectively. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Species composition shifts in mangrove forests may alter organic matter dynamics. The purpose of this study was to predict the effect of species replacements among mangrove trees on organic matter dynamics in a mangrove forest on the island of Kosrae. Federated States of Micronesia. We were particularly interested in elements of the carbon cycle that affect peat accumulation rates, organic matter exports to the estuary and coral reef systems, and soil microbiology. We compared organic matter production and decomposition rates among three mangrove species that commonly grow in similar hydrogeomorphic settings: Rhizophora apiculata BL, which is selectively harvested; Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, which may gradually replace Rhizophora; and Sonneratia alba, which is producing few mature fruits. Sonneratia had significantly higher rates of root production (estimated with ingrowth chambers) than Bruguiera or Rhizophora. Sonneratia foliage had significantly faster decomposition rates and significantly lower lignin:nitrogen ratios than Bruguiera foliage. Live root mass was positively correlated with ingrowth and soil carbon, although soil carbon and ingrowth were not significantly correlated with each other. Humic acid concentrations were significantly higher in Sonneratia rhizospheres than in either Bruguiera or Rhizophora rhizospheres and were positively correlated with root ingrowth. The species changes taking place on Kosrae are likely to result in lower rates of root production and foliage decomposition, and more refractory carbon pools in soil.

AB Detailed analysis of basal organic deposits underlying Hammock River marsh, Connecticut allowed documentation of water-level changes that occurred between 13,000 and 6000 yrs B.P. Four main periods of groundwater- and lake-level movements and related environmental changes can be identified. (1) 12,500-10,200 yrs B.P. (lake stage): very rapid rise of the groundwater table of about 2 to 3 m, resulting in a shallow lake, followed by a more gradual rise of about 2.5 to 1.5 m. (2) 10,200-7000 yrs B.P. (freshwater marsh, stage 1): slow overall rise of the water table interrupted by a drop of at least 1 m between about 9500 and 9000 yrs B.P. and of at least 0.8 m between about 8000 and 7500 yrs B.P., each event leading to oxidation and maceration of organic material. (3) 7000-6400 yrs B.P. (complete desiccation of the swamp): rapid fall of the water table of at least 3.9 m, causing large-scale down-wasting of the accumulated peat. (4) After 6400 yrs B.P. (freshwater marsh, stage 2): rapid rise of the water table.
   The water-table rise of period 1 and the lowering of period 3 are attributed to predominantly local causes, while the groundwater fluctuations during period 2 are probably climate-related. The final water-level increase reflects the influence of Holocene relative sea-level rise.

AB Although Finland's forest resources have been utilized intensively, the size of the total volume of the growing stock has increased since the mid-1960s, and hence increasing amounts of carbon have been sequestered by forests. The net sequestration by forests has also been substantial when compared with the CO2 emissions resulting from energy generation and consumption based on fossil fuels and peat. It is also important, from the point of view of mitigating the effects of climate change, to assess how the sequestration capacity of forests may change under changing climatic conditions. This paper presents the results of a study assessing the development of the forest and wood-product carbon budget for Finland, based on regionally measured data, detailed dynamic models, and recent predictions concerning the changing climate. At the starting point for the simulation (1990), nearly 90% of the forest sector's carbon storage was found in the forest. Regular management transferred carbon from forests to wood products. Under the current climatic conditions, the simulated forest carbon storage increased 45% by the year 2100, and the wood-product storage by 320%, as a consequence of continuous production. Under changing climate conditions, the forest carbon storage increased, but started to decline when the temperature increase exceeded 2.5 degrees C within 40 years.

ID TUNDRA; ACCUMULATION; ALASKA
AB (1) In cold environments, such as Arctic tundra, buried seeds can potentially persist in the soil for centuries or millennia. The possibility of obtaining time-stratified seed populations from Alaskan tundra was investigated in two ways. First, a deep layer of organic soil was sampled from a vertical profile through accumulating peat in Eriophorum-tussock tundra. Secondly, an organic soil buried by the slow, downslope erosional deposition of mineral soil (solifluction) was sampled; the progression of samples taken upslope under the deposit represented progressively older buried soils.
   (2) Both buried organic soils contained viable seeds, as determined with a germination assay. In Eriophorum-tussock tundra, only seeds of Carex bigelowii were found at depth. Dating by accelerator mass spectrometry of seed coats removed from these seeds showed that they were essentially modern. Several species germinated from the solifluction-buried organic soil, with viable seeds of Luzula parviflora and Carex bigelowii being found in the greatest numbers and persisting for the longest time. Dating of seed coats showed that these seeds persisted for at least 197 +/- 80 years, although viable seeds were also found associated with wood fragments 295 +/- 75 years old.
   (3) The buried seed profile under the solifluction lobe represents a 'time transect' two or three centuries long. Because seed coats were dated without killing the emerging seedling, this time transect can be used to make direct ecological genetic comparisons of past and present individuals from a single population.

AB Humic substances (HS) play an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration in soil. The structural characteristics of soil HS, extracted from two natural soils and a laboratory-incubated soil, were investigated by conventional beamline-based Fourier transform infrared radiation (CB-FTIR), a common FTIR technique based on a conventional thermal source, and synchrotron radiation-based (SR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The relative area of absorbance peaks that appeared at 2930, 2860, 1711, and 1635 cm(-1) were calculated to make a comparison of the absorbance intensities. The absorption of aromatic functional groups of HS was stronger in SR-FTIR spectroscopy than in CB-FTIR spectroscopy. Compared with humic acid extracted with a 0.1 mol/l Na4P2O7 solution, the level of aliphaticity in humic acid extracted with a 0.1 mol/l NaOH solution was higher. The aliphaticity of humin associated with clay (HMc) was higher than that of humin associated with iron (HMi). These results suggest that SR-FTIR spectroscopy is a useful and nondestructive technique to study the structural characteristics of soil humic substances. Sequential extraction of soil humic substances with NaOH and Na4P2O7 solutions may be helpful in providing additional information in cases where differences in the material obtained from different extraction solutions occur. The aliphaticity and complexity of HMc were higher than those of HMi.

AB This study attempted to improve the properties and energy efficiency of torrefied biochar produced from the waste of two common street trees, namely, Washingtonia filifera and Sterculia foetida. The effects of various torrefaction temperatures (210-300 degrees C) and reaction times (30 and 60 min) were evaluated. W. filifera petiole (WFP) biochar exhibited a higher weight loss and energy yield than S. foetida follicle (SFF) biochar. As the torrefaction temperature and time increased, the higher heating values (HHVs) and fuel ratios of both types of biochar increased, and the H/C and O/C atomic ratios became similar to the atomic ratios of lignite and peat due to the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose in the biomass structures. Furans and acetic acid, respectively, were the major gaseous products of WFP and SFF torrefaction. The maximum energy return on investment (EROI) of 23.2 was achieved for WFP biochar torrefied at 210 degrees C for 30 min. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced markedly by 74.7-91.6% if biochar is used as a substitute for bituminous coal. Moreover, cofiring WFP or SFF biochar with bituminous coal at power plants is sustainable and economically beneficial because of the high HHV, stability, thermal performance, sufficient EROI, and low GHG emissions.

AB The energy sector is the major contributor to GHG (greenhouse gas emissions) in Ireland. Under EU Renewable energy targets, Ireland must achieve contributions of 40%, 12% and 10% from renewables to electricity, heat and transport respectively by 2020, in addition to a 20% reduction in GHG emissions. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to carry out a comprehensive, holistic evaluation of biomass-to-energy systems in 2020 based on indigenous biomass supply chains optimised to reduce production and transportation GHG emissions. Impact categories assessed include; global warming, acidification, eutrophication potentials, and energy demand. Two biomass energy conversion technologies are considered; co-firing with peat, and biomass CHP (combined heat and power) systems. Biomass is allocated to each plant according to a supply optimisation model which ensures minimal GHG emissions. The study shows that while CHP systems produce lower environmental impacts than co-firing systems in isolation, determining overall environmental impacts requires analysis of the reference energy systems which are displaced. In addition, if the aims of these systems are to increase renewable energy penetration in line with the renewable electricity and renewable heat targets, the optimal scenario may not be the one which achieves the greatest environmental impact reductions.

AB Biochars are used to improve soil quality and crop productivity as well as to increase carbon sequestration in soil. However, it is important to identify the characteristics of biochar prior to its application because of the positive and negative effects on soil and crop productivity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of charcoals on the growth and seedling quality of Quercus serrata and Prunus sargentii in a containerized seedling production system. Two of the charcoals used in our research were from oak tree; one produced at 1200 degrees C and the other at 700 similar to 800 degrees C, and a bamboo charcoal produced at about 800 degrees C. Three charcoals were mixed with artificial soil (peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v)), and applied commercial fertilizer at two concentrations; 0.5 and 1.0 g L-1. Growth parameters, such as height, root collar diameter, and dry weight, were decreased in charcoal treatments compared to control. However, charcoal treatments significantly increased the quality index of seedlings by 8.3% in Q. serrata and by 19.9% in P. sargentii. Our results suggested that charcoal can be applied to improve seedling quality in the containerized Q. serrata and P. sargentii seedling production system.

AB Geoarchaeological research at the Middle Pleistocene site of Schoningen 13 II-4, often referred to as the Speerhorizont, has focused on describing and evaluating the depositional contexts of the well-known wooden spears, butchered horses, and stone tools. These finds were, recovered from the transitional contact between a lacustrine marl and an overlying organic mud, originally thought to be a peat that accumulated in place under variable moisture conditions. The original excavators proposed that hominin activity, including hunting and butchery, occurred on a dry lake shore and was followed by a rapid sedimentation of organic deposits that embedded and preserved the artifacts. Our geoarchaeological analysis challenges this model. Here, we present evidence that the sediments of Schoningen 13 II-4 were deposited in a constantly submerged area of a paleolake. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the artifacts were deposited during a short, extreme drying event, there are no sedimentary features indicative of surface exposure in the sediments. Accordingly, this paper explores three main alternative models of site formation: anthropogenic disposal of materials into the lake, a geological relocation of the artifacts, and hunting or caching on lake-ice. These models have different behavioral ramifications concerning hominin knowledge and exploitation of the landscape and their subsistence strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treatment of biochar with oxidants such as acids and hydrogen peroxide has been shown to alter porosity, increase adsorption of chemicals, and introduce functional groups on the biochar surfaces, all of which are desirable for their use in horticultural applications. Biochar was produced from the pyrolysis of wood from seven-year-old Paulownia elongata (PE) trees using a top-lit updraft design stove. PE biochar was subsequently treated with 30% (v/v) sulfuric acid, 30% (w/v) oxalic acid, and 10 and 30% (w/w) H2O2. After thorough rinsing with deionized water to remove residual acids and H2O2, biochars were examined for chemical and physical properties. All of the biochars had high carbon percentages, due to the high temperatures (>1000 degrees C) reached during pyrolysis. Surface areas, micropore surface areas, % micro pore surface areas, pH values, cation exchange capacities and electrical conductivities decreased with all oxidant treatments. Analysis of surface functionality by ATR-FTIR showed limited changes resulting from the treatments. TPO/MS analysis showed that all treatments resulted in chars with higher oxidation temperatures suggesting that these are more stable toward oxidation. Unlike reports of biochar derived from different feedstocks and different pyrolysis methods, it appears that treatment of PE biochar with oxidants is unnecessary for its use in horticultural applications.

TI A NEW LOOK AT MICRO WEAR IN CAST IRON BRAKE ROTORS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF METALCASTING
LA English
DT Article
DE wear; NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness); residual stress; thickness
   variation
AB Wear in cast iron is generally a macro phenomenon, measured in grams of weight loss or millimeters of thickness lost in a test specimen. Traditional wear test methods employ loads that are relatively high and of a short duration. In the automotive industry NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) is a primary concern with automotive driveline and chassis components. Recent NVH issues on some specific vehicles were determined to be caused by brake rotor thickness variation as observed during actual on-road tests after a short period in service. Changes in brake rotor thickness were observed in isolated areas of the brake plates during routine dynamometer testing of disc brake rotors. A new test was developed to determine the cause of the thickness variations. Numerous studies were conducted to reduce what was first thought to be thermal growth. Thermal growth reduction was investigated by looking at casting residual stresses, peal-lite decomposition reactions, elevating Martensite transition temperatures, peat-lite spacing, matrix hardness, and alloy levels affecting all of these. Micro wear was determined to be the cause for brake rotor thickness variation. The micro wear was in turn found to be a function of the graphite density differences around the rotor brake plate diameter caused by localized cooling rates. Casting process simulation studies were conducted to determine the effects of gating systems on cooling profiles. Changes were made to the gating system, minimizing the cooling rate differences.

AB Soil microbiome has a pivotal role in ecosystem functioning, yet little is known about its build-up from local to regional scales. In a multi-year regional-scale survey involving 1251 plots and long-read third-generation sequencing, we found that soil pH has the strongest effect on the diversity of fungi and its multiple taxonomic and functional groups. The pH effects were typically unimodal, usually both direct and indirect through tree species, soil nutrients or mold abundance. Individual tree species, particularlyPinus sylvestris,Picea abies, andPopulus x wettsteinii, and overall ectomycorrhizal plant proportion had relatively stronger effects on the diversity of biotrophic fungi than saprotrophic fungi. We found strong temporal sampling and investigator biases for the abundance of molds, but generally all spatial, temporal and microclimatic effects were weak. Richness of fungi and several functional groups was highest in woodlands and around ruins of buildings but lowest in bogs, with marked group-specific trends. In contrast to our expectations, diversity of soil fungi tended to be higher in forest island habitats potentially due to the edge effect, but fungal richness declined with island distance and in response to forest fragmentation. Virgin forests supported somewhat higher fungal diversity than old non-pristine forests, but there were no differences in richness between natural and anthropogenic habitats such as parks and coppiced gardens. Diversity of most fungal groups suffered from management of seminatural woodlands and parks and thinning of forests, but especially for forests the results depended on fungal group and time since partial harvesting. We conclude that the positive effects of tree diversity on overall fungal richness represent a combined niche effect of soil properties and intimate associations.

ID CAPTURE
AB Recently, CCS (carbon dioxide capture and sequestration) has been receiving considerable attention as a possible means of dealing with emissions of CO2, a greenhouse gas. To this end, EOR (enhanced oil recovery) and EGR (enhanced gas recovery) are regarded as being viable options for economically sequestrating large amounts of CO2. A feasible approach would involve capturing CO2 from large-scale CO2 emission sources such as power plants, and then transporting that captured gas to near-depleted oil and gas wells to maintain the reservoir pressure and enhance the oil/gas recovery rate. In the future, CO2 will be transported large distances from emission sources in developed countries to oil/gas producing regions by pipelines or ships. The long-distance ship-based transport of CO2 would require that the gas be compressed or liquefied (LCO2). Furthermore, an LCO2 transport ship would have to be capable of processing boil-off gas while at sea.
   In this study, the selection method of compressors for re-liquefaction system of dedicated LCO2 transport ship was investigated by computational method. The performance of same compression ratio (SCR) method exhibited low levels of efficiency and reliability as for coefficient of performance (COP) and compressor discharge temperature in terms of oil degradation compared to that of intermediate pressure optimization (IPO). Of these three methods, IPO produced the highest level of performance of all, but could not guarantee compressor reliability as like SCR, too. Intermediate pressure optimization with same discharge temperature (IPODT) method was found to be better in terms of reliability, with a decrease in performance of only 5% relative to that obtained by IPO. Consequently, we recommend the use of the IPODT method for the design of a multi-stage compression system for the re-liquefaction cycle of an LCO2 transport ship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE Se; Earthworms; Bioremediation; Biotransformation; Bacteria
AB Selenium (Se)-polluted soils pose serious threats to terrestrial ecosystems through food chains. This study evaluated the use of earthworm Eisenia fetida and organic materials for Se remediation. The greater mortality (6.7%) and weight loss (28.6%) were observed for earthworms exposed to selenate than selenite at 20 mg Se Kg(-1) over 21 d, while selenate was taken up 2.5-fold faster than selenite. Compared with peat moss, Se accumulation increased by 119% in selenite-exposed earthworms supplied with cow manure. Earthworm activity caused greater reduction in selenite (17.4%), with little impact on selenate-treated soil. X-ray absorption spectroscopy speciation analysis shows 87-91% of tissue Se was transformed to organo-Se, i.e., SeMet and SeCys, in earthworms exposed to either selenite or selenate, posing great risks to their predators. The study also found selenium increased bacterial diversity in earthworm casts, while greater relative abundances (similar to 37.57%) of functional genera were obtained for selenite. Over 24 h, two bacteria strains, Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas encheleia, isolated from casts, rapidly reduced selenite by similar to 94%, compared to similar to 25% for selenate. Elemental Se was present only in strains (similar to 27%), casts (similar to 11%) and worm-inhabited soil (similar to 2.7%) of selenite treatments, suggesting earthworm gut microbiota could buffer earthworms and other soil fauna from selenite toxicity.

AB This paper presents the result of the studies of soil formation on different aged coastal bars in the transgression zone of Lake Ladoga in the Nizhnesvirsky Nature Reserve (Leningrad region, North-West of the Russian Federation). The investigation presents the data on soil chronoseries, located on four Ladoga coastal bars of different ages from 70 +/- 25 to 1590 +/- 25 years BP. We estimated the trends of accumulation and transformation of organic matter, elemental composition of humic acids (HAs), development of plant communities and the influence of soil formation factors on the formation rate of soil horizons. We assessed the degree of soil organic matter stabilization using modern instrumental methods (spectroscopy of nuclear magnetic resonance CP/MAS C-13-NMR). An integral indicator of the hydrophobicity of HAs, which represents the total fraction of unoxidized carbon atoms, is proposed. The Ladoga Holocene transgression is one of the most informative and applicable models for pedogenesis; successional processes occurring in young and mature areas can be traced here. We identified local processes of soil formation such as podzolization, gleyfication, peat formation and humus accumulation. Physical, physical-chemical and biological soil properties with a detailed description of the morphology of soil of different aged coastal bars are presented.

AB SmNACE is a NAD, catabolizing, enzyme expresied on the outer tegument of S. mansoni, a human parasite that is one of the major agents of the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Recently, we identified aroylhydrazone, one derivatives capable,of inhibiting the recombinant form of the enzyme with variable potency (IC50 ranging from 88,mu M to 33 nM). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of action of the least potent micromolar inhibitor (compound 1) and they most potent nanomolar inhibitor (compound 2) in the series on both the recombinant and native SmNACE enzyme's Using, mass spectroscopy, spectrophotometry, and activity assays under different experimental conditions, we demonstrated that the >3 log gain in potency against recombinant SmNACE by this class of compounds is dependent on the formation of a coordination complex with metal cations, such as Ni(II), Zn(II), and Peat), that are loaded on the protein surface. Testing the compounds on live parasites, we observed that only the weak micromolar compound 1 was active on the native enzyme. We showed that S. mansoni effectively sequesters the metal from the coordination complex, resulting in the loss of inhibitory activity of the potent nanomolar compound 2, Importantly the modeling of the transition complex between Zn(II) and compound enabled the discovery of a new metal-independent aroylhydrazone analogue which is now the most potent and selective inhibitor of native SmNACE known.

AB Continuous paleoenvironmental records covering the period prior to the Last Glacial Maximum in northeastern Beringia are sparse. This study presents a multi-proxy analysis of a 35-m-high yedoma exposure located on the right bank of the Itkillik River in Alaska. The exposure accumulated over 39 thousand years (kyr) during the Middle Wisconsinan Interstadial and the Late Wisconsinan glacial advance. We identified five stratigraphic units based on pollen, carbon and ice content, and isotopic composition (6180) of the sediments. Middle Wisconsinan climate in northern Alaska promoted peat accumulation prior to 33.6 cal kyr BP (calibrated kyr before present). Reconstructed July air temperatures were 1-2 degrees C lower than current at 34.8 cal kyr BP, consistent with the timing of the interstadial climatic optimum in interior Alaska and Yukon. Colder (by up to 4 degrees C) and drier conditions characterize the transition from interstadial to glacial conditions between 33.6 and 29.8 cal kyr BP. Late Wisconsinan (29.8-17.9 cal kyr BP) July air temperatures were 2-3 degrees C lower than today, with grassland vegetation dominated by Poaceae, Artemisia and forbs, in contrast to the modem Cyperaceae dominance. Moister and warmer environmental conditions after 17.9 cal kyr BP correspond to the Late Glacial to Early Holocene interval. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Palynological, loss-on-ignition, and X-ray fluorescence data from a 525 m sediment core from a mangrove forest at the mouth of the Shark River Estuary in the southwestern Everglades National Park, Florida were used to reconstruct changes occurring in coastal wetlands since the mid-Holocene. This multi-proxy record contains the longest paleoecological history to date in the southwestern Everglades. The Shark River Estuary basin was formed similar to 5700 cal yr BP in response to increasing precipitation. Initial wetlands were frequently-burned short-hydroperiod prairies, which transitioned into long-hydroperiod prairies with sloughs in which peat deposits began to accumulate continuously about 5250 cal yr BP. Our data suggest that mangrove communities started to appear after similar to 3800 cal yr BP; declines in the abundance of charcoal suggested gradual replacement of fire-dominated wetlands by mangrove forest over the following 2650 yr. By similar to 1150 cal yr BP, a dense Rhizophora mangle dominated mangrove forest had formed at the mouth of the Shark River. The mangrove-dominated coastal ecosystem here was established at least 2000 yr later than has been previously estimated. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

AB Lithium (Li) is an important strategic resource, and with the increasing demand for Li, there are some limitations in the exploitation and utilization of conventional deposits such as the pegmatite-type and brine-type Li deposits. Therefore, it has become imperative to search for Li from other sources. Li in coal is thought to be one of the candidates. In this study, the petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of No. 2(1)coal from the Hebi No. 6 mine, Anhe Coalfield, China, was reported, with an emphasis on the distribution, modes of occurrence, and origin of Li. The results show that Li is enriched in the No. 2(1)coal, and its concentration coefficient (CC) value is 6.6 on average in comparison with common world coals. Lithium in the studied coal is mainly present in aluminosilicates, mainly clay minerals, some of which contain a significant amount of Ti. The Li enrichment in the No. 2(1)coal is mainly controlled by the terrigenous materials and sourced from the moyite of the Yinshan Upland. Furthermore, Li in the No. 2(1)coal is more enriched in coals formed in acidic and humid conditions and coals influenced by fresh water during peat accumulation.

DT Article
ID OREGON
AB A conifer forest on the shore of Verdant Cove, an inlet of Aialik Bay on the southeast coast of the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, was buried by high-energy beach sediments shortly after 860 +/- 50 C-14 years BP. The switch from ocean-distal forest to cobble beach indicates a radical change in depositional environment suggestive of rapid subsidence of 1-3.5 m. The presence of hemlock, a tree taxon sensitive to salt-water exposure, and the preserved cast of a tree trunk suggest that subsidence and burial occurred rapidly. By 690 +/- 60 C-14 years BP, forest peat was accumulating atop the beach sediments burying the forest and rapid spit progradation was underway. Spit progradation implies land emergence or stable sea level, especially in this case where the spit has a limited sediment supply. We infer that subsidence of the spit ca. 860 +/- 50 C-14 years BP was followed by slow land emergence up to the time of the 1964 AD great earthquake, when the area subsided coseismically 1.4 m. The sudden drowning of the buried forest in Verdant Cove was probably caused by coseismic subsidence and later emergence by gradual, interseismic uplift. Comparison of the Verdant Cove record with previously reported data from south-central Alaska suggests that the penultimate great earthquake in the rupture zone of the 1964 Alaska earthquake occurred between 700 and 800 calendric years BP.

AB Unusual carbonaceous matter, termed here chiemite, composed of more than 90% C from the Alpine Foreland at Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, southeastern Germany has been investigated using optical and atomic force microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis, as well as by delta C-13 and C-14 radiocarbon isotopic data analysis. In the pumice-like fragments, poorly ordered carbon matter co-exists with high-ordering monocrystalline alpha-carbyne, and contains submicrometer-sized inclusions of complex composition. Diamond and carbyne add to the peculiar mix of matter. The required very high temperatures and pressures for carbyne formation point to a shock event probably from the recently proposed Holocene Chiemgau meteorite impact. The carbon material is suggested to have largely formed from heavily shocked coal, vegetation like wood, and peat from the impact target area. The carbonization/coalification high PT process may be attributed to a strong shock that instantaneously caused the complete evaporation and loss of volatile matter and water, which nevertheless preserved the original cellular structure seen fossilized in many fragments. Relatively fresh wood encapsulated in the purported strongly shocked matter point to quenched carbon melt components possibly important for the discussion of survival of organic matter in meteorite impacts, implying an astrobiological relationship.

AB A factorial experiment, consisting of six potting media and two sizes of root trainers, was carried out in the nursery of the Forest Department, District of Lentang, Pahang. Potting media used were 100% coconut husk, peat gro and decomposed oil palm mesocarp fibre. Another three media were prepared, consisting each of the above medium mixed with rice hulls in the ratio of 3:1. These media were filled into two sizes of root trainers (500 and 700 cm(3)) and were tested with Shorea leprosula seedlings. Measurements taken at six months after potting showed that increments in height and diameter as well as root and shoot dry weights of S. leprosula were significantly better in plants raised in medium containing 100% oil palm mesocarp fibre compared with the other media tested. In this medium, height and diameter increments, and root and shoot dry weights were 50.8 cm, 3.8 mm, 1.5 g and 6.8 g respectively. No differences were observed in these parameters when two sizes of root trainers were used. More than 90% survival was obtained in all the media used. The results indicated that decomposed oil palm mesocarp fibre has the potential to be used as a lightweight potting medium for forest seedlings. Being a waste product from oil palm mills, it is easily obtainable and cheap. As a lightweight medium, it will greatly facilitate transportation of seedlings to the planting sites.

AB Coal is a particular sedimentary organic ore and has a huge resource worldwide. Coal is a resource primarily used for electric power generation, and currently supplies 41% of global electricity needs. Significant quantities of coal are also employed in metallurgical processes, gasification, cement industries. and as raw materials for activated carbon and many common and industrial chemicals, as well as for heat for the wallboard, aluminum, and cement industries. A number of coals can also be considered as an economic source of some critical metals, and thus are coal-hosted ore deposits. The critical metals in coal and coal-bearing sequences occur at concentrations comparable to or even higher than those in conventional economic deposits. China is. and in the coming decades should continue to be, the largest producer and user of coal in the world. The high volume of coal usage in China has led to attention not only on the toxic elements that may be released from coal combustion but also on the critical metals that may occur in the coal and coal-bearing sequences, as well as coal combustion by-products. Critical elements (e.g.. Ge, Ga, U. rare earth elements and Y, Nb, Zr, Se, V. Re, Au, and Ag, as well as the base metal Al) in a number of coals (or coal ashes) and some coal-bearing strata in China occur at concentrations comparable to or even higher than those in conventional economic deposits. This paper reviewed the distribution and ore-forming mechanism of some typical coal-hosted ore deposits in China, including Ge, Ga-Al, rare earth elements (REE), and Nb-Zr-REE-Ga. Additionally, other critical metals such as Be. Sc, Li, Mg, V, and Re in coal and coal bearing sequences have also been briefly reviewed. Several geological factors are responsible for the deposition of coal-hosted critical metals, including injection of hydrothermal fluids during peat accumulation or later epigenetic stages, deposition of syngenetic alkali volcanic ashes in peat swamp, input of terrigenous mineral matter into the coal-forming environment, leaching of partings by groundwater. and mixed processes involving both hydrothermal solutions and volcanic ash. Mixed processes involving both hydrothermal solutions and volcanic ash are also important geological factors that contribute to the deposition of coal-hosted critical metals. The critical metals in Chinese coal and coal-bearing sequences may be associated with either the organic matter or minerals. For example, germanium exclusively occurs in the organic matter. gallium mainly occurs in boehmite and kaolinite, and to a lesser extent, in the organic matter, rare earth elements and Y occur as carbonate minerals (e.g., florencite and parisite), phosphate minerals (e.g., rhabdophane, silicorhabdophane, and xenotime), and in part are associated with the organic matter. Some critical metals (e.g.. Ge, Al, and Ga) have been successfully extracted at an industrial scale from Chinese coals, and others have significant potential for such extraction. Major challenges remaining for coal scientists include the development of economic extraction methods from coal ash, and the control of toxic elements released during the metal extraction process to protect human health and to avoid environmental pollution.

AB A section cut across an alluvial fan and the underlying floodplain terrace in the central Grampian Highlands provides an unusually complete record of late Holocene events. At ca. 2.7-2.4 cal kyr BP floodplain aggradation was replaced by net floodplain incision. Pollen evidence and charcoal counts provide no evidence for contemporaneous anthropogenic landscape change, and the timing of the transition suggests that it reflects an increase in high-magnitude erosive flood events following overall climatic deterioration. The overlying fan was deposited by torrential hyperconcentrated flows during three brief storm-generated depositional events at ca. 2.2-2.1, 1.9-1.8 and 0.9-0.7 cal kyr BP, separated and succeeded by prolonged periods of stability and peat accumulation. During these three events, a cumulative total of ca. 6750 m(3) of sediment was deposited, probably in no more than a few hours over a timescale of two millennia. These findings imply that proposed links between human activity and the development of alluvial fans or debris cones require reassessment, and that different elements of the Holocene alluvial landscape have responded in different ways to the same climatic inputs. Aggregation of dating evidence relating to aggradation or incision of alluvial landforms at different scales therefore may produce misleading results. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Microtopography, or the small-scale variation in ground surface height (10(-1)-10(0) m) over short (10(0)-10(2) m) spatial scales, is a ubiquitous feature of wetlands globally. This variation in elevation, characterized by local high ("hummocks") and low ("hollows") patches, is more structured than what is observed in uplands, and is intertwined with concordantly structured spatiotemporal variability in hydrologic regimes and associated ecological processes. The importance of microtopography in wetlands is manifold, with critical influence on local hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes. Further, the creation and maintenance of wetland microtopography is a balance between activation processes (i.e., those that induce random elevation variation) and autogenic reinforcement processes (i.e., those that provide the feedbacks necessary for the persistence of microtopography). While there are many mechanisms that create vertical structure (e.g., tree falls, accumulation of roots and soil organic matter, and sediment deposition), they all yield a similar core feedback to enhance and sustain microtopographic structure. Finally, microtopography contributes to spatial patterning that confers emergent ecosystem-scale functions such as hydrologic storage and flows, carbon cycling, organism dispersal, and biodiversity. There is an ongoing need to study the origins and implications of this fine-scale variation in elevation, as well as the utility of including microtopography in model predictions and ecological restoration efforts.

AB Tertiary coals from the La Jagua and Calenturitas coal mines in the Cesar sub-basin, Colombia were investigated for the first time using organic-petrological and organic-geochemical methods to assess the thermal maturity and palaeoenvironmental conditions during peat accumulation. Thirteen seams were sampled from the Los Cuervos formation at two mines. Evaluation based on organic petrological analyses and Rock-Eval pyrolysis reveals that the coals are thermally immature and of sub-bituminous B to sub-bituminous A rank with a predominance of type III, mixed with type II kerogen. 22S/(22S + 22R) homohopane, T-s/(T-s + T-m), MPI, MPR and 1-MP/9-MP ratios are very low. This low thermal maturity corresponds to high volatile matter contents.
   Petrographically, the La Jagua and Calenturitas coals are dominated by vitrinite, with low to high amounts of inertinite and low to moderate amounts of liptinite. The detailed petrographic data indicate a predominantly herbaceous plant input and oxidative conditions during deposition, mostly with strong tissue destruction. Further conclusions are deduced from petrographic ratios such as tissue preservation-, gelification-, groundwater(Ac)- and vegetation indices, ash- and sulfur contents, iso- and n-alkane distribution, and 17 alpha(H)-homohopane ratio. In summary, the data support a formation in tropical, ombrogenic, rather wet pests with high bacterial activity.

AB One of the most valuable ecological potentials of soil organic matter (SOM) is based on its highly dynamic nature, which enables flexible reactions to a variety of environmental conditions. SOM controls a large part of the processes occurring at biogeochemical interfaces in soil and may contribute to sequestration of organic chemicals. This contribution focuses on dynamics in SOM from a viewpoint that regards SOM as an amorphous matrix, in which weak intermolecular interactions rather than covalent binding are considered. This view is based on the conception of SOM as a supramolecular assembly, which was first suggested in studies by A. Piccolo and R. L. Wershaw. Based on our recent results on thermal analysis of SOM, our central hypothesis is that regardless of the individual molecular mass, SOM undergoes physicochemical matrix aging, driven by dynamics in intermolecular cross-linking via bridges of water molecules. In this study, we have made the first efforts to evaluate the water-bridge hypothesis with proton NMR relaxation and proton wideline NMR. The results clearly indicate changes in relaxation time and proton line shape induced by manipulations of thermal history, which suggests an increase in side-chain mobility upon heating that remains after cooling. Side-chain mobility slowly decreases again within at least 1-2 weeks. Our current results strongly suggest even longer aging periods. This observation supports the hypothesis that water molecules bridge molecular segments of SOM. The bridges may be easily disrupted, while re-formation is slow due to diffusion limitation in the SOM matrix.

AB Spontaneous coal combustion in the La Guajira coals was studied for the presence of carbon nanophases (e.g., carbon nanotubes), occurrence of rare earth elements (REEs) in them, and the probable mechanisms for concentration of these rare compounds. For this purpose, various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Field-emission SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, and focused ion beam (FIB) were used. The development and alteration of the nanoparticles by geo-processes during the early modification periods of coal combustion were explored. Certain types of carbon nanophases and REE compounds may constitute nanominerals and ultra-fine particles accumulated in the coal peat. Assemblages of these nanophases (crystalline and amorphous compounds), predominantly the clay-monazite relationship and its connection to tonsteins in the coal combustion zones in the east region of the coal mines studied in this work, indicate that the coal area was subjected to REE concentration. The carbon nanophases contained several potential hazardous elements (PHEs), including, arsenic, bromine, cadmium, chlorine, fluorine, mercury, and other PHEs. While carbon nanotubes have been known to be produced from spontaneous combustion of coal of varying ranks, the present work is the first report on the naturally occurring REEs and carbon nanophases in the Colombian coal mining area.

AB We revisited the well documented and ongoing long-term 'Ultuna continuous soil organic matter field experiment' which started in 1956 at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The objective of the experiment is to quantify effects of six organic amendments and mineral N fertilizers on the crop and soil. We used the 'equivalent soil mass' concept for estimating changes in the topsoil carbon stocks in all 15 treatments. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop yields. Clustering C inputs into seven categories by quality allowed us to calculate a 'humification' coefficient for each category. Here, these coefficients were simply based on the fraction of total C input that still remains in the topsoil after about 50 years. As indicated by previous studies, this coefficient was highest for peat, followed by sewage sludge, manure, sawdust and above-ground crop residues. The most interesting result from the current investigation is that the optimized coefficient for root-derived carbon was about 2.3 times higher than that for above-ground plant residues. The calculated results were found to be robust in a sensitivity analysis. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that root-derived carbon contributes more to relatively stable soil C pools than the same amount of above-crop residue-derived (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Metalliferous coal deposits, mainly hosting Zr(Hf)-Nb(Ta)-REE and U(Mo,Se)-REE ores, in East Asia (Primorye of Russia and South China) primarily result from the evolution of plumes ascending from deep mantle and/or asthenospheric flows, both of which incorporate some reworking of the continental crust. This mantle-crust interaction not only led to coal-basin formation but also played a significant role in extensive volcanism and ore-generating hydrothermal activity. Three mineralization styles are identified in these deposits: tuffaceous, hydrothermal-fluid, and mixed tuffaceous-hydrothermal types. The tuffaceous Zr(Hf)-Nb(Ta)-REE deposits have source magmas with an alkali basalt composition, although felsic, mafic, and intermediate types of tuffaceous horizons have been identified in the study area. The mineralization occurred not only in the coal but also in the host rocks, and not only during peat accumulation but also during the later stages of coal development (including coalification and late epigenetic processes). Rare metals in the metalliferous coal deposits are generally either associated with clay and organic matter or occur as secondary minerals derived from decomposition of the primary magmatic rare-metal bearing minerals (e.g. Nb-bearing rutile) under the influence of organic acids and hydrothermal fluids.

AB & nbsp;It is increasingly clear that increases in dissolved organic carbon in upland waters in recent decades have often been dominated by acid deposition, but reasons for substantial variation in rates of change remain unclear. This paper focuses on the extent to which spatial properties, such as variation in soil properties, atmospheric deposition and climate, affect the sensitivity of DOC concentrations in soil water. The purpose is to i) examine evidence for differences in site average concentrations and trends in soil water DOC between sites with contrasting ecosystem properties, i.e. vegetation cover and soil type, and ii) identify the wider combination of site characteristics that best explain variation in these DOC metrics between sites. We collated soil water and deposition chemistry, soil chemistry and meteorological data from 15 long-term UK monitoring sites (1992 & ndash;2010) covering a range of soils, vegetation, climate and acid deposition levels. Mineral soils under forests showed the greatest range of long-term mean DOC concentrations and trends. Regression analysis indicated that acid and sea-salt deposition, and soil sensitivity to acidification were the factors most strongly associated with spatial variation in mean DOC concentrations. Spatial variation in DOC trends were best explained by Al saturation and water flux. Overall, the sensitivity of DOC release from soil to changes in pollutant deposition could be related to the type of vegetation cover and soils chemistry properties, such as Al saturation, divalent base cation content and hydrological regime. The identification of the ecosystem properties that appear most influential in modifying & nbsp;DOC production and responses to long-term drivers, helps elucidate potential mechanistic explanations for differences in DOC dynamics across seemingly similar ecosystems, and points to the importance of DOC mobility in regulating its dynamics.

AB Holocene paleoecological studies in tropical Africa are rare because most lakes either dried out at the termination of the African Humid Period or have since filled up. However, tropical sedge marshes can be an alternative to perform long-term ecological studies. The Lope National Park (LNP) in Gabon is a mosaic of forest and savanna enclosed in the equatorial forest, where open areas facilitated the development of peat marshes accumulating several-meter-thick sediment. In order to reconstruct the historical dynamic in these marshes through a local and regional point of view, we compared sedimentological, continuous X-ray fluorescence, and stable isotopic analyses on sediment cores from six herbaceous marshes in the LNP. A reliable chronological frame was based on 50 C-14 dates, over the last 2500 years in most sites, and reaching 9000 years in one marsh. We show that the origin of these marshes is a major hydrological change, 3450 and 2300 years ago, that affected the entire region, almost concomitantly with the diffusion of Iron Age population. The sedimentation within marshes is homogenous with low intra-site variability. In contrast, high inter-sites variability evidences that the functioning of the marsh itself exerts a much more significant influence than in lakes. However, a regional event is recorded between 1400 and 800 years ago, concurrently with an archeological trace hiatus throughout the forest hinterland of West Central Africa.

AB Overviewing the European carbon (C), greenhouse gas (GHG), and non-GHG fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP) is about 9.3 Pg yr-1, and fossil fuel imports are 1.6 Pg yr-1. GPP is about 1.25% of solar radiation, containing about 360 x 1018 J energy - five times the energy content of annual fossil fuel use. Net primary production (NPP) is 50%, terrestrial net biome productivity, NBP, 3%, and the net GHG balance, NGB, 0.3% of GPP. Human harvest uses 20% of NPP or 10% of GPP, or alternatively 1 parts per thousand of solar radiation after accounting for the inherent cost of agriculture and forestry, for production of pesticides and fertilizer, the return of organic fertilizer, and for the C equivalent cost of GHG emissions. C equivalents are defined on a global warming potential with a 100-year time horizon. The equivalent of about 2.4% of the mineral fertilizer input is emitted as N2O. Agricultural emissions to the atmosphere are about 40% of total methane, 60% of total NO-N, 70% of total N2O-N, and 95% of total NH3-N emissions of Europe. European soils are a net C sink (114 Tg yr-1), but considering the emissions of GHGs, soils are a source of about 26 Tg CO2 C-equivalent yr-1. Forest, grassland and sediment C sinks are offset by GHG emissions from croplands, peatlands and inland waters. Non-GHGs (NH3, NOx) interact significantly with the GHG and the C cycle through ammonium nitrate aerosols and dry deposition. Wet deposition of nitrogen (N) supports about 50% of forest timber growth. Land use change is regionally important. The absolute flux values total about 50 Tg C yr-1. Nevertheless, for the European trace-gas balance, land-use intensity is more important than land-use change. This study shows that emissions of GHGs and non-GHGs significantly distort the C cycle and eliminate apparent C sinks.

AB Woodlands represent highly significant carbon sinks globally, though could lose this function under future climatic change. Effective large-scale monitoring of these woodlands has a critical role to play in mitigating for, and adapting to, climate change. Mediterranean woodlands have low carbon densities, but represent important global carbon stocks due to their extensiveness and are particularly vulnerable because the region is predicted to become much hotter and drier over the coming century. Airborne lidar is already recognized as an excellent approach for high-fidelity carbon mapping, but few studies have used multi-temporal lidar surveys to measure carbon fluxes in forests and none have worked with Mediterranean woodlands. We use a multi-temporal (5-year interval) airborne lidar data set for a region of central Spain to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) and carbon dynamics in typical mixed broadleaved and/or coniferous Mediterranean woodlands. Field calibration of the lidar data enabled the generation of grid-based maps of AGB for 2006 and 2011, and the resulting AGB change was estimated. There was a close agreement between the lidar-based AGB growth estimate (1.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and those derived from two independent sources: the Spanish National Forest Inventory, and a tree-ring based analysis (1.19 and 1.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). We parameterised a simple simulator of forest dynamics using the lidar carbon flux measurements, and used it to explore four scenarios of fire occurrence. Under undisturbed conditions (no fire) an accelerating accumulation of biomass and carbon is evident over the next 100 years with an average carbon sequestration rate of 1.95 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). This rate reduces by almost a third when fire probability is increased to 0.01 (fire return rate of 100 years), as has been predicted under climate change. Our work shows the power of multi-temporal lidar surveying to map woodland carbon fluxes and provide parameters for carbon dynamics models. Space deployment of lidar instruments in the near future could open the way for rolling out wide-scale forest carbon stock monitoring to inform management and governance responses to future environmental change.

AB Purpose Potentially toxic element (PTE) concentrations in mine-degraded soil and their bioaccumulation in food crops is a public health concern worldwide. The current study investigates the influence of organic geo-sorbents including biochar (B), farmyard manure (FYM), and peat moss (PTM) on PTE in chromite mine-degraded soil and their subsequent effects on spinach biomass, PTE uptake, average dietary intake (ADI), and health risk (HRI) associated with PTE via spinach consumption.
   Materials and methods Chromite mine-degraded soil samples were collected from different mining sites in Kohistan region. Pot experiments were carried out in the greenhouse environment. The selected geo-sorbents (B, FYM and PTM) were mixed at application rates of 1%, 2%, and 5%. Contaminated soil without geo-sorbents (control treatment) was also included in each batch of the experiments. Local FYM and PTM were used in this experiment, while B was provided by the Institute of Urban Environment (CAS) Xiamen, China. The total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), and total sulfur (S) contents in mine-degraded soil and organic geo-sorbents were measured using a macro-elementor (VarioMax CNS, Germany). Total (acid digestion) and bioavailable PTE (As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn, and Pb) concentrations in mine-degraded soil and spinach were determined using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer (ICP-MS 7500 CX, Agilent Technologies, USA).
   Results and discussion The addition of organic geo-sorbents effectively immobilized the PTE concentrations in mine-degraded soil, and increased the major nutrient contents and thereby reduced the bioaccumulation of PTE (Cr, As, Ni, Cd, Zn, and Pb) in spinach. Consequently, B2, B5, FYM2, FYM5, PTM2, and PTM5 amendments significantly (p<0.001) increased the biomass, whereas the B1, FYM1, and PTM1 addition showed no significant increase in spinach biomass as compared to the control treatment. The results showed that all the organic geo-sorbents had significantly (p<0.001) reduced the As uptake in spinach, while B2, B5, FYM2, FYM5, and PTM5 significantly (p<0.001) decreased PTE bioaccumulation as compared to the control treatment.
   Conclusions The highest application rate (5%) showed the best result in increasing the spinach growth and biomass as well as reducing the PTE mobility in soil, and their bioaccumulation in spinach, as compared to 1% and 2% application rates and also with the control treatment. Furthermore, the average dietary intake (ADI) of PTE and health risk indices (HRIs) reduced via spinach consumption for both the children and adults, due to the addition of selected organic geo-sorbents used for soil amendments.

AB 1 This paper evaluates the role of soil drainage in tree seedling performance at a site being restored from Calluna vulgaris moorland to Pinus sylvestris woodland, in Glen Affric, Scotland. The investigation focuses on the relationships between height of planted seedlings, type of ground vegetation and drainage conditions. 2 Slope, aspect, and soil depth were assessed as potential surrogates for direct measures of soil drainage, all of which were derived from digital terrain data. 3 Six variables related to drainage were recorded at 58 seedling locations and used in a factor analysis to understand links between soil moisture conditions, topographic variables and soil depth characteristics. 4 Factor analysis generated two factors that accounted for 70.5% of the variance in the correlation matrix of these variables: Factor 1 correlated strongly with variables that controlled peat accumulation and Factor 2 correlated strongly with topographic controls upon drainage patterns.
   5 These two factors explained a significant amount of the variance in height of the Pinus seedlings planted at these locations. Significant differences were found between the factor scores associated with different types of ground vegetation, as well as between the seedling heights observed at locations with different vegetation types.
   6 Multiple regressions were developed that indicated that slope, aspect, and soil depth were significant as independent variables in models where soil moisture content and aerobic soil depth were the dependent variables.

ID MICROBIAL PROCESSES; ORGANIC-CARBON; DISCRIMINATION; CO2
AB We present soil organic carbon (SOC) inventories and carbon isotope compositions from over 900 samples collected in areas of minimally disturbed mature vegetation on freely drained soils (excluding peatlands) on a 1000 km transect along the Yennisey River, central Siberia. Carbon inventories over 0-30 cm depth range widely from 1.71 to 7.05 kg m(-2). While an effect of changing climate or vegetation along the transect cannot be ruled out, the observed differences in SOC inventories are largely the result of variations in mineral soil texture, with inventories in fine-textured soils being approximately double those in coarse-textured soils. The delta(13)C values of SOC in the 0-5 cm interval ranged from -26.3 to -28.0parts per thousand, with delta(13)C values for the 5-30 cm interval being 0.9 +/- 0.8parts per thousand (1sigma) enriched in C-13 relative to the 0-5 cm samples. The average delta(13)C value for the 0-5 cm interval for all samples was -27.1 +/- 0.6parts per thousand (1sigma) and for the full 0-30 cm interval the average was -26.5 +/- 0.5parts per thousand (1sigma). In general, delta(13)C values were higher in coarse-textured soils and lower in fine-textured soils. The results of detailed sampling of soils in Pinus sylvestris forest growing on sand near the Zotino flux tower suggest an SOC inventory in these soils of 2.22 +/- 0.35 kg m(-2) over 30 cm and an average delta(13)C value of -26.3 +/- 0.2parts per thousand over the 0-5 cm depth interval and -25.9 +/- 0.3parts per thousand over 0-30 cm. Recent burning had no effect on SOC inventories, but clearing has led to an average 25% decrease on SOC inventories from 0-30 cm over 12 yr. Neither burning nor clearing had a discernible effect on the delta(13)C value of SOC.

AB The growth pattern (phenology), resource allocation (morphology) and biomass accumulation of plant above-ground components is expected to have a feedback on root-associated processes in soil like water uptake, nutrient cycling and gas production. The aim was to see how above-ground plant characteristics (phenology, morphology and biomass) would impact water depletion, mineral nitrogen (N) concentration and carbon dioxide (CO2-C) and nitrous oxide (N2O-N) production from root-associated soil of Arabidopsis thaliana lines (wild ecotypes and down regulated mutants of MYB75, KNAT7 and CCR1 having altered lignin concentration in secondary cell walls) at various plant developmental stages. Phenology and morphology were determined on A. thaliana lines grown to maturity in peat moss-based substrate under controlled conditions. Plant biomass, water use, soil mineral N concentration and root-associated soil respiration were measured at various growth stages of A. thaliana lines grown in un-drained plastic pots containing clay-loam soil. The CCR1 mutant line had delayed maturation. While MYB75 and KNAT7 had similar morphology as the wild ecotype, the CCR1 line had fewer and smaller viable fruits, less crown cover of rosette leaves and lower biomass than the wild ecotype. The CCR1 mutant line had lower evapo-transpiration than the wild ecotype. Respiration of root-associated soil planted with MYB75 and KNAT7 was similar to the wild ecotype. Higher N2O production from soil planted with CCR1 was attributed to higher soil moisture content and mineral N concentration of bulk and rhizosphere soil than the wild ecotype. Morphology and biomass exerts strong influence on water content, mineral N concentration and soil respiration. Due to prolonged vegetative growth phase, reduced fecundity and biomass, the CCR1 mutant lowered evapotranspiration and left more mineral N in root-associated soils, which explained the higher N2O emission from soil during its growth and development.

AB Despite its prevalent reporting in regional/national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGI), forest floor (FF) carbon (C) stocks (including litter, humus, and fine woody debris [FWD]) have not been empirically measured using a consistent approach across forests of the US. The goal of this study was to use the first national field inventory of litter and humic layer depths, along with FWD volumes, to assess their basic attributes (e.g., depths/volumes) and refine NGHGI approaches to FF C stock monitoring. Results suggest that FF C stocks are present in nearly 99% of US forests with a median estimate of 25.6 Mg/ha, albeit with tremendous spatial variation in litter/humic depths and FWD volumes. Relative to aboveground live tree biomass C stocks, which typically range from 20 to 200 Mg/ha, nearly a quarter of US forests have minor FF C stocks (<14 Mg/ha), while approximately 10% of US forests may have substantial FF C stocks (>93 Mg/ha). Conditions conducive to large FF C stocks may be stochastic disturbance events that result in high volumes of FWD and/or climatic/physiographic conditions that slow decomposition (e.g., peatland ecosystems found in northern or coastal forest ecosystems). As soil and dead wood field inventories may only sample litter/humic depths and FWD counts by diameter class, C stock estimation procedures are heavily reliant on estimation constants (e.g., bulk/wood density). It was found that the variability in estimation constants may have a much stronger effect on resulting FF C stock estimates than the field measurements (e.g., litter layer depths) themselves. The monitoring of FF C stocks, along with the maintenance of site productivity and associated ecosystem services, would benefit from refined sample protocols in ecosystems with deep humic layers and coupling field data with lab analysis of bulk/wood density and C content from soil sampling programs.

AB Temperate wetlands in the Northern Hemisphere have high long-term carbon sequestration rates, and play critical roles in mitigating regional and global atmospheric CO2 increases at the century timescale. We measured soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) from 11 typical freshwater wetlands (Heilongjiang Province) and one saline wetland (Jilin Province) in Northeast China, and estimated carbon sequestration rates using Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating technology. Effects of climate, net primary productivity, and nutrient availability on carbon sequestration rates (R-carbon) were also evaluated. Chronological results showed that surface soil within the 0-40 cm depth formed during the past 70-205 years. Soil accretion rates ranged from 2.20 to 5.83 mm yr(-1), with an average of 3.84 +/- 1.25 mm yr(-1) (mean +/- SD). R-carbon ranged from 61.60 to 318.5 g Cm-2 yr(-1) and was significantly different among wetland types. Average R-carbon was 202.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in the freshwater wetlands and 61.6 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in the saline marsh. About 1.04 x 10(8) tons of carbon was estimated to be captured by temperate wetland soils annually in Heilongjiang Province (in the scope of 45.381-51.085 degrees N, 125.132-132.324 degrees E). Correlation analysis showed little impact of net primary productivity (NPP) and soil nutrient contents on R-carbon, whereas climate, specifically the combined dynamics of temperature and precipitation, was the predominant factor affecting R-carbon. The negative relationship observed between R-carbon and annual mean temperature (T) indicates that warming in Northeast China could reduce R-carbon. Significant positive relationships were observed between annual precipitation (P), the hydrothermal coefficient (defined as PEAT, where AT was accumulative temperature >= 10 degrees C), and Rcarbon, indicating that a cold, humid climate would enhance R-carbon. Current climate change in Northeast China, characterized by warming and drought, may form positive feedbacks with R-carbon in temperate wetlands and accelerate carbon loss from wetland soils.

AB Soil salinization, as one of the most important abiotic stresses in irrigated plant production, combined with metal contamination represents a serious threat to food production and human food safety. The influence of a factorial combination of four salinity concentrations (0, 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl added as solution) and three cadmium (Cd) levels (0.3, 2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1)) in peat soil on mineral accumulation, vegetative growth and edible hypocotyl yield of radish plants (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) was studied in a greenhouse. After 34 days of exposure to NaCl treatment, salt-stressed plants had a reduced number of fully developed leaves (up to 30%) and total fruit yield (up to 35%) in addition to the progressively increased Na and Cl concentration as well as significantly lower K concentration in leaf and hypocotyl tissues. Salinity significantly increased the uptake and accumulation of Cd in leaves (up to 20%). In contrast, raising salinity levels did not affect the Cd translocation and deposition into the edible hypocotyls (Cd contents being 4- to 6-fold lower than in leaves), which may indicate that the phloem mobility of Cd in radish plants is relatively poor and unaffected by NaCl exposure. Contamination of growing media by Cd (separately and in combination with NaCl salinity) had no effect on any measured parameter, except that accumulation of Cd in radish tissues was increased by an order of magnitude compared with non-contaminated control.

AB Most of the organic nitrogen in soils and sediments ultimately derives from living organisms where it is mainly present as peptides and amino acids. These biomolecules are considered to have a biologically labile chemical structure and are expected to be quickly mineralized during early stages of organic matter stabilization. In spite of this, nitrogen is still found in aged soils, recent and even fossilized sediments. To elucidate the nature of this recalcitrant nitrogen and the processes that are involved in its formation, solid-state N-15 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was recently introduced into geosciences and applied to various environments differing in the origin of their organic matter precursors as well as in chemical and physical conditions of the environment. Results obtained with this approach indicate that survival of peptide-like structures is a ubiquitous phenomenon, although the mechanisms for their stabilization may differ in different ecological systems. However, a conspicuous change in organic nitrogen composition is observed in fossilized sediments and for organic matter formed by vegetation fires. Cyclization and rearrangement of peptide structures result in the formation of heteroaromatic N during fossilization, which was not detected for recent sediments and soils. From this, it may be concluded that such compounds are only formed in environments in which abiotic transformation of biogenic precursors dominates over biotic degradation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Coastal wetlands soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in global carbon sequestration, and exotic S. alterniflora affects the coastal ecosystem's functions including SOC storage (SOCS). We investigated the vertical deep soil SOC distribution (0-300 cm) in Jiangsu salt marsh and estimated its changes. The results show that (1) exotic S. alterniflora increases the SOC, with higher densities (g kg(-1)) in both topsoil and deep soil in its colonized area, and subsequently increases the SOCS vertical depth (cm) distribution. Such influences become more prominent with time since the introduction of S. alterniflora. The deepest SOC distribution (180 cm) and the highest SOC content (2.14 +/- 0.19 g kg(-1)) in the deep layer( 50-300 cm) were found in the zones where S. salsa - S. alterniflora co-exist (SSI). The vertical SOC distribution in zones where multi-species co-exists is deeper than that in mono-species dominated zones; (2) The deep soil (100-300 cm) SOC accounts more than 50% of 0-300 cm SOC in Jiangsu salt marsh, suggesting that SOC content of deep soil should not be ignored when calculating the global soil carbon stock; (3) Total SOCS within 0-300 cm in Jiangsu salt marshes (107.84 x 10(6) m(2)) is 84.90 x 10(10) g, of which 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm and 200-300 cm layer accounts for 38.25%, 30.72% and 31.03%, respectively. The size of the SOCS (0-300 cm) in the Jiangsu salt marshes relatively to the global biome (0.36 x 10(-6)) is in a lower proportion of the range of salt marsh area to global biome area (0.89 x 10(-6)). The S. alterniflora salt marsh contributes most of the SOCS in the 0-300 cm and 0-100 cm soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Fine root production is one of the least well understood components of the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. Minirhizotrons allow accurate and non-destructive sampling of fine root production. Small and large scale studies across a range of ecosystems are needed to have baseline data on fine root production and further assess the impact of global change upon it; however, the expense and the low adaptability of minirhizotrons prevent such data collection, in worldwide distributed sampling schemes, in low-income countries and in some ecosystems (e.g. tropical forested wetlands). Results We present EnRoot, a narrow minirhizotron of 25 mm diameter, that is partially 3D printable. EnRoot is inexpensive (euro150), easy to construct (no prior knowledge required) and adapted to a range of ecosystems including tropical forested wetlands (e.g. mangroves, peatlands). We tested EnRoot's accuracy and precision for measuring fine root length and diameter, and it yielded Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.95 for root diameter and 0.92 for length. As a proof of concept, we tested EnRoot in a mesocosm study, and in the field in a tropical mangrove. EnRoot proved its capacity to capture the development of roots of a legume (Medicago sativa) and a mangrove species (seedlings of Rhizophora mangle) in laboratory mesocosms. EnRoot's field installation was possible in the root-dense tropical mangrove because its narrow diameter allowed it to be installed between larger roots and because it is fully waterproof. EnRoot compares favourably with commercial minirhizotrons, and can image roots as small as 56 mu m. Conclusion EnRoot removes barriers to the extensive use of minirhizotrons by being low-cost, easy to construct and adapted to a wide range of ecosystem. It opens the doors to worldwide distributed minirhizotron studies across an extended range of ecosystems with the potential to fill knowledge gaps surrounding fine root production.

AB The UK Countryside Survey (CS) is a national long-term survey of soils and vegetation that spans three decades (1978-2007). Past studies using CS data have identified clear contrasting trends in topsoil organic carbon (tSOC) concentrations (0-15 cm) related to differences between habitat types. Herewe firstly examine changes in tSOC resulting from land use change, and secondly construct mixed models to describe the impact of indirect drivers where land use has been constant. Where it occurs, land use change is a strong driver of SOC change, with largest changes in tSOC for transitions involving SOC-rich soils in upland and bog systems. Afforestation did not always increase tSOC, and the effect of transitions involvingwoodlandwas dependent on the other vegetation type. The overall national spatial pattern of tSOC concentration where land use has been constant ismost strongly related to vegetation type and topsoil pH, with contributions from climate variables, deposition and geology. Comparisons of models for tSOC across time periods suggest that declining SO4 deposition has allowed recovery of topsoils from acidification, but that this has not resulted in the increased decomposition rates and loss of tSOC which might be expected. As a result, the relationship between pH and tSOC in UK topsoils has changed significantly between 1978 and 2007. The contributions of other indirect drivers in the models suggest negative relationships to seasonal temperature metrics and positive relationships to seasonal precipitation at the dry end of the scale. The results suggest that the CS approach of long-term collection of co-located vegetation and soil biophysical data provides essential tools both for identifying trends in tSOC at national and habitat levels, and for identifying areas of risk or areas with opportunities for managing topsoil SOC and vegetation change.

AB Based on the track geometry car recordings performed from 1999 to 2016 on a section of the Swedish heavy haul line Malmbanan, the vertical track geometry degradation is analysed for wavelengths in the interval 1-25 m. The upper layer of the subgrade on parts of the rail section is peat (depths of up to 2 m), while it is moraine on others leading to a significant longitudinal variation in substructure stiffness. The degradation rates of irregularities in the longitudinal level and the influence of track maintenance (tamping) on the track geometry are studied. In parallel, a method for continuous measurement of track vertical stiffness along the line, allowing for the detection of track sections with poor support conditions, is described and demonstrated. Synchronised measurements of the longitudinal level and the track vertical stiffness are evaluated to determine whether there is a correlation between a high stiffness gradient due to variations in substructure stiffness and a high growth rate of local track geometry irregularities. It is shown that recurrent severe local track geometry irregularities often occur on track sections where there is a combination of a low magnitude and a high gradient in the substructure stiffness. In such cases, tamping may not be a cost-efficient long-term solution to the problem. Instead, upgrading of ballast and subgrade layers should be considered as an option. It is concluded that measurement of track vertical stiffness is an efficient method for the maintenance planning of a more robust railway track, which also minimises the life cycle cost and environmental footprint.

AB A 45.3-m long core was collected from near the Hemudu civilization site (Luojiang county, Zhejiang Province; 29 degrees 59.064'N, 121 degrees 21.754'E), which is located in the Ningshao plain on the southern margin of Hangzhou Bay. The core, named the HMD Core, was divided into seven lithological layers with clay and silt as the main lithological components. The sporopollen assemblages of this core combined with TOC/TN and stable organic carbon isotope (delta C-13(TOC)) analysis revealed the sedimentary environmental changes since the later part of the Late Pleistocene in the Ningshao plain. The study area changed from terrestrial fluvial-flood plain facies before Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to shore plain during transgression in MIS3, and became a freshwater lake during regression at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The area started to become a semi-salt lake influenced by sea water during 15,900-5000 cal. BP, in which time period the lake was deeper and the climate became gradually warmer. Later the seawater withdrew, the lake began desalinating, and then became swampy and accumulated peat until 1000 cal. BP. After that, the area became dry land. The results also indicate that the sediments of the core are of endogenous organic origin and the delta C-13(TOC) value was controlled by change in the concentration of atmospheric CO2, and thus was a response to global changes.

AB Ferns or fern-like plants have been important elements of terrestrial vegetation since the Late Devonian. Rhacophyton, a fern-like plant of the Late Devonian, appears to have been a colonizer of wet substrates, often forming large, nearly monotypic stands in peat-accumulating swamps. The earliest true ferns have been found in environments with high levels of disturbance, often tire, which suggest opportunistic, colonizing life histories, consistent with small, scrambling body plans. During the Early Carboniferous all major body plans and life histories of ferns appear, including scrambling ground cover, tree habit, and lianas. These ecological roles are distributed across several major lineages, including the Zygopteridales, Filicales, and Marattiales, plus some fern-like groups of uncertain affinity, and disappear and reappear independently within these groups. Until the Stephanian, the later part of the Late Carboniferous, ferns largely were confined to secondary ecological roles: colonists, understory vegetation, small vines. Beginning in the latter part of the Westphalian and expanding dramatically in the Stephanian, marattialean tree ferns became the dominant trees of tropical lowland, wetland forests. This dominance continued locally into the Permian in wetter parts of the landscape. The Paleozoic ferns suffered major extinctions at several times, beginning in the Late Carboniferous. By the Permian, new lineages were appearing, some of which would persist into and become dominant vegetational components during the Mesozoic. Among these lineages virtually all of the life histories and body plans that characterized Paleozoic ferns would reappear independently, plus some new kinds of organization and ecology, emphasizing the great evolutionary flexibility and responsiveness of fern-like construction and reproductive biology.

AB The relevance of the research is determined by the necessity for assessment of volcanic pyroclastic material impact on formation of geochemical background of rare elements in coal.
   The main aim of the research is to study the mineralogical and geochemical features of tonsteins and enclosing coals of hernogorskaya suite in the Chernogorskoe coal deposit (Minusinsk coal basin).
   Objects of the research are tonsteins and enclosing coals of hernogorskaya suite in the Chernogorskoe coal deposit (Minusinsk coal basin).
   Methods: sampling of coal seams of hernogorskaya suite in the Chernogorskoe coal deposit; chemical composition is estimated with inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry, instrumental neutron activation analysis, x-ray fluorescence methods; mineral composition is defined with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry.
   Results. The paper studies mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the tonsteins in chernogorskaya suite of the Chernogorskoe coal deposit (Minusinsk coal basin). Kaolinite is predominant in the composition of the studied tonsteins. Quartz, feldspar, and phosphates are found in smaller amounts. Integrated mineral and geochemical analysis allow determining the composition of the initial ash material, which served as a source for formation of tonsteins. Tonsteins formed from felsic volcanogenic pyroclastics are predominant. Tonsteins of felsic alkali-type volcanic genesis are less widespread. Tonsteins formed from intermediate and mafic volcanic material are rare. On the basis of the identified tonsteins, the sequence of changes in the composition of the pyroclastic material received during peat accumulation was restored. The study found that the pyroclastic material had a significant impact on accumulation of a group of lithophilic rare metals, including abnormally high concentrations of REE, Zr, Hf, Nb, Y, and Th.

AB Biomarker composition and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations of three coal samples from Bulgarian deposits of different rank are presented. The coal samples were taken from Stanyantsi, Bourgas and Dobroudja coal basins. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to assess organic matter source and to identify and quantify PAHs in the studied samples. Coal rank was determined on the basis of vitrinite reflectance, Ro %.
   The alkane patterns of the three samples are dominated by long chain n-alkanes (C-27-C-31), usually found in higher terrestrial plants rich in cuticular waxes. With increasing rank, the odd over even predominance is significantly reduced and short-chain n-alkanes are present in higher quantities. Increased pristane/phytane ratios in the Dobroudja coals are attributed to the influence of coal rank on this parameter. Based on terpenoid biomarker composition, angiosperm-dominated vegetation is concluded for the Bourgas coal whereas conifers dominated the peat-forming vegetation at Stanyantsi. Low terpenoid biomarker concentration and high contents of alkylated naphthalenes and phenanthrenes in the bituminous coal reflect the diagenetic conversion of the plant-derived terpenoid hydrocarbons to alkylated PAHs. Highest PAHs concentration was recorded in samples of higher rank (bituminous coal), and the lowest concentration was found in lignite samples. The examination of the PAHs composition revealed that 3 and 4 ring unsubstituted PAHs are dominant in the lignite and bituminous coal samples, whereas 4 and 5 ring PAHs predominate in subbituminous coal. We assume that the composition of PAHs in the extractable portion of coals is irrespective of the coal-forming vegetation.

AB Decomposition is a key ecosystem function, and the rate of decomposition in forests affects their carbon storage potentials. Processes and factors determining leaf litter decomposition rates in dry-land and temperate forests are well understood, but these are generally poorly studied in tropical wetland forests, especially freshwater swamp forests (FSF). The home-field advantage (HFA) hypothesis predicts that soil microbes specialize in decomposing leaf litter produced by the tree species in their immediate vicinity. However, empirical support for the HFA is equivocal, and the HFA has never been tested in the highly heterogeneous and biodiverse ecosystems of tropical FSFs. We collected leaf litter from swamp and non-swamp tree species in a tropical FSF in Singapore and monitored the decomposition rates of these in swamp and non-swamp plots for a period of eight months. Leaf litter decomposed 3.7 times more slowly in swamp plots. Leaf litter from swamp tree species were significantly poorer in quality (higher C:N ratio) than those of non-swamp FSF tree species, but this had only a weak effect on decomposition rates. There was also only weak evidence for the HFA and only in non-swamp conditions. Our results show that while the leaf litter of tropical FSF swamp and non-swamp tree species differ significantly in chemical traits, litter decomposition rate is ultimately determined by local abiotic conditions, such as hydrology. Additionally, the high FSF tree diversity may prevent decomposer communities from specializing on any group of leaf litter types and thus limit the extent of HFA observed in such heterogeneous forests.

AB The local landscapes of Early Mesolithic-Neolithic settlements within the Upper Volga outwash plain are reconstructed based on the investigation of the multilayer archaeological sites Minino 2 and Zamostye 5, Moscow district, Russian forest zone according to former descriptions by the authors (Vandenberghe et al., 2010). Regional environments in the different stages of the Holocene beginning from the Preboreal, are considered using pollen data while local landscapes (including relief, soil, vegetation and water regime) are reconstructed on the base of sediments, fossil soils and macrofossils, as preserved in a series of burial pits of different age. Colonization of the area by hunters-fishermen followed the local proglacial lake filling and shallowing at the end of the Lateglacial - Postglacial period, about cal 12.0-12.2 ka BP. Drying landscape inherited sharply undulating topography where elevated dry sites were populated up to a flooding episode between cal 2.5 and - 2.8 ka BP, or about 850 BC. Water receded between 1.7 and 1.9 cal ka BP, while large-scale peat accumulation and wetland expansion began about 650-700 BP. During the Holocene depressions had been gradually filled with organic deposits reflecting change of hydrological regimes; the most significant wetting occurred about cal 5.3-5.4 ka BP. Soil evolution has proceeded from initial calcareous alkaline soils to leached acid soils and further to peaty soils. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The freshwater Everglades is a complex system containing thousands of tree islands embedded within a marsh-grassland matrix. The tree island-marsh mosaic is shaped and maintained by hydrologic, edaphic and biological mechanisms that interact across multiple scales. Preserving tree islands requires a more integrated understanding of how scale-dependent phenomena interact in the larger freshwater system. The hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm provides a conceptual framework for exploring multi-scale interactions within complex systems. We used a three-tiered approach to examine the spatial variability and patterning of nutrients in relation to site parameters within and between two hydrologically defined Everglades landscapes: the freshwater Marl Prairie and the Ridge and Slough. Results were scale-dependent and complexly interrelated. Total carbon and nitrogen patterning were correlated with organic matter accumulation, driven by hydrologic conditions at the system scale. Total and bioavailable phosphorus were most strongly related to woody plant patterning within landscapes, and were found to be 3 to 11 times more concentrated in tree island soils compared to surrounding marshes. Below canopy resource islands in the slough were elongated in a downstream direction, indicating soil resource directional drift. Combined multi-scale results suggest that hydrology plays a significant role in landscape patterning and also the development and maintenance of tree islands. Once developed, tree islands appear to exert influence over the spatial distribution of nutrients, which can reciprocally affect other ecological processes.

AB Water plays a key role in the functioning of wetlands and a shortage or contamination of it leads to changes in habitat conditions and degradation of ecosystems. This article scrutinizes the impact of climate change on the hydrological characteristics of floods (maximum flow, duration, volume) in the River Biebrza wetlands (North-East Poland). We analysed the trends in duration and volume of flood and maximum discharges in the historical period 1970-2000 and predicted these for the future periods 2020-2050 and 2070-2100, respectively. Next we assessed the impact on the wetland ecosystems. The basis of our assessments consists of statistical analyses of hydrographs and calculations by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model and considering nine bias-corrected climate models. The results indicate that both volume and duration of winter floods will keep increasing continuously under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The reduction in peak annual floods is expected to decline slightly in both scenarios. On the other hand, the analysis of trends in mean and standard deviation revealed negligible tendencies in the datasets for summer and winter hydrological seasons within the three time frames analysed (1970-2000; 2020-2050; 2070-2100). We foresee several future implications for the floodplain ecosystems. Shifts in transversal ecosystem zonation parallel to the river will likely take place with more highly productive flood tolerant vegetation types. Nutrient availability and algal blooms during spring inundations will likely increase. Slowdown of organic matter turnover later in summer will lead to a higher peat accumulation rate. Logistical problems with summer mowing and removal of bushes in winter may enhance shrub encroachment.

AB Dryopteris erythrosora (D. C. Eaton) Kuntze is used as an ornamental horticultural crop and landscaping plant, and it is a plant with high development value as an herbal medicine, but there are few studies to proliferate a large amount of plants. This study aimed to determine a suitable method for spore germination, gametophyte proliferation, sporophyte formation, and seedling production in D. erythrosora. Spore germination rate was highest in 1/2xMurashige and Skoog (MS) medium (92.8%). A suitable medium for prothallus proliferation was selected based on gametophytes produced from germinated spores. A 1xMS medium was most effective for gametophyte proliferation and active organ formation; moreover, 1xMS medium containing 1% sucrose without activated charcoal was the most effective growth condition for inducing gametophyte growth and development. The suitable culture soil composition for sporophyte formation was investigated by varying the ratio of horticultural substrate, peat moss, perlite, and decomposed granite. We found that a 2:1 (v:v) mixture of horticultural substrate and perlite accelerated sporophyte formation (155 units). Furthermore, suitable seedlings and transplants for sporophyte seedling growth were determined by varying the ratio of horticultural substrate and decomposed granite, as well as plug tray cell size. For sporophyte seedlings, the greatest growth in root length (92.9mm) and the most aerial and underground fresh weight (234.1 and 40.3g, respectively) were observed in a mixture of horticultural substrate and decomposed granite at a 1:2 (v:v) ratio. Our results using tissue culture technology will be provided as a mass production method for substantial industrialization of D. erythrosora plants.

AB Humic substances play an important role in many environmental processes such as sequestration and transport of hydrophobic compounds. The supramolecular character of humic substances imparts high flexibility of the aggregates associated with their variable reactivity under different conditions. In this study, heat-induced transitions and character of the hydration shell of sodium salts of humic and fulvic acids originating from various sources were investigated using ultrasonic velocimetry in the temperature interval from 5 to 90 degrees C. Results clearly showed differences in stability and characteristics of the hydrated states at concentrations above and below 1 g L-1 with the exception of Pahokee peat fulvic acids. It has been concluded that predominantly the relaxation part of the adiabatic compressibility plays an important role below 1 g L-1 in contrast to both relaxation and intrinsic parts of the compressibility being important at higher concentrations. Dilution brought several temperature induced transitions which were investigated with respect to composition of all investigated humic substances. Correlation analysis revealed that the transition around 17 degrees C is associated with disruption of H-interactions whereas the transition around 42 degrees C depends on the aromaticity. Comparison of cooling and heating records revealed hysteresis in the structural relaxation resembling the behavior of physically stabilized hydrogels. Results indicated a difference in the conformation and therefore reactivity of dissolved humic substances in the dependence on temperature and thermal history. It has been hypothesized that this may play an important role in the transport and sequestration of hydrophobic pollutants by dissolved organic matter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CLIMATE
AB An Oligocene succession from the Slovenian Sava Basin (Zasavje) was analysed to reconstruct climate and vegetation of the interval. Independent quantitative approaches were applied on a detailed palynological data set to reconstruct both parameters separately allowing for a synthesis and interpretation. The reconstruction of palaeoclimate is based on the coexistence approach and documents an equal, warm-temperate, humid climate with low annual variation. Quantitative results indicate values of mean annual temperature of 16-19degreesC, with winter temperatures of 6-9degreesC and summer temperatures of 25-28degreesC, and a mean annual precipitation ranging between 1100 and 1300 mm. In contrast to the very homogeneous climatic signal, the vegetational reconstruction based on multivariate statistical analyses shows distinct changes through time. During intervals of peat accumulation, the environment was a typical swamp vegetation dominated by Taxodiaceae and ferns, in which ephemeral small ponds developed due to changing groundwater levels. With the development of an expanded limnic environment, the Taxodiaceae retreated and a riparian swamp flora dominated. This vegetation, in turn, was displaced by elements of drier mesophytic habitats that increased in abundance during a tectonically forced lowering of the groundwater table. Subsequently, the entire study area was flooded by transgression and overlain by marine sediments. All changes in vegetation can be explained by influences of the basin development on the habitats of the plant communities. The results demonstrate a vegetational change in the Oligocene of the Sava Basin that is independent from climate. Vegetation change dynamics were controlled probably by the regional tectonic-palaeogeographic development within a very equable, warm-temperate, and humid climate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE water balance; water discharge; filtration; water permeability
AB The influence of wetlands on the water supply of rivers has been discussed in media and some academic papers for more than 100 years. The first papers were published after draining the Polesye wetlands in Belarus in 1880's. Formation and hydrological role of wetlands in biosphere are considered. The influence of wetlands on the water supply of rivers is shown on the basis of multi-year stationary research. The reasons for reducing of water discharge in rivers with overgrowing of lakes and formation of wetlands on their place are described. The features of value of water flow from drained swamps in rivers obtained in 15-years stationary water-balance research were calculated according to the runoff rates. Water permeability of wetlands along the peat deposit depth were studied. The reasons for change in filtration of groundwater after hydromelioration of wetlands were established. The influence of steam flows inside the swamps on water discharge and entry of water into rivers were studied. There is a break in water flow from wetlands to rivers, especially in summer period. The reasons for "drainless periods" duration and the concept of "zero flow" (when groundwater flows into channels, but does not enter rivers) were explained. The influence of hydromelioration on the growth of pine forest stands, the improvement of their bonitet class in swamps were studied. The dependence of water discharge on bonitet class of forest stands was shown. It was established that water discharge from drained swamps during the year is more leveled off by reducing the spring flood flow and increasing the flow in summer period, which ensures the uniformity of river water supply.

AB Sequestration of carbon in soils and vegetation can contribute to meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for individual countries under the Kyoto Protocol. In this paper, the carbon mitigation potential of a series of agricultural land-management practices that are relevant to Belgian agriculture is quantified. Reforestation of a part of the total agricultural area is also considered, and the sequestration potential is corrected for practices already in use before the 1990 baseline. Existing and future agro-environmental policies as well as regional policies aimed at reducing environmental side effects of spreading organic amendments were considered when calculating the areas for which sequestration measures could be applied. The results are brought together in a realistic scenario. The mean sequestration potential expressed in Gg C per year for Belgium is as follows: additional bio-energy crops (96.2), spreading farmyard manure formerly applied to grassland on arable land (84.4) woodland regeneration (31.7), adopting no-till farming on suitable soils over a period of 20 years (15.8), the use of cover crops following winter cereals (15.2, adopted over 20 years), improved management of farmed peat soils (13.4) and organic fanning (2.2). These figures suggest that, by 2010, Belgium can only expect a reduction in CO2 emissions ranging from 0.47 to 0.90% of the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by improving agricultural management. These measures should not however be neglected as they will have other positive effects on soil properties, and they could offer a solution to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector by 4.7-9.0% of the 1990 values.

AB Wetlands play a vital role in terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration, but the sensitivity of their C stocks to disturbance remains uncertain, requiring enhanced understanding of the processes that govern C storage and removal. The unique conditions in wetlands from different hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes likely regulate the cycling, storage and vulnerabilities of wetland soil C stocks. To determine how differences in hydrogeomorphic setting influence soil organic carbon (SOC) processing, we compared C content and composition between depressional and slope wetlands located in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Isolated depressional wetlands were characterized by seasonally declining water tables, slow discharge, high clay content, and thick organic horizons. Slope wetlands received perennial groundwater inputs and had coarser soil textures and thinner organic horizons. Seasonal snowmelt inputs coupled with low hydrologic discharge and higher clay content in depressional wetlands were predicted to sustain anoxic conditions, leading to high SOC content and chemically reduced C compounds. Depressional wetland soils had higher SOC content at depth and higher porewater DOC concentrations compared to slope wetland soils. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that aliphatic compounds were the dominant SOC component in depressional wetlands compared to aromatic C forms in the slope wetlands. The higher prevalence of aliphatic carbon in depressional wetland soils suggests that stored SOC is protected by anaerobic conditions to a greater extent than in the slope wetlands, and that this SOC may be more vulnerable to drying and oxic conditions associated with wetland drainage and climate change.

AB Mosses are dominant components of high-latitude environments, and Signy Island (maritime Antarctic) provides a representative example of polar cryptogam-dominated terrestrial ecosystems. In 2011, we mapped all moss banks, their characteristics (thickness, area, floristic composition) and investigated their relationship with selected environmental factors including topography (elevation, slope, aspect), biotic disturbance (fur seals), deglaciation age of the surfaces, location on the eastern vs. western side of the island and snow cover as a proxy of water supply during the summer (December). We here identify the most important environmental factors influencing moss bank characteristics and distribution and provide a baseline for future monitoring. Moss bank abundance and distribution are the result of the interaction of multiple abiotic and biotic factors acting at different spatial scales. The most important factors are the location of moss banks on the eastern vs. western side of the island at the macroscale (with thicker and larger moss banks and a prevalence of Chorisodontium aciphyllum on the western side) and their favourable aspect (mainly N, NW) at the microscale, providing better microclimatic conditions suitable for their development. The elevation threshold detected at 120 m could indicate the occurrence of a 'moss bank line', analogous to the tree line, and corresponds with a threshold of mean annual temperature of -4.8 degrees C. The other factors examined play a subsidiary role in affecting bank distribution and characteristics. These findings allow a better understanding of this key feature of maritime Antarctic vegetation and provide quantitative information about their ecology.

AB The sub-Antarctic Antipodes Islands group, located on the edge of the Campbell Plateau, is composed of Surtseyan-like tuff cones, porphyritic lavas and dykes, overlain by scoriaceous cinder cones. The youthful nature is indicated by well-preserved cones and craters, raised boulder beaches, pollen and spores comparable to the present-day vegetation in peat underlying one lava flow, and published Ar/Ar ages of 0.5 Ma. The alkaline crystalline rocks record a fractionation lineage that was controlled by progressive removal of clinopyroxene and olivine at shallow depths with minimal interaction with continental crust. A compilation of isotopic data confirms that the magmas were derived from a mantle source containing a high-time integrated U/Pb (HIMU)-like component. Although this source component has been recognised in many Zealandia intraplate volcanoes, the Antipodes Volcano lavas contain consistently high Pb-206/Pb-204 and low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, making the geochemical suite an excellent baseline for HIMU studies. The distinctive isotope ratios and chemistries are comparable with those of some anhydrous Pb- and K-depleted peridotitic mantle xenoliths from intraplate volcanoes in Zealandia. If the lithospheric mantle contributed to the source of Antipodes Volcano, the Pb and K anomalies in the lavas may not require residual amphibole/phlogopite and/or sulphide in their source region. Furthermore, comparison with the peridotite suite indicates that the Zealandia lithospheric mantle is isotopically heterogeneous and thus not all the Zealandia Cretaceous-Cenozoic intraplate volcanoes need have tapped a HIMU-like reservoir.

AB Hudson Bay remains frozen or is dominated by ice over the summer solstice and throughout much of the high-sun season.  This contributes directly to the winterization of summer.  The juxtaposition of the mean summer position of the Arctic front and of treeline to the west of Hudson Bay has been clearly documented, and the coincidence of treeline and the southern boundary of continuous permafrost is well known.  The strong southward thrust of the Arctic front in summer is, in major degree, a response to cold air masses spawned over Hudson Bay.
   On a mesoscale, Hudson Bay generates onshore winds across a strong temperature and pressure gradient.  This mesoscale regime dominates the temperature and surface energy balance for a large distance inland across the Hudson Bay Lowlands.  Superimposed on the mesoscale wind field is a land-sea breeze, which is sometimes well developed in coastal areas and which can be traced up to 65 km inland.  It is, however, of low frequency occurrence and is usually overridden by the regional wind.
   Progressing inland from the coast, in the central Hudson Bay Lowlands, the landscape becomes dominated by deep peat soils and a surface vegetation which is resistant to evapotranspiration.  As a result, it is much drier than the wetlands near the coast and evapotranspiration is reduced.
   The large-scale cold air masses originating over Hudson Bay and the cold mesoscale winds combine to impose cold air temperatures on the adjacent terrestrial environment.  Even with abundant solar radiation and saturated surfaces, evaporation is vigorously suppressed by these cold temperatures.  Any warming or cooling during climate change will have a double impact on the terrestrial environment through the strong linkages with Hudson Bay.

AB Sustainable management of boreal ecosystems involves the establishment of vigorous tree regeneration after harvest. However, two groups of understory plants influence regeneration success in eastern boreal Canada. Ericaceous shrubs are recognized to rapidly dominate susceptible boreal sites after harvest. Such dominance reduces recruitment and causes stagnant conifer growth, lasting decades on some sites. Additionally, peat accumulation due to Sphagnum growth after harvest forces the roots of regenerating conifers out of the relatively nutrient rich and warm mineral soil into the relatively nutrient poor and cool organic layer, with drastic effects on growth. Shifts from once productive black spruce forests to ericaceous heaths or paludified forests affect forest productivity and biodiversity. Under natural disturbance dynamics, fires severe enough to substantially reduce the organic layer thickness and affect ground cover species are required to establish a productive regeneration layer on such sites. We succinctly review how understory vegetation influences black spruce ecosystem dynamics in eastern boreal Canada, and present a multi-scale research model to understand, limit the loss and restore productive and diverse ecosystems in this region. Our model integrates knowledge of plant-level mechanisms in the development of silvicultural tools to sustain productivity. Fundamental knowledge is integrated at stand, landscape, regional and provincial levels to understand the distribution and dynamics of ericaceous shrubs and paludification processes and to support tactical and strategic forest management. The model can be adapted and applied to other natural resource management problems, in other biomes.

AB The process of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) converts biomass into a carbonaceous product named hydrochar. It is hypothesized that due to a high recalcitrance against microbial decomposition in soil, hydrochar may contribute to carbon (C) sequestration, thereby sustaining its function as a soil conditioner. The objective of this microcosm study was to identify process parameters of hydrochar production affecting the stability of hydrochar-C against decomposition, and thus its C sequestration potential.
   A variety of hydrochars differing in processing temperature (180-250 degrees C) and time (4 -12 h), and feedstock material (sugarbeet pulp, draft) as well as reference materials (wheat straw (WS), mature compost (MC), white peat (WP), sugarbeet pulp biochar (SB)) were applied to soil in a concentration equivalent to 30 t ha(-1) incorporated into 15 cm soil depth. After 248 days of incubation, C mineralized from the hydrochars ranged from 12 to 32%; it decreased considerably with increasing processing temperature from 200 to 250 degrees C, and less pronounced with increasing processing time from 4 to 12 h, whereas feedstock had no distinct effect. Higher processing temperature reduced oxygen content in hydrochar thus decreasing its reactivity, which resulted in both a higher amount and mean residence time of the stable hydrochar-C fraction. The mean residence times of tested organic materials followed the order: WS << hydrochars < WP <<< SB, MC. Thus, the application of hydrochar as a soil conditioner under field conditions may offer a moderate potential for C sequestration. A comprehensive evaluation of the complete HTC process chain including C and energy balances is prospectively required. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Models of terrestrial vegetation distribution change during warming have generally paid little attention to ecological disturbances such as fire, even though these have been shown to be vitally important. A model predicting regionally dominant terrestrial vegetation in catastrophically disturbed landscapes is proposed: probability of a disturbance adapted species leaving progeny (P-r) is (1-1/M)(j)-(1-1/M)(s), where M is the mean return interval between disturbances, j is the age of organisms at onset of reproduction, and s is the age at which reproduction ceases. For non disturbance-adapted species, the model simplifies to (1-1/M)(j). The model was tested in fire-prone boreal forest landscapes in Ontario, Canada (48 degrees 00'-52 degrees 00'N, 80 degrees 00'-95 degrees 30'W). A vegetation map whose classes and class geographical distributions were predicted using the above model was compared with a standard vegetation map. Three upland vegetation classes: poplar-pine, spruce-pine-poplar and spruce-fir were predicted, as well as an organic class representing non fire-prone vegetation on peat. These classes were almost the same as those in the standard map and the vegetation distribution was comparable (vegetation correctly predicted for 61.4% of the area, chi square P < 0.005). Thus the model can predict dominant vegetation in this system, implying that the distribution of boreal biome subzones in central Canada is largely governed by fire occurrence. To predict climate warming impacts, fire in the model was increased to 1.5 and 5 times the 1926-75 area, with a resultant shift of predicted vegetation zones to the north and east.

AB Stand-scale palaeoecology in sandstone landscapes provides insight into contrasting Holocene forest succession trajectories. Sharp geomorphological gradients in this investigated area, which in addition have never been deforested during the Holocene, provide a good model for upscaling the local vegetation histories to the wider territory of Central Europe. In three sandstone areas - Bohemian Paradise, Polemene hory and Broumov - we compare (1) anthracological records from archaeological stratigraphies under rockshelters with (2) pedoanthracological sequences from nearby locations in valleys, rocks and plateaus; and with (3) pollen analyses carried out in nearby peat accumulations. Taphonomical vectors discriminate the source vegetation of each proxy, however thanks to proximity of all sampling sites pollen record and charcoals from rockshelters integrate the signal from pedoanthracology. The results show that past distribution of individual arboreal taxa is clearly related to the position within local environmental gradients. All basic habitats - valleys, rocky edges and plateaus - started with the dominance of pine forest in the early Holocene. Middle Holocene witnessed expansion of spruce inside valleys and oak on plateaus. Pine has maintained its dominance on rocky edges. In the late Holocene, silver fir and beech expanded into valleys, while oak stands remained dominant on plateaus. In the High Medieval and Modern Ages, human impact triggered general spread of fir. Records indicate site-specific local histories connected to various human activities, fire dynamics and erosion. Against the background of these immediate driving forces, the long-term process of ecosystem changes has been influenced by climate of the Holocene.

AB This article explains the technical potential of C (carbon) sequestration in world soils for mitigating climate change and describes its positive impacts on agronomic productivity and global food security through the improvement of soil quality. It also supports the idea of economic development through the provision of payments to farmers in developing countries for their stewardship and enhancement of ecosystem services. These would be generated by their use of recommended management practices for improved agriculture. The technical potential of C sequestration in soils of terrestrial ecosystems and restoration of peat soils is similar to 3 Petagram (Pg) C/yr (i.e. 3 x 10(15) g=3x 109 tonnes C/yr) or 50 ppm draw down of atmospheric CO2 by the end of the 21st century by increasing the soil C pool at a rate of 1 Mg/ha/yr. Depending upon climate and other variables, this could increase cereal and food legume production in developing countries by 32 million Mg/yr and roots and tubers by 9 million Mg/yr. It is precisely this strategy which would have received broad political support at the COP-15 meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009 from developing countries, emerging economies and the industrialized world. Addressing the issue of food-insecurity and global warming through sequestration of C in soils and the biota, along with payments to resource-poor farmers for the ecosystem services rendered, would be a timely win-win strategy.

AB Comprehensive analysis of the data of high-precision seismoacoustic profiling, drilling and sampling of deposits using seabed corers, biostratigraphic studies, and radiocarbon age data was performed for the first time for Mangyshlak sediments in several bottom sites of the North Caspian. It was found that the Mangyshlak sediments comprise numerous linearly stretched depressions of 5-10 m in depth (morphologically similar to modern substeppe ilmen areas in the Volga River delta), which are covered by the Novocaspian sedimentary cover, and river incisions (among them the largest Volga River valley). In addition, the Mangyshlak sediments comprise the deltaic alluvial fans of different sizes along the shelf zone of the North Caspian. Analysis of mollusks and biogenic remains indicates that accumulation of the Mangyshlak sediments occurred in freshwater and slightly salty water environments under various hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions. According to radiocarbon dating of organic matter, the Mangyshlak sediments formed during sea regression in the range of 10-8 ka (isotopic age) or 11.5-8.5 ka (calendar age). Several types of sediments are distinguished: clayey-carbonate sediments, enriched with organic matter up to the formation of sapropel and peat, accumulated at the lowest sea level; weakly calcareous silty-clayey silts, formed during the subsequent intense filling of paleodepressions with terrigenous material. The features of the mineral composition of sediments are as follows: polymineral composition of clayey material with a high proportion of hydromica and disordered mixed-layered formations, a high content of minerals of the epidote group, amphiboles, and other accessory minerals. All of this indicates a genetic relationship between the Mangyshlak sediments and the Volga terrigenous material.

AB The lowland heathlands of southern England comprise ca. 14 % of the total area of this habitat in Europe yet their history is poorly understood. This paper presents the first detailed palaeoecological evidence (combining palynological, microscopic charcoal and radiocarbon data) relating to the origin and long-term dynamics of heathland vegetation in southern England. Valley peat sites, situated on the Lower Greensand Group (coarse-grained sandstones) at Conford (Hampshire) and Hurston Warren (West Sussex) have been investigated. The sequence from Conford indicates the unusually late survival of Pinus sylvestris (to as late as ca. 6050 cal. b.p.) in southern England. This is attributed to edaphic factors and, after ca. 7050 cal. b.p., to frequent fires. After intervening phases of dominance by deciduous woodland, heathland vegetation became established in the proximity of both sites in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 3000 cal. b.p.) with increases in indicators of grazing and burning demonstrating an association between the development of heathland and human activity. Thereafter, the pollen and charcoal records show that the vegetation remained in a dynamic state as the scale and nature of human activity varied through time. Major expansions in the extent of heathland occurred relatively recently; after ca. 1450 cal. b.p. at Hurston Warren and after ca. 850 cal. b.p. at Conford. A review of the palaeoecological evidence suggests that the most intense use and greatest coverage of heathland in southern England probably occurred during the medieval to post-medieval periods.

AB Through a new development in stable isotope capability, gas chromatography coupled to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-C-IRMS), the reaction pathways of organic matter diagenesis can potentially be traced by analysis of the isotopic compositions of individual molecular components. In this study, changes in bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions, amino acid contents and carbon isotope compositions of individual amino acids are reported for seagrass and sediment degradation experiments using isotopically resolvable organic substrates. Seagrass showed slight enrichments in deltaN-15 (+0.40 parts per thousand) with little change in deltaC-13 following 4 weeks of decomposition. During that period, the identifiable amino acid content decreased by approximately 50% for each amino acid. Mixtures of marine sediment with the same seagrass showed enrichments in N-15 (+2.3 parts per thousand) with associated depletions in carbon (- 2.8 parts per thousand) isotopic compositions over the same time span. These changes are attributed to hydrolysis, deamination, decarboxylation and condensation reactions. Control experiments on the sediments without added fresh seagrass showed no change in isotopic content. At the molecular level, using GC-C-IRMS, certain amino acids in the seagrass (e.g., Glu, Ala, Val, Gly) are seen to decrease in C-13 content during decomposition whereas others remained constant (e.g., Leu, Ile, Pro) or became increasingly enriched in C-13 (Asp). The molecular isotope approach indicates that the process of early diagenesis, leading to the eventual residual materials which are preserved, is significantly more complex than simple breakdown and loss. A portion of the organic matter consequently preserved in organic-rich deposits can be attributed to new production during early diagenetic stages.

AB During Holocene sea-level rise, coastal areas became transitional environments as marine incursion covered the land. Changing conditions resulted in dynamic depositional environments that recorded the migration and stabilization of modern shorelines. These processes are viewed in the Zevulun Plain (Haifa Bay, Israel) record located in the northern edge of the Nile littoral cell. Sedimentological and palaeontological analyses combined with dating enabled the reconstruction of the Holocene chrono-stratigraphical frame. The results reveal an unconformity representing a long period of exposure and erosion during the last glacial. The interplay between relative sea-level rise and sediment supply was first set out by the deposition of alluvial sediments, evidence of the hydrological system reactivation and base level landward migration. Sea flooding of the Zevulun Plain started about 7.8 cal ka BP and the coastline was pushed eastward. Nile-driven sands transported by longshore currents formed dunes that blocked the rivers estuaries and led to wetlands formation. Peat accumulation is evident first in the north of the plain at 7.6-6.2 cal ka BP and later in the south at 6.5-5.5 cal ka BP. Both wetlands showed a change from fresh to brackish water environments at the end of their existence. Following the maximum sea-level rise and inland sea invasion at about 4 ka BP, alluvial sediments covered the plain and the coastline moved westward to its current position. This record serves as a model for the development of Mediterranean clastic coasts controlled by sea rise and infill processes.

AB Soil organic carbon (C) plays a critical role in supporting the productive capacity of soils and their ability to provide a wide range of ecologically important functions including the storage of atmospherically derived carbon dioxide (CO2). The present paper collates available information on Scottish soil C stocks and C losses and reviews the potential pressures on terrestrial C, which may threaten future C stocks. Past, present and possible future land use, land management practices and land use changes (LUCs) including forestry, agriculture, nitrogen (N) additions, elevated CO2 and climate change for Scotland are discussed and evaluated in relation to the anthropogenic pressures on soil C.
   The review deduces that current available data show little suggestion of significant changes in C stocks of Scottish soils, although this may be due to a lack of long-term trend data. However, it can be concluded that there are many pressures, such as climate change, intensity of land use practices, scale of LUC, soil erosion and pollution, which may pose significant threats to the future of Scottish soil C if these factors are not taken into consideration in future land management decisions. In particular, this is due to the land area covered by vulnerable peats and highly organic soils in Scotland compared with other areas in the UK. It is therefore imperative that soil C stocks for different land use, management practices and LUCs are monitored in more detail to provide further insight into the potential changes in sequestered C and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions, as advised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

AB This paper discusses the geochemistry and mineralogy of the barkinite liptobiolith of the Late Permian age from the Jinshan Mine, Guangde County, Anhui Province, China. Samples were examined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry, ion-selective electrode, sequential chemical extraction, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray, and optical microscopy. The coal is a medium-ash and high-sulfur resource. Minerals in the coal are composed of kaolinite, pyrite, calcite, and quartz. Pyrite and calcite are derived from seawater during peat accumulation. Quartz in the coal is of authigenic origin. Part of the kaolinite is from a land-source region, and part occurs as cell-fillings and is of authigenic origin. The results also indicate that the barkinite liptobiolith contains some toxic elements in high concentrations. Elements including Li, Be, Si, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ga, Se, Y, Zr, Mo, the rare earth elements (REEs), W, Hg, Tl, Pb, Th, and U in the coals are enriched in the barkinite liptobiolith. Results of sequential chemical extraction showed that Li, Sc, Ti, Cr, Y, Zr, REEs, and Th in the coal mainly occur as silicates, while Be and W are related to organic matter. Pyrite is the dominant source of S, Mo, Hg, Tl, and Pb. Gallium only occurs in silicate, and U and V occur both in organic and silicate associations.

AB We have investigated the storage and spatial distribution of soil nitrogen (N) in China based on a data set of 2480 soil profiles and a map of Chinese soil types at a spatial resolution of 1:1,000,000. Our estimate indicates that the total N storage in China is 8.29x10(15) g, representing 5.9-8.7% of the total global N storage. The total N storage in China is on average or slightly above the average of its share in the global N storage, even though low nitrogen content soils cover a large area in China. N density varies substantially with soil types and regions. Peat soils in the southeast of Tibet, southwest China, show the highest averaged N density with a value of 7314.9 g/m(3) among all soil types. This is more than 30 times of the lowest N density of brown desert soils in the western desert and arid region. The highest N storages among all the soil types are the felty soil in southeast of Tibet, dark-brown earths in northeast China, and red earths in southeast China with values of 921.1, 611.4, and 569.6 Tg, respectively. N density also varies with land cover types in China. Wetlands in southwest China exhibit the highest N density at 6775.9 g/m(3) and deserts in northwest China have the least at 447.5 g/m(3). Our analysis also indicates that land cover types are poor predictors of N content. Further research is needed to examine how transformation from organic agriculture to increased use of fertilizers and pesticides has influenced N storage in China.

AB New data were obtained from the sedimentary sequence study of Lieporiai palaeolake, Northern Lithuania, employing a multi-proxy abiotic approach, for the description of the Lateglacial-Early Holocene palaeoenvironmental dynamics in the basin. The study reveals significant differences in sediments deposited in the Lateglacial, at the end of Lateglacial/Early Holocene and in the Late Holocene time periods. Six main environmental stages are described. After glacial retreat, the formed landscape was re-organized by very fast currents that might have appeared later than previously thought. Rapid water flow stabilized and lacustrine sedimentation began together with the appearance of scarce pioneer vegetation shortly before 14 600 cal yr BP, (GI-le). The development of the lake with mostly undisturbed sedimentation continued up to the final stages of the Lateglacial Interstadial. The warm period caused maximum precipitation of Ca and Sr carbonates, which strongly affected sediment saturation with other components. Increase in humidity in the later Lateglacial Stadial (GS-1) period is indicated by the abrupt appearance of the coarser-sized mineral matter accompanied by weathering elements, i.e. Ti, Al, Si, Mg, and the early immigration of Picea. About 11 500 cal yr BP, the mineral matter input started decreasing, and stabilization of the climate regime began about 10 200 cal yr BP. (A)biotic proxies highlight slow sedimentation mechanisms that recover shallow- and trophic-lake stages. The Lieporiai palaeolake record clearly shows the sedimentation hiatus between the Early and the Middle Holocene. Further stages are characterized by paludification processes. Finally, peat accumulation was interrupted by humans.

AB East African wetlands are naturally dominated by papyrus, the world's fastest growing herbaceous plant, reaching up to 5 m in height and 3 kg m (2) of standing biomass per year. While its provisioning services are well-known, papyrus plays a less evident role in supporting tropical swamp ecosystems by controlling nutrient balances as well as hydrological flows, and through the provision of critical biotopes vital for the reproduction of insects, fishes and birds, including a small number of endemic species. Claims are made condemning papyrus for enhancing water loss, yet only few proper evapotranspiration studies have been carried out. Conflicting evidence indicates that papyrus swamps could be important in regulating local climate through evapotranspiration and hold significant potential in climate mitigation through carbon sequestration and carbon storage as peat. These benefits may become soon severely eroded because papyrus swamps are degrading rapidly due to direct exploitation, to agricultural encroachment, and to extensive trampling and feeding by cattle. We review papyrus ecosystem services, with a focus on its role on biodiversity enhancement and regulating functions. We present new evidence, showing an inverse temperature gradient within papyrus swamps, indicative of an optimised water retention capacity, with examples from Lake Naivasha and Lake Victoria. Better understanding of papyrus regulating services should underpin papyrus restoration as an ecohydrological tool to improve water quality, to moderate local climate by regulating the water cycle, to provide base material for a variety of provisioning ecosystem services, to enhance biotope structure and to support biodiversity.

AB Mechanisms by which soluble (i.e., dissolved and colloidal) humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA) alter the transformation kinetics of aromatic substrates by oxidoreductive enzymes such as lignin peroxidase and laccase are not well characterized nor have been quantitatively compared. Hypothesized mechanisms are that soluble HA and FA (1) deactivate the enzyme; (2) act as a competitive substrate; or (3) sequester the aromatic substrate. In this study the transformation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by purified laccase isolated from Trametes versicolor at 28 degrees C and pH 5.0, in combination with Aldrich HA, Leonardite HA, Suwannee River FA, or Waskish peat FA, were used as a model system to quantitatively test and compare these hypotheses. The four HA and FA did not deactivate laccase after adding catechol as the enzyme's substrate. Slower PCP transformation rates by laccase in the presence of HA and FA were found with higher inhibitor binding constants of HA and FA (K-i, ranging from 3.63 +/- 0.78 to 6.47 +/- 1.07 mu g mL(-1)) and sorption coefficients of HA and FA to PCP (K-dom, log K-dom ranging from 4.09 to 4.81). Comparison of experimental PCP transformation rates in the presence of soluble HA and FA with predicted transformation rates of dissolved PCP (i.e., PCP not associated with soluble HA and FA) indicated that soluble HA and FA modified PCP transformation by lacasse through sequestration and by acting as a competitive substrate.

AB Quantifying changes in thermokarst lake extent is of importance for understanding the permafrost-related carbon budget, including the potential release of carbon via lake expansion or sequestration as peat in drained lake basins. We used high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery from 1950/51, 1978, and 2006/07 to quantify changes in thermokarst lakes for a 700 km(2) area on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. The number of water bodies larger than 0.1 ha increased over the entire observation period (666 to 737 or +10.7%); however, total surface area decreased (5,066 ha to 4,312 ha or -14.9%). This pattern can largely be explained by the formation of remnant ponds following partial drainage of larger water bodies. Thus, analysis of large lakes (>40 ha) shows a decrease of 24% and 26% in number and area, respectively, differing from lake changes reported from other continuous permafrost regions. Thermokarst lake expansion rates did not change substantially between 1950/51 and 1978 (0.35 m/yr) and 1978 and 2006/07 (0.39 m/yr). However, most lakes that drained did expand as a result of surface permafrost degradation before lateral drainage. Drainage rates over the observation period were stable (2.2 to 2.3 per year). Thus, analysis of decadal-scale, high spatial resolution imagery has shown that lake drainage in this region is triggered by lateral breaching and not subterranean infiltration. Future research should be directed toward better understanding thermokarst lake dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution as these systems have implications for landscape-scale hydrology and carbon budgets in thermokarst lake-rich regions in the circum-Arctic.

AB Accelerated sea level rise threatens coastal wetland plant communities where coastal development restricts transgression, and inundation increases and declining sediment supplies limit the capacity of coastal wetlands to build in elevation. Juncus gerardii Loisel., black needle rush, is a high latitude cosmopolitan plant species and, within salt marshes of the U.S. mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, it occupies a narrow belt along the marsh-upland border. Examination of historic aerial photography, vegetation resurveys, and peat composition analysis for U.S. Northeastern marshes have shown vegetation change patterns indicative of increased inundation, including decline of J. gerardii. To interpret loss patterns for J. gerardii in southern New England, we conducted a factorial experiment to establish its sensitivity to inundation and drought. A strong relationship was found between inundation and growth for J. gerardii, which together with marsh elevation and water level data, suggests that growth is reduced by current flooding patterns. Examination off. gerardii flowering also indicates that floret and inflorescence density vary with inundation, suggesting that negative impacts of sea level rise on Juncus may extend to seed production. Late spring and summer drought impacted neither J. gerardii growth nor its flowering, implying that J. gerardii is insensitive to below-average precipitation or drought during this time of year. We conclude that current inundation patterns are incompatible with robust growth fan. gerardii, and recommend conservation actions be focused on the marsh-upland border to facilitate the upslope migration off. gerardii and other transitional high marsh plant species.

AB ! An oligotrophic coastal freshwater marsh converted to open water within months after receiving partially-treated sewage water in fall 2006. Rafts of the upper 60 cm of marsh soil were found throughout the area within two years, as parts of the 1100 year-old marsh were re-distributed in the open water. We examined the marsh soils from 2009 to 2012 to determine some of the cause-and-effect consequences of their decomposition to the formation of these floating mats. There was a lack of herbivory damage in April 2009 where the outer boundary of the soil profile was weakened at 50-60 cm depth, and eventually converted to open water. A 2012 storm event flooded the area by 1.5 m, resulting in new marsh mat 'pop-ups' whose bottom underside was coincidental with the layer of maximum decline in soil strength in the sewage treated area. We conclude that the addition of partially-treated sewage weakened the soil structure during this high water event and others to allow for the vertical separation of the marsh as the buoyancy forces exceeded the marsh's anchor strength, thereby exposing the softer older peats to decomposition, and smothering marsh underneath the mat's new location. A chronic effect of eutrophication on these marshes was, therefore, revealed in a dramatic flooding event. A bottom up (nutrient addition), not top-down stress (herbivory) contributed to wetland loss in the area, and is a potentially significant chronic stressor for other eutrophied marshes with significant aboveground flooding.

Conclusions 62 Acknowledgements 62 References 62 Summary Mosses in northern ecosystems are ubiquitous components of plant communities, and strongly influence nutrient, carbon and water cycling. We use literature review, synthesis and model simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological stability and resilience. Moss community responses to disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases, no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability. It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and singularity, relationships between response and effect traits, and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out over centuries permafrost formation and thaw, peat accumulation, development of microtopography and there is a need for studies that increase our understanding of slow, long-term dynamical processes.

AB Coal petrological investigation along with proximate and elemental analyses were undertaken to determine the petrographic characteristics of the Apofysis lignites (Amynteo basin, Northwestern Greece) and their depositional environment. Eight samples (representing different lignite beds of the Apofysis deposit) were collected from a borehole. The Apofysis lignites have an Eu-ulminite B reflectance of Rr=0.22%, and in terms of lithotype belong to matrix soft brown coals. Huminite is the most abundant maceral group and consists mostly of humodetrinite. Inertinite has relatively low percentages whereas liptinite concentrations are low in the lower lignite beds and higher in the upper ones. Ternary plots and facies indices were employed in order to investigate the palaeoenvironment. The depositional environment of the Apofysis lignites is not definitely ascribed to a forest swamp or a reed marsh environment. The high ash content of the analysed samples is a clear indication of a topogenous setting. Low tissue preservation index (TPI) and high gelification index (GI) values are observed. High alkalinity and strongly reducing conditions may be inferred from the presence of syngenetic (framboidal) pyrite, the low TPI values which indicate high bacterial activity, and thus high pH conditions, and the preservation of gastropod shells and chlorophyllinite. High GI indicates a constant influx of calcium-rich waters into the coal swamp. The Apofysis lignite deposit may be interpreted to be autochthonous to hypoantochthonous. The peat accumulation was governed by a high groundwater level (wet telmatic to limno-telmatic facies) and a moderate subsidence rate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the relationship between habitat and landscape characteristic,, and the abundance and species richness of breeding birds in 12 southern Rhode Island red maple (Acer rubrum) swamps of varying size (0.5-19.2 ha). Swamp size was the most important landscape variable explaining variation in species richness for the entire bird community and for individual habitat use groups (forest interior, interior-edge. and edge species). Richness increased log linearly with size. Increased richness appeared to be due to increased habitat heterogeneity within the swamp and at the swamp edge, not a core area effect. Bird relative abundance was not predictable from swamp size, The abundance of forest interior birds was positively related to the amount of upland forest within 1-2 kin of a swamp and negatively related to the regional abundance of swamp forests the relationships between these landscape variables and the species richness of edge-related species were just the reverse. The amount of shrub foliage 2-4 in above the ground also was a positive predictor of the abundance of forest interior birds, Variation in overall bird abundance was explained by models based on peat depth and the availability of swamp forest within 1-2 km. All four of the most common forest interior species-the Veery (Catharus fucescens), Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia). and Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis)-occurred in swamps as small as I ha. This pattern suggests that overall landscape composition (i.e.. total forest availability) may be more important than swamp patch size in explaining the occurrence of these area sensitive species.

AB Ornamental production worldwide has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. A globalized scene has shifted production to new countries from Africa, Asia, and South America. Sustainability is the major challenge for ornamental production, and the life cycle assessment (LCA) provides insights on environmental contributions from production to handling and transportation and highlights the problematic issues that need improvement. For example, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the production costs of roses in different parts of the world may vary dramatically between different production processes (e.g., heated or non-heated greenhouses, with or without air transportation, etc.). On the other hand, the production of landscape plants has the lowest environmental impact of all floricultural products. Their long production period offers carbon sequestrations that reduce the total GHG emissions. Sustainability is achieved via critical adjustments on cultivation by minimizing fuel and electricity use, adopting integrated nutrient management (INM) and integrated pest and disease management (IPDM), and using recyclable materials and peat-alternative growing compounds. In this review, two possible scenarios were proposed for ornamental production. Scenario I suggests conventional, protected cultivation under controlled environments (i.e., greenhouses), which can be sustainable after implementing appropriate adjustments to reduce environmental outputs. Scenario II suggests the cultivation of native and specialty ornamental crops, which may serve as eco-friendly alternatives. Combinations between the two scenarios are also possible in view to implement sustainable practices and meet future consumer needs.

AB Philosophy can overlap pedology. It is not casual that life begins and finishes in the soil. We separated the concepts of Humipedon, Copedon and Lithopedon. Some sections were dedicated to the founders of the movement for a new type of agriculture (agroecology). They simply proclaim to accompany the process of natural evolution instead of spending a lot of energy in hunting competitor organisms with pesticides or boosting the soil with mineral fertilisations and tillage. The core of the article is built on a biological concept of soil and shows researches supporting this view. After pointing to the soil structure and illustrating its natural genesis, explaining which cultural conditions may improve its quality, we finished the article with economic considerations, combining at planet level a program of soil restoration with a greenhouse effect mitigation.
   What a reader should have in mind at the end of the article: soil organisms have a prominent positive influence on soil structure and fertility; their mass is proportional to the soil organic matter quantity; it is possible to contrast the climate warming using the soil as sink of C. We estimated that the Agro Humipedons of a European economically active region could sink about 13 or 20% of its emissions, switching from conventional to minimum or no tillage during the coming 40 years. At planetary level, a well programmed 4 per 1000 action can even be more efficacious and compensate a part of the global greenhouse gas effect.

AB The geology, petrography and chemical variation of the Pecket coal sequence, Magellan Region (52degrees57' S, 71degrees10' W), the only Chilean coal used for electricity generation on a large scale, has been studied in order to predict their combustion behaviour, especially in coal blends. The depositional environment of formation of the coal seams was a swamp rarely exposed to subaerial conditions and was associated with the development of the folded foreland of the Magellan basin during the Tertiary (Oligo-Miocene). The general tectonic regime of the collision of the Antarctic and South American plates is reflected by a system of joints with 40degreesN-50degreesW strike. The maceral composition of all six seams studied indicates high contents of vitrinite (>90%), minor content of liptinite (4.7%) and inertinite (<2%). Occurrence of tonstein horizons altered to kaolinite indicates a distal volcanism during peat accumulation. Coal rank varies between lignite and subbituminous (Ro=0.28-0.42%) with an average dry basis calorific value of 5450 kcal/kg, 17 wt.% moisture, 41 wt.% volatile matter, and sulphur content below 0.5 wt.%, The mineral matter (LTA) associated with the coal shows a dominance of kaolinite with quartz, smectite, and minor basanite. SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) and Fe(2)O(3)/CaO ratios of the ashes diminish towards the lower seams. With respect to the utilisation of Pecket coals in combustion, base/acid ratios (B/A) and silica ratios (SR) indicate potential fouling for seams 1, 2, 5, and 6i, with high fouling indexes (Rf) for seams 2 and 5. Pecket coal is excellent for blend combustion due to its low sulphur content. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   WORKSHOP

DT Article
ID OCEAN; MODEL
AB Natural CO2 sinks in terrestrial and marine environments are important components of the global carbon cycle, yet the sign and magnitudes of key fluxes among them are unknown. The results of the Palmas Del Mar Workshop - Natural Sinks of CO2 presented in this special issue and its companion hard-bound volume of Water, Air, & Soil Pollution, provide a synthesis of current research on the carbon cycle, CO2 sinks and associated processes and fluxes, and critical research needs to assess the potential role of forest and land-use management in carbon sequestration. The papers in this volume present data, observations, and model simulations that demonstrate: 1) the existence of natural CO2 sinks that could mitigate a significant amount of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion; 2) probable, human-caused imbalances in C exchanges among vegetation, soils, and the atmosphere; 3) enhanced C storage in vegetation in response to excess atmospheric CO2; 4) strong interactions among carbon, nutrient and hydrological cycles; and 5) an excess of carbon production over consumption in several, large managed forests. Although it appears unlikely that the search for the "missing" C sink required to balance the C budget will end in the open ocean, new estimates of C storage in mangrove wood and peat, suggest that coastal ecosystems have the capacity to store significant amounts of carbon in vegetation and sediments. Convincing analyses are also presented indicating the technical and economical feasibility of managing existing lands to sequester additional carbon. Long-term field studies of CO2 fertilization effects and carbon cycling by plants and soils in geographically important systems, native forests, and coastal ecosystems will go a long way toward meeting the research needs identified at the workshop.

DE DEPOSITIONAL EPISODES; DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEMS; GENETIC STRATIGRAPHY;
   GUNNEDAH
AB A genetic approach to stratigraphic analysis which recognizes clastic sediments as facies components of sedimentary basins was applied to the Permo-Triassic Gunnedah Basin sequence.  The genetic units of widespread correlatability are unified by a common origin and deposited during discrete episodes of general tectonic, climatic and/or base level stability.  Such units are the fundamental time stratigraphic increments of the basin-fill and form the most logical basis for lithostratigraphic subdivision.
   Six depositional episodes and their stratigraphic products, the depositional systems, are recognized from detailed analysis of drill core and geophysical well logs within the Gunnedah Basin.  Contrasts of regional extent in the gamma and neutron logs proved essential to the delineation of the depositional systems.  The onset of sedimentation in the basin is recorded by alluvial and lacustrine deposition of the Leard-Maules Creek alluvial/lacustrine system.  The basin was then inundated by a regional transgression during which the Porcupine-lower Watermark marine shelf system was deposited and together these strata comprise the Leard-Maules Creek/Porcupine-lower Watermark depositional episode.  Progradation of the upper Watermark-lower Black Jack delta systems and overlying transgressive facies of the Arkarula shallow marine system represent the second depositional episode of basin history.  Widespread peat accumulation in the Hoskissons depositional episode followed termination of marine conditions, and alluvial and lacustrine systems again interfingered across the broad diameter of the basin during the succeeding upper Black Jack depositional episode.  Triassic sedimentation was characterized initially by widespread coarse alluvial clastics of the Digby depositional episode, followed by regional inundation by the Napperby lacustrine system which recorded the final episode of deposition in the basin.
   The genetic stratigraphic framework will have wide application to exploration and development of the basin's extensive coal deposits and potential, but undiscovered, petroleum resources.

AB A spatiotemporal computation of permafrost decay covering the period from 1957 to 2009 and validated by field investigations was made over a 76 km(2) river catchment straddling the tree line, in the discontinuous permafrost zone, east of Hudson Bay, in order to estimate the amounts of sediments and organic carbon released by thermokarst. Lithalsas and palsas are the dominant permafrost landforms, whereas thermokarst ponds, landslides, active layer failures, and gullies are the main features of permafrost degradation. Results show that 21% of the existing permafrost in 1957 had disappeared in 2009, resulting in a 96% growth of the thermokarst pond cover and a 46 to 217% increase of the number of active erosion landforms. An increase of stream connectivity related with the degradation of permafrost potentially allowed for an increase of sediments and carbon delivery to the main stream by a factor of 1.6. Volume of active landslides and gullies also increased by 12 to 38%, enhancing sediment and organic matter yields. Significant differences in permafrost degradation and in sediment and carbon inputs were observed along an east-west transect, from sites located at the head of the watershed near the tree line to sites located downstream close to the Hudson Bay coast. Thermokarst ponds in the forest tundra area released 2.3 times more sediments and dissolved organic carbon per unit of area in the fluvial system than in the shrub tundra area. Despite these yields by thermokarst, the Sheldrake River catchment currently does not seem to be yielding proportionally more sediments and carbon than a permafrost-free river catchment.

AB Estuaries like that of the Seine River in NW Europe developed in incised fluvial valleys after the last glacial maximum. Since the 1940s, several authors have studied the largest wetland of the Seine estuary, the Marais Vernier, to understand depositional environments during Holocene infilling. We reinterpret previous research based on new and published data (for example fill thickness and material source) to (1) describe facies and depositional environments; (2) reconstruct palaeoenvironmental evolution; (3) show the influence of local and global forcing on depositional environments. Before 7000-6000 cal. BC, terrestrial material was deposited because of catchment erosion related to changes in climate. Just before 7000-6000 cal. BC, estuarine material began to be deposited in low-lying areas in response to sea-level rise, while terrestrial material still settled at higher elevations. After this, but before 5850-5710 cal. BC, estuarine material areas began to accumulate at both high and low elevations. This marked a general flooding of the Marais Vernier, synchronous with that at the Seine estuary mouth. Soon after, peat accumulated over a wide area as a response to a local change in accommodation and a worldwide drop in sea level. A tidal channel developed to the west of the Marais Vernier, providing minerogenic material. After 1130-900 cal. BC, human influence becomes increasingly clear in the record. This record of regional change during the Holocene can serve as a reference for further studies in the area.

AB Fifty-six coals along with host rocks of Permian age (including samples from the Shanxi Formation, Lower Shihezi Formation and Upper Shihezi Formation) collected from the active Xinjier mine in the Huainan Coalfield, north China were studied in the present work. The overall object of this study was to characterize the coal quality and elucidate the possible genetic types for trace-element enrichment of Xinjier coals. Based on Chinese National Standards, all the coals can be classified as medium-high-volatile to high-volatile coal and ultra-low sulfur to low sulfur coal. The vitrinite-dominated Xinjier coals show phyiso-chemical properties difference along the coal-bearing strata. Compared to the coals of the Shanxi Formation, vitrinite contents are elevated in the coals of the Lower Shihezi and Upper Shihezi Formations, which indicates that they were probably exposed to a more reducing environment during peat accumulation. Most elements, such as Al2O3, K2O, Y, Se, and Sb, are enriched compared to those of Chinese and World coals. The major-element oxides Al2O3 and K2O as well as trace elements Th and Y increase from the lower to upper seams. Some elements are distinctly concentrated in host rocks (roof, floor, and parting) compared with adjacent coals. These geochemical anomalies and "increasing stratigraphically upward" ash yield trend are attributed to influence from terrigenous inputs. Elements in Xinjier coals were classified into three geochemical groups based on the statistical analysis. In particular, sequential extraction experiments of selected coals found that As, Se, and Sb predominantly occur as organic associations in coal.

AB Using sedimentological and pollen analysis, a reconstruction is presented here for the origin and history of a temporary pool from the quartzitic-sandstone Benslimane Plateau (W. Morocco). The pool is one of many that originated from the dismantling of a past hydrographical network, dated to the end of the Lower Pleistocene. Infilling of the pool began only recently between 5000 and 4000 cal. BP, and probably was in response to Neolithic-induced degradation of the regional vegetation cover. The almost continuous pollen occurrence of Isoetes velata-type, Myriophyllum alterniflorum and Ranunculus-type throughout the palynological sequence indicates that the organisation of local plant communities in concentric belts (a central aquatic community, an intermediate amphibious one, and a peripheral terrestrial one) has remained unchanged since the Mid-Holocene. The stability of the vegetation structure and composition over more than 4000 years confirms the adaptation of the hydrophytic communities to human-induced disturbances (mainly grazing).
   The long-term pool longevity is attributed to an equilibrium between wind erosion and sedimentation. The sediment accumulation balance that was null or negative during most of the Pleistocene became positive under the influence of Neolithic activities, which may also be linked to unfavourable climatic conditions. These results have important implications for the long-term conservation of biodiversity, as these rare habitats are rapidly declining. Since temporary pools also protect the quartzitic-sandstone plateau from erosion, their disappearance could trigger the reorganisation of the hydrological network and the resumption of soil erosion.

   Northern Cairngorm mountains, Scotland
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE pine; subalpine scrub; climate; vegetation; soil
ID CLIMATE; LIMIT
AB Scots pine Pinus sylvestris has been colonizing the Northern Corries area of the Cairngorm mountains, following a reduction in grazing and browsing, and a natural subalpine scrub zone appears to be developing. The area was surveyed to assess the density and rates of tree colonization, and identify the factors affecting the process. The pattern of colonization was uneven. Although relationships between pine establishment and environmental variables were complex, it was possible to identify the main factors affecting pine colonization. They were: distance from the forest (the main seed source), altitude, vegetation (type and height), drainage and soil organic horizon depth. Combining the effects of all these factors, pine establishment was greatest close to the forest, at altitudes around 600-700 m, in Calluna vulgaris moor or lichen-rich dwarf Calluna heath under 20 cm tall, on well-drained mineral soils with at most a shallow organic horizon. Establishment at low altitudes tended to be restricted by deep, wet peat and tall vegetation, and at high altitudes mainly by climate. The age structure of the population indicated a sudden increase in colonization around 1960, possibly related to reduced deer browsing, but colonization decreased after about 1970. Some possible reasons for this pattern ave given. Comparisons with other tree-line populations suggest that, provided grazing/browsing pressure remains low, the area may develop a natural tree-line similar to the only other extensive natural tree-line presently known in Scotland, at Creag Fhiaclach, also in the Cairngorms. Some suggestions are made of suitable management to accelerate this process. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited

AB The binding of a series of substituted phenols as axial ligands onto a diiron(III)bisporphyrin framework have been investigated. Spectroscopic characterization revealed high-spin states of the iron centers in all of the phenolate complexes, with one exception in the 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate complex of diiron(III)bisporphyrin, which only stabilized the pure intermediate-spin (S = 3/2) state of the iron centers. The average FeN (porphyrin) and FeO (phenol) distances that were observed with the 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate complex were 1.972(3)angstrom and 2.000(2)angstrom, respectively, which are the shortest and longest distances reported so far for any Fe(III)porphyrin with phenoxide coordination. The alternating shift pattern, which shows opposite signs of the chemical shifts for the meta versus ortho/para protons, is attributed to negative and positive spin densities on the phenolate carbon atoms, respectively, and is indicative of -spin delocalization onto the bound phenolate. Electrochemical data reveals that the E-1/2 value for the Fe-III/Fe-II couple is positively shifted with increasing acidity of the phenol. However, a plot of the E-1/2 values for the Fe-III/Fe-II couple versus the pK(a) values of the phenols shows a linear relationship for all of the complexes, except for the 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate complex. The large deviation from linearity is probably due to the change of spin for the complex. Although 2,4,6-trinitrophenol is the weakest axial ligand in the series, its similar binding with the corresponding Fe(III)monoporphyrin only results in stabilization of the high-spin state. The porphyrin macrocycle in the 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate complex of diiron(III)bisporphyrin is the most distorted, whilst the ruffling deformation affects the energy levels of the iron d orbitals. The larger size and weaker binding of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, along with hemeheme interactions in the diiron(III)bisporphyrin, are responsible for the larger ring deformations and eventual stabilization of the pure intermediate-spin states of the iron centers in the complex.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the influence of land cover changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in the Daqing Prefecture of China, where heavy industrialisation in the form of dense oil wells has impacted the environment. Time-series presentations for the period 1978 to 2008 of remotely sensed data and soil survey data were used to assess the extent of the changes. The study revealed soil degradation under all land cover types and in all soil types, grassland retreat (-15 per cent), swampland retreat (-45 per cent) and increases in the area of farmland (+19 per cent), sand land (+1450 per cent) and alkaline land (+52 per cent). Depletion of the SOC pool occurred in swampland (-64 per cent) both because of the decrease in the area of swampland and because of a decrease in SOC density (-34 per cent). An increase in the SOC pool occurred in alkaline land because of the increase in the area and also because of an increase in SOC density (+297 per cent), but there was little change in the SOC pool in farmland because the increase in area was largely offset by a decrease in SOC density (-14 per cent). The decrease in the STN pool was substantial (-44 per cent), with the largest contributor being the decrease in swamplands (-74 per cent), partly because of the decrease in the area of swampland and partly because of a decrease in STN density (-52 per cent). Large decreases in the STN pool also occurred in farmland (-22 per cent) and grassland (-41 per cent). The direct impacts of construction associated with the expansion of the oil industry were overshadowed by indirect impacts such as interference with water flows and water levels resulting in salinisation of soil. The study also revealed that land cover changes are much more dynamic than a simple analysis would reveal, and because of lag times in the loss of SOC, soil degradation will continue even if land cover changes cease.

AB Nitrous oxide (H2O) and methane (CH4()) are greenhouse gases and active in the depletion of the ozone layer. These gases, originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources, are mainly released to the atmosphere from coastal areas, including continental shelves, estuaries and cords. Surface distribution of dissolved N2O and CH4 during the austral spring were described within the Magellanic Sub -Antarctic region (50-55 degrees S, Chile) with a coastal area that has a complex system of Cords, channels, gulf and, bays. A narrow range of N2O concentrations were observed from under-saturations (similar to 65%), as result of freshwater/glacial flow into fjord heads, to slight super-saturations (similar to 120-150%) in cord mouths and adjacent marine zones. One exception was Otway Sound, where a penguin colony is situated, with N2O levels of up to 218%. In contrast, CH4 concentrations presented a wide range of saturations between 47.9% and 483%, with a spatial distribution that mainly corresponded to the type of hydrographic/geomorphologic basin; in the southern Patagonian Andes (mostly covered by the southern Ice Fields) CH4 levels varied between 65 and 80% in the marine area, and 180% saturation in the channels and Cords; whereas in the southern Patagonian tableland (Magellan Strait) higher CH4 concentrations, up to 483% saturation, were observed apparently associated with continental inputs (peatland and tundra vegetation). N2O concentrations were positively correlated with salinity and nutrients, indicating that the majority of N2O and nutrients (except silicate) originated from the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), which mixes with N2O-de-pleated freshwater. However, CH4 concentrations did not correlate with any oceanographic variables, suggesting that they originate from local marine/terrestrial interactions, The Magellanic Sub -Antarctic region acts as a modest source of N2O and CH4, to the atmosphere with effluxes of 6.20 +/- 10.13 and 16.88 +/- 27.04 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) respectively. Due to climate change and a growth in anthropogenic activities such as salmon farming, future emissions of N2O and CH4 within this remote region remain uncertain.

DE Seagrass; Posidonia oceanica; Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration;
   Mediterranean Sea; Corsica
AB Coastal marine vegetation has been recently highlighted for its highly efficient carbon storage capacity. Among the sixty-four species of seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, a Mediterranean endemic species, appears to be the most effective in carbon fixation and storage. Based on new data from the study of one of the largest P. oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean Sea (100 km of coastline, 20 425 ha), and a synthesis of available data from the whole of the Mediterranean basin, the aim of this work is to evaluate the amount of carbon fixed each year by P. oceanica and sequestered in the matte, in relation with the mitigation of the impact of climate change (carbon sink). The mean total carbon fixation (blades, sheaths and rhizomes) per year varies between 33.5 and 426.6 g C.m(-2) and the mean carbon sequestration (long-term sink in the matte), corresponding to the sheath and rhizome tissues, varies between 7.7 and 84.4 g C.m(-2), with a clear decreasing trend according to depth because of the meadow density decrease. The synthesis of a hundred measurements made throughout the Mediterranean Sea and at depths between 0.5 and 32.0 m provides a basis for estimating the average annual carbon fixation and sequestration rate throughout the Mediterranean basin. The fixation of the blades is estimated at 1 024 t C.ha(-1).yr(- 1), that of the sheaths at 220 t C ha(-1).yr(-1) and that of the rhizomes at 58 t C ha(-1).yr(-1); i.e. a total fixation rate of 1 302 t C ha(-1).yr(-1) and sequestration rate (dead sheaths and rhizomes) of 278 t C ha(-1).yr(-1). This annual carbon fixation represents only 0.61% on average of CO2 emissions/releases for all Mediterranean countries but in the large Mediterranean islands this fixation is on average 3.1% and can reach almost 14.4% for Corsica. Moreover, the major advantage of the P. oceanica meadow lies in its capacity to store carbon from annual carbon sequestration for centuries to millennia and can be compared to several terrestrial ecosystems considered to be efficient in carbon storage (peatlands).

AB Wheat was cultivated on soil-like substrate (SLS) produced by the action of worms and microflora from the inedible biomass of wheat. After the growth of the wheat crop, the inedible biomass was restored in SLS and exposed to decomposition ("biological" combustion) and its mineral compounds were assimilated by plants. Grain was returned to the SLS in the amount equivalent to human solid waste produced by consumption of the grain. Human wastes (urine and feces) after physicochemical processing turned into mineralized form (mineralized urine and mineralized feces) and entered the plants' nutrient solution amounts equal to average daily production. Periodically (once every 60-70 days) the nutrient solution was partly (up to 50%) desalinated by electrodialysis. Due to this NaCl concentration in the nutrient solution was sustained at a fixed level of about 0.26%. The salt concentrate obtained could be used in the human nutrition through NaCl extraction and the residuary elements were returned through the mineralized human liquid wastes into matter turnover. The control wheat cultivation was carried out on peat with use of the Knop nutrient solution. Serial cultivation of several wheat vegetations within 280 days was conducted during the experiment. Grain output varied and yield/harvest depended, in large part, upon the amount of inedible biomass returned to SLS and the speed of its decomposition. After achieving a stationary regime, (when the quantity of wheat inedible biomass utilized during vegetation in SLS is equal to the quantity of biomass introduced into SLS before vegetation) grain harvest in comparison with the control was at most 30% less, and in some cases was comparable to the control harvest values. The investigations carried out on the wheat example demonstrated in principle the possibility of long-term functioning of the LSS photosynthesizing link based on optimizations of biological and physicochemical methods of utilization of the human and plants wastes. The possibilities for the use of these technologies for the creation integrated biological-physicochemical LSS with high closure degree of internal matter turnover are discussed in this paper.

AB [1] Subglacial environments are a previously neglected component of the Earth's global carbon cycle, a reflection of the view held until recently that they are dominated by abiotic and oxic conditions. Here we provide a realistic assessment of the theory that the basal regions of the ice sheets that formed over North America and Europe during glaciations were host to significant populations of anaerobic microorganisms, including methanogens, able to metabolize organic carbon sequestered during interglacials and overridden during Quaternary glacials. In doing so, we review the current evidence for subglacial methane release during deglaciation, estimate the size of the subglacial reservoir of organic carbon (SOC), and assess the amount of SOC available to subglacial microbes and the likely pathways and rates of carbon turnover. We then discuss the fate of subglacial methane and the potential impact of its release on atmospheric methane concentrations. We calculate that the SOC equates to 418-610 Pg C and includes carbon from terrestrial soils/vegetation, peatlands, lake, and marine sediments. The SOC that is potentially available for microbial conversion to methane is smaller than this estimate due to (1) glacial erosion, (2) accumulation of recalcitrant organic carbon compounds over time, (3) conversion to carbon dioxide by aerobic/anaerobic respiration, and (4) incomplete conversion of labile organic matter to methane. We estimate that the total SOC available for conversion to methane is 63 Pg C. Our estimates of methane production potentials span a wide range because of the current uncertainty surrounding subglacial metabolic rates. We believe, however, that there is a strong likelihood that subglacial microbes could convert 63 Pg of SOC to methane during a glacial cycle. If this were the case, release of this methane from the ice sheet margins during retreat would need to be episodic in order to significantly impact atmospheric methane concentrations. Our findings suggest that it may well be important to consider subglacial environments as active components of the Earth's carbon cycle. Conclusive determination of the potential impact of subglacial methane production on atmospheric methane concentrations during deglaciation, however, awaits more precise determination of the ability of subglacial microbes to degrade organic carbon components and their associated rates of metabolism under in situ conditions.

AB It has been shown in many habitats worldwide, that a shift in vegetation composition between woody shrub and graminoid dominance can influence carbon (C) cycling. Due to land management practices and environmental change, UK upland heath vegetation has historically undergone shifts in dominance from the woody dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris (Calluna) to species poor graminoid swards. The consequences of this for C sequestration are unknown.
   We compared annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) between building phase Callunaand grass-dominated communities Within three upland heaths in Scotland, measuring c. monthly over a year. Light and temperature response curves were generated, and the parameters derived were applied to continuous light and temperature data to extrapolate CO2 fluxes over the full year and generate estimates of annual CO2 sequestration for each vegetation type.
   Grass-dominated communities had higher ecosystem respiration rates than Calluna-dominated communities, attributed to graminoids having greater metabolic demands and producing more labile litter which decomposes readily. Both communities had similar gross primary productivity over the year; the net result being higher NEE within the Calluna-dominated than the grass-dominated community (-2.36 +/- 0.23 and -1.78 +/- 0.18 mu mol CO2 m(-2) S-1 respectively).
   Modelled CO2 fluxes over a year showed both communities to be CO2 sinks. The Calluna-dominated community sequesters -3.45 +/- 0.96 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), double that sequestered by the grass-dominated community at 1.61 +/- 0.57 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).
   Potential rate of C sequestration by upland heath is comparable to that of woodland and the increase in total sequestration that could be gained from habitat restoration may equate to c. 60% of the annual UK C sink attributed to forest land management. National C sequestration by heathlands is also more than double that by peatlands. Management of graminoid-dominated upland heath should promote Calluna re-establishment, thus providing a C benefit in addition to benefits to biodiversity, grazing and sporting interests.

AB Vegetation, sub-surface peat, and road dust were sampled near the Delong Mountain Transportation System (DMTS) haul road in northwest Alaska in 2005-2006 to document aluminum, barium, cadmium, lead, and zinc concentrations, and to evaluate bioaccessibility of these metals. The DMTS haul road is the transport corridor between Red Dog Mine (a large-scale, lead-zinc mine and mill) and the coastal shipping port, and it traverses National Park Service lands. Compared to reference locations, total metal concentrations in four types of vegetation (birch, cranberry, and willow leaves, and cotton grass blades/stalks) collected 25 m from the haul road were enriched on average by factors of 3.5 for zinc, 8.0 for barium, 20 for cadmium, and 150 for lead. Triple rinsing of vegetation with a water/methanol mixture reduced metals concentrations by at most 50%, and cadmium and zinc concentrations were least affected by rinsing. Cadmium and zinc bioaccessibility was greater in vegetation (50% to 100%) than in dust (15% to 20%); whereas the opposite pattern was observed for lead bioaccessibility (< 30% in vegetation; 50% in dust). Barium exhibited low-to-intermediate bioaccessibility in dust and vegetation (20% to 40%), whereas aluminum bioaccessibility was relatively low (< 6%) in all sample types. Our reconnaissance-level study indicates that clean-up and improvements in lead/zinc concentrate transfer activities have been effective; however, as of 2006, metal dispersion from past and/or present releases of fugitive dusts along the DMTS road still may have been contributing to elevated metals in surface vegetation. Vegetation was most enriched in lead, but because bioaccessibility of cadmium was greater, any potential risks to animals that forage near the haul road might be equally important for both of these metals.

AB [ 1] We used a simple hydrological-biogeochemical mixing model to test the hypothesis that export of total organic carbon occurring mainly during spring in taiga and tundra watersheds might be compensated by production and export of bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) from groundwater during the rest of the year. The investigated watersheds are located in northern Sweden close to the Arctic Circle. An elevated spring flow peak due to snowmelt characterizes the hydrology of boreal and arctic river systems. During this snowmelt, total organic carbon (TOC), previously stored as soil carbon, is flushed and exported from the watersheds, and can be released to the atmosphere via heterotrophic remineralization during riverine transport to the sea, thereby contributing to atmospheric CO(2). The TOC yields of the watersheds investigated increased with vegetation and peat cover and ranged across watersheds from 0.5 to 2.8 tons km(-2) yr(-1). During frozen periods, streamflow is dominated by "old'' groundwater. This water has percolated through the soils and is rich in DSi and bicarbonate; that is, atmospheric carbon that has been "consumed'' in chemical weathering processes is partly exported as bicarbonate to the sea, where carbon is stored as CaCO(3) for geological time. The bicarbonate export of the watersheds investigated was between 0.4 and 1.2 tons C km(-2) yr(-1) corresponding to 15 - 73% of the TOC export. Very likely, global warming will affect water flow through the soils in taiga and tundra ecosystems and thus will have an effect on watershed carbon budgets. This bicarbonate export may compensate for significant amounts of the exported TOC, thereby reducing the positive feedback to atmospheric CO(2).

AB A prominent, middle Miocene (17.5-13.5 Ma) carbon isotope excursion ubiquitously recorded in carbonate sediments has been attributed to enhanced marine productivity and sequestration of C-13 depleted organic carbon in marine sediments or enhanced carbon burial in peat/lignite deposits on land. Here we test the hypothesis that the marine delta C-13 record reflects a change in productivity with proxy records from three Atlantic Ocean sites (Deep Sea Drilling Program Site 608 and Ocean Drilling Program Sites 925 and 1265). Our multiproxy approach is based on benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates, elemental ratios (Ba/Al and P/Al), the delta C-13 of bulk sedimentary organic matter, and dissolution indices. We compare these proxies to benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values measured on the same samples. Our results indicate that marine paleoproductivity in the Atlantic Ocean is not related to the benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 excursion. A numerical box model confirms that marine productivity cannot account for the delta C-13 maximum. The model shows that sequestration of 1.5 x 10(18) mol C in the terrestrial realm over a period of 3 Ma leads to a 0.9 parts per thousand delta C-13 increase in the deep ocean, which is near the observed records. Therefore, an increase in continental organic carbon sequestration is the most plausible way to enrich the ocean's carbon pool with C-13, which is consistent with coeval lignite deposits worldwide. The delta C-13 values of bulk sedimentary organic matter parallel the delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon as reflected by benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values suggesting no significant change in atmospheric pCO(2) levels over the investigated period.

AB The aim of the present paper is to determine the social structure of a guanaco population (Lama guanicoe Muller, 1776) and its interaction with the habitat in the north coast of Mitre Peninsula, Tierra del Fuego, Argentine. This is a forested region and has a low level of disturbance by human activity. Furthermore, a revision through the different techniques to determine sex relationships (SR) was carried out, which is a parameter of vital importance for the future management and exploitation of the Fuegian guanaco populations. Terrestrial census was made, in which data on structure of each social group, their dimension, male distribution in each group, size and composition of the social group, rate numbers of female and breeding in the family groups were obtained. The following proportions were determined: breeding/female, breeding/adult, and female/adult. 40.8% of all guanacos were together in family groups, 50.5% in male groups, and 8.7% were solitary males. The average size of the family groups was 6 members, and that of the male groups was 7.5 members. The breeding/female proportion was 0.4, the number of breeding per family group was 1.8 and the number of female was 4.6. Differences were found between the populations in areas with ''barren plain-peat'' vegetation, with few trees, of Policarpo Bay (36% of members were met in family groups, 58% in male groups, and 6% were solitary males; and the following proportions were found: breeding/female 0.36, female/adult 0.24, and breeding/family groups 1.5) and in forested areas of Thetis Bay (45% of the members were in family groups, 51% in male groups, and 4% were solitary males; the proportions were the following: breeding/female 0.46, female/adult 0.31 and breeding/family group 3).

AB Mineralisation of organic matter can substantially add to the risk of nitrogen leaching from drained humus-rich soils under intensive agricultural use. The objective of this study was to investigate net nitrogen mineralisation (NNM) in a drained Mollic Gleysol over the course of a year and to separate contributions from the decomposition of fresh organic residues ('litter') and stabilised soil organic matter ('humus'). Using NNM rates measured under different moisture conditions in two undisturbed subsoil monoliths and a moisture response function determined by incubation experiments with small soil cores from a humus-rich subsoil layer, a first-order rate model was calibrated to describe NNM of the 'humus pool'. Standardised to the same moisture conditions by means of this response function, NNM rate constants were independent of depth and also did not differ between monoliths and small soil cores. The model predicted NNM rates determined in situ at a depth of 20-40 cm well. For the topsoil (0-20 cm) it was necessary to extend the model by a second pool of organic matter with a higher turnover rate ('litter pool'). Assuming the same moisture and temperature dependence of NNM in the two pools, the basic NNM rate constant of the litter pool was determined by data fitting. With this calibration, the two-pool model predicted a net mineralisation of 322 kg N ha(-1) during the experimental year in the upper 40 cm of the soil of which 55% occurred in the 'litter pool'. While overall NNM predictions relating to the entire study period agreed well with the field data, predictions for individual incubation periods (3-6 weeks) and soil layers were much less reliable.

LA English
DT Article
ID PRINCE CHARLES MOUNTAINS
AB The mid- to Upper Permian Radok Conglomerate, the lowermost formation of the Permo-Triassic Amery Group, crops out in the Beaver Lake area of the northern Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica. Outcrop is confined to a north-south elongate, fault-bounded corridor interpreted as a remnant of a continental extensional basin formed during Late Palaeozoic times. This basin forms a small part of the much larger Lambert Graben, a major continental rift system. The Radok Conglomerate consists of interbedded conglomerates, argillaceous sandstones, siltstones, and minor, thin carbonaceous siltstones and coals. Textural, petrographic, palaeocurrent and other data suggest local derivation from Precambrian massifs to the immediate west, during a period of fault activity. The unit is a minimum of 400 m thick, the base being unexposed, and grossly fines upward. It is abruptly overlain by quartzo-feldspathic sandstone-dominated rocks of the Upper Permian Bainmedart Coal Measures. Seven recurrent lithofacies have been recognized with the Radok Conglomerate, and are interpreted as the products of poorly-confined stream flow, sheet how and sediment gravity flow processes, suspension fallout in shallow standing water, and organic sediment accumulation in peat-forming wetlands. The unit as a whole is interpreted as having accumulated as a coarse alluvial apron along the western margin of a ?graben extensional trough. Similar, though poorly exposed, facies are exposed on the eastern margin of the basin and may reflect similar depositional systems. Towards the top of the Radok Conglomerate, typical Radok lithologies are interbedded with quartzo-feldspathic sandstones derived from the south, precursors of the overlying Bainmedart Coal Measures. Interference between transverse (Radok) and axial (Bainmedart) drainage is possibly related to progressive infilling of extensional topography, thereby allowing axially flowing rivers to avulse increasingly into the Beaver Lake region from the main Lambert Graben.

AB To better predict the architecture of reservoirs and the location of undiscovered resources in fluvial-dominated strata, a sound chronostratigraphic framework is needed. This study reassesses the stratigraphic framework of petroleum-bearing Jurassic fluviolacustrine successions in the Eromanga, Surat, and Clarence-Moreton Basins of eastern Australia. Correlation of the strata is challenging because of the heterolithic facies, the absence of conventional stratigraphic marker beds, and the longevity of palynostratigraphic zones. The abundance of laterally discontinuous volcanic air-fall tuffs and volcanogenic sandstones across the Jurassic of eastern Australia allows for the construction of a new, regional chronostratigraphic framework. High-precision U-Pb zircon chemical abrasion-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) dates ranging from 168.07 +/- 0.07 Ma to 149.08 +/- 0.06 Ma were obtained from 31 samples from 13 wells across 3 basins. Five chronostratigraphic datums were defined and extrapolated to 677 wells within a time interval of 420 ka or less over hundreds of kilometers across eastern Australia. The new chronostratigraphic framework reveals inaccuracies in picking litho-stratigraphic units based on lithology andwire-line log characteristics and shows coal-bearing facies of the Walloon Coal Measures to be two episodes of coal (peat) accumulation separated by an unconformity. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of extending chronostratigraphic datums to neighboring basins without tuff beds by dating the youngest zircon in volcanogenic sandstones by U-Pb CA-TIMS following laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. The dates provide a substantial revision to the Middle to Upper Jurassic stratigraphy of eastern Australia. The use of precise U-Pb CA-TIMS dates should help elucidate the lithofacies architecture of nonmarine successions in other basins and assist in petroleum development.

AB Palynological investigations on two well-dated peat profiles provide insights into Neolithic vegetation and settlement history from Hummling in north-western Germany. The site selections allow comparisons between local and regional vegetation changes and are used to estimate the extent of Neolithic influence on the vegetation. The interpretation of the fossil spectra relied on radiocarbon dating, evaluation of pollen indicator taxa, non-pollen palynomorphs and multivariate techniques. During the late Mesolithic the vegetation was dominated by mixed oak forests while openings in forest cover were detected, with a decline in elm reflected in the regional pollen record around 4250 cal. b.c. The presence of humans is shown by settlement indicators that are first recorded at ca. 3800 cal. b.c. Vegetation changes were small between 4300 and 3600 cal. b.c. This suggests that regional vegetation was relatively resilient to small-scale disturbances. Possible indications of grazing were recorded in the spectra of the local pollen profile but there is no clear-cut evidence for Neolithic activity. Between 3520 and 2260 cal. b.c. decreases in forest cover were inferred from both profiles and increases in settlement indicators reflect farming activity. These changes coincide with the emergence in the area of the Funnel Beaker Culture and the subsequent Single Grave Culture. Both profiles suggest that settlement probably ceased between ca. 3230 and 3050 cal. b.c. This lull or cessation in activity was probably regional in character. After 2260 cal. b.c. human impact on the vegetation decreases and woodlands regenerate. The longevity of the regeneration phase-ca. 690 years-was probably connected with the low resilient capability of the vegetation on the poor soils.

AB Current emissions inventories of black carbon aerosol, an important component of PM2.5 and a powerful climate altering species, are highly uncertain in both space and time. One of the major and hardest to constrain sources of black carbon is fire, which comes from a combination of forest, vegetation, agricultural, and peat sources. Therefore, quantifying this source more precisely in both space and time is essential. While there is a growing body of work on this topic, the best estimations generally underestimate measurements by integer factors. In this work, 12 years of measurements from 2000 through 2012 of AOD from the MISR satellite and AOD and AAOD from the AERONET network, are used to evaluate the aerosol climatology from Southeast Asian fires. First, the fires in Southeast Asia are uniquely characterized in both space and time to reveal two major burning regions: one with a regular inter-annual and intra-annual distribution, and the other with an irregular inter-annual and somewhat variable intra-annual distribution. These patterns correspond well with regional and local measurements of both composition and meteorology. Using these newly developed relationships, a new temporally and spatially varying set of black carbon emissions is developed. Finally, the best fits with the various measurements yield an annual average value for black carbon emissions due to fires bounded by the range 0.36-0.54 Tg yr(-1), with the amount in the year of the greatest fires being bounded by the range 1.2-1.8 Tg yr(-1). These magnitudes are significantly higher and differently distributed in space and time when compared with current inventories, and therefore are expected to have a significant impact on regional particulate loadings and the global climate system.

AB The coalbed methane potential and producibility of any coal-bearing strata are strongly affected by the hydrogeological regime of formation waters and by coal permeability, which in turn depends on the effective stress regime of the coals. Peat that accumulated in the Alberta basin during the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary led to the formation of coal deposits that may contain significant coalbed methane resources. The flow of formation waters plays an important role in the maintenance and producibility of this resource. The present-day flow is driven by gravity (topography) and erosional rebound and is controlled by rock permeability and the presence of gas-saturated sandstones. The estimated gas in place in the Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous coals decreases significantly with stratigraphic age, ranging between less than 2 bcf/mi(2) in the lower coal zones and 12 bcf/mi(2) in the uppermost coals. The gas content, especially of the deeper coals, is lower than would be expected for the corresponding coal rank and burial depth, most likely because the underpressuring has caused the release of gas from the coals and accumulation, in adjacent sands. The shallow coals, although of low rank, may contain important amounts of late-stage biogenic methane. The salinity of formation water in shallow coal seams, where the flow is driven by topography, is low, generally less than 1500 mg/L, although in places, it reaches 3000-5000 mg/L. The salinity of formation water in the deeper, underpressured strata in the west-central part of the basin is significantly higher, reaching 18,000 mg/L. This affects treatment and/or disposal strategies with regard to the water produced concurrent to coalbed methane.

AB The evolution of the late Holocene environments has been reconstructed on the basis of multiproxy studies of peat sequences. The vegetation response to short-period climate fluctuations has been traced. Early in the late Holocene there were birch forests with oak and other broadleaf trees; vast areas were occupied by forb meadows. Under cooling (3250 yr BP) the shrub pine (Pinus pumila) became the landscape-forming species, and since 2490 yr BP Selaginella selaginoides appeared in abundance. The Little Ice Age was marked by the disappearance of broadleaf trees and widely spread heath land communities. The higher stands of the lake level were related to warmings (3660-3590; 3450-3180; 2960-2840; 2410-2260 cal yr BP). Shallowing coincided with short-term coolings (3590-3450; 3180-2960; 2840-2410; 2260-2150 cal yr BP) marked by reduced precipitations. The dune ridge formation began during the longest cooling accompanied by a minor regression. The dunes were stabilized and a paleosol developed similar to 2340-2260 yr BP. A younger generation of eolian sands developed during the Little Ice Age. An ecological effect of volcanic ashfalls has been estimated. The local biotic components seem to have been most afflicted by the eruption in the north of Iturup in similar to 2100-2300 cal yr BP, when CKr tephra up to 30 cm thick was deposited. The ages of 4 strongest tsunamis that occurred over the last 3660 years were determined. They appeared to be related to the earthquakes with focuses close to Urup Island or south of it. The lake microflora shows ecological effect of the marine water invasions.

AB This paper reports the mineralogical characteristics of a complete coal seam in the Late Permian Longtan Formation from the Yueliangtian mine, western Guizhou, southwestern China. The minerals in the coal were identified using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive Xray spectrometer (SEM-EDS), and low temperature ashing plus X-ray diffraction (LTA + XRD). The results show that quartz and kaolinite are the major components of the coal mineral matter; followed by pyrite, marcasite, anatase, and calcite; and in some cases, mixed-layer illite/smectite, chamosite, illite, ankerite, apatite, and anorthite. The highly-elevated concentration of quartz in the coal is mostly derived from siliceous solutions produced by weathering of the Emeishan basalt. However, quartz discrete particles with large size (>100 mu m) and rounded shape probably resulted from the input of felsic rock materials. The distribution and modes of occurrence of kaolinite, mixed-layer illite/smectite, illite, and anatase reflect a terrigenous origin. In comparison with the coals from eastern Yunnan, the Yueliangtian coals have lower proportion of authigenic chamosite, the formation of which was probably related to the injection of seawater. Pyrite occurring as individual particles or clustered framboids was most likely influenced by seawater during the stages of peat accumulation or early diagenesis, while fracture-filling pyrite probably had an epigenetic origin. Additionally, an intra-seam volcanic ash-derived tonstein layer, which contains sharp-edged quartz, vermicular kaolinite, and well-developed zircon crystals, has been identified in the coal of the present study.

AB Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) is one of the cheapest and technically least demanding carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR) or negative CO2 emission technologies. For a realistic assessment of SCS, it is critical to evaluate how much carbon (C) can be stored in soil organic matter under actual agricultural practices. This includes typical crop rotations and fertilization strategies, depends on resources that are available (e.g. farmyard manure (FYM)) and are affordable for farmers. Furthermore, it is important to assess SCS based on given climatic and soil conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in soil C storage for Switzerland using data from eleven long-term field experiments on cropland and permanent grassland that include common local practices.
   At all sites, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were measured in topsoil (similar to 0-0.2 m) in response to a total of 80 different treatments including different types of mineral or organic fertilization (e.g. FYM, slurry, peat, compost) or soil management (tillage vs. no-till). The treatments were applied to different, diverse crop rotations or grass mixtures that are representative for Switzerland. We found that topsoils lost C at an average rate of 0.29 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), although many of the investigated treatments were expected to lead to SOC increases. Based on a linear mixed effects model we showed that SOC change rates (Delta SOC) were driven by C inputs to soil (harvest residues and organic fertilizer), soil cover and initial SOC stocks. The type of land use or soil tillage had no significant effect. Our analysis suggests that current efforts to manage soils sustainably need to be intensified and complemented with further techniques if Switzerland wants to achieve the goal of the 4 per 1000 initiative.

AB Temperate oak-dominated woodlands are plant communities characterized by relatively open canopy structure and often rich assemblages of light-demanding understory species. This vegetation prevailed in Central European lowlands during the early and middle Holocene. Where open woodlands persisted in later periods, several main factors might have prevented the expansion of shade-tolerant tree species: climate, soil, and disturbances. The last factor includes both natural and human induced agents (fire, grazing of wild or domestic herbivores, management). In our study we focused on the relative impact of the humans and climate on long-term forest vegetation changes in the northerwestern part of the Panonnian Basin. Two peat cores covering the vegetation history of the past 12,000 years have been investigated by means of pollen and charcoal analyses. Palaeoecological data were interpreted in the context of a climatic model and archaeological evidence. Our results showed that the early Holocene vegetation in the study region was composed of open wooded steppe with the dominance of pine. Succession to temperate oak and hazel woodland started in about 7500 cal BP and coincides with the first traces of permanent human settlement in the vicinity of both study sites. Since the Neolithic, different types of woodland management have created a more open forest structure, which has benefited light demanding trees, such as oak and hazel. However, during the middle Holocene several humid oscillations were recorded, which might have triggered the expansion of temperate woodlands. Although the natural or anthropogenic drivers behind the dynamics of temperate woodland could not be separated from each other, it seems probable that long-term human impact influenced the dynamics of temperate woodlands from the middle and late Holocene until the present.

TI Assessment of Above-Ground Biomass of Borneo Forests through a New
   Data-Fusion Approach Combining Two Pan-Tropical Biomass Maps

ID CARBON-DENSITY; STOCKS
AB This study investigates how two existing pan-tropical above-ground biomass (AGB) maps (Saatchi 2011, Baccini 2012) can be combined to derive forest ecosystem specific carbon estimates. Several data-fusion models which combine these AGB maps according to their local correlations with independent datasets such as the spectral bands of SPOT VEGETATION imagery are analyzed. Indeed these spectral bands convey information about vegetation type and structure which can be related to biomass values. Our study area is the island of Borneo. The data-fusion models are evaluated against a reference AGB map available for two forest concessions in Sabah. The highest accuracy was achieved by a model which combines the AGB maps according to the mean of the local correlation coefficients calculated over different kernel sizes. Combining the resulting AGB map with a new Borneo land cover map (whose overall accuracy has been estimated at 86.5%) leads to average AGB estimates of 279.8 t/ha and 233.1 t/ha for forests and degraded forests respectively. Lowland dipterocarp and mangrove forests have the highest and lowest AGB values (305.8 t/ha and 136.5 t/ha respectively). The AGB of all natural forests amounts to 10.8 Gt mainly stemming from lowland dipterocarp (66.4%), upper dipterocarp (10.9%) and peat swamp forests (10.2%). Degraded forests account for another 2.1 Gt of AGB. One main advantage of our approach is that, once the best fitting data-fusion model is selected, no further AGB reference dataset is required for implementing the data-fusion process. Furthermore, the local harmonization of AGB datasets leads to more spatially precise maps. This approach can easily be extended to other areas in Southeast Asia which are dominated by lowland dipterocarp forest, and can be repeated when newer or more accurate AGB maps become available.

ID EXAMPLE; UTILITY
AB For unveiling coal-bearing source rocks in terrestrial-marine transitional sequences, the sequence stratigraphic framework and sedimentary facies of Lower Oligocene Yacheng Formation of Qiongdongnan Basin were investigated using seismic profiles, complemented by well bores and cores. Three third-order sequences are identified on the basis of unconformities on basin margins and correlative conformities in the basin center, namely SQYC3, SQYC2 and SQYC1 from bottom to top. Coal measure in Yacheng Formation of Qiongdongnan Basin were deposited within a range of fades associations from delta plain/tidal zone to neritic sea, and three types of favourable sedimentary facies associations for coal measure were established within the sequence stratigraphic framework, including braided delta plain and alluvial fan, lagoon and tidal flat, and fan delta and coastal plain facies associations. Results shown that, in the third-order sequences, coal accumulation in landward areas (such as delta plain) of the study area predominantly correlates with the early transgressive systems tract (TST) to middle highstand systems tract (HST), while in seaward areas (such as tidal fiat-lagoon) it correlates with the early TST and middle HST. The most potential coal-bearing source rocks formed where the accommodation creation rate (Ra) and the peat-accumulation rate (Rp) could reach a state of balance, which varied among different sedimentary settings. Furthermore, intense tectonic subsidence and frequent alternative marine-continental changes of Yacheng Formation during the middle rift stage were the main reasons why the coal beds shown the characteristics of multi-beds, thin single-bed, and rapidly lateral changes. The proposed sedimentary fades associations may aid in predicting distribution of coal-bearing source rocks. This study also demonstrates that controlling factors analysis using sequence stratigraphy and sedimentology may serve as an effective approach for coal-bearing characteristics in the lower exploration deepwater area of South China Sea.

AB We review the main effects of sea level rise, salinity changes, and human disturbances on mangrove forest dynamics. The effects of these drivers on mangrove communities are evaluated at centennial time scales in the light of six palynological records from the Colombian Caribbean. Despite the accelerated rates of sea level rise, increases in sea surface and air temperatures, and decreases in precipitation of the last two centuries, mangroves have shown an increasing representation in pollen records at continental and marine locations of the region. In continental settings, such expansions have been related to the offsetting of sea levels by the increasing loads of fluvial sediments since 1850 AD, and by increases in autochthonous peat accumulation in San Andres Island. Losses of mangrove cover in the past have been related to coastal erosion, regional droughts, and salinity increases. Such processes have commonly caused mangrove die-off or changes in forest species composition. When the substrate has become more saline, or sand sedimentation has increased significantly, the composition of mangrove communities has switched towards the dominance of Avicennia germinans at expenses of Rhizophora mangle. Resprout capacity of damaged stems of Avicennia germinans seems to have been the trait that has allowed this species to increase after strong and prolonged droughts, and occurrence of strong winds, tropical storms, and hurricanes. Human disturbances are represented either by the expansion of Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia germinans and decreases of Rhizophora mangle, or by mangrove replacement by herbaceous vegetation (grasses or crops), especially the fern Acrostichum aureum. Around 1850 AD, mangroves and beach vegetation were replaced by coconut plantations in San Andres Island, and in the Cispata bay swampy areas were covered with rice crops. Although after 1900 AD these crops were abandoned because of a marine incursion, Laguncularia racemosa has prevailed so far indicating pervasive anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Four profiles of estuarine sediments obtained from boreholes drilled in the Algarve, Southern Portugal were studied in order to reconstruct the process of sediment accumulation driven by the postglacial sea level rise. In addition to the sedimentological analysis, the Foraminifera Index of Marine Influence (FIMI) permitted assessment of the nature and organization of sedimentary facies in the Beliche-Guadiana and Gilao-Almargem estuaries. The Beliche-Guadiana CM5 and Almargem G2 profiles accumulated in a sheltered environment, with the former presenting an almost continuous record of the sea level rise since ca 13 000 cal yr BP. The G1 and G3 profiles from the Gilao-Almargem area represent a more discontinuous record of the last 8000 years, which accumulated in the more dynamic environment of an outer estuary. The integration of all radiocarbon ages of dated levels, led to an estimate of sediment accumulation rates. Assuming a constant position of the sediment surface with respect to the tidal range and a negligible compaction of sediment, the sea level rose at the rate of 7 mm yr 1 in the period from 13 000 to 7500 cal yr BR This process slowed down to ca 0.9 mm yr(-1) from 7500 cal yr BP until the present. The marked historical change in the rate of sediment accumulation in these estuaries also occurred with the accumulation of organic matter and is, therefore, important data for global bio-geochemical models of carbon. The main obstacle to obtain higher temporal resolution of the sedimentary processes was the intense anaerobic respiration of organic matter via sulphate reduction, which did not allow any accumulation of peat and, furthermore, led to erasure of the palaeontological record by acid formed from the subsequent oxidation of sulphides.

AB Increase of surface temperatures has long been recognized as an unequivocal response to radiative forcing and one of the most important implications for global warming. However, it remains unclear whether the variation of ground surface temperature (GST) and soil temperatures is consistent with simultaneous changes of the near-surface air and land (or skin) surface temperatures (T-a and LST). In this study, a seven-year continuous observation of GST, T-a, and surface water and heat exchange was carried out at an elevational permafrost site at Chalaping, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results showed a distinct retarding of warming on the ground surface and subsurface under the presence of dense vegetation and moist peat substrates. Mean annual T-a and LST increased at noteworthy rates of 0.22 and 0.32 degrees C/a, respectively, while mean annual GST increased only at a rate of 0.057 degrees C/a. No obvious trends were detected for the four radiation budgets except the soil heat flux (G), which significantly increased at a rate of 0.29 W.m(-2).a(-1), presumably inducing the melting of ground ice and resulted in much higher moisture content through the summers of 2015 and 2016 than preceding years and subsequent 2017 at the depths between 80 and 120 cm. However, no noticeable immediate variations of soil temperatures occurred owing to the large latent heat effect (thermal inertia) and the extending zero-curtain period. We suggest that a better protected eco-environment, particularly the surface vegetation, helps preserving the underlying permafrost, and thus to mitigates the potential degradation of elevational permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root: shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350-2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, (549) was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root: shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring.

AB Evaluation of historic range of variability (HRV) is an effective tool for determining baseline conditions and providing context to researchers and land managers seeking to understand and enhance ecological function. Incorporating HRV into restoration planning acknowledges the dynamic quality of landscapes by allowing variability and disturbance at reasonable levels and permitting riverine landscapes to adapt to the physical processes of their watersheds. HRV analysis therefore represents a practical (though under-utilized) method for quantifying process-based restoration goals. We investigated HRV of aggradational processes in the subalpine Lulu City wetland in Rocky Mountain National Park to understand the impacts of two centuries of altered land use and to guide restoration planning following a human-caused debris flow in 2003 that deposited up to 1?m of sand and gravel in the wetland. Historic aerial photograph interpretation, ground penetrating radar surveys, and trenching, coring, and radiocarbon dating of valley-bottom sediments were used to map sediment deposits, quantify aggradation rates, and identify processes (in-channel and overbank fluvial deposition, direct hillslope input, beaver pond filling, peat accumulation) creating alluvial fill within the wetland. Results indicate (i) the Lulu City wetland has been aggrading for several millennia, (ii) the aggradation rate of the past one to two centuries is approximately six times higher than long-term pre-settlement averages, (iii) during geomorphically active periods, short-term aggradation rates during the pre-settlement period were probably much higher than the long-term average rate, and (iv) the processes of aggradation during the last two centuries are the same as historic processes of aggradation. Understanding the HRV of aggradation rates and processes can constrain management and restoration scenarios by quantifying the range of disturbance from which a landscape can recover without active restoration.

AB Despite widespread evidence for atmospheric dust deposition prior to the Quaternary, quantitative rate data remains sparse. As dust influences both climate and biological productivity, the absence of quantitative dust data limits the comprehensiveness of models of pre-Quaternary climate and biogeochemical cycles. Here, we propose that inorganic matter contained in coal primarily records atmospheric dust deposition. To test this, we use the average concentration of inorganic matter in Permian coal to map global patterns and deposition rates of atmospheric dust over Pangea. The dust accumulation rate is calculated assuming Permian peat carbon accumulation rates in temperate climates were similar to Holocene rates and accounting for the loss of carbon during coalification. Coal-derived rates vary from 0.02 to 25 g m(-2) year(-1), values that fall within the present-day global range. A well-constrained East-West pattern of dust deposition corresponding to expected palaeoclimate gradients extends across Gondwana with maximum dust deposition rates occurring close to arid regions. A similar pattern is partially defined over the northern hemisphere. Patterns are consistent with the presence of two large global dust plumes centred on the tropics. The spatial patterns of dust deposition were also compared to dust cycle simulations for the Permian made with the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Key differences between the simulations and the coal data are the lack of evidence for an Antarctic dust source, higher than expected dust deposition over N and S China and greater dust deposition rates over Western Gondwana. This new coal-based dust accumulation rate data expands the pre-Neogene quantitative record of atmospheric dust and can help to inform and validate models of global circulation and biogeochemical cycles over the past 350 Myr.

AB Stratigraphically limited intervals from the Lower Eocene Willwood Formation contain laterally extensive carbonaceous shales and ribbon sandstone networks associated with channel avulsion. We present data from one such interval that documents the avulsion sequence. Vertical sections measured along the outcrop of this interval are similar and comprise a basal carbonaceous shale overlain by fine-grained deposits on which weakly developed, hydromorphic paleosols formed. The paleosols enclose and are locally incised by ribbon sandstones, some of which cut down to and partly through the carbonaceous shale. The ribbons have width/thickness ratios between 3 and 13. Some ribbons cluster at a particular stratigraphic level, which, together with paleocurrent trends, suggests that they formed channel networks. Sections are capped by yellow-brown paleosols showing moderate pedogenic development. We suggest that the carbonaceous shales developed in low-lying topogeneous swamps in distal portions of the floodplain far from the trunk channel. Such a location set limits on the sediment that they received. The mudrocks with weakly developed paleosols and associated ribbon sandstones are interpreted as crevasse-splay complexes resulting from avulsion of the trunk river. The ribbon sandstones represent ancient feeder channels of the avulsion complex. The rapid influx of avulsion deposits appears to have been crucial to preserving the organic material, and this study reveals an important and as yet uncharacterized link between trunk channel processes and the accumulation of organic rich deposits in distal alluvial swamps. Similar deposits are found in other stratigraphic units in the Rocky Mountain region, and the development of these and other organic-rich deposits should be reassessed in terms of channel avulsion.

AB This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the heavy metal removal performance by a laboratory scale wetland based on the design of a constructed wetland treating surface runoff. Laboratory scale gravel-substrate subsurface-flow wetlands in a continuous recirculating mode were studied regarding the removal of Cu, Pb and Zn from contaminated water. After establishing the flow characteristics, the wetland was planted with Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris and In's pseudacorus. The wetland system was dosed with increasing concentrations (1, 5 and 10mg/l) of Cu, Pb and Zn. Finally a shock load of metals (concentration 20 mg/l) was introduced to simulate a storm event. In each experiment water samples collected from the outlet at timed intervals were analysed and loadings calculated in order to assess the metal removal efficiency of the system. The removal efficiences and rates for these different doses ranged from 81.7% to 91.8% and 36.6 to 372.7 mg/m(2)/d for Cu, 75.8% to 95.3% and 30.8 to 387 mg/m(2)/d for Pb and 82.8% to 90.4% and 33.6 to 362.1 mg/m(2)/d for Zn respectively. Results for the storm simulation showed that in the time taken for the water level to subside to its original level (just below the substrate surface) at established outlet flow rates, the metal loadings leaving the system remained very low with the wetland system retaining over 99% of the metals. These results indicate the ability of the system to act as an efficient sink for heavy metals. The macrophytes were collected and segregated by species and subsurface tissue type (rhizomes, roots and root tips) and analysed for Cu, Pb and Zn. The results are discussed with respect to the surrounding peat substrate, biomass accumulation and the overall removal performance of the laboratory scale wetland. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

AB Rising sea levels and temperature will be dominant drivers of coastal Everglades' foundation communities (i.e., mangrove forests, seagrass/macroalgae, and coral reefs) by 2060 based on a climate change scenario of +1.5 A degrees C temperature, +1.5 foot (46 cm) in sea level, +/- 10 % in precipitation and 490 ppm CO2. Current mangrove forest soil elevation change in South Florida ranges from 0.9 to 2.5 mm year(-1) and would have to increase twofold to fourfold in order to accommodate a 2060 sea level rise rate. No evidence is available to indicate that coastal mangroves from South Florida and the wider Caribbean can keep pace with a rapid rate of sea level rise. Thus, particles and nutrients from destabilized coastlines could be mobilized and impact benthic habitats of southern Florida. Uncertainties in regional geomorphology and coastal current changes under higher sea levels make this prediction tentative without further research. The 2060 higher temperature scenario would compromise Florida's coral reefs that are already degraded. We suggest that a new paradigm is needed for resource management under climate change that manages coastlines for resilience to marine transgression and promotes active ecosystem management. In the case of the Everglades, greater freshwater flows could maximize mangrove peat accumulation, stabilize coastlines, and limit saltwater intrusion, while specific coral species may require propagation. Further, we suggest that regional climate drivers and oceanographic processes be incorporated into Everglades and South Florida management plans, as they are likely to impact coastal ecosystems, interior freshwater wetlands and urban coastlines over the next few decades.

AB Understanding large-scale drivers of animal breeding densities and demography has a range of important uses, including informing conservation management. Given the threat of climate change, the importance of developing a process-based understanding of variation in animal populations is increased to inform adaptive management. For a climate-change sensitive species, the European Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, we use novel field-collected data on large-scale spatial variation in prey abundance and vegetation structure to understand drivers of breeding abundance and breeding success, and inform potential management responses. The abundance of the key prey, crane flies (Tipulidae), increased with altitude (a surrogate for temperature) and peat depth (a surrogate for soil moisture). Golden plover breeding densities were highest where vegetation was shortest, probably reflecting greater prey accessibility. In contrast, breeding success was not strongly related to vegetation height, but positively correlated with both crane fly abundance and daily minimum temperatures. When combined to model the number of likely successful pairs in any 1 year, the magnitude of vegetation height effect far exceeded that of crane fly abundance. Thus, for golden plover and other shorebirds sharing similar habitats, management to optimize breeding habitat (grazing or burning to promote short vegetation) may differ from management to promote breeding success (drain blocking to increase soil moisture and prey abundance). Adaptive management in the face of climate change should therefore include appropriate vegetation management, as well as maximizing prey abundance. More broadly, as the drivers of breeding density and demographic parameters may differ, we advocate that conservation practitioners collect not just information on species' distributions but also underpinning demographic processes when using science to inform management.

AB The sediment records of three shallow climate-sensitive lakes in equatorial East Africa (Chibwera and Kanyamukali in western Uganda, and Baringo in central Kenya) contain clear lithological evidence of an episode of complete desiccation in the relatively recent past. Quantitative stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture (% sand and coarse organic detritus), the ON ratio of bulk organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to define a common succession of sedimentary units in all three takes. This common stratigraphy includes a basal unit of dry and stiff low-organic clays capped by a horizon of peaty mud or peat, overlain by organic lake sediment. We interpret this stratigraphy to represent an episode of (nearly) complete desiccation of these lake basins. This was followed first by an early phase of modest lake refilling, during which time extensive littoral and submerged vegetation developed, producing peaty lake deposits. Mostly higher lake levels later on resulted in deposition of fine-grained lake muds. Using Pb-210 and Cs-137 activity profiles combined with four AMS C-14 dates on single terrestrial plant macrofossils or multiple charred grass particles indicate that in all three lakes the episode of most recent complete desiccation occurred in the late 18th and early 19th century. These results add to an accumulating body of palaeoenvironmental data revealing a prolonged period of extreme drought in equatorial East Africa about 200 years ago, also documented in the cultural history of the African Great Lakes region. Given the geographical spread of the study lakes across the East African plateau, these results indicate that the climatic anomaly of reduced rainfall responsible for this drought was at least sub-continental in scale.

AB In March 2001, simultaneously by trapping and chemical baits an attempt was done to eradicate the Javanese Mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), the Ship Rat (Rattus rattus) and the House Mouse (Mus domesticus) from Fajou Island (104 ha of mangrove on peat, 11 ha of dry vegetation on sandy soil), part of a natural reserve managed by the Guadeloupe National Park (French West Indies). A control in December 2001 and January 2002 revealed the failure of the Ship Rat eradication. A second eradication operation was undertaken in March 2002 in order to test hypotheses explaining this failure and put right some technical defects. Its result will not be available before 2003. However it allowed to conclude to the success of the Mongoose eradication by trapping alone but the potential success of the House Mouse eradication by trapping and poisoning in March 2001 could not yet be properly evaluated. The spatial distribution of trapping specimens of the target species showed that statistically they concentrate on the dry part of the island. The Mongoose eradication and the sharp decline of the Ship Rat population induced the disappearance of the destruction of Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nests and the colonization of the dry part of the island by the Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris), strictly located in the mangrove before. The abundance indices of the Clapper Rail and the terrestrial crab Cardisoma guanhumi increased. To be tested, the eventual relationships between these increases and the drop of the alien mammal populations require more data. Such operations combining research and management have to be planned in the long term with good logistical, technical and qualified human supports. All these conditions were gathered here because of the protected area status of the Fajou Island.

AB Multi-compartment soil carbon (C) simulation models such as RothC are widely used for predicting changes in C stocks of arable soils. However, rigorous routines for establishing entry pools that account for the diversity of exogenous organic matter (EOM) applied to croplands are still lacking. We obtained data on changes in soil C stocks after repeated applications of EOM from four long-term experiments (LTEs): Askov K2 (Denmark, 31 yrs), Qualiagro (France, 11 yrs), SERAIL (France, 14 yrs) and Ultuna (Sweden, 52 yrs). The adjustment of the partition coefficients of total organic C in EOM (EOM-TOC) into the labile, resistant and humified entry pools of RothC (f(DPM), f(RPM), f(HUM), respectively) provided a successful fit to the accumulation of EOM-derived C in the LTE soils. Equations estimating the EOM partition coefficients in the RothC model were based on an indicator (I-Roc) of the EOM-TOC potentially retained in soil. I-Roc was derived from the C found in the soluble, lignin + cutin-like and cellulose-like Van Soest fractions and the proportion of EOM-TOC mineralized during 3 days of incubation. Using the EOM partition coefficients derived from these laboratory analyses resulted in RothC simulations with only slightly larger errors than simulations based on partition coefficients fitted from LTE soil data, except for EOMs that caused very large accumulations of C in soil (e.g. peat) possibly due to factors not accounted for in the RothC model, such as change in soil pH. The proposed partitioning of EOM-TOC allows the potential soil C storage after EOM applications to be predicted regardless of field location and specific composition of EOMs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Agricultural soils offer multiple soil functions, which contribute to a range of ecosystem services, and the demand for the primary production function is expected to increase with a growing world population. Other key functions on agricultural land have been identified as water purification, carbon sequestration, habitat biodiversity and nutrient cycling, which all need to be considered for sustainable intensification. All soils perform all functions simultaneously, but the variation in the capacity of soils to supply these functions is reviewed in terms of defined land use types (arable, bio-energy, broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, managed grassland, other grassland and Natura 2000) and extended to include the influence of soil drainage characteristics (well, moderately/imperfect, poor and peat). This latter consideration is particularly important in the European Atlantic pedo-climatic zone; the spatial scale of this review. This review develops a conceptual framework on the multi-functional capacity of soils, termed Functional Land Management, to facilitate the effective design and assessment of agri-environmental policies. A final functional soil matrix is presented as an approach to show the consequential changes to the capacity of the five soil functions associated with land use change on soils with contrasting drainage characteristics. Where policy prioritises the enhancement of particular functions, the matrix indicates the potential trade-offs for individual functions or the overall impact on the multi-functional capacity of soil. The conceptual framework is also applied by land use area in a case study, using the Republic of Ireland as an example, to show how the principle of multi-functional land use planning can be readily implemented.

AB Trenches excavated across the Superstition Mountain fault in the Imperial Valley, California, have exposed evidence for four prehistorical earthquakes preserved in displaced lacustrine stratigraphy associated with ancient Lake Cahuilla. The presence of shoreline peat accumulations along with abundant detrital charcoal allows for high-precision age determination of some stratigraphic units, thereby providing constraints on the timing of three of the paleoearthquakes. These three events occurred within a 480- to 820-year interval during the past 1200 years. The most recent earthquake (event 1) occurred during a fluvial phase of deposition between A.D. 1440-1637, immediately prior to the inundation of the Cahuilla basin at about A.D. 1480 and 1660. A channel margin was offset 2.2 +0.4/-0.15 m in this rupture, suggesting an earthquake with a magnitude greater than or equal to 7. The penultimate event (event 2) also occurred during fluvial deposition after A.D. 1280 but before another lakestand at A.D. 1440-1640. Lateral slip could not be resolved for event 2. However, based on juxtaposition of dissimilar units and the amount of deformation produced by this event, it is presumed that this was also a large earthquake. The timing of event 3 is constrained to have occurred between about A.D. 820 and 1280. This event is represented by several fractures and small displacements that rupture up to a distinct stratigraphic level or event horizon. Slip was not resolved for this event. Finally, the timing of event 4 is very poorly constrained to between A.D. 964 and 4670 B.C. Undoubtedly, many events may have occurred during this period. Notably, the past three earthquakes occurred within a period of less than 820 years, and it has been over 350 years since the last earthquake.

AB 1. Multiscale codependence analysis (MCA) quantifies the joint spatial distribution of a pair of variables in order to provide a spatially explicit assessment of their relationships to one another. For the sake of simplicity, the original definition of MCA only considered a single response variable (e.g. a single species). However, that definition would limit the application of MCA when many response variables are studied jointly, for example when one wants to study the effect of the environment on the spatial organisation of a multi-species community in an explicit manner.
   2. In the present paper, we generalise MCA to multiple response variables. We conducted a simulation study to assess the statistical properties (i.e. type I error rate and statistical power) of multivariate MCA (mMCA) and found that it had honest type I error rate and sufficient statistical power for practical purposes, even with modest sample sizes. We also exemplified mMCA by applying it to two ecological datasets.
   3. The simulation study confirmed the adequacy of mMCA from a statistical standpoint: it has honest type I error rates and sufficient power to be useful in practice. Using mMCA, we were able to detect variation in fish community structure along the Doubs River (in France), which was associated with large spatial structures in the variation of physical and chemical variables related to water quality. Also, mMCA usefully described the spatial variation of an Oribatid mite community structure associated with a gradient of water content superimposed on various smaller-scale spatial features associated with vegetation cover in the peat blanket surrounding Lac Geai (in Quebec, Canada).
   4. In addition to demonstrating the soundness of mMCA in theory and practice, we further discuss the strengths and assumptions of mMCA and describe other potential scenarios where it would be helpful to biologists interested in assessing influence of environmental conditions on community structure in a spatially explicit way.

AB Hydropneumatic root separation from field soil collects organic non-root residues. This study compares manual cleaning to electronic cleaning with image analysis of carrot roots from field experiments. Washed and stained very fine roots of carrots (diameter 0.15 mm) were video-recorded by using a high-resolution robotic camera system. Fibrous root lengths and widths of roots from samples grown in fine sand (n = 160) and organic soils (n = 150) were detemined by automated image processing of video-recorded images. During video-recording, some non-root residue remained with the extracted fine roots, especially in samples from organic soils, where residue materials comprised partially decomposed straw and peat. In computerized image analysis, materials with length-to-width ratios of <= 3:1 were deemed non-root debris and discarded electronically. The 3:1 length-to-width ratio was chosen for distinguishing long thin root images from short organic residues. Results show that more non-root residue was recovered by image analysis than was recorded by dry weight estimation after manual cleaning. Length, surface area and volume averaged 15%,18% and 24% of non-root residue in the manually fully cleaned samples (residue estimation 0%, i.e. no visible debris recorded visually) of fine sand soils (n = 80). Length, surface area, and volume averaged 20%, 25% and 33% (r = 0.55, p < 0.0001), respectively, of non-root residue in the organic soil samples with residues < 10% (g residues/g roots and residues) (n = 71). Both root and residue densities were higher at soil depths of 0-25 cm than in deeper subsoils, where the percentages of discarded residue were highest. Electronic non-root separation effectively eliminated short and partially decomposed organic material that was hardly visible or otherwise difficult and time-consuming to remove manually.

AB Solutions containing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from a depressional wetland that receives agricultural drainage water were incubated in pure quartz sands with FeCl3 added as the main electron acceptor. The effects of three factors (the water, DOC, and Fe contents) on the CO2 and CH4 production rates, integrated cumulative C emissions and Fe-OC co-precipitation were studied. The results showed that CO2 production during the DOC mineralization process was facilitated by Fe(III) reduction at the expense of CH4 production. Additionally, the cumulative CO2 emissions determined by integrating the temporal curves of CO2 production were negatively correlated with those of CH4 (r = -0.48, p < 0.01). Extremely large ratios of the CO2:CH4 production rate (13,762 and 44,885 under two soil water conditions: saturation and flood conditions of twice the saturation level) were observed. These ratios were likely caused by simultaneous anaerobic fermentation, microbial respiration, and methanogenesis suppression triggered by iron reduction. The effects of exogenous Fe(III) inputs on total C emissions (as the sum of integrated cumulative CO2 and CH4) were only dependent on soil water conditions during the initial period of the experiment, and flooded conditions increased total C emissions by as much as double. Increased ratios of Fe inputs to C contents were found to proportionally increase the total C emissions (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.01). Under saturated conditions, the co-precipitation of Fe-OC complexes prevented the remainder of the DOC from undergoing mineralization. In terms of DOC, we concluded that wetland saturation with introduced Fe(III) can reduce total C emissions from anaerobic respiration and promote C sequestration.

AB A century of hydrologic modification has altered the physical and biological drivers of landscape processes in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Restoring the ridge-slough patterned landscape, a dominant feature of the historical system, is a priority but requires an understanding of pattern genesis and degradation mechanisms. Physical experiments to evaluate alternative pattern formation mechanisms are limited by the long timescales of peat accumulation and loss, necessitating model-based comparisons, where support for a particular mechanism is based on model replication of extant patterning and trajectories of degradation. However, multiple mechanisms yield a central feature of ridge-slough patterning (patch elongation in the direction of historical flow), limiting the utility of that characteristic for discriminating among alternatives. Using data from vegetation maps, we investigated the statistical features of ridge-slough spatial patterning (ridge density, patch perimeter, elongation, patch size distributions, and spatial periodicity) to establish more rigorous criteria for evaluating model performance and to inform controls on pattern variation across the contemporary system. Mean water depth explained significant variation in ridge density, total perimeter, and length : width ratios, illustrating an important pattern response to existing hydrologic gradients. Two independent analyses (2-D periodograms and patch size distributions) provide strong evidence against regular patterning, with the landscape exhibiting neither a characteristic wavelength nor a characteristic patch size, both of which are expected under conditions that produce regular patterns. Rather, landscape properties suggest robust scale-free patterning, indicating genesis from the coupled effects of local facilitation and a global negative feedback operating uniformly at the landscape scale. Critically, this challenges widespread invocation of scale-dependent negative feedbacks for explaining ridge-slough pattern origins. These results help discern among genesis mechanisms and provide an improved statistical description of the landscape that can be used to compare among model outputs, as well as to assess the success of future restoration projects.

AB Thermokarst results from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost and alters the biogeochemical cycling in the Arctic by reworking soil material and redistributing soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) along uplands, hillslopes, and lowlands. Understanding the impact of this redistribution is key to better estimating the storage of SOC in permafrost terrains. However, there are insufficient studies quantifying long-term impacts of thaw processes on the distribution of SOC and TN along hillslopes. We address this issue by providing estimates of SOC and TN stocks along the hillslopes of three valleys located on Herschel Island (Yukon, Canada), and by discussing the impact of hillslope thermokarst on the variability of SOC and TN stocks. We found that the average SOC and TN 0-100 cm stocks in the valleys were 26.4 +/- 8.9 kg C m(-2) and 2.1 +/- 0.6 kg N m(-2). We highlight the strong variability in the soils physical and geochemical properties within hillslope positions. High SOC stocks were found at the summits, essentially due to burial of organic matter by cryoturbation, and at the toeslopes due to impeded drainage which favored peat formation and SOC accumulation. The average carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the valleys was 12.9, ranging from 9.7 to 18.9, and was significantly higher at the summits compared to the backslopes and footslopes (p < 0.05), suggesting a degradation of SOC downhill. Carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks were significantly lower on 16% of the sites that were previously affected by hillslope thermokarst (p < 0.05). Our results showed that lateral redistribution of SOC and TN due to hillslope thermokarst has a strong impact on the SOC storage in ice-rich permafrost terrains.

AB Sorption of humic acid (HA) oil mineral surfaces has a profound interest regarding the fate of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) and carbon sequestration in soils. The objective of our study is to determine the fractionation behavior of HA upon sorption oil mineral surfaces with varying surface properties. HA was coated sequentially oil kaolinite (1:1 clay), montmorillonite (2:1 clay), and goethite (iron oxide) for four times. The unadsorbed HA fractions were characterized by elemental analysis, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT), and solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The mineral-HA complexes were characterized by DRIFT. Polarity index [(N+O)/C] revealed higher polarity of the unadsorbed HA fractions after coating oil kaolinite, reflecting that relatively higher polarity fractions of HA remain unadsorbed. Sorption of aliphatic alcohol fraction along with carbohydrate was prominent on kaolinite surface. DRIFT results of the unadsorbed HA fractions indicated more sorption of aliphatic moieties oil both kaolinite and montmorillonite. DRIFT results of the unadsorbed HA fractions after sorption oil kaolinite and goethite showed the sorption of the proteinaccous fractions of HA. The HA fractions obtained after coating on goethite showed significant sorption of carboxylic moieties. The results mentioned above comply reasonably well with the DRIFT spectra of the mineral-HA complexes. 13C NMR results showed higher sorption of anomeric C oil kaolinite surface. Higher sorption of paraffinic fraction was observed oil montmorillonite. NMR data inferred the sorption of carboxylic moieties on goethite surface. Overall, this study showed that aliphatic moieties of HA preferentially sorbed oil kaolinite and montmorillonite. while carboxylic functional groups play a significant role in sorption of HA oil goethite. The sorbed fractions of HA may modify the mineral surface properties, and thus, the interaction with organic contaminants.

AB Temporal compositional conservatism of late Middle Pennsylvanian wetland vegetation and persistence of its dominance-diversity structure through time spans of millions of years have been documented from many places in North America and Europe. This conservatism occurs within the context of glacial-interglacial fluctuations that force spatial migration of that vegetation or its restriction to refugia during periodic sea-level changes on the craton. Although known from long temporal sequences, there have been few studies of spatial variability in these wetland floras over more than relatively small distances, generally much less than a km. Here we report a late Middle Pennsylvanian (Desmoinesian) flora from above the Hemyetta Coal, near Okmulgee, Oldahoma, in the American Midcontinent. This flora is exactly correlative with the Mazon Creek flora, above the Colchester Coal of northern Illinois; the Colchester Coal and its equivalents may have been the largest, contiguous peat accumulating swamp of the Pennsylvanian. Okmulgee and Mazon Creek are separated by 1100 km, but the depositional context of the two floras is the same and they can be considered isotaphonomic. Though a much smaller sample, and thus of lower overall biodiversity, the known composition of and dominance-diversity structure of the Okmulgee flora is convergent with Mazon Creek. The overwhelmingly dominant elements of both the Okmulgee and Mazon Creek floras are pecopterid tree-fern foliage mostly attributable to Lobatopteris vestita (Lesquereux) Wagner and the pteridosperm Macroneuropteris scheuchzeri (Hoffman) Cleal, Shute and Zodrow, Both of these floras likely represent wetlands that were being drowned during the early phases of sea-level rise associated with ice melting. Each sampled a broad area, and a variety of subhabitats that fringed the Pennsylvanian coastline. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The need to minimise the environmental impacts of production and consumption are increasingly being recognised by governments, industry and the general public. Biodegradable waste composting is able to make a contribution to this need, not only in reducing the biodegradable waste being landfilled, but also lessening the horticultural industry's and gardeners' reliance on peat based compost, whilst the application of compost to land has the potential to enhance soil and biomass carbon sequestration.
   As a result of the consequent interest in the potential environmental benefits accruing from composting, there have been a number of studies attempting to measure the gains from composting the biodegradable fraction of commercial and household waste streams. However, a review of such studies reveal that there is much scope for improvement in defining the product process and in data accuracy, as well as the technical framework employed to construct the life cycle inventory stage. These shortcomings can invalidate life cycle impact assessments, and at worst lead to invalid management and operational decisions based on their findings.
   This study addresses the inventory process deficiencies, and issues of data reliability and completeness, contained in much of the published compost production life cycle assessment literature. It provides a comprehensive cradle to grave inventory of the soil conditioning compost produced by a social enterprise company in Manchester, England. Based on the specifics of the system model, it provides the basis for valid comparisons of the environmental benefits of producing soil-conditioning compost from biodegradable municipal waste with other composting and waste management options. Overall energy use has been calculated as 1034 MJ/tonne of compost, equivalent to 633 MJ/tonne for processing the wet feedstock, with the processing inventory stage accounting for 57%.

AB The Serpukhovian (Namurian A) stratigraphy of the Ostrava Formation, Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Czech Republic, consists of coal-bearing paralic sediments underlain by marine deposits in a cyclothemic nature similar to those in the Pennsylvanian of Euramerica. The thickness of the formation exceeds 3000 m, in which >170 coals are identified in a foreland basin setting. Fifty-five genetic cycles are identified in the present study, using transgressional erosional surfaces as lower and upper boundaries. Terrestrial plant-macrofossil assemblages are preserved within each cycle, mostly associated with coals, and these represent a sampling of the coastal plain vegetation. New high-precision isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry U-Pb ages on zircons from tonsteins of two coals provide chronometric constraints for the Serpukhovian. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean clustering and Bayesian statistical classification group macrofloral assemblages into four distinct stratigraphic clusters, with assemblages persisting for <18 cycles before compositional change. Cycle duration, based on Ludmila (328.84+/-0.16 Ma) and Karel (328.01+/-0.08 Mal tonsteins, overlaps the short-period (100 kyr) eccentricity cycle at the 95% confidence interval. These dates push the beginning of the Serpukhovian several million years deeper in time. An estimate for the Visean-Serpukhovian boundary is proposed at similar to 330 Ma. Late Mississippian wetland ecosystems persisted for >1.8 million years before regional perturbation, extirpation, or extinction of taxa occurred. Significant changes in the composition of macrofloral clusters occur across major marine intervals. These results accord with other estimates of Carboniferous tropical wetland community persistence. Hence, vegetational persistence was characteristic of peat-accumulating and mineral-substrate wetland ecosystems beginning in the Late Mississippian, when there is evidence for the first appearance of eustatically controlled cyclothems during the buildup of Gondwanan glaciation.

AB The basement rocks of southern Sweden were deeply weathered in Late Triassic through Cretaceous times, and possibly even earlier. Sub-Mesozoic saprolites formed, presumably due to long-term warmth and humidity, in conjunction with decomposition of abundant organic matter and subsequent infiltration of acidic water. The upper parts of the weathering profiles were subjected to intense leaching and kaolinitisation whereas the less evolved deep weathering front is enriched in smectite. Thus. any erosion prior to full regolith development, or extraordinary deep erosion, released less developed, smectite-rich weathering material to the Late Triassic-Jurassic receiving basins.
   Mesozoic sedimentary successions in Southern Sweden show high detrital smectite and/or kaolinite contents, moderate illite contents and low chlorite contents, compatible with expected mid-latitude warm equable greenhouse conditions. Norian and older Triassic haematite-cemented continental arkoses and smectite-dominated clays (smectitemuch greater thankaolinite) were clearly formed in and settings. Front the Rhaetian and throughout the Jurassic, humid onshore conditions sustained abundant plant and peat accumulation, early diagenetic meteoric flushing, and intense chemical weathering. Kaolinite is therefore a dominating detrital clay mineral in these sedimentary successions (kaolinite = illitemuch greater thanchlorite and smectite (I/S)).
   Minor quantitative variations in clay mineralogy within the "humid climate" Rhaetian-Jurassic sedimentary successions are difficult to interpret. In deltaic coal-bearing successions, the detrital clay mineral composition is conspicuously constant (kaolinite = illite-chlorite), possibly due to post-depositional clay mineral transformation. Conversely, in shallow marine deposits, some quantitative variation is notable (kaolinite approximate to illite>variable smectitemuch greater thanchlorite). This may reflect that the original detrital composition was better preserved in shallow marine settings. Smectitic clay minerals associated with gypsum and caliche nodules ambiguously indicate increased aridity towards the end of the Jurassic. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Afforestation has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the often high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils with high organic matter content. However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes after afforestation can be considerable, depending predominantly on site drainage and nutrient availability. Studies on the full GHG budget of afforested organic soils are scarce and hampered by the uncertainties associated with methodology. In this study we determined the GHG budget of a spruce-dominated forest on a drained organic soil with an agricultural history. Two different approaches for determining the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were applied, for the year 2008, one direct (eddy covariance) and the other indirect (analyzing the different components of the GHG budget), so that uncertainties in each method could be evaluated. The annual tree production in 2008 was 8.3 +/- 3.9 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) due to the high levels of soil nutrients, the favorable climatic conditions and the fact that the forest was probably in its phase of maximum C assimilation or shortly past it. The N2O fluxes were determined by the closed-chamber technique and amounted to 0.9 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). According to the direct measurements from the eddy covariance technique, the site acts as a minor GHG sink of -1.2 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). This contrasts with the NEE estimate derived from the indirect approach which suggests that the site is a net GHG emitter of 0.6 +/- 4.5 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). Irrespective of the approach applied, the soil CO2 effluxes counter large amounts of the C sequestration by trees. Due to accumulated uncertainties involved in the indirect approach, the direct approach is considered the more reliable tool. As the rate of C sequestration will likely decrease with forest age, the site will probably become a GHG source once again as the trees do not compensate for the soil C and N losses. Also forests in younger age stages have been shown to have lower C assimilation rates; thus, the overall GHG sink potential of this afforested nutrient-rich organic soil is probably limited to the short period of maximum C assimilation.

AB China's Zoige Plateau, located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, has the largest alpine peat wetland in the world. However, little is known about how the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock of these wetlands has been influenced by human activities. In this study, we quantified the changes in the SOC stock in two counties (i.e., Hongyuan and Ruoergai) in the Zoige Plateau wetlands between 1980 and 2010 in response to progressive drainage of the wetlands and increased grazing intensity using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. The results indicate that wetlands accumulate large amounts of SOC (>300 t C ha(-1)) in the upper 1 m of the soil in the study area. Wetland soils sequestered similar to 0.25 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) despite the degradation that has occurred due to drainage and grazing. Drainage was one of the main driving factors for SOC loss in the wetlands. Conversion of wetlands to grassland via drainage since 1980 led to a loss of approximately 4 t C ha(-1) from the SOC stock. On the other hand, grazing might have positive impact on root biomass accumulation, thus enhancing the SOC stock. As estimated by EPIC, more intensive grazing slightly increased the SOC stock. However, grazing is also a reason why wetlands were drained with all the negative effects on the SOC pool. The potential SOC sequestration of intensive grazing was offseted by the negative effect of drainage. The outcomes suggest not only to limit drainage and restore wetland, but also to control grazing which will in turn decrease drainages to sustain the ecosystem service of carbon sequestration provided by the Zoige wetlands.

SO JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Wood energy; Green house gases; Forest sector; Carbon debt
ID BIOMASS EQUATIONS; FOREST; MODEL
AB Forests play an important role in mitigating climate change. Forests can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and provide biomass, which can be used to substitute for fossil fuels or energy-intensive materials. International climate policies favor the use of wood to substitute for fossil fuels rather than using forests as carbon sink. We examine the trade off between sequestering carbon in forests and substituting wood for fossil fuels in Finland. For Finland to meet its EU targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, a considerable increase in the use of wood for energy is necessary. We compare scenarios in which the wood energy targets are fully or partially met to a reference case where policies favoring wood based energy production are removed. Three models are used to project fossil fuel substitution and changes in forest carbon sinks in the scenarios through 2035.
   Finnish forests are a growing carbon sink in all scenarios. However, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be higher in the medium term if Finland achieves its current wood energy targets than if the use of energy wood stagnates or decreases. The volume of GHG emissions avoided by replacing coal, peat and fossil diesel with wood is outweighed by the loss in carbon sequestered in forests due to increased biomass removals. Therefore, the current wood energy targets seem excessive and harmful to the climate. In particular, biodiesel production has a significant, negative impact on net emissions in the period considered. However, we did not consider risks such as forest fires, wind damage and diseases, which might weaken the sequestration policy. The potential albedo impacts of harvesting the forests were not considered either. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

AB This paper investigates the mineralogical and geochemical compositions of the Pennsylvanian coal in the Hailiushu Mine, Daqingshan Coalfield, neighboring previously-reported Al (Ga, REE) ore deposits (including the Adaohai Mine in the same coalfield and deposits in the Jungar Coalfield), using optical microscopy, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The mineralogical and geochemical compositions in the coal were primarily controlled by the sediment-source region during peat accumulation, and by epigenetic acid hydrothermal solutions. The Hailiushu coal was deposited in a sub-depression (intermontane basin) in the inner part of the orogenic belt, with a sediment-source region composed mainly of Cambrian-Ordovician strata and Archaean metamorphic rocks. The minerals in the coal from the Hailiushu Mine dominantly consist of kaolinite, with minor amounts of quartz, sulfide and selenide minerals (including chalcopyrite, selenian galena, galena, sphalerite, clausthalite, and siegenite), aluminophosphates, and rhabdophane. The coal is enriched in SiO2 (17.05% on average), TiO2 (0.60%), Al2O3 (13.71%), Zr (289 mu g/g), Hf (7.09 mu g/g), and to a lesser extent, F, Sc, V, Cu, Ga, Se, Y, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, La, Ta, W, Hg, Pb, Bi, and Th. Titanium largely occurs in the kaolinite. Elements such as Cu, Se, Sn, Hg, Pb, and Bi in the coal mainly occur in sulfide and/or selenide minerals. Zirconium, Hf, and Nb were largely derived from the sediment source region. The substitution of Ti for Al in kaolinite, the corrosion of previously-formed zircon, anatase, and quartz, and the enrichment of middle rare earth elements in the coal were caused by the epigenetic acid hydrothermal solutions.

AB The importance of mycorrhizas in heathland and boreal forest biomes, which together cover much of the landmass of the Northern Hemisphere and store most of the global stocks of carbon, is reviewed. The taxonomic affinities of the organisms forming these symbiotic partnerships are assessed, and the distinctive structural features of the ericoid mycorrhizas of heathland dwarf shrubs and the ectomycorrhizas of boreal forest trees are described. It is stressed that neither in terms of the geographical distribution of the plants nor in terms of the occurrence of their characteristic mycorrhizas in the soil profile should these biomes be considered to be mutually exclusive. What unites them is their apparent affinity for acidic organic soils of inherently low accessibility of the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These properties relate directly to the nature of the nutrient-poor recalcitrant litter produced by their host plants and through positive-feedback mechanisms that are reinforced by selective removal of labile nutrients by the mycorrhizas. We suggest that coevolution of these plant litter traits with mycorrhizal associations that are adapted to them has been one of the defining features of these ecosystems. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi have biochemical and physiological attributes that make them highly efficient at scavenging for organic sources of N and P in surface soil horizons. In so doing, they restrict supplies of these elements to the decomposer communities. Case studies involving exploitation of N and P in defined organic substrates are described. In both biomes the dominant plants depend upon the abilities of their fungal partners to recover nutrients, so the symbioses control nutrient cycles, productivity, species composition, and functioning of these ecosystems. It is in this context that the fungal symbionts are here considered to be drivers of nutritional processes in their respective biomes. Through their influences upon the quality of carbon residues mycorrhizal fungi must also affect the sink-source balance for this key element in soil. There is an urgent need for the evaluation of the relative contributions of symbiotic and saprotrophic components of the microflora to the processes of carbon storage and cycling in these biomes, particularly in the context of global climate change and impacts of anthropogenic pollutant N deposition.

DE Nutrients leaching; Crops; Soil; Ground water; Surface water
AB The purpose of our work was to establish features of formation of filtration processes and to define prevention measures towards the nutrients leaching from drainage soils into the ground waters. Our researches were carried out on typical drained floodplain soils of Panfil Research Station, Institute of Agriculture of National Academy of Agrarian Science (floodplain of Supiy River, Yahotyn district, Kiev region, Ukraine) in 2016-2018. The arable layer of peatlands had high level of decomposition (50-60%) with gross nitrogen contamination of 1.9%, phosphorus - 0.4, potassium - 0.17 and sodium - 7.1%, which is typical for the forest-steppe zone. The drying and humidifying system was satisfactory. Research on nutrient washing into ground water was carried out on various agricultural lands, during and out of crop rotation. iltration water was taken from water measurement wells, from drainage canals and directly from the Supi River twice a year (in autumn and spring) on sites with different fertilisation schemes. We found that in the fields with perennial grasses without mineral fertilizers 4.9 mg L-1 of NO3 was washed out, 11.7 mg of K2O, and 130 mg of CaO; on the fertilized fields it were 4. 2-19.4, 12.8-22.2, and 122-148 mg L-1 respectively; on the annual crop fields without the fertilizers a total of 9.2 mg L-1 of NO3, 16.8 of K2O and 134 mg L-1 of CaO were leached, whereas it were 14.3-19.6, 21.2-34.4 and 138-161 mg L(-1)on the annual crop fertilized fields in the humid years. We observed a similar dependence in the dry 2018 year. Our observations of nutrient wash-out showed that on the fields with perennial grasses and annual crops (winter rye and corn) there were much more wash-out of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen, mobile phosphorus and potassium in autumn compared to spring for average from 2016-2018. In addition, the autumn drainage water contains more carbonates and had higher content of Na2O (up to 48.7-51.3 mg L-1). We did not register the dependence of nutrient washing into the ground water on the cultivated crops. At the same time, a significant amount of calcium and magnesium was washed out from perennial and annual crop fields in spring.

AB Rates of input, accumulation, and turnover of C differ markedly within soil profiles and in soils with different drainage in the BOREAS northern study area. Soil C storage increases from similar to 3 kg C m(-2) in well-drained, sandy soils to greater than 100 kg C m(-2) in wetlands. Two modes of C accumulation were observed in upland soil profiles. Large annual C inputs (0.06-0.1 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) and slow decomposition (turnover times of 6-250 years) lead to rapid C accumulation in regrowing surface moss and detrital layers following fire. Deep organic layers that have accumulated over the millennia since the initiation of soil development, and are located below the most recent charred horizon, show slower rates of input (0.015-0.03 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) and turnover (100-1600 years) and accumulate C about 10 times slower than surface detrital layers. Rates of C input to soils derived from C and C-14 data were in accord with net primary production estimates, with highest rates of input (0.14-0.6 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) in wetlands. Turnover times for C in surface detrital layers were 6-15 years for well-drained sand soils that showed highest soil temperatures in summer, 30-40 years for wetlands, and 36-250 years for uplands with thick moss cover and black spruce trees. Long (>100 years) turnover times in upland black spruce/clay soils most likely reflect the influence of woody debris incorporated into detrital layers. Turnover times for deep organic and mineral layer C were controlled by drainage, with fastest turnover (80-130 years) in well-drained sand soils and slowest turnover (>3000 years) in wetlands. Total C accumulation rates, which account for C losses from both deep organic and surface detrital layers, are close to zero for sand/jack pine soils, 0.003-0.01 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for moderately to poorly drained sites in mature forest stands, and 0.03 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for a productive fen. Decomposition of organic matter more than several decades old accounts for 9-22% of total heterotrophic respiration at these sites. The rates of C accumulation derived here are decadal averages for specific stands and will vary as stands age or undergo disturbance. Extrapolation to larger regions and longer timescales, where burning offsets C gains in moss layers, will yield smaller rates of C storage.

AB Vast areas on the Tibetan Plateau are covered by alpine sedge mats consisting of different species of the genus Kobresia. These mats have topsoil horizons rich in rhizogenic organic matter which creates turfs. As the turfs have recently been affected by a complex destruction process, knowledge concerning their soil properties, age and pedogenesis are needed. In the core area of Kobresia pygmaea mats around Nagqu (central Tibetan Plateau, c. 4500 m a.s.l.), four profiles were subjected to pedological, paleobotanical and geochronological analyses concentrating on soil properties, phytogenic composition and dating of the turf. The turf of both dry K. pygmaea sites and wet Kobresia schoenoides sites is characterised by an enrichment of living (dominant portion) and dead root biomass. In terms of humus forms, K. pygmaea turfs can be classified as Rhizomulls mainly developed from Cambisols. Wet-site K. schoenoides turfs, however, can be classified as Rhizo-Hydromors developed from Histic Gleysols. At the dry sites studied, the turnover of soil organic matter is controlled by a non-permafrost cold thermal regime. Below-ground remains from sedges are the most frequent macroremains in the turf. Only a few pollen types of vascular plants occur, predominantly originating from sedges and grasses. Large amounts of microscopic charcoal (indeterminate) are present. Macroremains and pollen extracted from the turfs predominantly have negative AMS C-14 ages, giving evidence of a modem turf genesis. Bulk-soil datings from the lowermost part of the turfs have a Late Holocene age comprising the last c. 2000 years. The development of K. pygmaea turfs was most probably caused by an anthropo(zoo)-genetically initiated growth of sedge mats replacing former grass-dominated vegetation ('steppe'). Thus the turfs result from the transformation of pre-existing topsoils comprising a secondary penetration and accumulation of roots. K. schoenoides turfs, however, are characterised by a combined process of peat formation and penetration/accumulation of roots probably representing a (quasi) natural wetland vegetation.

AB Background and Aims Species of the Nepenthaceae family are under-represented in studies of leaf traits and the consequent view of mineral nutrition and limitation in carnivorous plants. This study is aimed to complement existing data on leaf traits of carnivorous plants.
   Methods Physico-chemical properties, including construction costs (CC), of the assimilatory organs (leaf and pitcher) of a guild of lowland Nepenthes species inhabiting heath and/or peat swamp forests of Brunei, Northern Borneo were determined.
   Key Results Stoichiometry analyses indicate that Nepenthes species are nitrogen limited. Most traits vary appreciably across species, but greater variations exist between the assimilatory organs. Organ mass per unit area, dry matter tissue concentration (density), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon, heat of combustion (H(c)) and CC values were higher in the leaf relative to the pitcher, while organ thickness, potassium (K) and ash showed the opposite trend. Cross-species correlations indicate that joint rather than individual consideration of the leaf and the pitcher give better predictive relationships between variables, signalling tight coupling and functional interdependence of the two assimilatory organs. Across species, mass-based CC did not vary with N or P, but increases significantly with tissue density, carbon and H(c), and decreases with K and ash contents. Area-based CC gave the same trends (though weaker in strength) in addition to a significant positive correlation with tissue mass per unit area.
   Conclusions The lower CC value for the pitcher is in agreement with the concept of low marginal cost for carnivory relative to conventional autotrophy. The poor explanatory power of N, P or N : P ratio with CC suggests that factors other than production of expensive photosynthetic machinery (which calls for a high N input), including concentrations of lignin, wax/lipids or osmoregulatory ions like K(+), may give a better explanation of the CC variation across Nepenthes species.

AB Permafrost degradation influences the morphology, biogeochemical cycling and hydrology of Arctic landscapes over a range of time scales. To reconstruct temporal patterns of early to late Holocene permafrost and thermokarst dynamics, site-specific palaeo-records are needed. Here we present a multi-proxy study of a 350-cm-long permafrost core from a drained lake basin on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska, revealing Lateglacial toHolocene thermokarst lake dynamics in a central location of Beringia. Use of radiocarbon dating, micropalaeontology (ostracods and testaceans), sedimentology (grain-size analyses, magnetic susceptibility, tephra analyses), geochemistry (total nitrogen and carbon, total organic carbon, C-13(org)) and stable water isotopes (O-18, D, dexcess) of ground ice allowed the reconstruction of several distinct thermokarst lake phases. These include a pre-lacustrine environment at the base of the core characterized by the Devil Mountain Maar tephra (22800 +/- 280cal. a BP, Unit A), which has vertically subsided in places due to subsequent development of a deep thermokarst lake that initiated around 11800cal. a BP (Unit B). At about 9000cal. a BP this lake transitioned from a stable depositional environment to a very dynamic lake system (Unit C) characterized by fluctuating lake levels, potentially intermediate wetland development, and expansion and erosion of shore deposits. Complete drainage of this lake occurred at 1060cal. a BP, including post-drainage sediment freezing from the top down to 154cm and gradual accumulation of terrestrial peat (Unit D), as well as uniform upward talik refreezing. This core-based reconstruction of multiple thermokarst lake generations since 11800cal. a BP improves our understanding of the temporal scales of thermokarst lake development from initiation to drainage, demonstrates complex landscape evolution in the ice-rich permafrost regions of Central Beringia during the Lateglacial and Holocene, and enhances our understanding of biogeochemical cycles in thermokarst-affected regions of the Arctic.

Long Scarlet) as well as the soil quality of a hardsetting Chromosol (Alfisol). Four rates of biochar (0, 10, 25, and 50 t/ha), with and without nitrogen application (100 kg N/ha) were investigated. Both biochars, without N fertiliser, produced similar increases in dry matter yield of radish, which were detectable at the lowest application rate, 10 t/ha. The yield increase (%), compared with the unamended control rose from 42% at 10 t/ha to 96% at 50 t/ha of biochar application. The yield increases can be attributed largely to the ability of these biochars to increase N availability. Significant additional yield increases, in excess of that due to N fertiliser alone, were observed when N fertiliser was applied together with the biochars, highlighting the other beneficial effects of these biochars. In this regard, the non activated poultry litter biochar produced at lower temperature (450 degrees C) was more effective than the activated biochar produced at higher temperature (550 degrees C), probably due to higher available P content. Biochar addition to the hardsetting soil resulted in significant but different changes in soil chemical and physical properties, including increases in C, N, pH, and available P, but reduction in soil strength. These different effects of the 2 different biochars can be related to their different characteristics. Significantly different changes in soil biology in terms of microbial biomass and earthworm preference properties were also observed between the 2 biochars, but the underlying mechanisms require further research. Our research highlights the importance of feedstock and process conditions during pyrolysis on the properties and, hence, soil amendment values of biochars.

AB The investigations involved geophysical, sedimentological, palynological, chemical and mineralogical studies, supported by field-based infrared spectrometry. The Baganuur Basin, Central Mongolia, is among the rift or pull-apart-basins, which subsided at the boundary between the Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous in East Asia. During the Berriasian, peat accumulation began in the area under study in Central Mongolia. The palynoflora is akin to the Siberian palynological province. Based on the phytoclast assemblages and the ratios of total sulfur content to total organic content, marine transgressions into this intermontane basin may be ruled out. The coal interseam sediments were laid down prevalently under neutral to slightly alkaline conditions; only in some carbonaceous sediments, the pH of intrastratal solutions was lowered. Suboxic to anoxic conditions persisted during almost the entire Lower Cretaceous period in the Baganuur Basin. Based on the distribution of fining- and coarsening-upward sequences and the organic matter, the basin fill has been subdivided into seven depositional units (A: fluvial-swamp, B: fluvial-lacustrine, C: deltaic-fluvial, D: fluvial, E: fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine/floodplain (?), F: lacustrine-deltaic-swamp, G: swamp-fluvial). A conspicuous change in the fluvial-lacustrine regime and an increase in the sediment supply may be observed at the boundary between depositional units B and C. A strong uplift triggered the onset of an intensive delta sedimentation. Lithoclasts, heavy minerals (e.g., apatite, zircon, garnet, anatase, brookite, epidote, sphene, tourmaline) and phyllosilicates (e.g., kaolinite, smectite, mica, chlorite) attest to a mixing of detrital material. One provenance area was abundant in acidic plutonic rocks as shown by the granitic lithoclasts, the other in volcanic rocks, which produced the vitroclastic debris deposited as tephra fallout. Post-depositional alteration of the siliciclastic interseam sediments was favored by a distinctive facies association of transmissive and sealing horizons. It led to a re-deposition of Ca, U and Sr in the siliciclastics. Post-depositional alteration of the organic material converted it into lignite to subbituminous C coal. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Permian coal-bearing strata occur in a number of intracratonic rift basins in Tanzania, This study examines coals, shales and mudstones of the Namwele-Mkomolo, Mute and Galula coalfields (Rukwa basin) by coal petrological, palynological and rock eval techniques. For the coals the focus was on the establishment of coal seam characteristics and related quality and utilization potentials, whereas the shales and mudstones were examined for age relationships, flora and related palaeodepositional environments and source rock potential. The coal seams, which have a thickness of up to 2.95 m are high in ash yields (25-63 wt%) and have calorific values ranging from 5344 to 18947 J/g. Typical for many of the seams is their detrital nature as indicated by the high content in finely disseminated clay minerals, quartz and detrital macerals. Pyrite content is variable (0.60-5.81 wt%). Vitrinite reflectance ranges from 0.43 to 0.66% R-random (subbituminous to high volatile B bituminous). Use of the coals in small-scale power generations and for domestic use would greatly reduce the dependency of rural Tanzania on wood and wood-derived charcoal as the main source of fuel, Palynomorph assemblages are characterized by the predominance of nontaeniate and taeniate pollen, and trilete spores in the Namwele-Mkomolo and Mute coalfields. At Galula coalfield the palynomorph assemblages were poor (rare trilete, alete and monolete spores). On the basis of age correlations with Karoo basins to the south and the Collie Basin of western Australia, an Artinskian to Kungurian(?) age is suggested for the coal measures in the Rukwa basin. The diversity of palynomorph assemblages suggests a variety of floras and contemporary depositional environments throughout deposition of the Karoo strata. This is consistent with coal petrographic parameter, which would indicate that peat accumulation occurred in upper delta plain, braided plain and lacustrine depositional environments. Rock eval parameters indicate kerogen type III for all samples investigated and indicate very poor hydrocarbon source rock potential. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The complexity of ecosystems and mechanisms of succession are often simplified by linear and mathematical models used to understand and predict system behavior. Such models often do not incorporate multivariate, nonlinear feedbacks in pattern and process that include multiple scales of organization inherent within real-world systems. Wetlands are ecosystems with unique, nonlinear patterns of succession due to the regular, but often inconstant, presence of water on the landscape. We develop a general, nonspatial state and transition (S and T) succession conceptual model for wetlands and apply the general framework by creating annotated succession/management models and hypotheses for use in impact analysis on a portion of an imperiled wetland. The S and T models for our study area, Water Conservation Area 3A South (WCA3), Florida, USA, included hydrologic and peat depth values from multivariate analyses and classification and regression trees. We used the freeware Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool as an exploratory application to evaluate our S and T models with different management actions (equal chance [a control condition], deeper conditions, dry conditions, and increased hydrologic range) for three communities: slough, sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), and wet prairie. Deeper conditions and increased hydrologic range behaved similarly, with the transition of community states to deeper states, particularly for sawgrass and slough. Hydrology is the primary mechanism for multi-state transitions within our study period, and we show both an immediate and lagged effect on vegetation, depending on community state. We consider these S and T succession models as a fraction of the framework for the Everglades. They are hypotheses for use in adaptive management, represent the community response to hydrology, and illustrate which aspects of hydrologic variability are important to community structure. We intend for these models to act as a foundation for further restoration management and experimentation which will re. ne transition and threshold concepts.

AB Vine decline is limiting muskmelon production in many growing areas. Monosporascus cannonballus Pollack and Uecker and Acremonium cucurbitacearum Alfaro-Garcia, W. Gams, and J. Garcia-Jimenez are the main causal agents of this disease in Spain. The wild accession Pat81 (Cucumis melo subsp. agrestis Jeffrey) has shown to be highly resistant in naturally infested fields and after artificial inoculations. In three greenhouse experiments conducted over two seasons, the root structure of Pat81 was examined and compared to the highly susceptible commercial cultivar Amarillo Canario (AC). Pat81 produced a more vigorous, branched, and longer root system, conferring to this accession a higher capacity for the uptake of water and nutrients, even after inoculation using naturally infested soil. To determine the plasticity of the root systems, the effect of five different soil substrates on root growth was assayed. The root morphology was highly influenced by the soil substrate. Differences between genotypes appeared at 10 weeks after transplanting using sand as soil substrate. An organic substrate made up of well-decomposed peat and sand minimized the genotype x substrate interactions, and facilitated root analysis. This substrate allowed bringing the sampling date forward to flowering (at 7 weeks after transplanting). The maximum root length, the number and size of lateral roots (diameter 0.5-1 mm) and branching order, consistently differed between the two genotypes in most of the assayed substrates. These easily measurable root traits can be used as selection criteria in healthy soils to breed a larger root system more tolerant to stress. In addition, in inoculated soils the greater root absorbent area and the reduced lesion intensity of Pat81 could have applications to increase vine decline resistance of cultivated melons. By using segregant populations derived from the cross AC x Pat81, we are trying to modify the root structure of muskmelon in order to offer a genetic alternative to the expensive strategy of grafting muskmelon varieties onto rootstocks resistant to soil stresses.

AB The coastal deltaic plain of the Yangtze River between Taihu (Lake Tai) and Shanghai in eastern China has been the scene of human settlement and agriculture since the early Neolithic, becoming increasingly intensive in the Upper Holocene when delta accretion and the establishment of a stable hydrological regime of freshwater lakes and wetlands allowed the development of extensive agriculture and complex society in late prehistoric and dynastic times. During this period the area was significantly affected by changes in sea level, climate and vegetation, resulting in a dynamic and complex environmental history, however little research has concentrated on environmental change and human impacts during the last few millennia. This study focuses on this late period, presenting the results of integrated sedimentary, microfossil and radiocarbon analyses from a core near the eastern margin of Lake Dianshan, to the east of Taihu. After the withdrawal of intertidal conditions and the conversion to freshwater lake at the core site about 2600 cal. yr BP, pollen and algal spore data show that increased sedimentation gradually reduced freshwater depth until a surface peat formed ca. 1500 cal. yr BP. This also dates the start of a switch in woodlands from sub-tropical and warm temperate trees to a mainly cool temperate and coniferous tree flora, under climatic cooling and human impact. After this time water depths at the site increased greatly, partly due to climate change and flooding, but also because of the establishment of deepwater 'paddy' agriculture. Microcharcoal and pollen data show that a major episode of human impact using fire, with deforestation and rice cultivation, occurred between ca. 1500 and 1200 cal. yr BP. These dates suggest it is one of the latest examples of 'flooded-field"paddy' cultivation before more intensive agricultural techniques were adopted in the area after ca. 800 cal. yr BP.

AB Bottom sediments from a single core retrieved from nine lakes and/or reservoir sites have been analysed for particle size, loss on ignition and the total concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Al, Mn and P. Site differences reflect the relative significance of autochthonous and allochthonous contributions to the sedimentary record and are related to changes in sedimentation rate through time as determined from a (210)Pb and (137)Cs chronology determined for each core. Whilst changing sedimentation rates reflect both sediment influx from the contributing catchment and focusing within the lake basin, the patterns generally reveal changes associated with catchment disturbance over the last century. Calcium-rich sediments are found in two lakes draining catchments underlain by Oolitic limestones. Organic matter contents, as determined by low temperature loss on ignition, range from 13 to 25%. High organic matter levels are found in bottom sediments either where the contributing catchment has extensive blanket peat accumulations or in lakes with low sediment accumulation rates, where the organic matter content is more likely to be controlled by lake productivity. In general, organic matter content is inversely related to sedimentation rate and to sediment yield. Greatest down-core variations in sediment physical and geochemical signatures are found in lake sediment records where catchments have experienced significant increases in sediment influx from the catchment. The average sediment yield determined for each of the nine lake-catchments is inversely related to average organic matter and P content of the sediments, but an increase in sediment yield is associated with better sorting and a decrease in the proportion of coarse and medium silt sized particles. Six of the nine sites show evidence for significant increases in the total P load in their near-surface sediments, either resulting from higher than average sediment yields or as a result of significant increases in sediment-P concentrations.

AB Litter decomposition in wetlands is an important component of ecosystem function in these detrital systems. In oligotrophic wetlands, such as the Florida Everglades, litter decomposition processes are dependent on nutrient availability and litter quality. The aim of this study was to assess the differences and changes in chemical composition of above- and belowground plant tissues at different stages of decomposition, and to compare them to organic matter accumulating in wetland surface soils.
   To understand the chemical changes occurring during the early stages of litter decomposition in wetlands, short-term subaqueous decomposition patterns of above- and belowground tissues from Cladium jamaicense and Eleocharis cellulosa were investigated at two freshwater marsh sites in the Florida Everglades. The composition of litter at different stages of decomposition was compared to that of the two end-members, namely fresh plant tissues and soil organic matter (SOM), in an effort to assess both the gradual transformation of this organic matter (OM) and the incorporation of above- vs. belowground biomass to wetland soils. The chemical composition of the litter and of surface soils was assessed using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   Decomposition indices (alkyl/O-alkyl ratio, Aromaticity index) of Cladium and Eleocharis leaves varied during incubation likely reflecting physical leaching processes followed by a shift to microbial decomposition. Overall, Eleocharis leaves were more labile compared to Cladium leaves. Relative to aboveground litter, the belowground biomass of both species was more resistant to degradation, and roots were more resistant than rhizomes. Compared to the observed early diagenetic transformations of the plant litter, the SOM is at a more advanced stage of degradation, suggesting that the decomposition of litter and belowground biomass prior to its incorporation into wetland soils requires longer degradation times than those applied in this study.
   Litter decomposition in Everglades' freshwater marshes is driven by a combination of tissue quality and site characteristics such as hydroperiod and nutrient availability, ultimately leading to the accumulation of peat.

AB Context Although there is a need to develop a spatially explicit methodological approach that addresses the social importance of cultural ecosystem services for regional planning, few studies have analysed the spatial distribution on the cultural ecosystem services based on social perceptions.
   Objective The main objective of this study was to identify cultural ecosystem service hot-spots, and factors that characterize such hot-spots and define the spatial associations between cultural ecosystem services in Southern Patagonia (Argentina).
   Methods The study was carried out in Southern Patagonia (243.9 thousand km 2) located between 46 degrees and 55 degrees SL with the Andes mountains on the western fringe and the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern fringe of the study area. The study region has a range of different vegetation types (grasslands, shrub-lands, peat-lands and forests) though the cold arid steppe is the main vegetation type. We used geo-tagged digital images that local people and visitors posted in the Panoramio web platform to identify hot-spots of four cultural ecosystem services (aesthetic value, existence value, recreation and local identity) and relate these hot-spots with social and biophysical landscape features.
   Results Aesthetic value was the main cultural service tagged by people, followed by the existence value for biodiversity conservation, followed by local identity and then recreational activity. The spatial distribution of these cultural ecosystem services are associated with different social and biophysical characteristics, such as the presence of water bodies, vegetation types, marine and terrestrial fauna, protected areas, urbanization, accessibility and tourism offer. The most important factors are the presence of water in Santa Cruz and tourism offer in Tierra del Fuego.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that this methodology is useful for assessing cultural ecosystem services at the regional scale, especially in areas with low data availability and field accessibility, such as Southern Patagonia. We also identify new research challenges that can be addressed in cultural ecosystem services research through the use of this method.

AB Wetland loss and climate change are known to alter regional and global methane (CH4) budgets. Over the last six decades, an extensive area of marshland has been converted to cropland on the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China, and a significant increase in air temperature has also been observed there, while the impacts on regional CH4 budgets remain uncertain. Through model simulation, we estimated the changes in CH4 emissions associated with the conversion of marshland to cropland and climate change in this area. Model simulations indicated a significant reduction of 1.1 Tg yr(-1) (0.7-1.8 Tg yr(-1)) from the 1950s to the 2000s in regional CH4 emissions. The cumulative reduction of CH4 from 1960 to 2009 was estimated to be similar to 36 Tg (24-57 Tg) relative to the 1950s, and marshland conversion and the climate contributed 86% and 14% of this change, respectively. Interannual variation in precipitation (linear trend with P > 0.2) contributed to yearly fluctuations in CH4 emissions, but the relatively lower amount of precipitation over the period 1960-2009 (47mmyr(-1) lower on average than in the 1950s) contributed similar to 91% of the reduction in the areaweighted CH4 flux. Global warming at a rate of 0.3 degrees per decade (P < 0.001) has increased CH4 emissions significantly since the 1990s. Relative to the mean of the 1950s, the warming-induced increase in the CH4 flux has averaged 19 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the last two decades. In the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 scenarios of the fifth IPCC assessment report (AR5), the CH4 fluxes are predicted to increase by 36 %, 52 %, 78% and 95 %, respectively, by the 2080s compared to 1961-1990 in response to climate warming and wetting.

AB The Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework watershed model was enhanced to simulate the transport and fate of mercury and to calculate the fish mercury concentrations (FMC) attained by fish through the food web. The model was applied to Western Lake Superior Basin of Minnesota, which has many peat lands and lakes. Topographic, land use, and soil data were used to set up the model. Meteorology and precipitation chemistry data from nearby monitoring stations were compiled to drive the model. Simulated flow and mercury concentrations for several stream stations were comparable to available data. The model was used to perform mercury total maximum daily load calculations for two contrasting drainage lakes (Wild Rice Lake and Whiteface Reservoir). The model results for wet deposition, dry deposition, evasion, watershed yield, and soil sequestration of mercury were comparable with available actual data. The model predicted lake ice cover from November to April and weak stratification in summer, typical of shallow lakes in cold regions. The simulated sulfate decrease and methylmercury increase near the lake bottom in late summer are caused by sulfate reduction and mercury methylation that occur in the surficial sediment. Simulated FMC were within the range of observed values and the R-2 of correlation between the simulated and observed FMC was 0.77. Under the 1989-2004 base condition, the average simulated FMC of four-year-old walleye was 0.31 mu g /g for Whiteface Reservoir and 0.15 mu g /g for Wild Rice Lake. The FMC criterion in Minnesota is 0.2 mu g /g. Wild Rice Lake already meets this criterion without any load reduction. The model showed that a 65% reduction in atmospheric mercury deposition will not, by itself, allow Whiteface Reservoir to meet the criterion in 15 years. Additional best management practices will be needed to reduce 50% of the watershed input.

AB The weathering of U and/or Th rich granite plutons, which occurs worldwide, may serve as a potentially important, but as yet poorly defined source for U and Th in (sub-) surface environments. Here, we assessed the impact of an outcrop of such granite (5 km in diameter) and its erosional products on the distribution of U and Th in four nemo-boreal catchments. The results showed that (i) the pluton was enriched in both U and Th; and (ii) secondary U and Th phases were accumulated by peat/gyttja and in other Quaternary deposits with high contents of organic matter. Movement of the ice sheet during the latest glaciation led to dispersal of U- and Th-rich materials eroded from the pluton, resulting in a progressive increase in dissolved U and Th concentrations, as well as U concentrations in aquatic plants with increasing proximity to the pluton. The accumulation of U in the aquatic plants growing upon the pluton (100-365 mg kg(-1), dry ash weight) shows that this rock represents a long-term risk for adjacent ecosystems. Dissolved pools of U and Th were correlated with those of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and were predicted to largely occur as organic complexes. This demonstrates the importance of DOM in the transport of U and Th in the catchments. Large fractions of Ca2UO2(CO3)(3)(0)(aq) were modeled to occur in the stream with highest pH and alkalinity and thus, explain the strongly elevated U concentrations and fluxes in this particular stream. In future climate scenarios, boreal catchments will experience intensified runoff and warmer temperature that favor the production of hydrologically accessible DOM and alkalinity. Therefore, the results obtained from this study have implications for predicting the distribution and transport of Th and U in boreal catchments, especially those associated with U and/or Th rich granite plutons.

AB This paper deals with the mineral matter in the coal and associated strata from the Datanhao mine, Daqingshan Coalfield, which is closely located to the previously-reported Adaohai and Hailiushu mines of the same coalfield. The coal from the Datanhao mine is mainly high-ash and low-sulfur bituminous. The mineral assemblage in the coal is dominated by quartz, kaolinite, with varying proportions of carbonates (calcite, ankerite and siderite), small proportions of muscovite, illite, pyrite and anatase. The associated non-coal (claystone) samples have similar mineral assemblage, except that most non-coal samples contains less quartz than the adjacent coal plies. Although deposited in the same intermontane basin of the orogenic belt, the Yinshan Upland, the Datanhao coal seam shows different mineralogical characteristics from those of the nearby Adaohai and Hailiushu mines. This may reflect the different sediment-source regions during the peat accumulation stage. The sediment source for the Datanhao coal was probably the Ordovician quartz-rich sandstone or the Sinan quartzite in the surrounding sub-uplifts. High proportions of quartz in the Datanhao coal suggest intense terrigenous input into the paleomire and a short distance from the sediment source region. Different mineralogical characteristics of the coals from the three mines (Datanhao, Hailiushu, and Adaohai) of the Daqingshan Coalfield are probably due to the different source material in their respective surrounding subuplifts within the intermontane basin. Kaolinite displaying graupen, tabular and vermicular textures, and the common presence of beta-quartz in the intra-seam non-coal bands from the Datanhao coal seam indicate that most of these bands are tonsteins (altered airborne volcanic ash). The original magma is probably high level volatile-rich silicic in composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Minerals and elements in coal are derived from the processes associated with peat accumulation and rank advance, as well as possibly a range of epigenetic processes, and thus can provide information on the depositional conditions and geologic history of coal beds and coal-bearing sequences, as well as perhaps on regional tectonics. This paper investigates the petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of anthracites and their host rocks (partings, roof, and floor strata) from two coal deposits (Hongmao and Luocheng) in Guangxi Province, southern China. Samples collected from these deposits were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy plus energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, low-temperature ashing, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and quadrupole-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
   The anthracites from the two deposits are medium- to high-sulfur coals. The rare earth elements in the Luocheng anthracites are characterized by distinct positive Eu anomalies and medium- and heavy-REE enrichment types. The minerals in the Hongmao anthracites are characterized by the occurrence of K-illite, paragonite, and ammonian illite, which, however, are absent in the Luocheng anthracites. The paragonite, ammonian illite, and chlorite resulted from the alteration of pre-existing kaolinite by hot solutions containing Na+ NH4+, and Fe2+ respectively. The partings in the Luocheng anthracite seams contain pyrophyllite that was formed by reactions between kaolinite and quartz during injection of high-temperature solutions. The mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the anthracites in the two deposits indicate that the coals were subjected to high temperature ( > 250 degrees C) solutions that also elevated the coal rank to anthracite grade. The assemblage of K-illite-paragonite-NH4-illite in the coals of the Hongmao deposit was formed under greater hydrothermal but less tectonic influence compared to the Luocheng deposit; by contrast, the pyrophyllite-illite-chlorite assemblage of the Luocheng deposit reflects a greater tectonic but lesser hydrothermal influence.

AB Quaternary climato-custatic oscillations and tectonic movements result in base-level changes that modify the shape of fluvial systems. At the onset of the Holocene, NW European fluvial systems were deeply incised and comprised several terraces. Some terraces now lie beneath the estuary that formed in response to the Holocene sea-level rise.
   The macrotidal estuary of the Seine River is one example of that NW European fluvial valley evolution. Although the system has been CN tensively studied over the last 40 years, no study has drawn together all the research on its Holocene evolution. We gathered available data on five sites distributed across the system, in order to discuss that evolution and the related forcing factors. We have identified four main phases.
   (1) Prior to 6000 BC, there was a retrogradational shifting of the shoreline, where pre-Holocene topography and the sea level were the main forcing factors. Only depositional environments of low-elevated areas were affected by the influence of the sea-level rise, while the others were affected by climatic changes. (2) Around 6000-5000 BC, there was a maximum flooding event, where all depositional sites were affected by the influence of the sea-level rise. (3) Between 5000 and 1100 BC, there was an aggrading sequence, where tide and local hydrological conditions were the main forcing factors. The deposition record indicates that there were open tidal environments toward the sea, while landward peat accumulated. and was sometimes disturbed by tidal channel formation. (4) From 1100 BC, there was a progradational shifting of the shoreline, where human activity was the main forcing factor. Seaward environments at this time still indicate open-tidal conditions, while landward ones show: a return to elastic deposits related to floodplain deposition. All the C-14 data accumulated in the area should allow us to present a regional sea-level curve in the near future.

AB Late Holocene volcanic activity at Ruapehu has been characterized by the generation of small (< 10(5) m(3)) to very large (> 10(7) m(3)) lahars and repeated, small to medium (VEI 1-3) tephra-producing eruptions. The Onetapu Formation groups all lahar deposits that accumulated during the last 2,000 years on the southeastern Ruapehu ring plain. The andesitic tephras are grouped within the Tufa Trig Formation and are intercalated within the laharic sequence. By correlating these two formations with new radiocarbon ages obtained on interbedded paleosols, we reconstruct a detailed volcanic history of Ruapehu for this period.
   Clast assemblages identified in the laharic sequences record the lithologies of synchronous tephras and rocks within the source region. These assemblages suggest a strong genetic link between the development of Crater Lake, the variation in eruptive styles, and the production of lahars.
   Lahar-triggering mechanisms include: (1) flank collapse of hydrothermally altered and unstable portions of the cone; (2) phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions favoring the generation of snow-rich slurries and hyperconcentrated stream flows; ( 3) sudden Crater Lake rim collapse, releasing large amounts of water inducing debris flows; and ( 4) eruptions that generate large volumes of tephra on snow-covered slopes, later remobilized by heavy rain.
   Two major lahars in the Onetapu sequence had a volume greater than or equal to 4 x 10(7) m(3), roughly 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than the 1953 event leading to the Tangiwai disaster (151 casualties). One of these lahars crossed over a low interfluve currently separating the Whangaehu River from a stream feeding the Tongariro River, sometime since peat accumulated between AD 1400 and AD 1660. A repetition of such a large-scale event would have devastating consequences on the infrastructure, economy and environment within the distal areas of the two catchments. The 1995 - 1996 eruptions were a timely reminder of the hazards posed by the volcano.

AB The Late Mississippian and Pennsylvanian have been referred to as the Coal Age due to enormous paleotropical peat accumulations (coal beds). Numerous fossil floras have been collected from these coals, and their associated seat-earth paleosols and roof-shales, over more than two centuries, leading to the inference of vast swampy wetlands covering the Pangean tropics during the Pennsylvanian. In contrast, the Permian tropics are characterized as more arid, with sparser and more heterogeneous vegetation than inferred for the Pennsylvanian. In the tropics, the Pennsylvanian to Permian transition has been described as a changeover from a pteridophytedominated "Paleophytic flora", to a seed-plant dominated "Mesophytic flora. This view notwithstanding, floras dominated by xeromorphic seed plants also are well known from the Pennsylvanian tropics. Some authors have characterized these plants as being occupants of uplands, subsequently transported into basinal-lowland, preservational environments. In this model, uplands are well drained, causing areas of drought under otherwise everwet climates. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation: that the apparent transition in Pennsylvanian-Permian tropical vegetation reflects two types of taphonomic megabias. First is a preservational megabias, strongly favoring the vegetation of humid climates over that of seasonally dry climates. Accordingly, tropical-plant preservational potential fluctuated in concert with Late Paleozoic Ice Age glacial-interglacial oscillations, and contemporaneous sea-level and climatic changes. Second is an analytical megabias, strongly favoring the discovery and collection of the wetland biome from Pennsylvanian strata, overlooking the less frequently and more poorly preserved drought-tolerant biome. By Permian times, vast wetlands, and their fossil record, had largely disappeared from central Pangea (although continuing in Cathaysia), making drought-tolerant vegetation more "visible" to searchers, without changing its preservational circumstances. We demonstrate that the upland model is untenable, being inconsistent with the principles of plant biogeography and with geological aspects of the fossil record.

AB In the Arctic zone, where up to 1024 x 1013 kg of organic matter is stored in permafrost-affected soils, soil organic matter consists of about 50% humic substances. Based on the analysis of the molecular composition of humic acids, we assessed the processes of accumulation of the key structural fragments, their transformations and the stabilization rates of carbon pools in soils in general. The landscape of the Lena River delta is the largest storage of stabilized organic matter in the Arctic. There is active accumulation and deposition of a significant amount of soil organic carbon from terrestrial ecosystems in a permafrost state. Under ongoing climate change, carbon emission fluxes into the atmosphere are estimated to be higher than the sequestration and storing of carbon compounds. Thus, investigation of soil organic matter stabilization mechanisms and rates is quite an urgent topic regarding polar soils. For study of molecular elemental composition, humic acids were separated from the soils of the Lena River delta. Key structural fragments of humic matter were identified and quantified by CP/MAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy: carboxyl (-COOR); carbonyl (-C=O); CH3-; CH2-; CH-aliphatic; -C-OR alcohols, esters and carbohydrates; and the phenolic (Ar-OH), quinone (Ar = O) and aromatic (Ar-) groups as benchmark Cryosols of the Lena delta river terrestrial ecosystem. Under the conditions of thermodynamic evolutionary selection, during the change between the dry and wet seasons, up to 41% of aromatic and carboxyl fragments accumulated in humic acids. Data obtained showed that three main groups of carbon played the most important role in soil organic matter stabilization, namely C, H-alkyls ((CH2)n/CH/C and CH3), aromatic compounds (C-C/C-H, C-O) and an OCH group (OCH/OCq). The variations of these carbon species' content in separated humics, with special reference to soil-permafrost organic profiles' recalcitrance in the current environment, is discussed.

AB Tree islands, forested islands in an herbaceous freshwater wetland landscape, are a major landscape feature in the Florida Everglades. The vegetation communities on the heads of 31 tree islands, including eight islands with recreational camp structures, were assessed throughout Water Conservation Area 3 to determine their composition, structure, and distribution across the landscape. The islands were a sample of the most elevated islands in the local landscape. Measures of forest canopy (> 3 m) and subcanopy (1-3 m) structure and composition, including cover, species richness, number of exotics, and total canopy basal area were ordinated onto six hydrologic variables estimated from the South Florida Water Management Model (v5.5) simulation from 1984 to 1997, and history of recent fire. Ordination allowed identification of four island groups: Group A, higher islands, most with camp structures, low or no canopy structure, high level of fire history, driest hydrology, and largest number of exotic species in canopy; Group B, variable canopy development including many plots without canopy cover, some fire history, and exotics in sub-canopy; Group C, highest islands with well developed canopy structure and no canopy exotics; and Group D, low elevation islands, wettest hydrology, no exotics, and deep peat soils. Cluster analysis of the vegetation cover data was used to identify sub-canopy and canopy communities of the island groups. Our results indicated that the forest canopy of elevated tree islands is similar throughout the central Everglades and that differences in tree island forest composition and structure were the result of local differences in island topography, hydrology, direct human disturbance, and past fire history. Canopy composition and structure were strongly correlated with extreme wet or dry hydrologic events rather than mean or median annual water levels. Fern species were also found to be a ubiquitous component of the sub-canopy. The results of this study identify potentially successful species and provide some basic guidelines for restoring the forest head communities of degraded tree islands.

AB On the research results of 2009-2013 we conducted the closed experimental tapping in the pine forests in the forest hydromelioration stations of the Sokol district, Vologda region. The experimental pine forests were presented by the stands transformed after drainage and the pine stands after drainage and partial cutting (thinning); peat accumulation was presented by the transitional water-logging process; the pine forests belonged to the sedge-sphagnum group. Pine was dominant in a tree layer. The share of birch and spruce was less than 10 % before cutting. Our research was mainly dedicated to the approbation of the proximate method of micro wounding, used for closed rapid tapping. We offered the formula for the obtained results recalculation according to the Russian method of the resin productivity evaluation. The following research objectives were considered: to develop and adjust the proximate method of micro wounding for the resin productivity evaluation of pine stands; to define the stable and significant summer growth period of time for drained pine stands when the resin productivity is maximum; to identify the differences in pine resin exudation in different categories of objects (canalside and interchannel drained wood lines; drainage and drainage with thinning); to set the minimum research time period of the resin productivity to get the reliable results. The research results demonstrate that the proximate method of micro wounding for the shortest period of time allows us to get reliable data on the resin productivity of drained pine forests, which can serve as a general indicator of the living condition of pine trees. The 5-year observation period for drainable pine forests led to the following conclusions: the resin productivity in June is by 21 % higher than in average for the whole summer period; in the canalside drained area the turpentine yield is by 10 % more intense, than in the interchannel one; thinning affects positively as the resin productivity increases by 42 % comparing to the pine stand that was only drained. 3-year monitoring of drainable pine stands can give the most reliable results when establishing their resin productivity.

AB Isla de los Estados (54A degrees 45'S, 63A degrees 10'aEuro"64A degrees 46'W) lies east of the main island of Tierra del Fuego and is the southeastern-most point in Argentina. Because of its geographic position near the latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies and the strong influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the area is suitable for paleoecological and paleoclimate research. The island is not far north of the Subantarctic Front, which limits the northern boundary of the ACC. Paleoenvironmental study in this geographic location can shed light on past changes in atmospheric and marine circulation patterns. Diatom analysis of the lower part of a sediment sequence from Laguna Cascada (54A degrees 45' 51.3''S, 64A degrees 20' 20.07''W) enabled inference of changing lake conditions between 16 and 11.1 cal ka BP. Between 16 and 14.4 cal ka BP fragilarioid diatom species, often a pioneer group, dominated the record. Their presence shows seasonally open-water conditions from the onset of sedimentation. In zone II (14.4-12.8 cal ka BP), the dominance of planktonic/tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira spp. might represent longer ice-free periods and windier conditions, which would have kept this heavy species suspended in the water column. This period corresponds to the Antarctic Cold Reversal, when the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies were possibly centered on the latitudes of Tierra del Fuego, resulting in windy and wet conditions. Zone III (12.8-11.1 cal ka BP) is dominated by benthic diatom taxa that are mainly associated with peat and wetland vegetation. This suggests that climate conditions had become milder and less windy, favoring aquatic productivity and terrestrial vegetation development. This change in environmental conditions may have been a consequence of the southward movement of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies at the start of the Antarctic Holocene thermal optimum.

TI CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN SOILS AND SURFACE WATERS OF THE UKOK PLATEAU

DE South-Eastern Altai; Ukok plateau; soils; surface water; macro- and
   microelements
ID REGION; IMPACT
AB The relevance of the research is in the poorly studied chemical composition of soils and surface waters of the Ukok plateau - the UNESCO world heritage site.
   The aim of the research is to study chemical elements content level in soils and surface waters of the central, southern and south-eastern parts of the Ukok plateau, to give an ecological and biogeochemical assessment of this little-studied area.
   Objects: main soil types (Mollic Leptosols Eutric, Umbric Leptosols Dystric, Lithic Leptosols Brunic) and surface water (rivers Zhumaly, Kalguty, Argamzhi, Ak-Alakh, Tarkhat and lake Ukok) of the plateau Ukok (Altai Republic, Russian Federation).
   Methods. Metal content in soils was determined by the approximate-quantitative emission spectral analysis at the Institute of Geochemistry and Mineralogy of SB RAS, while the content of trace elements in natural waters was defined by means of the atomic absorption spectrometry using electrothermal atomization at the Chemical Analytical Center of IWEP SB RAS.
   Results. The paper presents the results of studying chemical composition of different types of soils and surface waters of the high-mountain plateau Ukok. The concentrations of chemical elements in soils of the plateau do not exceed their Clarks in the soil cover and correspond to those in the mountain-tundra soils of Altai, except for the soils and parent rocks above the Kalguty W-Mo-V-Cu deposit distinguished by the abnormally high content of tungsten (up to 30-60 mg/kg). The increased content of Cu in the waters of the river Kalguty (16 mu g/dm(3)) and the soils of the basin is related to the halos and the influence of pilings and tailings of the concentration plant. The plateau soils are characterized by low gross content of P and Ca needed for plants, but enriched with potassium, the content of which exceeds 2 % in more than half of the samples. In soils of the Ukok plateau, P content increases from west to east, from true surface (central) part to the edging mountains that is due to phosphor presence in indigenous rocks of the Altai-Sayan mountain country. At present, low eluvial-accumulative ratios of metals in the studied soils of the plateau are evidence of the lack of pronounced anthropogenic pollution. The content of most elements in soils increases with depth. In mountain-tundra peat soils, the biogenic accumulation of Mn was found under dwarf birches. For steppe soils, some accumulation of Zn, Cr, V and Ni was observed in surface horizons. Pb and Zn had the most uniform distribution. The initial heterogeneity of moraine and lake-glacial deposits determines the diversity of intra-profile distribution of metals in the formed soils. Clear dependence of most macro-and microelements content in surface waters on their concentrations in soils was not established. Nevertheless, there was an increase in the intensity of water migration of iron in wetlands of the Bertek part of the Ak-Alakh river basin, where its content was the highest.

SO GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID HOLOCENE GLACIATION; DELMARVA PENINSULA; BROOKS RANGE; RIVER; HISTORY
AB Epiguruk, a prominent bluff along the Kobuk River in northwestern Alaska, exposes a rich depositional record of Quaternary eolian and fluvial sand, with associated loess, paleosols, and periglacial features. Three major complexes of alluvial and eolian deposits are separated by two conspicuous organic-rich paleosols which formed during cool-moist interstadial intervals. Sediments between the two paleosols include eolian, channel, and floodplain deposits that formed during alluviation of the Kobuk River to a height of about 12 m above the present level. The youngest depositional complex, which overlies the upper paleosol, is divisible into late Wisconsinan and Holocene components and into fluvial-channel, flood-plain, eolian-dune, sand-sheet, loess, and pond facies. Eolian sand from the active Kobuk sand sea overloaded the river during late Wisconsinan time, causing it to alluviate to about 13 m above its modern level. The Holocene record reflects erosion and deposition by a small southern tributary to the Kobuk River, downcutting by the Kobuk River toward its modern level, and subsequent erosion across a meander belt nearly 8 km wide.
   Sixty-six radiocarbon ages, many from rooted shrubs, provide a firm chronology for the past 35 ky. at Epiguruk. The Kobuk River incised to near its present level by about 35 ka, and the upper paleosol began forming near that level about 33 ka, coincident with the Fox termal event of central Alaska. Although higher-standing sandy facies of this paleosol began forming earlier, thick peat beds did not accumulate until about 33 ka at those sites. Late Wisconsinan loess influx and alluviation began about 24 ka, synchronous with the Itkillik II glaciation of the Brooks Range. The river overlapped progressively higher surfaces of the upper paleosol, attaining its maximum height of about 13 m above modern river level between 20 and 19 ka. It downcut about 18.5 ka and subsequently migrated northward. Deposits at the north end of the bluff show that the river had begun building its modern flood plain by 8.6 ka, and it has varied little in elevation since that time.

TI Recovery of latent fingermarks from burial environments
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Fingermarks; Burial; Soil; Chemical enhancement; Sudan black
AB Background: Fingermarks can be found both in indoor and outdoor crime scenes. The latter could be subjected to various types of environmental insults. In many cases, criminals try to dispose of or conceal the evidence in several ways, such as throwing in the waterways or burying in the soil to avoid detection from the law enforcement agencies. Thus, crime scene investigators often face challenges to detect and develop latent fingermarks in such environments. This study aimed to investigate the persistence and ageing of latent fingermarks in a burial environment for particular periods. To date, there is a limited study that attempted to investigate the survivability of fingermarks in a burial environment.
   Methodology: The experiment was carried out in two settings: preliminary and main experiments. A preliminary experiment was conducted indoor to determine the most effective chemical for fingermark development on buried metal substrates. Five different chemicals were employed to develop the latent fingermarks, namely fingermark powder dusting, small particle reagent (SPR), Sudan black, oil red 0, and crystal violet The main experiment was carried out to simulate the realistic situation in which the metal substrates bearing latent fingermarks were buried in the soil within 2 months period. In both experiments, the substrates were buried in peat soil at a depth of 10 cm from the surface.
   Results: The results demonstrated that latent fingermarks could be effectively recovered after being buried in the soil up to 8 weeks using Sudan black The position of the substrates whether underlying in "face up" or "face down" orientations when buried had also influenced the quality of the developed fingermarks. Fingermarks buried in the "face up" position demonstrated better quality and more ridge details as compared to those buried in the "face down" position. Secondary fingermarks were also observed in this study and found to be useful for identification and must be taken into consideration when developing fingermarks on buried items in forensic cases.
   Conclusion: The development of fingermarks recovered from burial environments is feasible as excellent ridge characteristics can still be identified. Hence, any evidence recovered from burial sites should be examined for fingermarks and cannot be discounted.

AB Human-induced salinization and trace element contamination are widespread and increasing rapidly, but their interactions and environmental consequences are poorly understood. Phytoaccumulation, as the crucial entry pathway for biotoxic Cd into the human foodstuffs, correlates positively with rhizosphere salinity. Hypothesising that organic matter decreases the bioavailable Cd2+ pool and therefore restricts its phytoextraction, we assessed the effects of four salinity levels (0, 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl) and three Cd levels (0.3, 5.5 and 10.4 mg kg(-1)) in peat soil on mineral accumulation/distribution as well as vegetative growth and fruit yield parameters of muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) in a greenhouse. Salt stress reduced shoot biomass and fruit production, accompanied by increased Na and Cl and decreased K concentration in above-ground tissues. A 25- and 50-day exposure to salinity increased Cd accumulation in leaves up to 87% and 46%, respectively. Accumulation of Cd in the fruits was up to 43 times lower than in leaves and remained unaltered by salinity. Soil contamination by Cd enhanced its accumulation in muskmelon tissues by an order of magnitude compared with non-contaminated control. in the drainage solution, concentrations of Na and Cl slightly exceeded those in the irrigation solution, whereas Cd concentration in drainage solution was lower by 2-3 orders of magnitude than the total amount added. Chemical speciation and distribution modelling (NICA-Donnan) using Visual MINTEQ showed predominance of dissolved organic ligands in Cd chemisorption and complexation in all treatments; however, an increase in salt addition caused a decrease in organic Cd complexes from 99 to 71%, with free Cd 2, increasing up to 6% and Cd-chlorocomplexes up to 23%. This work highlights the importance of soil organic reactive surfaces in reducing trace element bioavailability and phytoaccumulation. Chloride salinity increased Cd accumulation in leaves but not in fruit peel and pulp. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon (C)-rich wetland soils are often drained for agriculture due to their capacity to support high net primary productivity. Increased drainage is expected this century to meet the agricultural demands of a growing population. Wetland drainage can result in large soil C losses and the concentration of residual soil minerals such as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). In upland soils, reactive Fe and Al minerals can contribute to soil C accumulation through sorption to poorly crystalline minerals and coprecipitation of organo-metal complexes, as well as C loss via anaerobic respiration by Fe-reducing bacteria. The role of these minerals in soil C dynamics is often overlooked in managed wetland soils and may be particularly important in both drained and reflooded systems with elevated mineral concentrations. Reflooding drained soils have been proposed as a means to sequester C for climate change mitigation, yet little is known about how reactive Fe and Al minerals affect C cycling in restored wetlands. We explored the interactions among soil C and reactive Fe and Al minerals in drained and reflooded wetland soils. In reflooded soils, soil C was negatively associated with reactive Fe and reduced Fe(II), a proxy for anaerobic conditions (reactive Fe:R-2 = .54-.79; Fe(II):R-2 = .59-.89). In drained soils, organo-Al complexes were positively associated with soil C and Fe(II) (AlR2 = .91; Fe(II):R-2 = .54-.60). Soil moisture, organo-Al, and reactive Fe explained most of the variation observed in soil C concentrations across all sites (p < .01). Reactive Fe was negatively correlated to soil C concentrations across sites, suggesting these Fe pools may drive additional C losses in drained soils and limit C sequestration with reflooding. In contrast, reactive organo-Al in drained soils facilitates C storage via aggregation and/or formation of anaerobic (micro)sites that protect residual soil C from oxidation and may at least partially offset C losses.

AB Agricultural application of sewage sludge (SS) after carbonization is a plausible way for disposal. Despite its benefits of improving soil fertility and C sequestration, heavy metals contained in sewage sludge biochars (SSB) are still a concern. In this study, two types of heavy metal stabilizers were chosen: fulvic acid (FA) and phosphogypsum (with CaSO4, CS, as the main component). The two stabilizers were incorporated into SS prior to 350 degrees C carbonization for 1 h at the rates of 1%, 2%, or 4%. The obtained SSBs were then analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Total and available concentrations of four heavy metals, i.e., Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni, in the SSBs were determined. In addition, a series of pot soil culture experiments was conducted to investigate the effects of stabilizers incorporation into SSB on heavy metal bioavailability and the uptake by plants (corn as an indicator) and plant biomass yield, with SS and SSB (no stabilizers) as controls. The results showed that incorporation of both FA and CS increased functional groups such as carboxyl, phenol, hydroxyl, amine and quinine groups in the SSBs. The percentage of heavy metals in sulfuric and oxidizable state and residual state of SSBs were significantly increased after carbonization, and hence the mobility of the heavy metals in SSBs was decreased. The introduction of the stabilizers (i.e., FA or CS) significantly lowered the total and available concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni. The reduction in available heavy metal concentration increased with incorporation rate of the stabilizers from 1% to 4%. In the treatments with FA or CS incorporated SSB, less heavy metals were taken up by plants and more plant biomass yields were obtained. The mitigating effects were more pronounced at higher rates of FA or CS stabilizer. These findings provide a way to lower bioavailability of heavy metals in SS or SSB for land application or horticulture as a peat substitute.

AB RothC is an established model for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) changes in response to environmental conditions and management. The model lacks algorithms for carbon input estimation and a differentiated consideration of carbon input sequestration from organic amendments commonly used in agriculture. Moreover, it does not consider the higher stability of below-ground crop residues in relation to above-ground crop residues.
   RothC was combined with two empirical approaches for quantifying carbon inputs from above- and below ground crop residues and tested on 439 SOC data series from 36 arable long-term field experiments in Central and Northern Europe. Effects of carbon input quality on model fit were quantified with linear mixed models based on the analytical solution of RothC. Model parameters that describe the stability of incoming carbon were calibrated using a multi-site approach and Bayesian calibration. A second calibration study combined the determination of partitioning of incoming carbon into pools with different turnover rates and model responses to temperature and soil water content. With this calibration we showed that the contribution of above-ground residues to SOC is lower than when estimated with default RothC paramerization. We also show that the relative contribution from roots to SOC is higher than that from above-ground residues. Moreover, the degradability of organic amendments was highly variable between amendment categories and increased for all model configurations in the following order: farmyard manure < farmyard compost < sawdust < sewage sludge < peat. The proposed RothC partition coefficients for above-ground residues, roots and several commonly used organic amendments as estimated for this large data set should be useful for other studies in temperate climates. We also show that the analytical solution of RothC is closely related to the much simpler empirical humus balancing approaches used by farm advisory services. This provides opportunities to build bridges between the more process-oriented SOC models used in research and the well established instruments used by the fanning community to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on SOC changes.

AB Owing to the fact that the coal-beds are with the characteristics of multi-beds, thin single-bed, rapid lateral changes and deep burial, coal-bearing source rocks are difficult to be identified and predicted, especially in the lower exploration deepwater area. In this paper, a new integrative process utilizing geology and geophysics is proposed for better predicting the distribution of coal-bearing source rocks. Coal-beds were identified by the logging responses of "three higher, three lower, and one expand" and carbargilite were recognized by the characteristics of "four higher and one lower". Based on the above logical decision, coal-beds and carbargilite can be distinguished automatically by cluster analysis of logging curves in verticality. Within the constraints of well-seismic calibration, the coal-beds group also can be detected in horizontality by the integrated representation of "negative phase, higher Q, lower impedance and lower frequency" within the seismic data. However, the distribution of coal-bearing source rocks utilizing geophysical methodology may do not conform to the geological rules of coal accumulation. And then the main geological controlling factors of coal accumulation are comprehensively analyzed as follows: (1) Paleotopography and tectonic subsidence determine the planar range of terrestrial-marine transitional facies markedly; (2) The relative sea level changes affect the accommodation space and shoreline migration, and limit the vertical range of coal-beds. More specifically, the relationship between the accommodation creation rate and the peat accumulation rate is a fundamental control on coal accumulation. The thickest and most widespread coals form where those two factors reached a state of balance; (3) The supply of autochthonous clasts and the distance between deposition places and paleovegetation accumulated area are the critical factor to form abundant coal, which means that if deposition area is close to paleouplift, there would be sufficient organic matters to form abundant source rocks. The results show that the integrated methods can significantly improve prediction accuracy of coal-bearing source rocks, which is suitable for early exploration of western deepwater area of South China Sea.

AB Saltmarshes provide important services including flood control, climate regulation, and provisioning services when grazed by livestock for agriculture and conservation purposes. Grazing diminishes aboveground carbon, creating a trade-off between these two services. Furthermore, saltmarshes are threatened by overgrazing. To provide saltmarsh protection and ensure the continuing delivery of ecosystem services, there is a need to incentivise land managers to stock environmentally sensible densities. We therefore investigated the possibility of agri-environmental schemes and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to compensate for lost livestock revenue under reduced grazing regimes and provide carbon sequestration and other benefits. This is the first study to consider the benefits arising from a potential carbon market to saltmarshes, although similar schemes exist for peatland and woodland. We calculated the net economic benefit (costs of livestock production are removed from revenue) to farmers obtained from a hectare of grazed saltmarsh under low (0.3 Livestock Units per hectare per year), moderate (0.6), high (1.0) and very high (2.0) stocking densities accounting for livestock revenue, carbon benefits, and agri-environmental subsidies. We repeated the procedure considering additional benefits transferred from the literature in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by protected saltmarshes. The net benefits were assessed for a range of market carbon prices and social costs of carbon, e.g. the opportunity cost of carbon for society. Applying the model to Scottish saltmarshes we find that the current range of market prices could prompt transitions from high to moderate regimes in areas where livestock value is low, however break-even prices for transitions showed high spatial variability due to spatial variability in livestock values. In some areas of the West Highlands, the break-even carbon price is negative, indicating that the current agri-environmental schemes are able to more than compensate for the lost revenue accruing to farmers by a reduced grazing density. However, in other areas, such as the Outer Hebrides, the breakeven carbon price is positive. Private PES schemes or increased public subsidies should then be provided to generate net benefits. It is reasonable to infer that a pure carbon market may have limited scope in incentivising consumers to buy carbon services, especially in areas with limited local number of buyers and corporates of small size. Under this circumstance, a premium carbon market offering bundled ecosystem services may help reduce grazing pressure across a larger number of Scottish saltmarshes, thereby providing globally important climate regulation services and at the same time protecting sensitive habitats.

DT Article
DE trace elements; Permian; Heshan coal field; China
AB The concentration of trace elements and their distribution in the late Permian coal in the Heshan coal field, Guangxi Autonomous Region, were analysed in this paper. The late Permian coal of the Heshan mining district was developed in a low energy and shallow, confined carbonate platform. Heshan coal is a low volatile bituminous coal characterized by a high sulphur content, ranging between 2.0% and 8.2%. Compared with the worldwide average content of the trace elements in coal, the content of some trace element in the study coal is markedly high (Bi, Cc, Cr, Cs, Cu, Ga, Hf, Sr, Ta, Th, U, V, W, Y, Zr, La, Mo, Nb and Sc).
   The trace element associations were investigated by means of intracorrelation analysis. Some elements, such as Cl, F and Sr are found in coal in association with the carbonate minerals. V, Cr, Zn, Mo, Ni and As contents in coal vary significantly amongst the coal samples. They are mainly concentrated in the lower part of the coal #4 upper of Suhe and Lilan mines and the coal #4 lower of Dong mine, and these possibly occurring in minerals such as arsenide and sulphide. The content of U in Heshan coal is high and is mainly concentrated at the upper and the lower parts of the coal seam and it is associated with mineral assemblages with Ba, Mo, V, Ni, Zn, Rb and Cr. Furthermore, La and Cc are highly correlated with those found in phosphate minerals and Pb, Sc, Ga, Th, Y and Sri to those in alummosilicate minerals. The enrichment of some elements such as V, Cr, Zn, Mo, Ni, Rb as well as total sulphur and iron in the lower part of most coal seams might be associated with the formation of soil horizon before the accumulation of peat in the basin. Some other elements such as Cl, F, Sr and Ca are locally concentrated in the top of specific coal seams as a result of the leaching from overlying carbonates. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Injecting oxy-coal combustion flue gas into deep coal seams is viable to simultaneously reduce the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) CO2 and gaseous contaminants SO2 and NOx. This paper investigates the adsorption and desorption behaviors of N2O on different rank coals from peat to anthracite. The potential adsorption mechanism is also elucidated. The results show that the Sips model can well describe the equilibrium relationship of N2O adsorption on coals. The fitting results derived from the Sips model indicate that the adsorption affinity of N2O on coals decreases with the increasing coal rank, while the heterogeneity of the adsorption system tends to be stronger with the decreasing coal rank. The micropore surface area of coals greatly determines the maximum adsorption capacity of N2O derived from the Sips model. The kinetics process of N2O adsorption on coals follows the simplified bidisperse model, and it is controlled by the micropore diffusion. The apparent diffusion coefficient in micropores mainly depends upon micropore surface area of coals. The adsorption and desorption process of N2O on the high-rank Fumin (FM) coal (R-o,R-max = 2.59%) is a completely reversible and physical adsorption process. In contrast, the adsorption and desorption hysteresis of N2O on coals becomes more significant with the coal rank decreasing from 0.83 to 0.23%, indicating that the chemical adsorption of N2O exists for the low-rank coals. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization further reveals that the oxygenic and nitric speciation compositions of the high-rank FM coal after N2O adsorption remain unchanged. However, the oxygenic functional groups in the low-rank coals act as the main active sites for the chemical adsorption of N2O. Interaction with N2O only increases the total nitrogen content of the three low-rank coals but also changes their nitric speciation compositions, which are characterized by the increasing content of pyridine N and oxide N and the decreasing content of pyrrole/pyridone N. The aforementioned chemical adsorption is beneficial for stable storage of N2O in the target coal seams with a low metamorphic degree.

AB Tropical wetlands have been shown to exhibit high rates of net primary productivity and may therefore play an important role in global climate change mitigation through carbon assimilation and sequestration. Many permanently flooded areas of tropical East Africa are dominated by the highly productive C4 emergent macrophyte sedge, Cyperus papyrus L. (papyrus). However, increasing population densities around wetland margins in East Africa are reducing the extent of papyrus coverage due to the planting of subsistence crops such as Colocasia esculenta (cocoyam). In this paper, we assess the impact of this land use change on the carbon cycle and in particular the impacts of land conversion on net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange. Eddy covariance techniques were used, on a campaign basis, to measure fluxes of carbon dioxide over both papyrus and cocoyam dominated wetlands located on the Ugandan shore of Lake Victoria. Peak rates of net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, derived from monthly diurnal averages of net ecosystem exchange, of 2835 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 and 1520 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 were recorded in the papyrus and cocoyam wetlands, respectively, whereas night-time respiratory losses ranged between 10 and 15 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 at the papyrus wetland and 510 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 at the cocoyam site. The integration of the flux data suggests that papyrus wetlands have the potential to act as a sink for significant amounts of carbon, in the region of 10 similar to t C similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1. The cocoyam vegetation assimilated similar to 7 similar to t C similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1 but when carbon exports from crop biomass removal were accounted for these wetlands represent a significant net loss of carbon of similar magnitude. The development of sustainable wetland management strategies are therefore required to promote the dual wetland function of crop production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions especially under future climate change scenarios.

AB Short-term effects of high axle load traffic on soil total porosity and pore size distribution were examined in field experiments on a clay (Vertic Cambisol) and an organic soil (Mollic Gleysol) for 3 years after the heavy loading. The clay soil had 48 g clay (particle size less than 2 mu m) per 100 g in the topsoil and 65 g per 100 g in the subsoil. The organic soil consisted of well-decomposed sedge peat mixed with clay below 0.2 m depth down to 0.4-0.5 m and was underlain by gythia (organic soil with high clay content). The experimental traffic was applied with a tractor-trailer combination in autumn 1981. The trailer tandem axle load was 19 Mg on the clay and 16 Mg on the organic soil. There were three treatments: one pass with the heavy axle vehicle, with wheel tracks completely covering the plot area, four repeated passes in the same direction, and a control treatment without experimental traffic. During loading, the clay was nearly at field capacity below 0.1 m depth. The organic soil was wetter than field capacity.
   One and four passes with the high axle load compacted both soils to a depth of 0.4-0.5 m. On the clay soil the total porosity was reduced by the heavy loading nearly as much as macroporosity (diameter over 30 mu m) to 0.5 m depth. On the organic soil, macroporosity was reduced and microporosity (under 30 mu m) increased in the 0.2-0.5 m layer by the heavy loading. Total porosity did not reveal the effects of compaction on the organic soil. The compaction of the clay below 0.1 m persisted for 3 years following the treatment despite annual ploughing to a depth of 0.2 m, cropping and deep cracking and freezing. Likewise, in the subsoil (below 0.2 m) of the organic soil, differences in pore size distribution persisted for a period of at least 3 years after the heavy loading.

AB Although oribatid mites are essential to the decomposition. of plant tissues in modern temperate forests by assisting conversion of primary productivity to soil organic matter, little is known of their paleoecologic history. Previously there has been scattered and anecdotal evidence documenting oribatid mite detritivory in Pennsylvanian plant tissues. This study evaluates the incidence of oribatid mite damage for seven major coal-ball deposits from the Illinois and Appalachian sedimentary basins, representing a 17 million year interval from the Euramerican tropics. Although this interval contains the best anatomically preserved plant tissues with oribatid mite borings in the fossil record, coeval oribatid mite body-fossils are absent. By contrast, the known body-fossil record of oribatid mites commences during the Middle Devonian, but does not reappear until the Early Jurassic, at which time mite taxa are modern in aspect.
   All major plant taxa occurring in Pennsylvanian coal swamps, including lycopsids, sphenopsids, ferns, seed ferns and cordaites, were consumed by oribatid mites. Virtually every type of plant tissue was used by mites, notably indurated tissues such as bark, fibrovascular bundles and especially wood, as well as softer seed megagametophytic and parenchymatic tissues within. stems, roots and leaves. Significant evidence also exists for secondary consumption by mites of tissues in macroarthropod coprolites. Our data indicate that oribatid mites consumed dead, aerially-derived plant tissues at ground level, as well as root-penetrated tissues substantially within the peat. Oribatid mites were important arthropod decomposers in Pennsylvanian coal swamps of Euramerica.
   The wood boring functional-feeding-guild was expanded by insects into above-ground live trees during the early Mesozoic. New food resources for insect borers resulted from penetration of live tissues such as cambium and phloem, and the invasion. of heartwood and other hard tissues mediated by insect-fungus symbioses. Termites and holometabolous insects were prominent contributors to this second wave of wood-boring, exploiting gymnosperms and angiosperms as both detritivores and herbivores. An earlier emplacement of oribatid mites as detritivores of deadplant tissues continued to the present, but without a documented trace-fossil record.

TI Sequence paleogeography and coal accumulation of the Early-Middle

AB The Muli Basin in the Qinghai Province, located at the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is a Jurassic coal-bearing basin, and is an important area for coal production in China. Recent explorations have revealed the presence of unconventional types of gases such as coalbed methane and gas hydrates. Wehave investigated the sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, and lithofacies paleogeography of this basin based on data from outcrop and borehole sections. The coal-bearing strata include the Lower Jurassic Reshui and theMiddle JurassicMuli and Jiangcang Formations. Lithofacies including conglomerates, sandstones, mudstones, and coal were identified and have been interpreted to be formed in environments ranging from braided fluvial, braided fluvial delta, to lacustrine. The preferred sites of coal accumulation are the interdistributary bays of lower delta plain and upper delta plain environments. Three types of sequence boundaries are recognized, including regional unconformities between the Lower Jurassic and underlying Triassic, the basal surface of incised valley fills of thick-bedded sandstones in the Muli and Jiangcang Formations, and the surfaces that mark abrupt depositional facies shifts. Four third-order sequenceswere subdivided, namely S1, S2, S3, and S4 in ascending order, which correspond to the Reshui Formation, the Muli Formation, the lower member of the Jiangcang Formation, and the upper member of the Jiangcang Formation, respectively. Each sequence consists of a lowstand systems tract, a transgressive systems tract (TST), and a high-stand systems tract. A series of sequence-specific basin-wide paleogeographic maps have been constructed based on contour maps of several lithological parameters including stratal thickness, sandstone-to-mudstone ratio, and mudstone thickness. From S1 to S4, the Muli Basin experienced an evolution from a braided fluvial system to braided fluvial delta, then to a lacustrine system, showing a gradual deepening process. Thick coal seams with thickness greater than 3.5 m (11.5 ft) were primarily developed in the delta plain environment where the rate of peat accumulation can be easily balanced by the rate of accommodation generation. A five-stage coal-accumulation model has been summarized, and the major coal seams mainly developed in the early and late TST of sequences S1 and S2.

AB Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in the soil. Sequestration can be facilitated by agricultural management, but its influence is not the same on all soil carbon pools, as labile pools with a high turnover may be accumulated much faster but are also more vulnerable to losses. The aims of this study were to (1) assess how soil organic carbon (SOC) is distributed among SOC fractions on a national scale in Germany, (2) identify factors influencing this distribution and (3) identify regions with high vulnerability to SOC losses. The SOC content and proportion of two different SOC fractions were estimated for more than 2500 mineral topsoils (< 87 g kg(-1) SOC) covering Germany, using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Drivers of the spatial variability in SOC fractions were determined using the machine learning algorithm cforest. The SOC content and proportions of fractions were predicted with good accuracy (SOC content: R-2 = 0.87-0.90; SOC proportions: R-2 = 0.83; ratio of performance to deviation (RPD): 2.4-3.2). The main explanatory variables for the distribution of SOC among the fractions were soil texture, bulk soil C / N ratio, total SOC content and pH. For some regions, the drivers were linked to the land-use history of the sites.
   Arable topsoils in central and southern Germany were found to contain the highest proportions and contents of stable SOC fractions, and therefore have the lowest vulnerability to SOC losses. North-western Germany contains an area of sandy soils with unusually high SOC contents and high proportions of light SOC fractions, which are commonly regarded as representing a labile carbon pool. This is true for the former peat soils in this area, which have already lost and are at high risk of losing high proportions of their SOC stocks. Those "black sands" can, however, also contain high amounts of stable SOC due to former heathland vegetation and need to be treated and discussed separately from non-black sand agricultural soils. Overall, it was estimated that, in large areas all over Germany, over 30 % of SOC is stored in easily mineralisable forms. Thus, SOC-conserving management of arable soils in these regions is of great importance.

AB In the UK, as organo-mineral soils are a significant store of soil organic carbon (SOC), they may become increasingly favoured for the expansion of upland forestry. It is important, therefore, to assess the likely impacts on SOC of this potentially major land use change. Currently, these assessments rely on modelling approaches which assume that afforestation of organo-mineral soils is 'carbon neutral'. This review evaluates this assumption in two ways. Firstly, UK information from the direct measurement of SOC change following afforestation is examined in the context of international studies. Secondly, UK data on the magnitude and direction of the major fluxes in the carbon cycle of semi-natural upland ecosystems are assessed to identify the likely responses of the fluxes to afforestation of organo-mineral soils. There are few directly relevant measurements of SOC change following afforestation of organo-mineral soils in the UK uplands but there are related studies on peat lands and agricultural soils. Overall, information on the magnitude and direction of change in SOC with afforestation is inconclusive. Data on the accumulation of litter beneath conifer stands have been identified but the extent to which the carbon held in this pool is incorporated into the stable soil carbon reservoir is uncertain. The effect of afforestation on most carbon fluxes is small because the fluxes are either relatively minor or of the same magnitude and direction irrespective of land use. Compared with undisturbed moorland, particulate organic carbon losses increase throughout the forest cycle but the data are exclusively from plantation conifer forests and in many cases pre-date current industry best practice guidelines which aim to reduce such losses. The biggest uncertainty in flux estimates is the relative magnitude of the sink for atmospheric carbon as trees grow and mature compared with that lost during site preparation and harvesting. Given the size of this flux relative to many of the others, this should be a focus for future carbon research on these systems.

AB Black carbon (BC) plays an important role in carbon burial in marine sediments globally. Yet the sequestration of BC in the Arctic Ocean is poorly understood. Here we assess the concentrations, fluxes, and sources of soot BC (SBC)-the most refractory component of BC-in sediments from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), the World's largest shelf sea system. SBC concentrations in the contemporary shelf sediments range from 0.1 to 2.1 mg g(-1) dw, corresponding to 2-12% of total organic carbon. The Pb-210-derived fluxes of SBC (0.42-11 g m(-2) yr(-1)) are higher or in the same range as fluxes reported for marine surface sediments closer to anthropogenic emissions. The total burial flux of SBC in the ESAS (similar to 4,000 Gg yr(-1)) illustrates the great importance of this Arctic shelf in marine sequestration of SBC. The radiocarbon signal of the SBC shows more depleted yet also more uniform signatures (-721 to -896%; average of -774 +/- 62%) than of the non-SBC pool (-304 to -728%; average of -491 +/- 163%), suggesting that SBC is coming from an, on average, 5,900 +/- 300 years older and more specific source than the non-SBC pool. We estimate that the atmospheric BC input to the ESAS is negligible (similar to 0.6% of the SBC burial flux). Statistical source apportionment modeling suggests that the ESAS sedimentary SBC is remobilized by thawing of two permafrost carbon (PF/C) systems: surface soil permafrost (topsoil/PF; 25 +/- 8%) and Pleistocene ice complex deposits (ICD/PF; 75 +/- 8%). The SBC contribution to the total mobilized permafrost carbon (PF/C) increases with increasing distance from the coast (from 5 to 14%), indicating that the SBC is more recalcitrant than other forms of translocated PF/C. These results elucidate for the first time the key role of permafrost thaw in the transport of SBC to the Arctic Ocean. With ongoing global warming, these findings have implications for the biogeochemical carbon cycle, increasing the size of this refractory carbon pool in the Arctic Ocean.

AB This study of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany is based on the national greenhouse gas inventory, which was compiled as part of a report the EU's National Inventory Report (NIR) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in order to collect and evaluate data about all direct GHG emissions from agriculture at the state level. The purpose of this anallysis was (1) to determine which GHG sources are the most important and should, therefore, be primarily considered for the implementation of mitigation strategies; and (2) to find any possible connections between structural and technological changes as well as changes in management which have influenced the amount of GHG emissions from the individual sources over the past years since 1990.
   A business ABC analysis was used to analyse the data from the NIR as it is a method which allows a rating of the sources and sinks for GHG emissions, thereby enabling their importance to be determined. Based on this approach, individual strategies for different countries can be evaluated in order to determine the proper strategy out of a portfolio of mitigation measures for each country.
   Out of a total of 30 individual sources identified in Germany using the ABC analysis, four GHG sources contributed to 63.2% of the total emissions from the agricultural sector: agriculturally used peat soils, entric fermentation of cattle, drainage of grassland and usage of mineral fertilizer In the MR, five emission categories are given; namely, manure management, enteric fermentation, agricultural soils, land use and land use change (LULUC), and fuels. The categories dealing with the utilization of farmland, namely agricultural soils and LULUC, were found to cause 68.6% of the total of GHG emissions from agriculture. lnterestingly, the consumption of fuels, even in a highly mechanised agricultural system such as that found in Germany, only represents 6% of the total GHG emissions from agriculture. Sinks ill Germany are minor (is they only sequestrate 1.5% (if the total emissions. The evaluation of the agricultural GHG emission changes ill Germany, which decreased by about 16.0% within the period from 1990 to 2004, shows that the biggest part of GHG emission mitigation has been based oil structural change rather than oil abatement measures.

AB It is generally assumed that soil properties such as organic matter content, porosity, and mineral surface area have a significant effect oil the bioavailability and leachability of aged petroleum hydrocarbons. It order to test this hypothesis, nine model soils or sot-bents (i.e., fine and coarse quartz sand, montmorillonite and kaolinite clay, peat, 60 angstrom and 150 angstrom silica gel, a loam soil, and non-porous glass beads) were spiked with a crude oil, aged for 27 months in the laboratory, and transferred to glass columns for the performance of continuous flow leaching experiments. The column effluents were periodically sampled for 43 days and anayzed for BTEX. A one-drimensional flow model for predicting the dissolution and dispersion of individual hydrocarbons from a multicomponent NAPL such as crude oil was used to fit the leaching data (i.e., the BTEX concentration versus time curves) by adjusting the equilibrium oil-leachate partitioning coefficient (K-ol)for each respective hydrocarbon. The Peclet number, which is a measure of dispersion and a required modeling parameter, was measured in separate chloride tracer experiments for each soil column.
   Results demonstrate that soil properties did not significantly affect the leaching kinetics of BTEX from the columns. Instead, BTEX leaching curves coil Id be successfully fitted with the one-dimensional NAPL dissolution flow model for all sorbents with the exception of montmorillonite clay. The fitting parameter K-ol for each hydrocarbon was found to be similar to the Kol values that were independently measured for the same crude oil by Rixey et al. (Journal of Hazardous Materials B, 65: 137-156, 1999). In addition, the fitted Kol values were very similar for BTEX leaching from aged compared to freshly spiked loam soil. These findings indicate that leaching of BTEX in the aged soils that are contaminated with crude oil at the high concentrations commonly found in the environment (i.e., > 20,000 mg/kg) was not affected by soil properties or aging but rather was governed by the equilibrium dissolution of these hydrocarbons from the crude oil NAPL that is coating the soil particles.

AB Carbon (C) stocks in forest soils were evaluated in the first comprehensive survey of Great Britain, the BioSoil soil survey, using a total of 167 plots (72 in England, 26 in Wales and 69 in Scotland). The average C stock down to 80cm depth for seven main soil types ranged between 108 and 448tC/ha with maximum values from 511 to 927tC/ha. Carbon stock varied with soil depth and type, forest type, and stand age. Stocks within the upper mineral soil (0-20cm) represented between 29 and 69% of the total 0-80cm C stock, while those in the top 40cm comprised 59-100% of the total. Carbon stocks decreased in the order deep peats>peaty gleys>groundwater gleys>surface-water gleys>podzols and ironpans>brown earths>rankers and rendzinas. Litter and fermentation horizons on average contributed an additional 7.3 and 8.8tC/ha, respectively, to the overall soil C stock. Measured soil C stocks (0-80cm) were upscaled by area of main soil and forest types to provide national estimates. Total forest soil stocks for England, Wales and Scotland were upscaled to 163, 46 and 337MtC, respectively, with an additional 17, 4 and 21MtC within surface organic layers (litter and fermentation horizons). Carbon stocks were larger under conifers compared with broadleaves. Peaty gleys contributed most to the total C stock in Scotland, while brown earths and podzolic soils made the largest contribution in Wales, and brown earths and surface-water gley soils in England. Estimated total carbon stocks in forest soils in Great Britain, including organic layers, are 589MtC in the top 80cm and 664MtC in the top 1m of soil. The BioSoil soil survey provides the most comprehensive estimate of forest soil C stocks in Great Britain to date and provides a good baseline for assessing future change even though variability in forest soil C stocks is high. However, a relatively small number of additional plots to fill existing gaps in spatial coverage and to increase representation of rendzinas and highly organic soils would significantly reduce the level of uncertainty.

AB The variations in stress-sensitive minerals and elements in tectonically deformed coals (TDCs) were revealed in this paper. Results show that the clay minerals, carbonates and sulfides in the Middle to Lower Permian TDCs of the no. 8 and no. 10 coal seams of the Zhuxianzhuang mine are dominated by kaolinite, iron dolomite and calcite, and pyrite, respectively. The contents of Th are significantly higher than U, indicating that the sedimentary paleo-environment was almost independent of seawater and was characterized by hypoxia during peat accumulation periods. The light rare earth elements (LREEs) are enriched, yielding (La/Lu)(N) values of 1.00-12.30 and slightly positive Ce anomalies in the no. 8 (0.95-1.44, delta Ce/delta Eu = 1.30-2.62) and no. 10 coal seams (1.02-1.31, delta Ce/delta Eu = 1.66-2.17). The cluster results show that stress-sensitive elements in TDCs can be classified as aggregation-type (Si, Al, Ti, K, Fe, Sc, Li, Rb, Nb, Ag, Cd, Ta, Tl, Bi, Th, U, W), dissipation-type (N, H, Cl, Mo, Ni, Y, Sr), and mutant-type (O, Na, Ca, Be, Mn, Co, Ga, Ge, Pb, Bi, As). The enrichment effects of ductile deformations for major elements are more significant than those of brittle deformations. The combinations of (Nb, U), (Th, Rb), and (Li, Sc, Ag, Ta) are good brittle-, ductile-, and brittle-ductile enrichment-type elements, respectively, which can be used as good indicators of the coal's tectonic deformation. Sr records higher loss rates in brittle TDCs than in wrinkle coals. The Mo content gradually decreases with increasing tectonic deformation intensity, which is related to the dynamic metamorphism caused by tectonic deformation. Nucleophilic clay mineral elements (Be, Ga, Pb, Ge) in the no. 8 and no. 10 coal seams record similar trends and are highest in scaly coals, indicating that strong shearing effects can promote the enrichment of these elements. The contents of LREE and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) both increase with the increasing tectonic deformation intensity. For various TDCs, LREE record higher degrees of fractionation than the HREE.

   Salt marsh dieback in different regions of the United States exhibits considerable variability in symptoms, processes, and theoretical or proven causes. On Cape Cod (Massachusetts), where losses within the low-marsh zone (elevations below mean high tide, dominated by smooth cordgrass [Spartina alterniflora Loisel.]) have been particularly severe, recent studies suggest that intense grazing pressure from increased abundances of a native, herbivorous, purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) is to blame. Low-marsh dieback is spatially heterogeneous because it is closely related to the distribution of the crabs' preferred substrate (peat us. sand or mud). However, vegetation losses have also occurred in the high marsh, which is comprised of mainly saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens [Aiton] Muhl). In contrast to the low marsh, high-marsh losses consistently occur along the seaward-most edge of this zone, suggesting a link with hydrology (flooding frequency). In this study, we attempted to determine the relative contribution of environmental factors and crab herbivory to high-marsh dieback. To do this, we (1) characterized tidal regimes in dieback vs. healthy areas, (2) assessed the extent of herbivory on S. patens using crab-exclosure cages, (3) documented the ability of S. patens to recover from simulated grazing (clipping) in different marshes and in different areas of individual marshes, and (4) estimated densities of S. reticulatum in two high-marsh dieback areas. The results indicate that S. patens losses are likely the result of a combination of stressors. Flooding frequency and salinities are higher in dieback areas, which impart a higher level of physiological stress. Plants growing there also seem to have a much-reduced capacity to recover from both simulated and actual grazing by the herbivorous crab, S. reticulatum. Continued losses of high-marsh vegetation could eliminate this community from coastal wetlands on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

AB It is widely appreciated that management shapes the dynamics of many ecological systems, but ecologists rarely consider the reverse interaction, that is, the ecological influences on management decisions. Reciprocal feedback between management and ecology can cause complex system behaviour. Therefore, better predictions about how external policy-drivers or climate change will affect semi-natural ecosystems may be made when both the ecological and human dimensions are considered.
   We develop a spatially-explicit model of moorland vegetation dynamics and management decisions about sheep grazing and heather burning in the Peak District National Park, UK. Competition between dwarf shrubs, bracken and graminoids is mediated by grazing, dwarf shrub age (determined by burning rotation) and environmental gradients. Management decisions depend on vegetation cover in a model parameterized through interviews with upland managers.
   Current management regimes are designed to reverse historical dwarf shrub losses, and simulations suggest that this reversal should occur in the future. After equilibration, grazing densities fall and dwarf shrubs have expanded from their current distribution, mainly at the expense of graminoids. This causes more land to come under managed burning, but current intensities are maintained.
   Enforcing winter or summer grazing densities influences model vegetation cover and causes other aspects of the management strategy to adapt. For example, when summer grazing is banned, dwarf shrub cover increases and there is a shift towards grouse moor management.
   Simulations with warmer temperatures indicate that climate change may increase bracken invasion of the moorland and prevent re-vegetation of bare peat. This is associated with a reduction in managed burning that causes the dwarf shrub community to become dominated by the older, degenerate growth phase.
   Synthesis and applications. Our model suggests that current management paradigms could achieve their aim of restoring historically degraded moorland over the coming century, but that climate change may prevent this from occurring. One application of the model would be to try to design management paradigms that are robust to this. As such, models of coupled human-natural systems can provide a valuable tool for assessing the impacts of policy decisions and climate change on semi-natural ecosystems at landscape scales.

AB Forests play a primary role in the cycling and storage of mercury (Hg) in terrestrial ecosystems. This study aimed to assess differences in Hg cycling and storage resulting from different vegetation at two adjacent forest stands - beech and spruce. The study site Nacetin in the Czech Republic's Black Triangle received high atmospheric loadings of Hg from coal combustion in the second half of the 20th century as documented by peat accumulation rates reaching 100 mu g m(-2) y(-1). In 2004, the annual litterfall Hg flux was 22.5 mu g m(-2) y(-1) in the beech stand and 14.5 mu g m(-2) y(-1) in the spruce stand. Soil concentrations and pools of Hg had a strong positive relation to soil organic matter and concentrations of soil sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N). O-horizon Hg concentrations ranged from 245 to 495 mu g kg(-1) and were greater in the spruce stand soil, probably as a result of greater dry Hg deposition. Mineral soil Hg concentrations ranged from 51 to 163 mu g kg(-1) and were greater in the beech stand soil due to its greater capacity to store organic carbon (C). The Hg/C ratio increased with depth from 0.3 in the O-horizon to 3.8 mu g g(-1) in the C horizon of spruce soil and from 0.7 to 2.7 mu g g(-1) in beech soil. The Hg/C ratio was greater at all mineral soil depths in the spruce stand. The organic soil Hg pools in beech and spruce stands (6.4 and 5.7 mg m(-2), respectively) were considerably lower than corresponding mineral soil Hg pools (39.1 and 25.8 mg m(-2)). Despite the important role of S in Hg cycling, differences in soil Hg distribution at both stands could not be attributed to differences in soil sulfur speciation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Laboratory incubations, gas and solute analyses, and stable isotope methods were used to investigate the pathway of methanogenesis in 25 wetland peats of varying vegetation composition along a latitudinal gradient in Alaska. Sites were divided into gross vegetation classes indicative of tropic status: mostly Sphagnum (class 1); Sphagnum plus vascular plants (i. e., Carex) (class 2); mostly vascular plants, but still containing Sphagnum (class 3), and; sites dominated by vascular plants with no visible Sphagnum species (class 4). The magnitude of CO2, acetate and CH4 as end products of anaerobic metabolism varied greatly, but ratios of end product formation indicative of differences in the pathway of C flow and methanogenesis corresponded with vegetation classes, especially at the extremes, e. g., acetate-C accounted for 67% of total C production in Sphagnum-rich sites (class 1) decreasing to 13% in sites devoid of sphagna (class 4). Conversely, CH4 comprised only 0.4% of products in class 1 sites, but increased to 14% in class 4. Total respiration rates (sum of all three products) varied by only a factor of similar to 2 among vegetation classes (200 -440 nmol ml(-1) day(-1)), but rates differed greatly if acetate formation was not included suggesting that belowground C cycling can be much more rapid than previously thought. Apparent fractionation factors (alpha = delta C-13(DIC) + 1000/delta(13) C-CH4 + 1000) that estimate methanogenic pathway, i. e., the relative contribution of CO2 reduction or acetate as precursors of methane, varied from similar to 1.030 to similar to 1.080 and agreed with incubation end product ratios, underscoring the importance of the presence or absence of vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses in affecting the pathway of anaerobic C flow. We contend that methanogenesis in general, including CO2 reduction, is impeded in northern wetlands compared to the production of other C compounds and that its importance decreases with oligotrophy. The connection with vegetation suggests that climate change scenarios leading to increases in vascular plant cover in northern wetlands may shift methanogenic pathways toward increased acetotrophy and increased methane formation, which is a positive feedback on warming.

AB At the 21st session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, COP21), a voluntary action plan, the '4 per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate' was proposed under the Agenda for Action. The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious aspirational target of a 4 per 1000 (i.e. 0.4%) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO2 losses, e.g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target.

AB Some previous studies have investigated the enrichment origin of Sb and Cs in coal, but strong supportive evidence for the sources of the two elements in coal is still absent. The main aims of this study were to provide a better understanding of the geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of the Palaeogene No. 5 Coal from the Zhoujing coal mine, Baise Coalfield, Guangxi Province, southwestern China. The No. 5 Coal has a low rank (0.44% R-o,R-max; 46.96% volatile matter content), an average ash yield 19.37%, and a medium sulfur content (1.23% on average). The main minerals in the No. 5 Coal are kaolinite, illite, quartz, and pyrite. Bassanite (2CaSO(4)center dot(H2O)) was identified in the low-temperature ashes in varying proportions (2.7% - 37.6%). The mineralogy of the non-coal samples (partings, roof and floor strata) is similar to that of the coals but chlorite is additionally present and pyrite is largely absent in these non-coal samples. The modes of calcite occurrence in the partings indicates a terrigenous origin for this phase.
   Compared with average values for world low-rank coals, the No. 5 Coal is distinctively enriched in Sb (29.12 mu g/g), Cs (9.71 mu g/g), and U (15.61 mu g/g). Compared with the average values for world clays, the parting and host rock samples have normal concentrations for most trace elements, with an exception of higher Sb (9.93 mu g/g). The elevated Sb and Cs in the coal were derived from the detrital material shedding from the exposed middle Triassic strata, which host notable Au and Sb deposits in the surrounding region. The REY (rare earth elements and Y) distribution patterns for the coal benches, partings, roof and floor strata are generally characterized by enrichment in medium REY and positive Gd anomalies, both of which were due to acidic waters circulating within the coal basin. The mineral compositions and their association indicate that the depositional environment was weakly acidic at the early stage of peat accumulation and then changed to neutral or weakly alkaline in the later stage.

AB Interpretations of Pennsylvanian sedimentation and peat accumulation commonly use examples from the Appalachian basin because of the excellent outcrops and large reserve of coal (>100 billion metric tons) in the region, Particularly controversial is the origin of Lower and lower Pennsylvanian quartzose sand-stones; beach-barrier, marine-bar, tidal-strait, and fluvial models all have been applied to a series of sand bodies along the western outcrop margin of the basin, Interpretations of these sand stones and the inferred lateral relationships are critical for understanding the relative degree of eustatic, tectonic, and climatic controls on Early Pennsylvanian sedimentation.
   Cross sections utilizing >1000 subsurface records and detailed sedimentological analysis of the Livingston Conglomerate, Rockcastle Sandstone, Corbin Sandstone, and Pine Creek sandstone (an informal member) of the Breathitt Group were used to show that each of the principal quartzose sandstones on the margin of the central Appalachian basin contains both fluvial and marginal marine facies.
   The four sandstones are fluvially dominated and are inferred to represent successive bed-load trunk systems of the Appalachian foreland, Base-level rise and an associated decrease in extra-basinal sediment at the end of each fluvial episode led to the development of local estuaries and marine reworking of the tops of the sand belts, Each of the sand belts is capped locally by a coal, regardless of whether the upper surfaces of the sand belts are of fluvial or estuarine origin, suggesting allocyclic controls on deposition. Feats were controlled by a tropical ever-wet climate, which also influenced sandstone composition through weathering of stored sands in slowly ag-grading braidplains.
   Recurrent stacking of thick, coarse-grained, fluvial deposits with extra-basinal quartz pebbles; dominance of bed-load fluvial-lowstand deposits over mixed-load, estuarine-transgressive deposits; thinning of sand belts around tectonic highs and along faults; cratonward shift and amalgamation of successive sand belts on the margin of the basin; and truncation of successive sand belts toward the fault-bound margin of the basin are interpreted as regional responses to Alleghenian tectonism, inferred to have been the dominant control on accommodation space and sediment flux in the Early Pennsylvanian basin,

AB Coastal karst aquifers are an important source of potable water which can be affected by external forcing on various temporal and spatial scales (e.g. sea-level) but there is a lack of long-term data to understand their response. Sediment cores and their proxy records have been used in lakes and oceans to assess past environmental change, but haven't been extensively applied to anchialine caves where there is less known about the physical, biological and chemical processes affecting sedimentation. Over fifty sediment traps were placed in Yax Chen which is part of the Ox Bel Ha cave system near Tulum, Mexico and four water level sensors were placed in two additional cave systems (Ponderosa, Sac Actun) for comparative water table fluctuations. Data collected over the past three years (2011-2013) captured seasonal and spatial sediment flux including the effect of an intense rainfall associated with Hurricane Ingrid (September 18, 2013). The data indicates that sediment deposition was controlled by cenote size and the presence of mangrove. Areas upstream of Cenote Gemini had negligible sediment accumulation as there were few cenotes and the terrain is dominated by lowland tropical forest, while areas downstream from Cenote Gemini were dominated by mangrove forests and larger cenotes which resulted in higher sediment accumulation rates (0.014 vs. 0.22 mg/cm(2)/day). Bi-annual sedimentation rates in 2013-2014 were higher in the months after the rainy season (0.2 vs. 0.5 mg/cm(2)/day) indicating that cenote productivity was likely controlling sedimentation. Mangrove areas with their peat accumulations occlude the porous karst causing funneling of nutrient rich rainwater into the sunlit cenotes enhancing primary productivity and sedimentation in downstream areas. Hurricane Ingrid had little effect on the yearly sediment rate even though water table fluctuations were high (0.7 m) compared to the yearly values (0.3 m). This likely is due to water bypassing the cenotes with little residence time to enhance productivity and sedimentation in downstream areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of different coal lithotypes on grindability has been investigated using lignite from two of the most important Upper Miocene lignite basins in Serbia (Kolubara and Kostolac). Yellow xylite-rich types demonstrated the most negative impact on Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI). All different types of xylite-rich coal, as well as total xylite-rich coal from the Kolubara basin have a negative influence on the grindability properties, while only the yellow type of xylite-rich coal from the Kostolac showed a negative impact on HGI. Matrix coal does not show a clear effect on HGI.
   A negative correlation between textinite content and HGI is observed in both basins, whereas contents of other macerals do not show influence on grindability properties.
   Content of total organic carbon demonstrated the negative impact on HGI. Correlation analysis indicates that the negative impact of the yellow type of xylite-rich coal and the sum of total xylite-rich coal on the grindability properties partly can be related to content of total organic carbon and high amount of soluble organic matter. Matrix lithotype does not show any significant correlation with bulk geochemical parameters in both basins. The peat-forming vegetation of all samples from both basins were dominated by decay-resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, belonging to one or several of the families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Lignite from the Kolubara basin is characterized by a higher contribution of angiosperm vegetation than coal from the Kostolac basin. Peatification of the Kolubara coal occurred under more oxic conditions than the Kostolac one.
   Analysis of biomarkers indicated that the negative impact of all types of xylite-rich coal from the Kolubara on HGI can be related to the higher proportion of angiosperms, abundance of mid-chain n-alkanes and sesquiterpenoids, aromatization of non-hopanoid triterpenoids and hopanoids, and intense degradation of wood tissues in a more oxic environment. The positive impact of matrix coal on HGI in the Kolubara samples can be attributed to elevated content of non-aromatic hopanoids and low amounts of aromatic non-hopanoid triterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, which seems to hinder the grindability properties.

AB Large amounts of sulfate and divalent iron (Fe) are released into the pore water of acid sulfate (AS) soils upon oxidation of sulfidic materials. The simultaneously produced acidity dissolves metals from the soil matrix. Reduced horizons of AS soils commonly have a large mineral nitrogen (N) stock in the form of NH4+-N, which is a potential source of N leaching and gaseous emissions. This study was carried out at three AS soil sites in Finland. Cation composition of pore water was monitored in a monolithic lysimeter experiment. Timothy samples grown in an AS soil were analysed for mineral elements and the soil was investigated for zinc (Zn) distribution in different chemical species at four depths down to 85 cm. The composition of pipestems formed in previous root channels was investigated by SEM, X-ray EDX and XRD. Emissions of CO2 and N2O were measured in an AS field which had a peaty topsoil. Monitoring by closed chambers was carried out at three sites differing in the depth of peat layer (15, 30 and 60 cm). In the sulfuric horizon, large amounts of calcium and magnesium were mobilized. Reflooding stopped the mobilization of those elements but resulted in abundant dissolution of Fe, which became the dominant cation in the pore water. Timothy growing in an AS soil showed only small deviations from the average composition measured in Finland with the exception of Zn that was at the deficiency level. As Zn in the root zone had been dissolved and subsequently leached, it was recovered in easily soluble forms in the subsoil. Pipestem composition indicated accumulation of Fe and formation of a new solid phase probably mostly in the form of schwertmannite even though jarosite was also detected. The annual CO2 emissions from the peaty AS soil were about 6000 kg C ha(-1) but the (NO)-O-2 emissions were relatively small, with a magnitude more typical of mineral rather than organic soils. Thus, large N stock of an AS soil do not necessarily contribute to abundant gaseous N emissions.

AB In Europe and North America the prevailing model of "natural" lowland streams is incised-meandering channels with silt-clay floodplains, and this is the typical template for stream restoration. Using both published and new unpublished geological and historical data from Europe we critically review this model, show how it is inappropriate for the European context, and examine the implications for carbon sequestration and Riverine Ecosystem Services (RES) including river rewilding. This paper brings together for the first time, all the pertinent strands of evidence we now have on the long-term trajectories of floodplain system from sediment-based dating to sedaDNA. Floodplain chronostratigraphy shows that early Holocene streams were predominantly multi-channel (anabranching) systems, often choked with vegetation and relatively rarely single-channel actively meandering systems. Floodplains were either non-existent or limited to adjacent organic-filled palaeochannels, spring/valley mires and flushes. This applied to many, if not most, small to medium rivers but also major sections of the larger rivers such as the Thames, Seine, Rhone, Lower Rhine, Vistula and Danube. As shown by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating during the mid-late Holocene c. 4-2 ka BP, overbank silt-clay deposition transformed European floodplains, covering former wetlands and silting-up secondary channels. This was followed by direct intervention in the Medieval period incorporating weir and mill based systems- part of a deep engagement with rivers and floodplains which is even reflected in river and floodplain settlement place names. The final transformation was the "industrialisation of channels" through hard-engineering - part of the Anthropocene great acceleration. The primary causative factor in transforming pristine floodplains was accelerated soil erosion caused by deforestation and arable fanning, but with effective sediment delivery also reflecting climatic fluctuations. Later floodplain modifications built on these transformed floodplain topographies. So, unlike North America where channel-floodplain transformation was rapid, the transformation of European streams occurred over a much longer time-period with considerable spatial diversity regarding timing and kind of modification. This has had implications for the evolution of RES including reduced carbon sequestration over the past millennia. Due to the multi-faceted combination of catchment controls, ecological change and cultural legacy, it is impractical, if not impossible, to identify an originally natural condition and thus restore European rivers to their pre-transformation state (naturalisation). Nevertheless, attempts to restore to historical (pre-industrial) states allowing for natural floodplain processes can have both ecological and carbon offset benefits, as well as additional abiotic benefits such as flood attenuation and water quality improvements. This includes rewilding using beaver reintroduction which has overall positive benefits on river corridor ecology. New developments, particularly biomolecular methods offer the potential of unifying modern ecological monitoring with the reconstruction of past ecosystems and their trajectories.
   The sustainable restoration of rivers and floodplains designed to maximise desirable RES and natural capital must be predicated on the awareness that Anthropocene rivers are still largely imprisoned in the banks of their history and this requires acceptance of an increased complexity for the achievement and maintenance of desirable restoration goals.

AB Vegetation uptake of atmospheric mercury (Hg) is an important mechanism enhancing atmospheric Hg deposition via litterfall and senescence. We here report Hg concentrations and pool sizes of different plant functional groups and plant species across nine tundra sites in northern Alaska. Significant spatial differences were observed in bulk vegetation Hg concentrations at Toolik Field station (52 +/- 9 mu g kg(-1)), Eight Mile Lake Observatory (40 +/- 0.2 mu g kg(-1)), and seven sites along a transect from Toolik Field station to the Arctic coast (36 +/- 9 mu g kg(-1)). Hg concentrations in non-vascular vegetation including feather and peat moss (58 +/- 6 mu g kg(-1) and 34 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1), respectively) and brown and white lichen (41 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1) and 34 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1), respectively), were three to six times those of vascular plant tissues (8 +/- 1 mu g kg(-1) in dwarf birch leaves and 9 +/- 1 mu g kg(-1) in tussock grass). A high representation of non-vascular vegetation in above ground biomass resulted in substantial Hg mass contained in tundra above ground vegetation (29 mu g m(-2)), which fell within the range of foliar Hg mass estimated for forests in the United States (15 to 45 mu g m(-2)) in spite of much shorter growing seasons.
   Hg stable isotope signatures of different plant species showed that atmospheric Hg(0) was the dominant source of Hg to tundra vegetation. Mass-dependent isotope signatures (delta Hg-202) in vegetation relative to atmospheric Hg (0) showed pronounced shifts towards lower values, consistent with previously reported isotopic fractionation during foliar uptake of Hg(0). Mass-independent isotope signatures (Delta Hg-199) of lichen were more positive relative to atmospheric Hg(0), indicating either photochemical reduction of Hg(II) or contributions of inorganic Hg (II) from atmospheric deposition and/or dust Delta Hg-199 and Delta Hg-200 values in vascular plant species were similar to atmospheric Hg(0) suggesting that overall photochemical reduction and subsequent re-emission was relatively insignificant in these tundra ecosystems, in agreement with previous Hg(0) ecosystem flux measurements.

AB The influence of different coal lithotypes on grindability has been investigated using lignite from two of the most important Upper Miocene lignite basins in Serbia (Kolubara and Kostolac). Yellow xylite-rich types demonstrated the most negative impact on Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI). All different types of xylite-rich coal, as well as total xylite-rich coal from the Kolubara basin have a negative influence on the grindability properties, while only the yellow type of xylite-rich coal from the Kostolac showed a negative impact on HGI. Matrix coal does not show a clear effect on HGI.
   A negative correlation between textinite content and HGI is observed in both basins, whereas contents of other macerals do not show influence on grindability properties.
   Content of total organic carbon demonstrated the negative impact on HGI. Correlation analysis indicates that the negative impact of the yellow type of xylite-rich coal and the sum of total xylite-rich coal on the grindability properties partly can be related to content of total organic carbon and high amount of soluble organic matter. Matrix lithotype does not show any significant correlation with bulk geochemical parameters in both basins. The peat-forming vegetation of all samples from both basins were dominated by decay-resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, belonging to one or several of the families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Lignite from the Kolubara basin is characterized by a higher contribution of angiosperm vegetation than coal from the Kostolac basin. Peatification of the Kolubara coal occurred under more oxic conditions than the Kostolac one.
   Analysis of biomarkers indicated that the negative impact of all types of xylite-rich coal from the Kolubara on HGI can be related to the higher proportion of angiosperms, abundance of mid-chain n-alkanes and sesquiterpenoids, aromatization of non-hopanoid triterpenoids and hopanoids, and intense degradation of wood tissues in a more oxic environment. The positive impact of matrix coal on HGI in the Kolubara samples can be attributed to elevated content of non-aromatic hopanoids and low amounts of aromatic non-hopanoid triterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, which seems to hinder the grindability properties.

AB A quantitative diatom analysis was carried out on a sediment core from the small infilled lake basin of Marcacocha and was compared with other proxy data (e.g., pollen and plant macroremains) in order to reconstruct environmental changes between 800 and 1850 AD in the Cuzco region of SE Peru. Five stratigraphical zones were distinguished by means of constrained cluster analysis. Very few diatoms were present between 790 and 1070 AD, possibly reflecting dry and cool conditions, at a time when anthropogenic impact was limited around the basin. These conditions were probably interrupted by several flooding events, causing short-term macrophyte-dominated stages in the lake. The transition at ca. 1070 AD represented the most prominent change in the diatom record and corresponded with a marked shift towards higher temperatures, as deduced from plant macroremains and the pollen record. This transition further coincided with a sudden climate shift recorded elsewhere in tropical South America. Between 1070 and 1650 AD, our proxy data indicate the existence of a stable, shallow lake as evidenced by increased diatom production and high concentrations of charophyte oospores. The transition in the diatom data at ca. 1650 AD, with peaks in diatom abundance centered on 1700 AD, lags the start of the "Little Ice Age" (LIA; around 1490-1530 AD), though matches a major cool and dry phase of the LIA at the end of the 17(th) and early 18(th) centuries as recorded in Peruvian ice cores. This could be caused by a threshold that was passed after the lake level had lowered sufficiently, due to a cooling climate causing a drier lake environment, combined with infilling processes. Further transitions in the diatom community may be interpreted less in terms of climatic change, and more as increasing sensitivity to local environmental changes, such as lake level decrease due to infilling processes and increased anthropogenic activity in the catchment area. The final stage of infilling occurred after ca. 1845 AD, with complete colonization of the remaining lake surface by Juncaceae and the ongoing accumulation of peat.

AB Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle and thus global carbon budgets. Climate variability affects amount of material entering and the metabolic balance of wetlands, thereby modifying carbon dynamics. This study presents spatiotemporal changes in air-water CO2 exchange in the vast wetlands of Donana (Spain) in relation to different hydrological cycles. Water sources feeding Donana, including groundwater and streams, ultimately depend on the fluctuating balance between annual precipitation and evapotranspiration. Hence, in order to examine the contribution of the rainfall pattern to the emission/capture of CO2 by a range of aquatic habitats in Donana, we took monthly measurements during severely wet, dry, and normal hydrological years (2010-2013). During wet hydrological cycles, CO2 outgassing from flooded marshes markedly decreased in comparison to that observed during subsequent dry-normal cycles, with mean values of 25.8419 and 5.28mmolm(-2)d(-1), respectively. Under drier meteorological conditions, air-water CO2 fluxes also diminished in permanent floodplains and ponds, which even behaved as mild sinks for atmospheric CO2 during certain periods. Increased inputs of dissolved CO2 from the underground aquifer and the stream following periods of high rainfall are believed to be behind this pattern. Large lagoons with a managed water supply from an adjacent estuary took up atmospheric CO2 nearly permanently. Regional air-water carbon transport was 15.2GgCyr(-1) under wet and 1.24GgCyr(-1) under dry meteorological conditions, well below the estimated net primary production for Donana wetlands, indicating that the ecosystem acts as a large CO2 sink.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle, representing important contributors to the global carbon budget. Climate variability affects productivity in wetlands, thereby modifying their capacity to act as sink or source for atmospheric CO2. This study addresses how the hydrological cycle influences the capacity for carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean wetlands of Donana. Covering a surface of 3560km(2), Donana region includes a rich variety of landforms and vegetation types representative of Mediterranean lowlands. Its wetlands are one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe with a high biotic diversity and unique importance for aquatic wildfowl. The region experiences annual cycles of flooding (October to March) and desiccation (May to June), with the inundation cycles being dependent on rainfall. Our measurements suggest that drier meteorological conditions result in lower CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from flooded marshes and permanent ponds whereas large lagoons with man-managed water supply from an adjacent estuary behave as carbon sequestrators. Predictions indicate an increasing frequency of droughts over the Mediterranean region due to climate change. These results highlight the importance of water management in Donana for wetlands conservation and their role in the atmospheric CO2 exchange.

TI Not seeing the carbon for the trees? Why area-based targets for
   establishing new woodlands can limit or underplay their climate change
   mitigation benefits
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Afforestation; Emissions; Mitigation; Targets; Soils; Carbon
AB Area-based targets for afforestation are a frequent and prominent component of policy discourses on forestry, land use and climate change emissions abatement. Such targets imply an expected contribution of afforestation to the net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, yet the nature of afforestation undertaken and its geographical distribution means that there is considerable uncertainty over the eventual emission reductions outcomes. This uncertainty is reduced if the net carbon balance is calculated for all potential afforestation sites, considering climate, soil characteristics and the possible types of afforestation (species and management regimes). To quantify the range of possible emissions outcomes for area-based afforestation targets, a new spatial analysis method was implemented. This improved the integration of spatial data on antecedent land use with mapped outputs from forest models defining the suitability and productivity of eleven forestry management alternatives. This above ground carbon data was then integrated with outputs from the ECOSSE (Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils Sequestration and Emissions) model which simulates the soil carbon dynamics. The maps and other model output visualisations combining above and below ground carbon highlight where net carbon surpluses and deficits are likely to occur, how long they persist after afforestation and their relationships with antecedent land use, soils, weather conditions and afforestation management strategies. Using more productive land classes delivers more net sequestration per hectare and could mean greater carbon storage than anticipated by emissions reduction plans. Extensive establishment of lower yielding trees on low-quality ground, with organo-mineral soils could, though, result in net emissions that persist for decades. From the spatial analysis, the range of possible outcomes for any target area of planting is substantial, meaning that outcomes are highly sensitive to policy and implementation decisions on the mix of forestry systems preferred and to spatial targeting or exclusions (both at regional and local scales). The paper highlights the importance of retaining the existing presumption against planting of deep peat areas, but also that additional incentives or constraints may be needed to achieve the aggregate rates of emission mitigation implied by policy commitments. Supplementary carbon storage tonnage targets for new forestry would introduce a floor for carbon sequestration outcomes, but would still allow for flexibility in achieving an appropriate balance in the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and the many other objectives that new woodlands are expected to deliver.

AB Coal beds that occur in the Dunkard Group are typically thin (avg. 0.3 m), and are high in ash yield (avg. 27.8%) and total sulfur content (avg. 5.1%). Petrographically, Dunkard coals are high in vitrinite (avg. 83.1%, mmf), with correspondingly low to moderate amounts of liptinite (avg. 2.1%, mmf) and inertinite (avg. 13.8%, mmf). Palynologically, Dunkard coal beds are all dominated by tree fern spore taxa (avg. 963%), especially Punctatisporites minutus (avg. 82.8%). Calamite spores are the second most abundant plant group (avg. 2.4%), with others (lycopods, small ferns, Cordaites and other gymnosperms) having very minor representation. Overall, the coal palynofloras are strongly dominated by lowland plants (ferns and Calamites), with only rare occurrences of bisaccate-striate conifer pollen.
   Coal beds of the underlying Monongahela Group (Pittsburgh, Redstone, Sewickley and Waynesburg) are thicker (avg. 1.6 m), and are lower in ash (avg. 13.4%) and sulfur (avg. 33%) than their Dunkard counterparts. Petrographically, Monongahela Group coals are very similar to Dunkard Group coals, when compared on a mineral matter free basis; coal beds that occur in both groups are strongly dominated by vitrinite macerals. Monongahela Group coals are also palynologically very similar to Dunkard Group coals, with tree fern spore taxa dominating. A coal bed of early Permian age from west-central Texas is also similar, petrographically and palynologically, to Dunkard and Monongahela coals, being vitrinite and tree fern spore dominant. The almost complete lack of coniferous pollen in Dunkard coals led earlier workers to conclude that the Dunkard was entirely Late Pennsylvanian, and not Permian, in age. However, it is now known that Late Pennsylvania lowland floras persisted into the Dunkard, especially during wet intervals. As earlier interpretations were based primarily on spore and pollen floras from coal beds, the lack of conifer pollen in Dunkard coals is probably the result of a sampling bias. Because of this ecological bias, coal palynology is a poor proxy for age dating Dunkard Group coals.
   Collectively, Dunkard swamps were all planar and topogenous, their formation being controlled by topography and moisture availability. A progressive decrease in wet intervals, both in terms of frequency and duration, during the Dunkard was the major control on peat accumulation and preservation. Collectively, moisture limitation appears to be the principle factor that controlled the formation of Dunkard Group coals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Late Permian coal measures of the Bowen Basin, Australia express both environmental and climatic changes that occurred prior to the Permian Triassic (P-T) boundary. In order to decouple the influence of environmental factors (salinity, pH, base level and temperature) from depositional and climatic factors (atmospheric CO2) in organic delta C-13, a high resolution study was performed on 24 coal seams (total 24.6 m) in the Late Permian stratigraphy in the northern Bowen Basin. The Late Permian stratigraphy of the Bowen Basin records a transition from deltaic and lacustrine conditions within the Tinowan Formation and Black Alley Shale Formation, to fluvial deposition in the Kaloola and Bandanna Formations. Intermittent volcanism is recorded by tuff layers during periods of peat accumulation. Variations of coal lithotypes were recorded and formed the basis of sampling for petrography and isotope analysis. Coal samples were etched to expose cellular anatomy, and systematically identified to recognise palaeoflora assemblages. When observed within seam, delta C-13 of the coal varied cyclically (C-13 enriched-depleted-enriched) as a response to environmental changes expressed in palaeoflora communities. The total range of delta C-13 was -26.6 parts per thousand to -21.9 parts per thousand. The overall trend of delta C-13 progresses to increasing C-13 enrichment, corresponding with dull lithotypes (rich in inertinite) which indicate fluctuations in base level. The C-13 enrichment peaks at -22.5 parts per thousand within the Kaloola Member and shifting rapidly toward a depletion (maximum -26.6 parts per thousand) of C-13 in the upper Bandanna Formation, prior to the P-T boundary. These changes are expressed in palaeoflora communities where ecosystems shifted from dominant Glossopteris flora, to climax community flora including Palaeosmunda, Cycadales and Ginkgo, suited to temperate, early Mesozoic climates. The results of this study represent an insight into the effects of environmental variables on C-13 uptake of plants. The identification of flora within coal gives an insight into palaeowetland evolution, and can be partnered with classic petrographical techniques for integrated analysis in coals. Both the geochemistry and the anatomical aspects of coal represent an important tool for future palaeowetland research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Question: What are the tempo and mode of long-term succession and of demographic processes in an alpine community, especially: tenacity, transition patterns, predictions. growth of individual cushion plants, cyclic succession, spatial patterns?
   Location: A low-alpine mixed cushion/turf/snow-tussock shrub community in southeastern New Zealand. Methods: The distribution of seven plant cover-types was recorded at 1024 fixed points in an 8 m x 8 m plot at approximately decade intervals for 50 years. The diameters of eight Donatia novae-zelandiae cushions were monitorec.
   Results: The process was essentially first-order Markovian. There was a chance in transition frequencies about 1980. The tenacity of the two major cover types - cushion and turf - was high. but that of cushion decreased about 1980 as some of its area was taken over by turf. The original informal prediction of 1955 that the cushion/turf Would increase proved to be correct. probably because of paludification of the site. A prediction of 1987 made from observed transitions that cushion would dominate over turf has proved untrue because of a change in the transition probabilities in the 1980s, of unknown cause. There is a ten-fold range in diameter growth rates among the eight cushions measured, but the mean rate of 5.3 mm.a(-1) is similar to that reported from other alpine and arctic sites. As cushions aged. turf colonized their centres, and in two cases new cushions colonized into this turf: consistent with cyclic succussion. The pattern of transitions was compatible with a general interpretation Of Cyclic succession. but not definitive.
   Conclusions: Change is slow in this alpine community, and tenacity high. The change in transition frequencies about 1980. the invasion of individual Cushions, and the decrease in spatial autocorrelation all suggest that Cushions established on the site as a result of the clearance of woody vegetation after 1400 AD. Paludification may be causing some loss Of tussock grass. A tendency for the cushions to break Lip, and the shallow peat accumulated below them, may indicate that they are the first generation of cushions on the site. Though these cushions are breaking up, other cushions are establishing, and cushions will continue to be ail important part of the vegetation dynamics which may be part of a cyclic succession.

AB Mineralogy and geochemistry of the four main workable coal seams (No.6, No.7, No.8, and No.11) of Late Permian age from the Songzao Coalfield, Chongqing, Southwest China, were examined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), cold-vapor absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS), ion-selective electrode (ISE), scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The results showed that the main workable No.8 Coal that accounts for about 60% of the total coal reserves in the Songzao Coalfield was not enriched in hazardous trace elements. The No.11 Coal has high concentrations of alkaline elements, Be (9.14 mu g/g), Sc (12.9 mu g/g), Ti (9508 mu g/g), Mn (397 mu g/g), Co (23.7 mu g/g), Cu (108 mu g/g), Zn (1123 mu g/g), Gia (32 mu g/g), Zr (1304 mu g/g), Nb (169 mu g/g), Hf (32.7 mu g/g), Ta (11.4 mu g/g), W (24.8 mu g/g), Hg (0.28 mu g/g), Pb (28.1 mu g/g), Th (24.1 mu g/g), and rare earth elements (509.62 mu g/g). The concentration of Nb and Ta in the No. 11 Coal is higher than the industrial grade, and their potential utilization should be further studied. Besides pyrite, quartz, calcite, and clay minerals, trace minerals including chalcopyrite, marcasite, siderite, albite, mixed-layer clay minerals of illite and smectite, monazite, apatite, anatase, chlorite, and gypsum were found in the No.11 Coal. It should be noted that alabandite of hydrothermal origin and anatase occurring as cement were identified in coal. In addition, the clayey microbands derived from alkaline volcanic ashes were identified in the coal. The dominant compositions of these clayey microbands were mixed-layer clay minerals of illite and smectite, which were interlayered with organic bands. The modes of occurrence of alkaline volcanic ash bands indicate that the volcanic activities were characterized by the multiple eruptions, short time interval and small scale for each eruption during peat accumulation. The alkaline volcanic ashes were the dominant factors for the enrichment of alkaline elements, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and rare earth elements, and the sulfide minerals are the main carriers of Ga, Cu, and Hg in the No. 11 Coal.

AB A number of coal seams of Late Carboniferous age in the coal-bearing Karadon, Kozlu, and Alacaagzt formations have been mined in several deep underground mines in the Zonguldak Basin (NW Turkey). For this study, a total of 154 coal core samples were collected from three research wells that were drilled in the tectonically complex settings of the Kozlu coalfield. All the coal samples were studied by means of coal petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry. Special attention was given to the compositions and origins of fracture/cleat-filling minerals that were identified by SEM-EDX on polished blocks. The coal seams investigated are of bituminous rank. They are characterized by low total sulphur contents (<= 1.0%, on dry basis) and high gross calorific values (22.5-40.2 MJ/kg, on dry, ash-free basis), whereas ash yields and volatile matter contents are variable. X-ray powder diffraction data indicate that the mineralogical compositions of the studied coal seams are rather similar, and clay minerals, along with quartz and carbonate minerals, were identified in almost all seams. The statistical evaluations and SEM data show that some elements such as Mg, Ti, Zr, Nb, and Th are generally affiliated with silicate minerals, whereas elements like Cu, Zn, Mo, and Pb are mainly associated with sulphide minerals. The silicate minerals are generally detrital, and the majority of carbonate minerals are of epigenetic origin. The epigenetic carbonate and sulphide minerals suggest that circulated solutions within coal seams were mainly derived from Ca2+-ricb solutions leached from overlying formations such as Cretaceous aged Zonguldak formations and from hydrothermal solutions that likely were derived from andesitic dykes within the basin. The regional tectonic activities during coalification seem to have deformed coal-bearing formations and, therefore, intra-basinal solutions could have penetrated into the studied coal seams. The epigenetic mineralisation also resulted in elemental enrichments and elevated ash yields, total sulphur, and volatile matter contents in some coal seams. Thus, deformation during coalification controlled some coal quality parameters in the studied wells. The coal fades diagrams suggest that palaeomires mostly accumulated under limno-telmatic conditions, whereas a telmatic environment was more common in palaeomires of the Kozlu Formation. Coal petrography suggests that peat-forming vegetation and water tables in palaeomires were changeable during the Late Carboniferous.

AB The Okavango Delta, situated in the Kalahari Desert (Botswana), is host to extensive areas of seasonal swamp that are characterised by the presence of numerous tree-covered islands. Islands have been shown to play an important role in the landscape through the creation of habitat diversity, focusing of nutrients, and sequestration of salts. Islands are thought to grow through the subsurface precipitation of carbonate and silica, although recent work has suggested that other factors may be involved, notably airborne dust accumulation. In this study, we investigate the role of airborne dust in the maintenance and growth of tree islands in the seasonal swamps of the Okavango Delta. Chemical and grain size analyses indicate that whilst the channels and floodplains in the Okavango are dominated by well-sorted Kalahari sand that covers the entire region, material on the surface of islands is distinctly different. Island soils are enriched in Al2O3 and are characterised by higher proportions of poorly sorted, fine-grained material that we attribute to the addition of airborne dust. Large quantities of material that circulate in anticyclonic systems over southern Africa represent a potentially significant source of particulate sediment to the Okavango, whilst peat fires and the desiccation of the surrounding floodplains during the dry season are also considered to be important sources of local dust. The data suggest that varying proportions of Kalahari sand, dust, and chemical precipitate give rise to the range of compositions found on and within the islands of the Delta. Dust typically accounts for between 20 and 60% of material found on the surface of islands, whilst dust and chemical precipitate dominate the subsurface material. Islands thus appear to grow through a combination of ongoing surface and subsurface processes that result in considerable heterogeneity in soil composition. In both instances vegetation, especially trees, is the main driving force behind island development, not only causing the subsurface accumulation of CaCO3 and SiO2 in island soils, but also trapping airborne dust on the surface of islands. Our study suggests that dust fallout is an equally or possibly even more important contributor to the local topographic irregularities and thus habitat diversity in the Okavango Delta. Despite the potential importance of airborne material to the biogeochemistry and development of tree islands in wetland systems, our knowledge regarding these processes remains poor.

AB Coal reserves of Lower Eocene age are limited in Turkey and the most important are situated in the Sorgun and Suluova basins. A thick and laterally extensive coal seam occurs at the base of the Celtek Formation in the two basins. The Celtek Formation was developed in a fluvial-lacustrine facies and was unconformably overlain by transgressive units of Middle-Upper Eocene age. The coal samples were studied mineralogically and petrographically, and to define fluorescence emission spectra of sporinite and cutinite. A total of 75 coal samples collected from the two basins are characterized, on an air-dried basis, by relatively low moisture contents (0.69-9.31 wt%, av. 3.90 wt%), a broad range of ash yields (2.4-67.8 wt%, av. 19.9 wt%), total sulphur contents (0.55-7.60 wt%, av. 2.15 wt%), and calorific values (1689-7480 kcal/kg, av. 5458 kcal/kg). Minerals of the coals from the two basins determined on an air-dried basis by X-ray diffraction method are mainly kaolinite, quartz and pyrite. Kaolinite and pyrite contents of the Sorgun coals are higher and quartz contents are lower than those of the Suluova coals. In addition, a few samples in the Sorgun coals contain epigenetic calcite, whereas some samples in the Suluova coals contain syngenetic siderite, calcite and dolomite. The coals in general are characterized by high contents of macerals of the huminite group (av. 69.0 vol%), and contain liptinite (av. 4.9 vol%), inertinite (av. 0.8 vol%) and mineral matter (av. 25.3 vol%). On the TPI and GI diagram the coals plot in the limno-telmatic and telmatic areas in which the Sorgun and Suluova peats accumulated between the high and low water tables. Fluorescence emission spectra of sporinite and cutinite macerals are, in general, similar in the coals of both basins, but the spectral maxima of sporinites and cutinites are between 594-658 nm and 592-671 nm respectively. The values for the sporinites indicate a relatively broad range of coal rank. However, the range of values of the mean random ulminite (mainly eu-ulminite A) reflectances (0.46-0.60%Rr, av. 0.53%Rr), the proximate and ultimate analyses imply that the rank is a subbituminous A coal transitional to high-volatile C bituminous coal according to the ASTM classification.

AB The sink Of CO2 and the C budget of forest biomes of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) were assessed with two distinct methods: (1) ecosystem/ecoregional, and (2) forest statistical data. The ecosystem/eroregional method was based on the integration of ecoregions (defined with a GIS analysis of several maps) with soil/vegetation C data bases. The forest statistical approach was based on data on growing stock, annual increment of timber, and FSU yield tables.
   Applying the ecosystem/ecoregional method, the area of forest biomes in the FSU was estimated at 1426.1 Mha (10(6) ha); forest ecosystems comprised 799.9 Mha, non-forest ecosystems and arable land comprised 506.1 and 119.9 Mha, respectively. The FSU forested area was 28% of the global area of closed forests. Forest phytomass (i.e., live plant mass), mortmass (i.e., coarse woody debris), total forest plant mass, and net increment in vegetation (NIV) were estimated at 57.9 t C ha-1, 15.5 t C ha-1, 73.4 t C ha-1, and 1.0 t C ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The 799.9 Mha area of forest ecosystems calculated in the ecosystem/ecoregional method was close to the 814.2 Mha reported in the FSU forest statistical data. Based on forest statistical data forest phytomass was estimated at 62.7 t C ha-1, mortmass at 37.6 t C ha-1; thus the total forest plant mass C pool was 100.3 t C ha-1. The NIV was estimated at 1.1 t C ha-1 yr-1. These estimates compared well with the estimates for phytomass, total forest plant mass, and NIV obtained from the ecosystem/ecoregional method. Mortmass estimated from the forest statistical data method exceeded the estimate based on the ecosystem/ecoregional method by a factor of 2.4. The ecosystem/ecoregional method allowed the estimation of litter, soil organic matter, NPP (net primary productivity), foliage formation, total and stable soil organic matter accumulation, and peat accumulation (13.9 t C ha-1, 125.0 t C ha-1, 3.1 t C ha-1 yr-1, 1.4 t C ha-1 yr-1, 0.11, and 0.056 t C ha-1 yr-1, respectively). Based on an average value of NEP (net ecosystem productivity) from the two methods, and following a consideration of anthropogenic influences, FSU forests were estimated to be a net sink of approximately 0.5 Gt C yr-1 of atmospheric C.

AB Petrographical and geochemical data of gelified and ungelified fossil wood from the Early Miocene Oberdorf lignite seam (Styrian Basin, Austria) provide evidence that the early diagenetic, aerobic degradation of wood by fungi may be followed by further decomposition under reducing conditions by the activity of anaerobic bacteria. Based on the molecular compositions of terpenoid hydrocarbons, the wood fragments in the lignite are identified as gymnosperms. This result is corroborated by the mean isotopic composition (delta(13)C = -24.2parts per thousand) of the macrofossils. The isotopic difference between fossil wood and extracted cellulose of most samples (3.9-2.5parts per thousand) is higher than in modern trees, which can be explained by the smaller effect of C-13 discrimination during decomposition of cellulose when compared with wood. The mean carbon isotope values found for gymnosperms and coals (-24.2parts per thousand and -24.7parts per thousand, respectively) confirm the results from biomarker analyses indicating that the peat-forming vegetation of the Oberdorf seam was dominated by gymnosperm taxa. Minor variation in the relative contributions of gymnosperms and angiosperms to coal deposition is of negligible influence on the isotopic composition of the coals. Cross-correlations between delta(13)C of the coals, soluble organic matter yield, and the proportions of liptinite macerals of higher-plant origin imply that the carbon isotopic composition may be affected by the contents of plant lipids because of their delta(13)C values ranging from 5 to 10parts per thousand less than whole-plant tissue values. An isotopic shift of the coals towards more negative values due to the activity of prokaryotes (i.e. anaerobic bacteria) in organic matter degradation is proposed. The results obtained from the Early Miocene Oberdorf lignite indicate that the carbon isotope ratios of,the coals are primarily affected by varying contributions of different parts of whole-plant tissue, due to their different isotopic and molecular compositions (e.g. epicuticular leaf waxes, resins, wood) and their different decay-resistance against the early diagenetic changes involved in organic matter decomposition. Carbon cycling during anoxic decomposition of plant-derived organic matter is assumed to affect the delta(13)C values of. coal. delta(13)C Values of wood and extracted cellulose are affected only to a minor extent.

AB This study uses coal petrography, micro-FTIR, mineralogical, and geochemical analyses to determine the coal characteristics and controlling factors of elemental enrichments in the Isaalan coal (NW Turkey). The obtained data show that this subbituminous coal has a relatively low ash yield (avg. 19%), high hydrogen content (avg. 5.4%) and total S content (avg. 2.4%), on an air-dry basis. The maceral composition, along with micro-FTIR data on ulminite, suggests that lignin- and resin-rich vegetation was predominant The coal facies data imply the precursor peat was accumulating under, mesotrophic anoxic conditions where water level was high and fluctuating. The mineralogical composition of the bulk coal samples is composed mainly of quartz, pyrite, and clay minerals and lesser amounts of feldspars and carbonates.
   The statistical analysis of the bulk compositional data shows the major elements, including Al, Fe, K, Na, Mg, P, and the vast majority of trace elements, have inorganic affinity, whereas B presumably has organic affinity. The trace element concentrations are variable, and especially As and elements including B, Ba, Cr, Cs, Ni, Sb, and V are enriched compared to most world coals. The enrichments and distributions of Cr, Cs, Ni, and V were controlled by clastic inputs into a palaeomire, whereas As enrichments were controlled mainly by epigenetic and, to a lesser extent, syngenetic factors. Introduced SO4 and As-rich surface- and groundwater from the basin margin area, along with anoxic conditions in the palaeomire, resulted in syngenetic formation of As-bearing pyrite. The circulating intra-seam solutions later liberated As from syngenetically formed pyrite, which resulted in As- and Ni-rich overgrowths around framboidal and massive pyrite crystals. These solutions could also easily mobilize B that was absorbed by organic matter. Therefore, B enrichment appears to be related to epigenetic factors. Tectonic activities during coalification allowed hydrothermal solutions from neighbouring epithermal mineralisation to penetrate and circulate along with underground waters that leached overlying volcanoclastic-volcanic strata and supplied a number of elements to the studied coal. Thus, infilling As-bearing pyrite and silica were formed mainly during coalification. All these results suggest that As-enrichment in the study area is more likely a combination of epigenetic factors and syngenetic-detrital rather than volcanogenic contributions, as suggested earlier for some other Turkish coal deposits.

AB Consecutively to the global sea-level rise, coastal landscapes significantly changed during the Early Holocene. We explored how coastal mutations have affected ancient human systems in the western Mediterranean. The Pego-Oliva basin (Spain) provides a thick sediment sequence located in proximity to two well-studied Mesolithic and Neolithic archaeological sites. Based on 16 sediment cores, sedimentological analyses, C-14 dates, and integration of previous works, we reconstructed the architecture of the sedimentary facies and the chronology of deposition for the last 9500 years. From 9500 to 8200 cal. BP, the stepwise inland migration of the coastline is characterised by the deposition of peat layers at distinct depths indicating four phases of barrier-lagoon systems development. The marine transgression caused the disappearance of the lagoon at 8200 cal. BP, and reached a maximum inland position at 7300 cal. BP. Since 5800 cal. BP, sea-level stabilisation induced coastal progradation and barrier-lagoon system construction. Five marine flooding phases dated at 9500, 9100-9000, 8750-8650, 8450-8200, and 8100-7300 cal. BP match Atlantic meltwater pulses. Comparison to archaeology shows that the long-lasting Mesolithic occupation corresponds to the presence of coastal offering easily exploitable local intertidal resources. In contrast, during the Late Mesolithic, we observe a lagoon contraction and the reduction of lagoon bivalves size arguing for a decrease in resource productivity. This changes in the lagoon ecosystems negatively impacted to Late Mesolithic populations leading to a less intense occupation of this area. Therefore, the 700 years' temporal hiatus between the last hunter-gatherers and the first farmers occupying this area is explained by the disappearance of the formerly exploited biotopes because of sea-level rise, a situation that may have been aggravated by coincidence of the 8200 cal. BP climate event. The maximal sea transgression corresponded to a shift from intertidal to infralittoral species between the Impressa/Precardial and the Postcardial Neolithic, indicating a good adaptation to changing environments at that time. However, comparison between Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic suggests that communities with different cultural baggage have had a different perception of the same environment. By the past perspective, it emphasises that perception of the ecosystem value as a benefit or constraint, and of the risks associated with sea-level rise, relies first on the local and regional scales adaptive capacity of society to global changes.

AB The Permian-Triassic boundary section at Wybung Head, eastern Australia shows a rapid change from humic coal-bearing lowland braided stream through a thin clay and coal breccia and paleosols to semi-arid silt) floodplain deposits. Identifiable plant remains and total organic matter disappear above the coal and cla) breccia. Three characteristic palynofacies accumulated in a range from oxic to sub-oxic to anoxic conditions. The dominance of opaque phytoclasts in the entire sequence reflects deposition under oxic conditions, especially it the sequence lying above the Birdie Coal, the result of fluctuating water tables, high energy and desiccating conditions. In the Birdie Coal, however, at certain horizons, a water-saturated environment favored the pre servation of organic matter such as pollen, spores, and structured organic matter. This latest Permian paleo. vegetation was dominated by opportunistic understory spore-bearing plants, with a canopy of pollen-bearing glossopterids, conifers and cordaitales. Total organic carbon drops from > 30% in the coal, through < 5% in the breccia to < 1% in the paleosols and silts. The organic 513C values are constant at similar to - 25.5 parts per thousand in the coal ant coal breccia, but then decrease to less than - 27 parts per thousand in the paleosols and silts. These results confirm the rapic sedimentary, floral and organic carbon isotope changes across the non-marine Permian-Triassic boundary it eastern Australia. Our delta C-13(org) values suggest a significant and sustained negative delta C-13(org), excursion, with c magnitude of about 3 parts per thousand, above the Birdie Coal. Unlike delta C-13(org), there is no clear trend in delta N-15(org) values. The lots C/N ratios of 10 and less, of the samples above + 55 cm, are only found in modern burned soils with loth bacteria/fungi ratios or in decaying wood. There is no obvious fungal spike in the Wybung Head section, ma) have been destroyed during the formation of this soil B horizon, as elsewhere a global fungal spike layer mark: an interval of decreased terrestrial biomass and decaying vegetation associated with the Permian-Triassic crisis and boundary. Two negative excursions in the uppermost Permian and lowest Triassic can be correlatec throughout Gondwana.

AB Lake basins (similar to 2.7 X 10(6) km(2), about 0.8% of the ocean surface or 2% of the land surface) bury a surprisingly high amount of atmospheric carbon (similar to 70 X 10(6) t/a) which reaches more than one fourth of the annual atmospheric carbon burial in the modern oceans. This is mainly accomplished by the rapid accumulation of lacustrine sediments and a very high preservation factor (on average 50 times higher than that in the oceans). Lakes with relatively large drainage areas commonly display the highest carbon accumulation rates. In most cases, burial of organic matter is more important than that of carbonate carbon produced by silicate weathering, in contrast to the oceans where the burial of atmospheric carbonate carbon almost reaches the same amount as that of organic carbon. Exceptions to this rule are closed lake basins in arid to semiarid climate which precipitate a major part of their atmosphere-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as carbonate. These results are demonstrated in some detail for L. Qinghai, China, (low contribution of atmospheric carbonate carbon) and L. Turkana, East Africa, (high contribution from silicate rocks). Further data are gained by estimates for a number of closed and open lakes. The drainage areas of the lakes withdraw atmospheric carbon at rates of mostly 1-4 g/m(2)/a, calculated from the lacustrine carbon burial. Carbon burial rates in lakes commonly increase with change to wetter and warmer climate (partially larger lake surfaces, higher rates of seasonal carbonate precipitation, trend to stratified lake waters with oxygen-deficient bottom water). Anthropogenic influence mostly enhances the production and preservation of organic carbon in lake basins (often by a factor of 3-4). After the last glacial maximum, the joint action of the globally spreading vegetation, peat growth, and carbon burial in lakes would have been able to reduce the atmospheric carbon pool to one third to one half of its present amount within a time period of 1 ka. However, CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean has brought about an overall increase in the atmospheric CO2 during the Holocene. The contribution of lakes and artificial reservoirs in counteracting matt-made CO2 emissions should not be neglected. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The petrological, geochemical, and mineralogical compositions of 10 coal seams (Early Jurassic) from an exploratory borehole (Hole ZKJ502) in the Jieliangzi mining area of the Yining Coalfield, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, were investigated, using optical microscopy and field emission-scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (FE SEM-EDS), as well as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The Yining coals are of subbituminous to highly volatile C bituminous in rank (vitrinite reflectance, average 0.49%) and are characterized by low sulfur content (average 0.45%), low ash yield (average 4.10%), high volatile matter (average 38.82%), high proportion of inertinite (average 49.5%), and low concentrations of most trace elements. Relative to the upper continental crust, the rare earth elements and yttrium in the Yining coals are mainly characterized by light and heavy REY enrichment. The minerals in the Yining coals are dominated by quartz, kaolinite, and siderite, followed by pyrite, bassanite, and hexahydrite, along with small proportions of illite, calcite, dolomite, gorceixite, goyazite, ankerite, marcasite, diaspore, florencite, hematite, and millerite. The similarity between the Yining coals and the magmatic rocks from the peripheral mountain area of the basin in terms of the Al2O3/TiO2 ratio, the REY enrichment type, the REY distribution patterns, and the Eu anomalous fractionation suggest that the sediment source region was mainly Carboniferous volcanic rocks (andesite and basalts) on peripheral mountains. The acid conditions and lowered water table during peat accumulation may have caused detrital minerals to be leached, leading to the relatively low ash yield. Another reason for the low ash yield may be the simple coalfield structure and poor groundwater migration channels in the rocks and coal seams in the central zone of the basin, which would limit the minerals carried by the groundwater into coals. A number of authigenic minerals (quartz, kaolinite, siderite, and gorceixite) occur as cell-fillings and elevated concentrations of Li, Be, Sc, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Rb, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cs, Hf, W, Pb, Th, and REY occur in Nos. 26 and 27 coals, indicating that there was an injection of a small-scale solution.

AB Application of organic amendments has been proposed as a strategy for the management of diseases caused by soilborne pathogens. However, inconsistent results seriously hinder their practical use. In this work we use an extensive data set of 2423 studies derived from 252 papers to explore this strategy. First, we assess the capability of a specific organic amendment to control different diseases; second, we investigate the influence of organic matter (OM) decomposition on disease suppressiveness; and third, we search for physical, chemical and biological parameters able to identify suppressive OM. OM was found to be consistently suppressive to different pathogens in only a few studies where a limited number of pathogens were tested. In the majority of studies a material suppressive to a pathogen was ineffective or even conducive to other pathogens, suggesting that OM suppressiveness is often pathogen-specific. OM decomposition in many studies (73%, n = 426) emerged as a crucial process affecting suppressiveness. During decomposition, disease suppression either increased, decreased, was unchanged or showed more complex responses, such as 'hump-shaped' dynamics. Peat suppressiveness generally decreased during decomposition, while responses of composts and crop residues were more complex. However, due to the many interactions of contributing factors (OM quality, microbial community composition, pathosystem tested and decomposition time), it was difficult to identify specific predictors of disease suppression. Among the 81 parameters analysed, only some of the 643 correlations showed a consistent relationship with disease suppression. The response of pathogen populations to OM amendments was a reliable feature only for some organic matter types (e.g. crop residues and organic wastes with C-to-N ratio lower than similar to 15) and for pathogens with a limited saprophytic ability (e.g., Thielaviopsis basicola and Verticillium dahliae). Instead, population responses of the pathogenic fungi Phytophthora spp., Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium spp. appeared unrelated to disease suppression. Overall, enzymatic and microbiological parameters, rather than chemical ones, were much more informative for predicting suppressiveness. The most useful features were FDA activity, substrate respiration, microbial biomass, total culturable bacteria, fluorescent pseudomonads and Trichoderma populations. We conclude that the integration of different parameters (e.g. FDA hydrolysis and chemical composition by C-13 NMR) may be a promising approach for identification of suppressive amendments.

AB Passive heating during storage of pre-packed growing media may reduce its quality. However, the impact of passive heating on basic chemical characteristics of growing media and plant yield are not fully understood. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of (i) the passive heating temperature under oxygen depleted conditions, (ii) the critical passive heating duration and (iii) the type of storage on the basic chemical composition of hand-bagged and pre-packed growing media and on yield of Chinese white cabbage (Brassica napus var. chinensis). Six growing media at three different degrees of hurnification (H2-H7 on the von post humification scale) were heated for two weeks at 20, 35, 45 and 60 degrees C under oxygen depleted conditions prior to testing. Additionally, the growing media were heated for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days at 35 degrees C under oxygen depleted conditions and tested directly after heating and after five months of storage. Increased heating temperatures of unlimed and unfertilized (unamended) growing media from 20 to 60 degrees C led to NH4+ accumulation, but did not cause plant yield losses, if nitrogen fertilization of growing media after heating was mainly through NO3-. Heating of amended growing media to 35 degrees C for six days or longer decreased plant fresh weight more than 20%. Five months of storage after heating at 35 degrees C of amended growing media for zero to 10 days influenced yield slightly negatively only for one growing medium, which was based on weakly decomposed peat (M-W). For growing media amended prior to heating, the loss of NO3- explained 87% of the variation in fresh weight yield. The NH4+:NO3- ratio was a good indicator of a previous heating event. The NH4+:NO3- ratio values were fitted by a logarithmic curve to the plant fresh yield and were high significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.75). Nitrate loss during storage of pre-packed growing media in bags was less for bags with perforations on the outside of the palette than those with perforations on the inside of the palette. Our results indicate that growing media should not be exposed to temperatures higher than 35 degrees C for more than six days during transport and storage. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. The role of prescribed burning of vegetation to manage fire risk is controversial in a variety of situations worldwide. It is becoming more topical (i) as a result of potential global warming where the risk of wildfire might increase and (ii) because fire might affect the various ecosystem services provided in a different way. Where prescribed fire is used, ecologists need to know the impact on biodiversity (post-fire recovery) and on provisioning and regulating services such as water collection and carbon sequestration. Here, we assess the effect of prescribed burning on plant community composition and its component species at the regional scale of the Peak District, where the moorland vegetation is severely degraded.
   2. Species cover (%) was assessed on five moors with respect to elapsed time since prescribed burning and vegetation height. A stratified random method was used to choose burn patches covering a range of ages since burning; quadrats were then sampled randomly within these patches over a 3-year period. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to relate species composition to significant environmental variables, and variation partitioning was used to assess their relative contribution. Response curves were produced for the major species with respect to elapsed time since burning and vegetation height.
   3. The species ordination produced two gradients, (i) a continuum from a graminoid-dominated vegetation to one dominated by Erica tetralix, Vaccinium myrtillus and Rubus chamaemorus and (ii) a post-fire growth response of the dominant species, Calluna vulgaris. Species composition was more highly correlated with vegetation height than elapsed time since burning. The environmental variables explained 15.2% of the variation.
   4. Calluna vulgaris was the only species to show an increasing response after burning; all others showed an increase immediately after burning, but then they either decreased or showed a unimodal/skewed response. Most other species were restricted to vegetation <40 cm height and 20-25 years after burning. 5. Synthesis and applications. We found two major results of importance to policy makers and land managers: (i) that prescribed burning maintains species diversity in the immediate post-burn phase, and (ii) as the vegetation ages and increases in height, most species disappear and the vegetation becomes dominated by C. vulgaris. From a policy perspective, prescribed burning (or some other disturbance) is needed to maintain burning and a no-burn policy will result in a low-diversity, C. vulgaris-dominated vegetation. As vegetation height is the easiest measure for land managers to use in judging when to burn, we recommend moorland vegetation be burned before it reaches 25 cm in height to maintain the pre-burn complement of plant species. If the rotation allows the vegetation to become much taller (>40 cm), then most species will be lost and they will have to colonize after subsequent fires from the seedbank or from the surrounding area.

AB Background, Aims and Scope. Soil microbial community diversity has been suggested as a way of assessing the 'health' or 'quality' of soils. While molecular (genetic) or biochemical (phenotypic) measurements of microbial diversity have their place, functional diversity is popular in that it relates to the activity of the soil microflora, particularly in the carbon cycle. Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPPs) are usually assessed by carbon substrate utilization. The aim here is to review the various methods available for CLPP assessment.
   Main Features. The original method for CLPP determination was based upon the Biolog plate with its range of 95 carbon substrates and many studies have been employing this over the past 15 years. However, a number of criticisms have been leveled at the method, principally that it relies upon the growth of an extracted microbial population, which may not represent the true functioning of the whole soil. A multiple carbon-source, substrate induced respiration method (multi-SIR) was developed that did measure the response of the whole soil community without the need for growth but it did not have the convenience of the microtitre plate format. MicroReSp (TM) was designed to overcome the deficiencies in both methods and we have applied it to a range of media including mineral and organic soils, sediments and litter. In addition we have adapted the method to the testing of a wide range of carbon substrates such as hydrocarbons, terpenes and pesticides.
   Results. The MicroReSp (TM) technique covers the middle road of relevance and convenience, being a 'whole soil' method in a flexible microtitre plate format. It also has the advantage that it can be adapted for the use of radiolabelled (C-14) substrates, which increases the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. A few direct comparisons between MicroReSp (TM) have been made. We have found that its discriminatory ability compares favourably with Biolog while other users have reported it to be superior to the multiple SIR approach. A number of laboratories around the world are now utilizing MicroReSp (TM) and reporting good sensitivity to changes to the microbial community due to such varied factors as age of forest rehabilitation, heavy metal treatment, hydrocarbon exposure, salinity, peatland vegetation, cropping system and tree clone type.
   Discussion. A comparison of the available methods reveals that each has its advantages and drawbacks. The choice of method may depend upon the particular hypotheses or questions.
   Conclusions. MicroReSp (TM) offers a convenient, rapid and sensitive method for the determination of Community Level Physiological Profiles. Its application in a number of case studies has demonstrated its utility and advantages over other methods though its full potential for characterizing soil activity is yet to be realized. Perspectives. Increasing awareness of the environmental pressures on soils and the need to monitor soil health has resulted in a range of potential indicators. Microbial functional diversity is one such indicator that seeks to characterize a core soil attribute. The availability of rapid methods for its assessment will aid our understanding of such pressures on basic soil functioning.

AB Coalsack Bluff was the first discovery site in Antarctica for the latest Permian to earliest Triassic reptile Lystrosaurus. This together with discovery of Permian Glossopteris leaves during the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, indicated not only that Antarctica was part of Gondwanaland, but also that Antarctic rocks recorded faunas from the greatest of all mass extinctions at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Pinpointing the exact stratigraphic level of this life crisis has recently become possible using delta C-13 values in terrestrial organic matter. Multiple, short-lived events of C-13 depletion may reflect carbon cycle crises, with the isotopic change a measure of terrestrial and atmospheric disequilibrium. Additional evidence for ecosystem reorganization came from changes in paleosol types and their root traces. Such studies previously completed at the Antarctic localities of Graphite Peak, Mount Crean, Portal Mountain, Shapeless Mountain and Allan Hills, are here extended to Coalsack Bluff. Carbon isotopic values in Permian rocks at Coalsack Bluff average -23.08 +/- 0.25 parts per thousand, but begin to decline within the last coal with leaves (Glossopteris), roots (Vertebraria) and permineralized stumps (Araucarioxylon) of glossopterids. The low point in a C-13 values is -27.19 parts per thousand at 5.6 m above the last coal, which is capped by unusually abundant pyrite, and a claystone breccia with common clasts of redeposited clayey soils. Above this are massive quartz-rich sandstones of braided streams, considered a geomorphic response to deforestation and soil erosion following the mass extinction. Distinctive berthierine-bearing paleosols (Dolores pedotype) within these sandstones have unoxidized iron taken as evidence of severe groundwater hypoxia. Other paleosols at this stratigraphic level are like those in other Early Triassic rocks of Antarctica, which indicate unusually warm and humid conditions for such high paleolatitude lowlands. Waterlogging is also indicated by newly discovered kinds of paleosol (Ernest pedotype) with groundwater calcretes. The lack of peat accumulation in such waterlogged lowlands, berthierine in paleosols and large negative carbon isotopic shift at Coalsack Bluff support the idea of atmospheric pollution with methane from submarine and permafrost clathrates as a cause for the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Hypoxic soils would have killed lowland plants by preventing root respiration and hypoxic air would have challenged vertebrates with pulmonary edema. Causes for catastrophic methane release remain unclear. Flood basalt eruptions, dolerite intrusions into coal measures,. submarine landslides, tectonic faulting, and bolide impact suggested for episodes of methane release at other times are also plausible for the Permian-Triassic boundary.

AB The differential accumulation or loss of carbon and nutrients during decomposition can promote differentiation of wetland ecosystems, and contribute to landscape-scale heterogeneity. Tree islands are important ecosystems because they increase ecological heterogeneity in the Everglades landscape and in many tropical landscapes. Only slight differences in elevation due to peat accumulation allow the differentiation of these systems from the adjacent marsh. Hydrologic restoration of the Everglades landscape is currently underway, and increased nutrient supply that could occur with reintroduction of freshwater flow may alter these differentiation processes. In this study, we established a landscape-scale, ecosystem-level experiment to examine litter decomposition responses to increased freshwater flow in nine tree islands and adjacent marsh sites in the southern Everglades. We utilized a standard litterbag technique to quantify changes in mass loss, decay rates, and phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) dynamics of a common litter type, cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco L.) leaf litter over 64 weeks. Average C. icaco leaf degradation rates in tree islands were among the lowest reported for wetland ecosystems (0.23 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)). We found lower mass loss and decay rates but higher absolute mass C, N, and P in tree islands as compared to marsh ecosystems after 64 weeks. With increased freshwater flow, we found generally greater mass loss and significantly higher P concentrations in decomposing leaf litter of tree island and marsh sites. Overall, litter accumulated N and P when decomposing in tree islands, and released P when decomposing in the marsh. However, under conditions of increased freshwater flow, tree islands accumulated more P while the marsh accumulated P rather than mineralizing P. In tree islands, water level explained significant variation in P concentration and N: P molar ratio in leaf tissue. Absolute P mass increased strongly with total P load in tree islands (r(2) = 0.81). In the marsh, we found strong, positive relationships with flow rate. Simultaneous C and P accumulation in tree island and mineralization in adjacent marsh ecosystems via leaf litter decomposition promotes landscape differentiation in this oligotrophic Everglades wetland. However, results of this study suggest that variation in flow rates, water levels and TP loads can shift differential P accumulation and loss leading to unidirectional processes among heterogeneous wetland ecosystems. Under sustained high P loading that could occur with increased freshwater flow, tree islands may shift to litter mineralization, further degrading landscape heterogeneity in this system, and signaling an altered ecosystem state.

AB Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important horticultural crop in the world. The objective of this work was to evaluate salinity stress tolerance and understand the ionic mechanism conferring this trait in nine Hami melon landracesfrom Xinjiang, China. Plants were grown in a potting mix (peat: vermiculite: perlite = 1:1:1, v/v) under glasshouse conditions and irrigated with Hoagland's nutrient solution containing either 0 (control) or 100mM NaCl. Plant dry weight, single fruit weight, Na+ and K+ content of all leaves, stem and roots of the whole plant were measured at day 70 after commencing the treatment. Also, Na+ and K+ content of the second fully expanded leaf from the top were measured at day 20, 40 and 60 after stress onset. Net fluxes of K+ and Na+ were measured from plant roots in laboratory experiments using a noninvasive MIFE (microelectrode ion flux estimation) technique, and expression levels of the leaf tonoplast Na+/H+ antiporters (NHX) were investigated. Salt injury index and leaf chlorophyll content were also measured. The results showed that, according to the relative (NaCl/Control) plant dry weight and a single fruit weight, the salt tolerance of the nine landraces can be classified into three types: 'Huangdanzi', 'Zajiaojiashigua', 'Kalakesai' and 'Paotaihong' are salt tolerant; 'Laotiepi', 'Kaeryunxi' and 'Sairekekekouqi' are intermediate in salt tolerance; and 'Akekekouqi' and 'Paodangua' are salt sensitive. This conclusion was also supported by the results of measuring of the salt injury index and leaf chlorophyll content. The salt tolerance of landraces was positively correlated with the relative K+ content of all leaves, but correlated negatively with the relative Na+ content of the second fully expanded leaf, and relative K+ content of the root. Compared with salt sensitive landraces, salt tolerant genotypes had significantly lower relative Na+ content of the second fully expanded leaf, lower relative root K+ content (except Paotaihong), and higher relative K+ content of all leaves. They also displayed lower root net K+ efflux and higher Na+ efflux (except Zajiaojiashigua) capacity. The intermediate landrace 'Laotiepi' had very high Na+ content and high level of NHX2/3/6 expression in leaves but still possessed high chlorophyll content, suggesting that this landrace had an efficient vacuolar Na+ sequestration mechanism in the leaf mesophyll. Taken together, our results showed that Hami melon landraces in Xinjiang showing significant difference in salt tolerance, and that K+ retention in the shoot and Na (+) exclusion from young leaves are the main mechanisms conferring salinity stress tolerance of Hami melon landraces in Xinjiang.

AB The long-term effects of high axle load traffic on soil structure were investigated in three field experiments. Two of the experiments were located on fine-textured mineral soils (Vertic Cambisol). The clay soil had 48 g clay (particle size less than 2 mu m) per 100 g in the topsoil and 65 g per 100 g in the subsoil, and the loam soil had clay contents of 30 g and 42 g per 100 g in the topsoil and subsoil, respectively. One experiment was located on an organic soil (Mollic Gleysol) consisting of well-decomposed sedge peat mixed with clay from 0.2 to 0.4-0.5 m depth, and underlain by gythia (organic soil with high clay content). In the autumn of 1981, one pass and four repeated passes with a heavy tractor-trailer combination compacted the soils to 0.4-0.5 m depth. The trailer tandem axle load was 19 Mg on the clay and 16 Mg on the other soils.
   For 9 years after the experimental traffic, the main crops grown were spring cereals. During this time, the maximum axle load applied during field operations was 5 Mg and the maximum tyre inflation pressure was 150 kPa. The clay and loam froze to 0.5 m depth for 6 and 2 years, respectively. During several growing seasons all three soils dried and cracked. In the ninth year after the loading, soil penetrometer resistance, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), macroporosity and number and area of cylindrical biopores were measured and the visual structure of the soils examined.
   Compaction in the plough layer was alleviated by ploughing and natural processes, whereas in the subsoil the effects of the compaction were still measurable, in all experiments, in the ninth year after the high axle load traffic. In the clay soil in the 0.3-0.5 m layer and in the organic soil in the 0.28-0.4 m layer, the penetrometer resistance was 22-26% greater and the soil structure more massive in the plots compacted with four passes than in the control plots. In the 0.4-0.55 m layer in all soils, the loading with four passes decreased K-sat by 60-98% and macroporosity (diameter greater than 300 mu m) by 37-70%. In the fine-textured mineral subsoils, cylindrical biopores were found in all treatments. The trend of the results was, however, for biopores to be fewer in compacted than in control plots.

AB Inland waters, particularly small and shallow lakes, are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, the spatial inlake heterogeneity of CO2 and CH4 production processes and their drivers in the sediment remain poorly studied. We measured potential CO2 and CH4 production in slurry incubations from 12 sites within the small and shallow crater lake Windsborn in Germany, as well as fluxes at the water-atmosphere interface of intact sediment core incubations from four sites. Production rates were highly variable and ranged from 7.2 to 38.5 mu mol CO2 gC(-1) d(-1) and from 5.4 to 33.5 mu mol CH4 gC(-1) d(-1). Fluxes ranged from 4.5 to 26.9 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and from 0 to 9.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Both CO2 and CH4 production rates and the CH4 fluxes exhibited a significant and negative correlation (p<0.05, rho < 0.6) with a prevalence of recalcitrant organic matter (OM) compounds in the sediment as identified by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The carbon/nitrogen ratio exhibited a significant negative correlation (p<0 .01, rho = -0.88) with CH4 fluxes but not with production rates or CO2 fluxes. The availability of inorganic (nitrate, sulfate, ferric iron) and organic (humic acids) electron acceptors failed to explain differences in CH4 production rates, assuming a competitive suppression, but observed non-methanogenic CO2 production could be explained up to 91% by prevalent electron acceptors. We did not find clear relationships between OM quality, the thermodynamics of methanogenic pathways (acetoclastic vs. hydrogenotrophic) and electron-accepting capacity of the OM. Differences in CH4 fluxes were interestingly to a large part explained by grain size distribution (p<0.05, rho = +/- 0.65). Surprisingly though, sediment gas storage, potential production rates and water-atmosphere fluxes were decoupled from each other and did not show any correlations. Our results show that within a small lake, sediment CO2 and CH4 production shows significant spatial variability which is mainly driven by spatial differences in the degradability of the sediment OM. We highlight that studies on production rates and sediment quality need to be interpreted with care, though, in terms of deducing emission rates and patterns as approaches based on production rates only neglect physical sediment properties and production and oxidation processes in the water column as major controls on actual emissions.

AB A unique complex of multiphased Holocene drift sands and paleosols, with at least two lacustrine phases, was discovered during a major sanitation project in the Laarder Wasmeren area near Hilversum, the Netherlands. The complex could be studied in detail, highly facilitated by the excellent and large-scale exposure of the various deposits and soils. OSL dating was used to establish ages of the phases, where possible differentiating between time of deposition and time of burial by taking into account the potential effects of bioturbation. Pollen analysis served to reconstruct the vegetation during the various phases.
   A first minor phase of aeolian activity already started before approx. 5,000 BC, followed around 4,000 BC by a second phase and a rather massive third phase around 3,000 BC. After a long phase of soil formation, the latest, massive drift sand phase started around the 14th to 15th century. It clearly represents the classic drift sand phase that started in the Late Middle Ages in the Netherlands. Sand drifting followed on soil forming phases during which the vegetation became increasingly dominated by ericaceous plants and culminated in heathlands. The first three aeolian phases and associated heathlands are much older than generally assumed for heathland and drift sand to occur in the Netherlands. Moreover, podzolisation was found to have started very early, true podzols already occurring before 4,000 BC.
   Around 3,000 BC groundwater in the area reached a maximum altitude of about 230 cm +NAP, resulting in local open water in the area. This rise is probably linked to the development of the Dutch coastal area, where at that time peat accumulated and drainage was poor, inducing a rise of the groundwater level in 'het Gooi'. This groundwater level fell later on, to never reach this altitude again. The Groot Wasmeer was formed by local stagnation on a slowly permeable podzol and already reached a level of 320-325 cm +NAP by 400 BC, which more or less equals its 20th century level.
   The results demonstrate that earlier concepts on the occurrence and age of aeolian phases, podzols and heathland vegetations in the Netherlands are far too schematic, and that early, pre-agricultural cultures may already have had an impact on the stability of fragile cover sand landscapes, e.g. through burning. Results are in line with those from several contemporary studies on early prehistoric cultures and their impact in river dune areas in the Central and Eastern Netherlands.

   SEDIMENTARY; EVOLUTION
AB Published Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) curves for the U.S. Gulf Coast are in mutual conflict, with some characterized by a smooth RSL rise akin to widely accepted eustatic sea-level curves versus others, including several recent ones, that are characterized by a conspicuous "stair-step" pattern with prolonged (millennium-scale) RSL stillstands alternating with rapid (meter-scale) rises. In addition, recent work in Texas and Alabama has revitalized the notion of a middle Holocene RSL highstand, estimated at 2 m above present mean sea level.
   An extensive sampling program in the Mississippi Delta (Louisiana) focused on the collection of basal peats that accumulated during the initial transgression of the pre-existing, consolidated Pleistocene basement. We used stable carbon isotope ratios to demonstrate that many of these samples accumulated in environments affected by frequent saltwater intrusion in the <30 cm zone between mean spring high water and mean sea level, and we selected plant macrofossils that were subjected to AMS C-14 dating. Nearly 30 sea-level index points from a similar to20 km(2) study area on the eastern margin of the delta suggest that RSL rise followed a relatively smooth trend for the time interval 8000-3000 cal yr B.P., thus questioning the occurrence of major RSL stillstands alternating with abrupt rises. Given the narrow error envelope defined by our data set, any sea-level fluctuations, if present, would have amplitudes of <1 m.
   Although a true middle Holocene highstand never occurred in the Mississippi Delta, the high level of detail of our time series enables a rigorous test of this hypothesis. Correction of our data set for a hypothetical tectonic subsidence rate of 1.1 mm yr(-1) (assuming a constant subsidence rate compared to the tectonically relatively stable adjacent coast of Texas) leads to sea levels near 2 m above present during the time interval 6000-4000 cal yr B.P. However, this model also implies a RSL position near -2 m around 8000 cal yr B.P, which is inconsistent both with data of this age from Texas, as well as with widely accepted sea-level data from elsewhere. We therefore conclude that a middle Holocene highstand for the U.S. Gulf Coast is highly unlikely, and that the entire area is still responding glacio-isostatically, by means of forebulge collapse, to the melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

AB The Early Cretaceous Wulantuga high-Ge coal deposit in Inner Mongolia is one of the major coal-hosted Ge deposits in China. This paper reports new data on the petrological, mineralogical, and geochemical compositions of 13 bench samples of the high-Ge No. 6 coal from the Wulantuga deposit, and provides new insight into the origin and modes of occurrence of the minerals and elements present.
   The No. 6 Coal has a low rank (R-o,R-max = 0.45%) and is a low-ash coal (8.77%). The total content of inertinite (52.5 vol.% on average) in most coal benches is higher than that of huminite (46.8 vol.% on average). The dominant huminite maceral is textinite (averages 43.9%), and the dominant inertinite macerals are mainly fusinite (averages 33%) and semifusinite (12.5%), along with trace portions of intertodetrinite, secretinite, funginite, and macrinite. Fungus, seen as the maceral funginite, played a role in the development of degraded maceral forms in the Wulantuga coals. Funginite is present in samples examined in this study, but is not easily extracted during palynological studies; recovered fungal taxa are saprophytes, indicating woody decomposition prior to incorporation in the mire. Palynology revealed a sparse flora that is consistent with the early Cretaceous age.
   Minerals in the coal include quartz, kaolinite, illite (and/or illite/smectite), gypsum, pyrite, and traces of rutile and anatase. A varying proportion of bassanite was observed in the low-temperature ashes (LTAs). Bassanite in the LTAs was derived both from the dehydration of gypsum in the raw coals and from the interaction between organically-associated Ca and S during the low-temperature ashing. In addition to a proportion of detrital quartz, fine-grained and cell-filling quartz of authigenic origin is also present. Pyrite is of syngenetic origin and derived from sulfate-rich hydrothermal fluids.
   Compared to common Chinese and world low-rank coals, the No. 6 Coal is enriched in Be (25.7 mu g/g), F (336 mu g/g), Ge (274 mu g/g), As (499 mu g/g), Sb (240 mu g/g), Cs (5.29 mu g/g), W (115 mu g/g), Hg (3.165 mu g/g), and TI (3.15 mu g/g). Germanium in the coal is organically associated, and its enrichment is attributed to hydrothermal fluids from the adjacent granitoids. Beryllium is probably associated with Ca- and Mn-bearing carbonate minerals and to a lesser extent with clay minerals, rather than with organic matter. Fluorine largely occurs in clay minerals (kaolinite and illite). The elevated concentrations of T1, Hg, As, and Sb are mainly distributed in pyrite and were derived from the same hydrothermal source. The high W in the coal occurs in both the organic matter and the authigenic quartz. Illite is the major carrier of Cs in the coal.
   The accumulation of rare earth elements (REE) in the coals had a polygenetic and multistage nature, including two syngenetic stages (early hydrothermal and terrigenous) and one diagenetic (late hydrothermal) stage. The REE distribution patterns of the early hydrothermal and terrigenous stages were characterized by the enrichment of medium REE (M-type REE) and light REE (L-type REE), respectively. A H-type REE distribution pattern (HREE enrichment) occurred in the late diagenetic hydrothermal stage.
   The high-Ge Wulantuga coals are also abnormally enriched in precious metals. Gold, Pt, and Pd in the coals, calculated from their concentrations in the LTAs, are 3.5-25.8, <4-25.5, and <2.5-15.5 times higher in comparison with those in the continental crust. The highest concentrations of precious metals occur in the pyrite contained in the coal and are 18 (Pd), 130 (Au), and 725 (Pt) times higher than those of the continental crust. The pyrite is probably the basic carrier of the Pt and some portion of the Au in the coal; additionally, a portion of precious metals may be organically (halogen-organic) bound in the coal.

TI THE SYDNEY COALFIELD OF NOVA-SCOTIA, CANADA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In size, production and remaining resources, the Sydney coalfield is the largest field in eastern Canada. It is nearly entirely submarine and extends from northeastern Cape Breton Island to almost as far as Newfoundland, occupying an area estimated at 36,300 km2. During 205 years of mining, some 410 million t have been produced and the total remaining ''demonstrated'' resources, present in ten seams, have been calculated at 1,800 million short tons, T (1 short ton = 0.907 t). Of this in situ tonnage about 300 million may be suitable for metallurgical purposes and 1,500 million T can be classed as thermal coal. Some 82% of the total estimate is contributed by four seams, of which the Harbour seam is the main producer. The present annual production is between 3 and 4 million T and all mining is done in the submarine area. The main problems with submarine mining are ventilation and haulage time. The latter increases with the distance from the shore and results in reduced production.
   A west to east cross-section through five seams illustrates the development of coal and shows the phenomenon of depositional splitting and rejoining, caused by the interaction of fluvial sedimentation and peat accumulation. Fossil rivers forming ''wants'' or ''wash-outs'' in the coal seams are the principle geological obstructions to mining. Structural difficulties are minor as the field is only gently folded and no main faults are present. All coal of the Sydney field is classed as high volatile A bituminous, but there are significant changes within and beyond this category. These are related to the observation that the coalification is essentially post-deformational. This has resulted in an increase in rank with depth, as well as regionally from west to east within the same seam. Coke stability data indicate that these rank changes are economically favourable, because the coking characteristics of the coal improve with depth and towards the east.
   Petrographically, a normal, banded bright coal is represented, consisting of alternating bands of vitrite, clarite, clarodurite, durite and fusite. Durite bands occur sporadically, rarely exceeding 3 cm, and are present as ''inertinite-rich'' durite and ''exinite-rich'' durite. The latter consists of a ground-mass of matted exinite and some of these bands could be traced over a lateral distance of some 50 km within the Harbour seam section. Microlithotype analyses show that, within each seam section, four coal facies types can be recognized, namely: the forest-terrestrial-moor (Ftm), the forest-moor (FM), the reed-moor (RM) and the open-moor (OM) facies. All coal seams of the Sydney field have low ash yields, which range from 5% to 9%. However, the sulphur content is generally high and varies between seams from 2.5% to 6.2%. The average volatile matter content is 36% and calorific value averages 7,524 kcal/kg (13,545 Btu/lb).

AB Coals containing ammonium-bearing aluminosilicates usually have highly-elevated concentrations of critical elements, including Ga, Al, U, V, Re, Se, and rare earth elements. Coals from the Moxinpo and Yishan coalfields of southern China and the Daqingshan Coalfield of northern China are unusual in containing abundant ammonium-bearing minerals (buddingtonite and ammonian illite). Understanding the source of N in the ammonium-bearing minerals could provide useful information, not only for the enrichment of the critical elements, but also for the formation of these unusual minerals. A geochemical and nitrogen isotope study was undertaken in order to investigate the origin and behavior of nitrogen in the minerals and associated coals. The N contents decrease as rank increases from low volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite, indicating that substantial N was thermally lost during coalification. The isotopic composition of organic nitrogen (delta N-15(org)) ranges from 3.7 to 7.7 parts per thousand and increases with coal rank in the studied samples. However, this does not indicate that the isotope fractionation of organic N was due to the coal rank advance; rather, it is largely caused by the depositional environments of peat accumulation and coal-precursor plant assemblages.
   delta N-15 values of inorganic N (delta N-15(ino)) in NH4+-minerals generally have a wider range (5.1 to 12.4 parts per thousand) than those of organic matter (3.7 to 7.5 parts per thousand) in coal and are commonly higher than those of (delta N-15(org) in the same coal sample. The N in the ammonium-bearing aluminosilicates was derived from the decomposition of the organic matter of the coals that were subjected to increased geothermal gradient (and fluid flow) as a consequence of igneous intrusion or infiltration of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids. The N released from organic matter was transported by high-T fluids, from which N-14 was preferentially converted into volatile matter and N-15 readily remained in the fluids. Subsequently NH4+ in the high-T fluids substituted for K+ in pre-existing minerals or NH4+ bearing high-T fluids reacted with pre-existing kaolinite in the coals, leading to more positive (delta N-15 values for the NH4+-bearing minerals than those of the organic matter in these coals. Therefore, the delta N-15(i)no values in coal, in a wider context, could be potentially used to estimate the degree of high-T heating on coal metamorphism, to trace the pathway of hydrothermal fluids circulating within the coal basin, and to provide useful information on the sources of critical elements that are enriched in coals.

AB Seasonally flooded, freshwater cypress-tupelo wetlands, dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distictum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (S-R) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i.e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54.8, 1.48, 0.270, and 0.0205 mg L-1, for DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher S-R and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.

AB Increasing green space, especially in densely built-up areas is considered to be a valuable climate change adaptation response in order to reduce the threat of high temperatures to human health and comfort and to controlled global greenhouse gas emissions. Practical responses to climate change, under urban conditions, in order to avoid or reduce trees and shrubs vulnerability, can be considered drought resistant planting approaches, as the addition of organic amendeds to soil. The improvement of physical-chemical soil quality is a key step for carrying out xeriscaping programs of urban green spaces in Mediterranean semiarid areas. Organic amendments, particularly compost, have been receiving a renewed attention not only in horticulture but also in the context of restoring disturbed urban soils to address environmental issues as well as to improve trees and shrubs growth. The influence of increasing rates (0, 15, 30, and 45%) of composted sewage sludge (SSC) placed in the plantation hole on both urban soil properties and growth for three native Mediterranean woody hedge species was monitored over a 2-year period after planting. The experiment was supported by a xerogardening project in an urban context under semi-arid conditions. The results indicate that the urban soil physical characteristics were positively influenced by the addition of SSC: the 45% rate showed an increase in both moisture and infiltration values, thereby increasing the volume of plant-available water in the soil. The chemical properties of the amended soils were also directly affected by the SSC rate, but the effect of the compost on organic matter, nitrogen and potassium contents decreased overtime. Our results prove that the hedge growth response to the compost treatments is also highly dependent on the rate of compost used. At the end of the trial, in Rhamnus and Myrthus plants 30% compost level guarantees the best performance; in fact, the further addition of 15% of compost led to a significant decrease in hedge and diameter values, in particular in Myrtle. This could be explained by the high pH at 45% compost, which would seem not to suit the physiology of the two species. On the other hand, in Phillyrea plants, the rate of 45% compost gives high performance equal to that of 30%; it would therefore seem that the high pH at 45% compost does not influence the nutritive elements' absorption and, as a consequence, the growth. The use of composted sludge as an amendment for sclerophyllous could be feasible and, what is more, helpful to mitigate the environmental impact of organic waste disposal. Moreover more natural vegetation can be introduced into urban parks and green spaces in semi-arid environments to encourage sustainable landscaping and xerogardening. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Permian waning of the low-latitude Alleghenian/Variscan/Hercynian orogenesis led to a long collisional orogeny gap that cut clown the availability of chemically weatherable fresh silicate rock resulting in a high-CO2 atmosphere and global warming. The correspondingly reduced delivery of nutrients to the biosphere caused further increases in CO2 and warming. Melting of polar ice curtailed sinking of O-2(-) and nutrient-rich cold brines while pole-to-equator thermal gradients weakened. Wind shear and associated wind-driven upwelling lessened, further diminishing productivity and carbon burial. As the Earth warmed, dry climates expanded to mid-latitudes, causing latitudinal expansion of the Ferrel circulation cell at the expense of the polar cell. Increased coastal evaporation generated O-2(-) and nutrient-deficient warm saline bottom water (WSBW) and delivered it to a weakly circulating deep ocean. Warm, deep currents delivered ever more heat to high latitudes until polar sinking of cold water was replaced by upwelling WSBW. With the loss of polar sinking, the ocean was rapidly filled with WSBW that became increasingly anoxic and finally euxinic by the end of the Permian. Rapid incursion of WSBW could have produced similar to 20 m of thermal expansion of the oceans, generating the well-documented marine transgression that flooded embayments in dry, hot Pangaean mid-latitudes. The flooding further increased WSBW production and anoxia, and brought that anoxic water onto the shelves. Release of CO2 from the Siberian traps and methane from clathrates below the warming ocean bottom sharply enhanced the already strong greenhouse. Increasingly frequent and powerful cyclonic storms mined upwelling high-latitude heat and released it to the atmosphere. That heat, trapped by overlying clouds of its own making, suggests complete breakdown of the dry polar cell. Resulting rapid and intense polar warming caused or contributed to extinction of the remaining latest Permian coal forests that could not migrate any farther poleward because of light limitations. Loss of water stored by the forests led to aquifer drainage, adding another similar to 5 m to the transgression. Non-peat-forming vegetation survived at the newly moist poles. Climate feedback from the coal-forest extinction further intensified warmth, contributing to delayed biotic recovery that generally did not begin until mid-Triassic, but appears to have resumed first at high latitudes late in the Early Triassic. Current quantitative models fail to generate high-latitude warmth and so do not produce the chain of events we outline in this paper. Future quantitative modeling addressing factors such as polar cloudiness, increased poleward heat transport by deep water and its upwelling by cyclonic storms, and sustainable mid-latitude sinking of warm brines to promote anoxia, warming, and thermal expansion of deep water may more closely simulate conditions indicated by geological and paleontological data.

AB It is widely recognized that interactions between vegetation and flow cause the emergence of channel patterns that are distinct from the standard Schumm classification of river channels. Although landscape pattern is known to be linked to ecosystem services such as habitat provision, pollutant removal, and sustaining biodiversity, the mechanisms responsible for the development and stability of different landscape patterns in shallow, vegetated flows have remained poorly understood. Fortunately, recent advances have made possible large-scale models of flow through vegetated environments that can be run over a range of environmental variables and over timescales of millennia. We describe a new, quasi-3D cellular automata model that couples simulations of shallow-water flow, bed shear stresses, sediment transport, and vegetation dynamics in an efficient manner. That efficiency allowed us to apply the model widely in order to determine how different hydroecological feedbacks control landscape pattern and process in various types of wetlands and floodplains. Distinct classes of landscape pattern were uniquely associated with specific types of allogenic and autogenic drivers in wetland flows. Regular, anisotropically patterned wetlands were dominated by allogenic processes (i.e., processes driven by periodic high water levels and flow velocities that redistribute sediment), relative to autogenic processes (e.g., vegetation production, peat accretion, and gravitational erosion). These anistropically patterned wetlands are therefore particularly prone to hydrologic disturbance. Other classes of wetlands that emerged from simulated interactions included maze-patterned, amorphous, and topographically noisy marshes, open marsh with islands, banded string-pool sequences perpendicular to flow, parallel deep and narrow channels flanked by marsh, and ridge-and-slough patterned marsh oriented parallel to flow. Because vegetation both affects and responds to the balance between the transport capacity of the flow and sediment supply, these vegetated systems exhibit a feedback that is not dominant in most rivers. Consequently, unlike in most rivers, it is not possible to predict the "channel pattern" of a vegetated landscape based only on discharge characteristics and sediment supply: the antecedent vegetation pattern and vegetation dynamics must also be known.
   In general, the stability of different wetland pattern types is most strongly related to factors controlling the erosion and deposition of sediment at vegetation patch edges, the magnitude of sediment redistribution by flow, patch elevation relative to water level, and the variability of erosion rates in vegetation patches with low flow-resistance. As we exemplify in our case-study of the Everglades ridge and slough landscape, feedback between flow and vegetation also causes hysteresis in landscape evolution trajectories that will affect the potential for landscape restoration. Namely, even if the hydrologic conditions that historically produced higher flows are restored, degraded portions of the ridge and slough landscape are unlikely to revert to their former patterning. As wetlands and floodplains worldwide become increasingly threatened by climate change and urbanization, the greater mechanistic understanding of landscape pattern and process that our analysis provides will improve our ability to forecast and manage the behavior of these ecosystems.

AB Detailed botanical (microfossil and macroremain), zoological and geochemical analyses (major and trace elements including C, Al, S, Ca, Fe, P, As, Zn, U, Ba and Rare Earth Elements) of organic deposits provide new insights into Early Holocene environmental change in the Kreekrak area (southwestern Netherlands). The age assessment of the record is based on high resolution AMS C-14 wiggle-match dating (WMD). For the first time an AMS C-14 WMD based chronology covering the Late Glacial/Holocene transition and early Preboreal is introduced for a site in The Netherlands.
   The Kreekrak botanical record reflects the end of the Younger Dryas to early Boreal and can be well correlated with pollen records from other sites in The Netherlands and Belgium. The palaeo-topography showed that the Kreekrak deposits formed in an abandoned channel of the River Schelde. Around ca. 11,490 cal BP, at the end of the Late Glacial/Holocene transition, infilling of the lake started with predominantly organic deposits in slowly running water. As a result of the warmer climate the area became forested with birch and poplar during the Friesland Phase (ca. 11,490-11,365 cal BP). Biological productivity of the lake and its surroundings increased. Aquatic vegetation developed in the lake, while shrubs of willow, reed swamps and grasslands fringed the shores. Precipitation increased, which caused a rise in the lake water table and an increase in the supply of oxic surface (=river) water into the Kreekrak take. During this period, the Kreekrak lake was fed by inflowing river water, runoff, precipitation and seepage of Fe-rich groundwater. Around ca. 11,43 5 cal BP the water became stagnant probably as result of a total cut-off of the river channel. Inflow of river water ceased, while the supply of reduced Fe-rich groundwater became dominant. During the Rammelbeek Phase (ca. 11,365-11,250 cal BP), the climate was more continental and the abundance of grasslands and open herbaceous vegetation increased. Biological productivity remained high. In the lake, the supply of Fe-rich groundwater continued, the water level slightly decreased but aquatic vegetation remained present. At the end of the Rammelbeek Phase a sudden reduction in the supply of Fe-rich reduced groundwater caused a lowering of the groundwater level in the area, resulting in the development of a hiatus. Due to this hiatus, the Late Preboreal (11,250-10,710 cal BP) is absent from the record. During the early Boreal (10,710-10,000 cal BP) the landscape became densely forested and accumulation of peat in the former lake resumed due to a slowly rising groundwater level. The Boreal was a relatively stable period with low sedimentation rates.
   The combination of palaeobotanical and geochemical analyses in the Kreekrak record shows a close interrelation between landscape development and geochemistry. It appears that the environmental development of this area during the Late Glacial/ Holocene transition and Early Holocene was largely influenced (directly or indirectly) by major climatic changes that occurred during this period, which determined local phenomena such as the composition and density of the vegetation, occurrence of seepage and river activity. Further research of this type has the potential to develop the application of major- and trace element geochemistry in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI Paleoseismic event dating and the conditional probability of large
   earthquakes on the southern San Andreas fault, California
SO BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID IRREGULAR RECURRENCE; WRIGHTWOOD; INTERVAL; OFFSETS
AB We introduce a quantitative approach to paleoearthquake dating and apply it to paleoseismic data from the Wrightwood and Pallett Creek sites on the southern San Andreas fault. We illustrate how stratigraphic ordering, sedimentological, and historical data can be used quantitatively in the process of estimating earthquake ages. Calibrated radiocarbon age distributions are used directly from layer dating through recurrence intervals and recurrence probability estimation. The method does not eliminate subjective judgements in event dating, but it does provide a means of systematically and objectively approaching the dating process. Date distributions for the most recent 14 events at Wrightwood are based on sample and contextual evidence in Fumal et al. (2002) and site context and slip history in Weldon et al. (2002). Pallett Creek event and dating descriptions are from published sources. For the five most recent events at Wrightwood, our results are consistent with previously published estimates, with generally comparable or narrower uncertainties. For Pallett Creek, our earthquake date estimates generally overlap with previous results but typically have broader uncertainties. Some event date estimates are very sensitive to details of data interpretation. The historical earthquake in 1857 ruptured the ground at both sites but is not constrained by radiocarbon data. Radiocarbon ages, peat accumulation rates, and historical constraints at Pallett Creek for event X yield a date estimate in the earliest 1800s and preclude a date in the late 1600s. This event is almost certainly the historical 1812 earthquake, as previously concluded by Sieh et al. (1989). This earthquake also produced ground deformation at Wrightwood.
   All events at Pallett Creek, except for event T, about A.D. 1360, and possibly event I, about A.D. 960, have corresponding events at Wrightwood with some overlap in age ranges. Event T falls during a period of low sedimentation at Wrightwood when conditions were not favorable for recording earthquake evidence. Previously proposed correlations of Pallett Creek X with Wrightwood W3 in the 1690s and Pallett Creek event V with W5 around 1480 (Fumal et al., 1993) appear unlikely after our dating reevaluation. Apparent internal inconsistencies among event, layer, and dating relationships around events R and V identify them as candidates for further investigation at the site. Conditional probabilities of earthquake recurrence were estimated using Poisson, lognormal, and empirical models. The presence of 12 or 13 events at Wrightwood during the same interval that 10 events are reported at Pallett Creek is reflected in mean recurrence intervals of 105 and 135 years, respectively. Average Poisson model 30-year conditional probabilities are about 20% at Pallett Creek and 25% at Wrightwood. The lognormal model conditional probabilities are somewhat higher, about 25% for Pallett Creek and 34% for Wrightwood. Lognormal variance sigma(1n) estimates of 0.76 and 0.70, respectively, imply only weak time predictability. Conditional probabilities of 29% and 46%, respectively, were estimated for an empirical distribution derived from the data alone. Conditional probability uncertainties are dominated by the brevity of the event series; dating uncertainty contributes only secondarily. Wrightwood and Pallett Creek event chronologies both suggest variations in recurrence interval with time, hinting that some form of recurrence rate modulation may be at work, but formal testing shows that neither series is more ordered than might be produced by a Poisson process.

AB Wildfire frequency has increased in past four decades in Canada and is expected to increase in future as a result of climate change (Wotton et al., 2010). Mercury (Hg) emissions from biomass burning are known to be significant; however, the impact of biomass burning on air concentration and deposition fluxes in Canada has not been previously quantified. We use estimates of burned biomass from FINN (Fire INventory from NCAR) and vegetation-specific emission factors (EFs) of mercury to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of Hg emissions in Canada. We use Environment and Climate Change Canada's GEM-MACH-Hg (Global Environmental Multi-scale, Modelling Air quality and Chemistry model, mercury version) to quantify the impact of biomass burning in Canada on spatiotemporal variability of air concentrations and deposition fluxes of mercury in Canada. We use North American gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) observations (2010-2015), GEM-MACH-Hg, and an inversion technique to optimize the EFs for GEM for five vegetation types represented in North American fires to constrain the biomass burning impacts of mercury. The inversion results suggest that EFs representing more vegetation types - specifically peatland - are required. This is currently limited by the sparseness of measurements of Hg from biomass burning plumes. More measurements of Hg concentration in the air, specifically downwind of fires, would improve the inversions. We use three biomass burning Hg emissions scenarios in Canada to conduct three sets of model simulations for 2010-2015: two scenarios where Hg is emitted only as GEM using literature or optimized EFs and a third scenario where Hg is emitted as GEM using literature EFs and particle bound mercury (PBM) emitted using the average GEM/PBM ratio from lab measurements. The three biomass burning emission scenarios represent a range of possible values for the impacts of Hg emissions from biomass burning in Canada on Hg concentration and deposition. We find total biomass burning Hg emissions to be highly variable from year to year and estimate average 2010-2015 total atmospheric biomass burning emissions of Hg in Canada to be between 6 and 14 t during the biomass burning season (i.e. from May to September), which is 37 times the mercury emission from anthropogenic sources in Canada for this period. On average, 65% of the emissions occur in the provinces west of Ontario.
   We find that while emissions from biomass burning have a small impact on surface air concentrations of GEM averaged over individual provinces/territories, the impact at individual sites can be as high as 95% during burning events. We estimate average annual mercury deposition from biomass burning in Canada to be between 0.3 and 2.8 t, compared to 0.14 t of mercury deposition from anthropogenic sources during the biomass burning season in Canada. Compared to the biomass burning emissions, the relative impact of fires on mercury deposition is shifted eastward, with on average 54% percent of the deposition occurring in provinces west of Ontario. While the relative contribution of Canadian biomass burning to the total mercury deposition over each province/territory is no more than 9% between 2010 and 2015, the local contribution in some locations (including areas downwind of biomass burning) can be as high as 80% (e.g. northwest of Great Slave Lake in 2014) from May to September. We find that northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, central British Columbia, and the area around Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories are at greater risk of mercury contamination from biomass burning. GEM is considered to be the dominant mercury species emitted from biomass burning; however, there remains an uncertainty in the speciation of mercury released from biomass burning. We find that the impact of biomass burning emissions on mercury deposition is significantly affected by the uncertainty in speciation of emitted mercury because PBM is more readily deposited closer to the emission sources than GEM; an addition of similar to 18% percent of mercury emission from biomass burning in the form of PBM in the model increases the 6-year average deposition by similar to 4 times.

AB The Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, provide a significant window into the Paleozoic-Cenozoic geology and palaeontology of this remote part of eastern Zealandia, and today, they are the only emergent tracts of an otherwise submerged Chatham Rise east of New Zealand. As part of early 19th Century intensive surveys by the New Zealand Company, German scientist Johann Karl Ernst Dieffenbach (1811-1855) spent the winter months of May-July 1840 studying the remote eastern outpost of the Chatham Islands archipelago at 43.7 degrees S and 176.7 degrees W, recording the first geological observations in this part of the Southwest Pacific as part of the land surveys to determine the suitability of natural resources and settlement. Dieffenbach's descriptions of the Chathams sparked some interest in England, but it would take some 130 years before the first geologic map of the Chathams was published in 1970 as a result of research by the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (New Zealand). The Chathams, today the only emergent parts of the Chatham Rise extending eastward from the New Zealand mainland for 1000 km, host the only outcrops of the Rise's geology, with deep roots in Gondwana. The geology comprises basement rocks of Permo-Triassic metasediments and schists which correlate to the Torlesse Supergroup of New Zealand, having been connected to Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica. Through phases of complex uplift and accretion along the Gondwanan landmass, a convergent margin ensued with associated back-arc volcanism within Antarctica for at least the Permian to mid-Jurassic time, which subsequently evolved into a passive margin, giving the Chatham Rise its distinctive finger-like shape. Divergent plate motions, resulting from the final fragmentation of Gondwana, pulled the Zealandia block away from the West Antarctic margin ca. 85-80 Ma concurrently with rifting phases that created large horsts and grabens forming a basin and range style landscape. Tectonism also formed intraplate volcanic provinces, including the establishment of a massive alkaline basalt stratovolcano in the Late Cretaceous with associated alkali olivine basalts and tuffs. From ca. 83 Ma the Chathams were positioned at 70 degrees S to about 54 degrees S at the K-Pg boundary, at a rate of approximately 0.9 degrees/m.y. Crustal thinning and subsidence resulted in the deposition of a thick sequence of associated terrestrial to paralic rift-fill sediments in the mid-Cretaceous, overlain by Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene shallow marine volcaniclastics, greensands and minor interstitial limestones. However, the presence of terrestrial fauna and flora of Paleocene age provides evidence of at least some emergent tracts of land (Chatham Peninsula) along the Rise until at least the mid- to late Paleocene. The lower Cenozoic successions are characterised by thin and discontinuous marine sandstones, tuff and limestones, reflecting regional subsidence of the Chatham Rise, concomitant with pulsed volcanic activity, which persisted intermittently throughout the late Cenozoic. Limestone deposition and volcanic sediments waned before the end of the Pliocene, and only thin accumulations of littoral sands, peats, dune sand, and marine terrace gravels, were lain down after the islands' uplift in the latest Pliocene. Current knowledge infers that the Chatham Islands have been emergent only for the last three to four million years. Varying terrigenous and carbonate sedimentation, reflecting intense palaeoclimatic cycles from global cooling during the Pliocene to Holocene, continue to the present day.

TI A REVIEW OF THE STRATIGRAPHY AND SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS OF THE
   KAROO-AGED BASINS OF SOUTHERN AFRICA
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Karoo Basin of South Africa was one of several contemporaneous intracratonic basins in southwestern Gondwana that became active in the Permo-Carboniferous (280 Ma) and continued to accumulate sediments until the earliest Jurassic, 100 million years later. At their maximum areal extent during the early Permian, these basins covered some 4.5 million km2. The present outcrop area of Karoo rocks in southern Africa is about 300 000 km2 with a maximum thickness of some 8000 m.
   The economic importance of these sediments lies in the vast reserves of coal within the Ecca Group rocks of northern and eastern Transvaal and Natal, South Africa. Large reserves of sandstone-hosted uranium and molybdenum have been proven within the Beaufort Group rocks of the southern Karoo trough, although they are not mineable in the present market conditions.
   Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the major stratigraphic units of the Karoo succession in South Africa demonstrates the changes in depositional style caused by regional arid localized tectonism within the basin. These depocentres were influenced by a progressive aridification of climate which was primarily caused by the northward drift of southwestern Gondwana out of a polar climate and accentuated by the meteoric drying effect of the surrounding land masses. Changing palaeoenvironments clearly influenced the rate and direction of vertebrate evolution in southern Gondwana as evidenced by the numerous reptile fossils, including dinosaurs, which are found in the Karoo strata of South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
   During the Late Carboniferous the southern part of Gondwana migrated over the South Pole resulting in a major ice sheet over the early Karoo basin and surrounding highlands. Glacial sedimentation in upland valleys and on the lowland shelf resulted in the Dwyka Formation at the base of the Karoo Sequence. After glaciation, an extensive shallow sea covered the gently subsiding shelf, fed by large volumes of meltwater. Marine clays and muds accumulated under cool climatic conditions (Lower Ecca Group) including the distinctive Mesosaurus-bearing carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation.
   Subduction of the palaeo-Pacific plate reslted in an extensive chain of mountains which deformed and later truncated the southern rim of the main Karoo Basin. Material derived from these ''Gondwanide'' mountains as well as from the granitic uplands to the north-east, accumulated in large deltas that prograded into the Ecca sea (Upper Ecca Group). The relatively cool and humid climate promoted thick accumulations of peat on the fluvial and delta plains which now constitute the major coal reserves of southern Africa.
   As the prograding deltas coalesced, fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Beaufort Group were laid down on broad gently subsiding alluvial plains. The climate by this time (Late Permian) had warmed to become semi-arid with highly seasonal rainfall. Vegetation alongside the meander belts and semi-permanent lakes supported a diverse reptilian fauna dominated by therapsids or ''mammal-like reptiles''. Pulses of uplift in the southern source areas combined with possible orographic effects resulted in the progadation of two coarse-grained alluvial fans into the central parts of the basin (Katberg Sandstone Member and Molteno Formation).
   In the upper Karoo Sequence, progressive aridification and tectonic deformation of the basin through the late Triassic and early Jurassic led to the accumulation, in four separate depositories, of ''redbeds'' which are interpreted as fluvial and flood-fan, playa and dune complexes (Elliot Formation). This eventually gave way to westerly wind-dominated sedimentation that choked the remaining depositories with fine-grained dune sand. The interdune areas were damp and occasionally flooded and provided a habitat for small dinosaurs and the earliest mammals. During this time (Early Jurassic), basin wide volcanic activity began as a precursor to the breakup of Gondwana in the late Jurassic and continued until the early Cretaceous. This extrusion of extensive flood basalts (Drakensberg Group) onto the Clarens landscape eventually brought Karoo sedimentation to a close.

DT Article
ID LAND-SURFACE SCHEME; ENERGY-EXCHANGE; CONDUCTANCE; EVAPORATION; GCMS
AB This paper documents the performance of the organic soil version of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) in modelling the hydrology and energy balance of the Beverly Swamp, Southern Ontario. The hydrometeorological dataset used to assess model performance begins in the autumn of 1983 and spans 33 months, presenting the first multi-year characterization of the area. The Beverly Swamp receives approximately 900 mm of precipitation per year of which one third is lost to net runoff and the remainder to evaporation. Vertical drainage at this site is impeded, due to the presence of a marl layer below the highly decomposed peat soil, at approximately 1-m depth. This mixed-forest wetland is unique among surfaces used for CLASS testing to date.
   Within CLASS, vertical drainage at the bottom of the soil profile is set to Zero to represent the marl subsurface boundary. Preliminary runs have shown that after each melt period this produced ponded water on site which persisted from year to year: The inclusion of a simple lateral drainage function in CLASS simulated actual measured lateral surface flow, and effectively reproduced seasonal differences in water table position.
   Comparisons between measured and modelled diurnally averaged energy budget components taken from two summers indicate that there is a marked tendency for CLASS to underestimate latent heat flux (Q(E)) by 29% of the observed values, the major cause of this disagreement being due to systematic error Concurrent with this error is an overestimation of the magnitude of soil heat storage (Q(G)) by a factor of seven, wherein the error is dominantly systematic. Modifications made to the canopy resistance parametrization, based on site measurements, resulted in improved model estimates of Q(E), reducing the underestimation to 12% of observed values, and changing the major cause of error from systematic to unsystematic in nature. The improvement in Q(E) corresponded with a change in the prediction of sensible heat flux (Q(H)). A tendency to overestimate Q(H) by 20% of the observed values changed to an underestimation of Q(H) by 14%, the error being unsystematic in each case. The modifications resulted in no significant change to either the magnitude or the nature of the error for Q(G).
   Modelled daily average temperatures for the third soil layer vel sus temperature measured at 1-m depth (the centre of the layer) indicated that modelled values had more extreme minima and maxima, although some of this discrepancy could be attributable to the heterogeneous nature of the soil column, and the unavoidable use of point versus layer average temperatures. Discrepancies also exist between measured and modelled snow mass duration and the timing of melt for three consecutive winters. This suggests that further tests of CLASS, using winter season data, must be conducted before it can be determined if the model is able to correctly simulate snow accumulation and melt. Wintertime total albedo at this site was also poorly modelled during the fall and winter periods. Further test runs determined that this overestimation in total albedo was not contributing significantly to the lower modelled soil temperatures or to the persistence of the winter snowpack.
   The correspondence between modelled and observed data, particularly given the complexity of the canopy and surface at this study site, is adequate but suggests that further code testing and development initiatives should be directed towards improving the simulation of latent and soil heat fluxes, shortwave reflectivity winter snowpack dynamics and surface and subsurface moisture transfers, by which are especially important in wetland environments.

AB Aluminum-hydroxide (boehmite)-rich Pennsylvanian coals of high volatile A bituminous rank were found previously in the Jungar Coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China. This paper reports new results on 48 bench samples of the CP2 coal from the adjacent Adaohai Mine, Daqingshan Coalfield, Inner Mongolia, and provides new insights into the origin and modes of occurrence of the minerals and elements present in the CP2 coal.
   Compared to the same coal in the adjacent mines, the CP2 coal in the Adaohai Mine has a higher rank (R-o,R-ran = 1.58%), which is attributed to igneous intrusions during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous Epochs. The proportion of inertinite (35.3%) in the coal is higher than that in other Late Paleozoic coals in northern China but lower than that in the Jungar coals.
   Minerals in the CP2 coal include diaspore, boehmite, gorceixite, calcite, dolomite, siderite, clay minerals (kaolinite and ammonian illite), and trace amounts of anatase, fluorapatite, quartz, and pyrite. Based on mineral proportions in the coal bench samples, the CP2 coal may be divided into four Zones (I to IV) from bottom to top. The major mineral in Zones I and IV is kaolinite. Zones II and III are mainly composed of ammonian illite, diaspore, boehmite, gorceixite, calcite, dolomite, and siderite. Diaspore-, boehmite-, and gorceixite-forming materials were derived from oxidized bauxite in the weathered crust of the Benxi Formation in the sediment-source region during peat accumulation. However, gorceixite may have formed earlier than diaspore; the diaspore was derived from gibbsite that was subjected to dehydration by the heat of the igneous intrusions. The ammonian illite may have been formed at a relatively high temperature by interaction of kaolinite with nitrogen released from the organic matter in the coal during metamorphism caused by the igneous intrusion. The calcite and dolomite occur as epigenetic cell- and fracture-fillings and were probably derived from the igneous fluids.
   Compared to the common Chinese and world coals, the CP2 coal is enriched in CaO (1.69%), MgO (0.32%), P2O5 (0.214%), F (207 mu g/g), Ga (163 mu g/g), Zr (446 mu g/g), Ba (276 mu g/g), Hg (0.33 mu g/g), and Th (12.4 mu/g), but has a lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio due to the higher proportions of diaspore, boehmite, and gorceixite in the coal. The F occurs mainly in gorceixite and fluorapatite. The major carriers of Ga are diaspore and kaolinite but not gorceixite. Barium mainly occurs in gorceixite and barite. Mercury was probably derived from the igneous intrusion and is distributed in both the organic matter and the minerals. The elements are classified into five associations by cluster analysis, Groups A, B, C, D, and E. Group A represents a REE-Be-Y-Se-Ga-Ge-Sc-In-Pb-Bi-Nb-Ta-TiO2-W-Hg-Sb-Zr-Hf-Th-U association. Most of the elements in Group A are lithophile elements that occur in aluminosilicate minerals. Group B (Sn-Te-Zn-Cd-V-As-Cr-Cu-Mo-Ni-Re) is weakly correlated with ash yield and is associated with unidentified trace sulfide minerals. Elements in Group C (A(d)-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2- Li-K2O-Rb-Cs-TI association) probably occur in the clay minerals and diaspore. Group D consists of P2O5, Ba, F, Sr, S. and Cl, and with the exception of S. they occur in minerals (gorceixite and fluorapatite). Oxides of Fe2O3-MnO-CaO-MgO make up Group E and mainly occur in the carbonate minerals. The coals are enriched in light REEs and the LREEs-HREEs have been highly fractionated, with an average (La/Yb)(N) of 8.71. The heavy REEs in the coals have a stronger organic affinity than the LREEs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic lagoons of barrier reefs provide great potential as sedimentary archives focusing on paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes as well as on event deposition. Sediment sources include lagoonal carbonate production, the marginal reef and the volcanic hinterland. Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic continent attached coastal lagoons have been intensively studied, however, their isolated oceanic counterparts have been widely disregarded. Here, we present a new model of Holocene sediment dynamics in the barrier-reef lagoon of Bora Bora based on sedimentological, paleontological, geochronological and geochemical data. The lagoonal succession started with a Pleistocene soil representing the Lowstand Systems Tract. As the rising Holocene sea inundated the carbonate platform, peat accumulated locally similar to 10,650-9400 years BP. Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation started ca. 8700-5500 years BP and represents the Transgressive Systems Tract. During that time, sediments were characterized by relatively coarse grain size and contained high amounts of terrestrial material from the volcanic hinterland as well as carbonate sediments mainly produced within the lagoon. Siliciclastic content decreases throughout the Holocene. After the rising sea had reached its modern level, sand aprons formed between reef crest and lagoon creating transport pathways for reef-derived material leading to carbonate-dominated sedimentation ca. 6000-3009 years BP during the Highstand Systems Tract. However, mainly fine material was transported and accumulated in the lagoon while coarser grains were retained on the prograding sand apron. From ca. 4500-500 years BP, significant variations in grain-size, total organic carbon as indicator for primary productivity, Ca and Cl element intensities as qualitative indicators for carbonate availability and lagoonal salinity are seen. Such patterns could indicate event (re-)deposition and correlate with contemporaneous event deposits found in the lagoon of nearby Tahaa, which are supposed to be induced by elevated cyclone activity. Correspondingly, enhanced erosion and run-off from the volcanic hinterland as well as lower lagoonal salinity would be associated with intense rainfall during repeated cyclone landfall. Increased amounts of coarse-grained sediment from marginal reef areas would be transported into the lagoon. However, Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios as proxies for terrigenous sediment delivery have incessantly declined since the mid-Holocene. Also, benthic foraminiferal faunas do not validate reef-to-lagoon transport of sediment. Alternatively, the apparent onset of higher hydrodynamic energy conditions can be explained by more permanent southeast trade winds and higher-than-present sea level, which are supposed for the mid-late Holocene in the south Pacific. Sustained winds would have flushed higher amounts of open ocean water into the lagoon enhancing primary productivity and the amount of pelagic organisms within the lagoon while lowering lagoonal salinity. We propose the shift towards coarser-grained sedimentation patterns during the mid-late Holocene to reflect sediment-load shedding of sand aprons due to oversteepening of slopes at sand apron/lagoon edges during times of stronger trades and higher-than-present sea level of the Highstand Systems Tract, which led to redeposition of sediment even within the lagoon center. Modern conditions including a sea-level fall to modern level were reached ca.
   1000 years BP, and lagoonal infill has been determined to a large part by fine-grained carbonate-dominated sediments produced within the lagoon and derived from the marignal reef. Infill of lagoonal accommodation space via sand aprons is estimated to be up to six times higher than infill by lagoonal background sedimentation and emphasizes the importance of the progradation of sand aprons. Contrary to the commonly supposed assumption that coarse grained sediment layers within fine-grained lagoonal successions represent overwash events induced by storms or periods of higher storm activity, we postulate a new model of long-term lagoonal sediment dynamics including sea level, climatic change and geomorphological variation of the barrier reef lagoon.

AB Before publication of Fisk's classic scientific papers dealing with the Mississippi River alluvial valley and deltaic plain, geological knowledge of the Holocene deltaic plain was the product of surficial geomorphological studies with a temporal framework provided by archaeology. Fisk and his co-workers provided the third and fourth dimensions, the three-dimensional characteristics of sediment bodies, by numerous deep borings and better chronostratigraphy through C-14 dating. This research, and the emphasis of his work on fluvial processes, was largely responsible for the form-process approach in sedimentary geology and the awareness that depositional environments are represented by unique sedimentary sequences and properties. Although Fisk made many contributions to deltaic geology, six major areas are noteworthy: delta response to base level changes, sedimentary loading, processes of delta switching, delta abandonment and formation of transgressive sands, river diversion (Atchafalaya distributary), and deltaic sedimentary architecture.
   In order to comprehend the complexly structured Holocene deltaic plain, the processes of channel migration, meander belt formation, avulsion, and delta switching must be understood. Preceding the work of Fisk, landforms resultant from these processes were recognized by geomorphologists, and this body of research formed the foundation for Fisk's major contributions. Using the concept of changing sea levels during the Quaternary, Fisk was one of the initial scientists to recognize the importance of a changing base level and its effect on valley cutting and filling episodes, particularly during the process of valley filling by fluvial and deltaic sediments during rising sea level. In documenting these cyclic processes, he first postulated the development of canyons or trenches carved across the continental shelf, the development of shelf-edge deltas, and the feeding of the deep-sea fans during periods of lowered sea level. Trowbridge (1930) and Russell and Russell (1939) described the dendritic shape of delta lobes and indicated that they were offset and overlapping, resulting in the Holocene deltaic plain configuration; delta chronology was provided by utilizing archeological methods (McIntire, 1954). The pioneering work of Fisk and McFarlan (1955) on the Mississippi delta set the stage for refinement of delta lobe chronology. Details regarding the timing of important depositional events have been added by McFarlan (1961), Frazier (1967), Morgan (1970), Penland and Suter(1989) and, most recently, Autin et al. (1991).
   In collecting data on offshore Mississippi River delta deposits, Fisk documented the regional subsidence associated with loading by continuous delta deposition as well, as the localized subsidence associated with delta-front deposition and the formation of mud diapirs. He later applied this concept to the accumulation of peat deposits in interdistributary regions and the development of interdistributary bays. This research was the foundation for work by later scientists dealing with wetland loss in the deltaic plain. Fisk was the first major contributor to our current understanding of the stratigraphic-sedimentological architecture of the modern deltaic plain of the Mississippi River. The first cross-sections of the deltaic plain were published by Fisk (1947), prior to which there were little data for establishing the geometry of sediment bodies and spatial relationships of facies beneath the modern surface. Classic examples of this approach were the point bar and backswamp studies in the alluvial valley of the Lower Mississippi River (Fisk, 1944), his bar-finger sand paper (Fisk, 1961), and his more comprehensive sand facies paper (Fisk, 1955). This body of work on sedimentary facies relationships and specifically sand body geometries found wide acceptance among both academic and industry groups. At the time Fisk prepared his appraisal of sand facies in the Mississippi delta he was an employee of Humble Oil and Refining Company, and the paper was obviously directed toward understanding reservoir geometries and spatial relationships in a deltaic complex. In addition to the sedimentary architecture of the delta, Fisk also contributed to understanding of both the constructive and destructive cycles, the geotechnical properties of various delta facies, and subsidence, all of which helped establish an awareness of the critical need for geological knowledge in engineering applications.
   Since Fisk's contributions, the major advances in understanding the Holocene deltaic plain have been primarily in the realm of filling in the details of Fisk's sedimentary architecture. The mudlump studies of Morgan (1961) and work on crevasse splays and bay-fill sequences by Welder (1959), Coleman and Gagliano (1964), and Morgan (1970), as well as others, are good examples. Later, work on the new lobe of the deltaic plain, the Atchafalaya-Wax Lake delta complex (Shlemon, 1975; Roberts et al., 1980a, van Heerden and Roberts, 1980; van Heerden et al., 1983), added an element to the deltaic plain evolutionary story that was not available during Fisk's era. However, regardless of future research on the Mississippi River deltaic plain, the body of work produced by Fisk and his co-workers will always be recognized as the cornerstone of our understanding of this complex depositional system.

AB Uncertainty about the geological processes that deposited syngenetically frozen ice-rich silt (yedoma) across hundreds of thousands of square kilometres in central and northern Siberia fundamentally limits our understanding of the Pleistocene geology and palaeoecology of western Beringia, the sedimentary processes that led to sequestration of hundreds of Pg of carbon within permafrost and whether yedoma provides a globally significant record of ice-age atmospheric conditions or just regional floodplain activity. Here, we test the hypotheses of aeolian versus waterlain deposition of yedoma silt, elucidate the palaeoenvironmental conditions during deposition and develop a conceptual model of silt deposition to clarify understanding of yedoma formation in northern circumpolar regions during the Late Pleistocene. This is based on a field study in 2009 of the Russian stratotype of the 'Yedoma Suite', at Duvanny Yar, in the lower Kolyma River, northern Yakutia, supplemented by observations that we have collected there and at other sites in the Kolyma Lowland since the 1970s. We reconstruct a cold-climate loess region in northern Siberia that forms part of a vast Late Pleistocene permafrost zone extending from northwest Europe across northern Asia to northwest North America, and that was characterised by intense aeolian activity.
   Five litho-and cryostratigraphic units are identified in yedoma remnant 7E at Duvanny Yar, in ascending stratigraphic order: (1) massive silt, (2) peat, (3) stratified silt, (4) yedoma silt and (5) near-surface silt. The yedoma silt of unit 4 dominates the stratigraphy and is at least 34 m thick. It is characterised by horizontal to gently undulating subtle colour bands but typically lacks primary sedimentary stratification. Texturally, the yedoma silt has mean values of 65 +/- 7 per cent silt, 15 +/- 8 per cent sand and 21 +/- 4 per cent clay. Particle size distributions are bi- to polymodal, with a primary mode of about 41 mu m (coarse silt) and subsidiary modes are 0.3-0.7 mu m (very fine clay to fine clay), 3-5 mu m (coarse clay to very fine silt), 8-16 mu m (fine silt) and 150-350 mu m (fine sand to medium sand). Semidecomposed fine plant material is abundant and fine in-situ roots are pervasive. Syngenetic ice wedges, cryostructures and microcryostructures record syngenetic freezing of the silt. An age model for silt deposition is constructed from 47 pre-Holocene accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 ages, mostly from in-situ roots and from three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of quartz sand grains. The C-14 ages indicate that silt deposition extends from 19 000 +/- 300 cal BP to 50 000 cal BP or beyond. The OSL ages range from 21.2 +/- 1.9 ka near the top of the yedoma to 48.6 +/- 2.9 ka near the bottom, broadly consistent with the C-14 age model.
   Most of the yedoma silt in unit 4 at Duvanny Yar constitutes cryopedolith (sediment that has experienced incipient pedogenesis along with syngenetic freezing). Mineralised and humified organic remains dispersed within cryopedolith indicate incipient soil formation, but distinct soil horizons are absent. Five buried palaeosols and palaeosol 'complexes' are identified within cryopedolith on the basis of sedimentary and geochemical properties. Magnetic susceptibility, organic content, elemental concentrations and ratios tend to deviate from average values of these parameters at five levels in unit 4. The cryopedolith-palaeosol sequence accreted incrementally upwards on a vegetated palaeo-land surface with a relief of at least several metres, preserving syngenetic ground ice in the aggrading permafrost. Pollen spectra dated to between about 17 000 and 25 000 C-14 BP characteristically have frequencies of 20-60 per cent tree/shrub pollen (mainly Betula and Pinus) and 20-60 per cent graminoids, predominantly Poaceae, plus forbs, whereas spectra dated to about 30 000-33 000 C-14 BP have lower values of woody taxa (about 10%) and are dominated by graminoids (mainly Poaceae), forbs (particularly Caryophyllaceae and Asteraceae) and Selaginella rupestris. The latter are more typical of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples reported elsewhere in Siberia, and the unusually high arboreal pollen values in the LGM yedoma at Duvanny Yar are attributed to long-distance transport of pollen.
   Three hypotheses concerning the processes and environmental conditions of yedoma silt deposition at Duvanny Yar are tested. The alluvial-lacustrine hypothesis and the polygenetic hypothesis are both discounted on sedimentary, palaeoenvironmental, geocryological and palaeoecological grounds. The loessal hypothesis provides the only reasonable explanation to account for the bulk of the unit 4 yedoma silt at this site. Supporting the loessal interpretation are sedimentological and geocryological similarities between the Duvanny Yar loess-palaeosol sequence and cold-climate loesses in central and northern Alaska, the Klondike (Yukon), western and central Siberia and northwest Europe. Differences between loess at Duvanny Yar and that in western and central Siberia and northwest Europe include the persistence of permafrost and the abundance of ground ice and fine in-situ roots within the yedoma. Modern analogues of cold-climate loess deposition are envisaged at a local scale in cold, humid climates where local entrainment and deposition of loess are generally restricted to large alluvial valleys containing rivers that are glacially sourced or drain areas containing Late Pleistocene glacial deposits, and thus glacially ground silt. The Duvanny Yar yedoma shares sedimentological and geocryological features with yedoma interpreted as ice-rich loess or reworked loess facies at Itkillik (northern Alaska) and in the central Yakutian lowland, and with yedoma in the Laptev Sea region and the New Siberian Archipelago. It is therefore suggested that many lowland yedoma sections across Beringia are primarily of aeolian origin (or consist of reworked aeolian sediments), although other depositional processes (e.g. alluvial and colluvial) may account for some yedoma sequences in river valleys and mountains.
   A conceptual model of yedoma silt deposition at Duvanny Yar as cold-climate loess in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and MIS 2 envisages summer or autumn as the main season of loess deposition. In summer, the land surface was snow-free, unfrozen and relatively dry, making it vulnerable to deflation. Graminoids, forbs and biological soil crust communities trapped and stabilised windblown sediments. Loess accretion resulted from semicontinuous deposition of fine background particles and episodic, discrete dust storms that deposited coarse silt. Winter was characterised by deep thermal contraction cracking beneath thin and dusty snow covers, and snow and frozen ground restricted deflation and sediment trapping by dead grasses. Sources of loess at Duvanny Yar potentially include: (1) sediments and weathered bedrock on uplands to the east, south and southwest of the Kolyma Lowland; (2) alluvium deposited by rivers draining these uplands; and (3) sediments exposed in the Khallerchin tundra to the north and on the emergent continental shelf of the East Siberian Sea. Glacially sourced tributaries of the palaeo-Kolyma River contributed glacially ground silt into channel and/or floodplain deposits, and some of these were probably reworked by wind and deposited as loess in the Kolyma Lowland.
   The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the sedimentary sequence at Duvanny Yar is traced from MIS 6 to the late Holocene. It includes thermokarst activity associated with alas lake development in the Kazantsevo interglacial (MIS 5e), loess accumulation, pedogenesis and syngenetic permafrost development, possibly commencing in the Zyryan glacial (70 000-55 000 cal BP) and extending through the Karginsky interstadial (55 000-25 000 cal BP) and Sartan glacial (25 000-15 000 cal BP), cessation of yedoma silt deposition during the Lateglacial, renewed thermokarst activity in the early Holocene, and permafrost aggradation in the mid to late Holocene.
   Beringian coastlands from northeast Yakutia through the north Alaskan Coastal Plain to the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (Canada) were characterised by extensive aeolian activity (deflation, loess, sand dunes, sand sheets, sand wedges) during MIS 2. Siberian and Canadian high-pressure cells coupled with a strengthened Aleutian low-pressure cell would have created enhanced pressure gradient-driven winds sufficient to entrain sediment on a regional scale. Summer winds are thought to have deflated sediment exposed on the East Siberian Sea shelf and deposited silt as a distal aeolian facies to the south. Additionally, stronger localised winds created by local downslope gravity flows (katabatic winds) may have entrained sediment. Local katabatic winds in summer may have transported silt generally northwards towards the Kolyma Lowland, particularly during times of extended upland glaciation in the North Anyuy Range to the east during the Zyryan (MIS 4) period, whereas winter winds carried limited amounts of silt generally southwards as a result of pressure gradient forces. The Duvanny Yar yedoma is part of a subcontinental-scale region of Late Pleistocene cold-climate loess. One end member, exemplified by the yedoma at Duvanny Yar, was loess rich in syngenetic ground ice (Beringian yedoma). The other, exemplified by loess in northwest Europe, was ice-poor and subject to complete permafrost degradation at the end of the last ice age. These end members reflect a distinction between enduring cold continuous permafrost conditions leading to stacked ice-rich transition zones and large syngenetic ice wedges in much of Beringia versus conditions oscillating between cold permafrost, warm permafrost and seasonal frost, leading to repeated permafrost thaw and small ice-wedge pseudomorphs in northwest Europe.

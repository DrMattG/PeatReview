ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is recognized as a preferable alternative fuel for ship owners, since it can substantially reduce harmful emissions to comply with stricter environmental regulations. The increasing number of LNG-fueled vessels has driven up the number of LNG bunkering vessels (LNGBVs) as well. A key issue of LNGBVs is boil-off gas (BOG) generation, especially the huge amount of BOG that is generated during loading and unloading (bunkering) processes. This study proposes a hybrid system that combines conventional onboard LNG-fueled generators with an energy storage system (ESS) to solve the BOG issue of LNGBVs. This hybrid system is targeted at an LNGBV with the cargo capacity of 5000 m(3). The amount of BOG generation is calculated based on assumed operation modes, and the economic study and the environmental analysis are performed based on the results. By comparing the conventional system to the proposed ones, some benefits can be verified: about 46.2% BOG reduction, 66.0% fuel saving, a 7.6-year payback period, and 4.8 tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction for one voyage in the best case, with some assumptions. This proposed hybrid system using the ESS could be an attractive green solution to LNGBV owners.

AB There has been lively debate, especially in Finland and Sweden, on the climate impacts of peat fuel. Previous studies of peat fuel's life-cycle climate impacts were controversial in their interpretation. The aim of this paper is conclusive examination of the issues of LCA methodology, derived from critical review of previous studies and recalculation based on the latest knowledge of greenhouse gas balances related to peat fuel's utilisation and the radiative forcing impacts of greenhouse gases.
   The most recent findings on emissions and the gas fluxes between soil, vegetation and atmosphere were used in calculation of the life-cycle climate impacts of the various peat fuel utilisation chains by means of LCA methodology. In the main, the calculation methods and rules were the same as in the previous studies, with the aim being to distinguish the impact of peat fuel's utilisation from that of the natural or semi-natural situation. A dynamic method was employed for assessing changes in radiative forcing. The results of alternative peat fuel utilisation chains were compared to the corresponding result for coal.
   There are many steps in peat fuel LCA, where different assumptions lead to different outcomes. Determining the functional unit, reference situations and system boundaries, as well as the emission calculation methods, is important from this point of view. Determination of the initial reference situation emerged as one of the critical points in the calculations. Time scale can strongly affect the final outcomes in a study where effects of long-term land-use change are considered.
   Each peatland area is unique. The higher the greenhouse gas emissions in the initial reference situation, the greater is the climate impact of the area and the more suitable the area is for peat extraction. The study showed that more greenhouse gas flux measurements are needed, for better assessment of the climate impacts of different potential peat extraction sites. Climate change mitigation requires quick actions, and uncertainties related to emissions are higher for longer time spans. Therefore, it can be concluded that a perspective spanning more than 100 years is inappropriate in peat fuel's life-cycle climate impact assessments.

AB Compost produced from biological treatment of organic waste has a potential for substituting peat in growth media preparation. The life-cycle-inventories (LCIs) of the two alternatives were compared using LCA-modelling (EASEWASTE) considering a 100-year period and a volumetric substitution ratio of 1:1. For the compost alternative, the composting process, growth media use, and offsetting of mineral fertilizers were considered. For the peat alternative, peatland preparation, excavation, transportation, and growth media use were considered. It was assumed that for compost 14% of the initial carbon was left in the soil after 100 years, while all carbon in peat was mineralized. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, the former is considered a saving, while the later is considered an emission, because peat in a peatland is considered stored biogenic carbon. The leaching during the growth media use was assessed by means of batch leaching tests involving 4 compost samples and 7 peat samples. The compost leached 3-20 times more heavy metals and other compounds than the peat. The life-cycle-assessment showed that compost performs better regarding global warming (savings in the range of 70-150 kg CO(2)-eq. Mg(-1)) and nutrient enrichment (savings in the range of 1.7-6.8 kg NO(3) Mg(-1) compost), while peat performs better in some toxic categories, because of the lower content of heavy metals.

AB Climate warming and subsequent permafrost thaw may result in organic carbon and nutrient stores being metabolized by microbial communities, resulting in a positive feedback loop of greenhouse gas (GHG) soil emissions. As the third most important GHG, understanding nitrous oxide (N2O) flux in Arctic mineral ice-wedge polygon cryosols and its relationship to the active microbial community is potentially a key parameter for understanding future GHG emissions and climatic warming potential. In the present study, metatranscriptomic analyses of active layer Arctic cryosols, at a representative ice-wedge polygon site, identified active nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying bacteria that included members of Rhizobiaceae, Nostocaceae, Cyanothecaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Burkholderiaceae, Chloroflexaceae, Azotobacteraceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae. Unique microbial assemblages with higher proportion of Rhodobacteriales and Rhocyclales were identified by targeted functional gene sequencing at locations with higher (P = 0.053) N2O emissions in the wetter trough soils compared with the dryer polygon interior soils. This coincided with a higher relative abundance of the denitrification nirS gene and higher nitrate/nitrite concentrations in trough soils. The elevated N2O flux observed from wetter trough soils compared with drier polygon interior soils is concerning from a climate warming perspective, since the Arctic is predicted to become warmer and wetter.

   DEPENDENCE; PEATLANDS; EMISSIONS; RESPONSES; CH4; NITROGEN
AB The peatlands of northern latitudes represent an enormous store of organic carbon. The decomposition of peat and the release of carbon dioxide is expected to increase with temperature as a result of climate change. CO2 emission and O-2 uptake were measured during laboratory incubations of homogenised peat samples from 15 sites in Scotland. These were made either at fixed temperatures or in experiments where the temperature was steadily raised and lowered in 2 degrees C steps, enabling Arrhenius plots to be made and the temperature response to be quantified as an activation energy or as a Q(10) The respiratory quotient varied with temperature and this led to higher Q(10) values for O-2 uptake than for CO2 emission. Feats varied widely in their response to temperature; Q(10) values were between 2.2 and 19 with a mean of 4.8. For most peats the response was approximately constant over the range of temperature tested but a third of the peats showed a marked deviation over the range 1-5 degrees C where Q(10) values increased considerably. Several published models describing the change in temperature response with temperature were applied to the data. A function in which the log of;the soil respiration rate is a quadratic in temperature gave the best coverall fit. Based on the observed laboratory Q(10) values, a rise in mean annual temperature of 5 degrees C could potentially increase CO2 emissions by a factor of 2- to 4-fold. For some peats at low temperatures (0-5 degrees C) small changes in temperature could have a much more marked effect. This may be significant for the peatlands in Scotland and similar latitudes where soil temperatures are commonly within this range and where predicted temperature increases over the next 50 years may bring about a significant increase in peat decomposition rates.

AB Freeze-thaw (FT) events and increasing nitrogen (N) availability may alter N turnover and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in permafrost peatlands. However, the responses of N2O emissions to different N levels and additions during FT events are far from clear. We conducted an incubation study to investigate the impacts of different N addition levels (LN: 0.07 mg N g(-1), HN: 0.14 mg N g(-1)) and N addition forms (AC: ammonium chloride, NS: sodium nitrate) on the emissions of N2O under FT and non-freeze-thaw (NFT) conditions in boreal peatlands of Northeast China. Results indicated that the FT condition significantly increased N2O emissions compared with the NFT condition and peaks occurred during thawing. Compared with AC treatments, NS treatments significantly elevated the accumulation of N2O emissions under the FT condition, exhibiting significant differences in different NS levels. N2O emissions were also positively dependent on soil NO3- concentrations to supply nitrate for denitrification. Nitrate-N addition was mainly responsible for the burst of N2O with denitrification as the main process during FT events. Therefore, these results suggest that N2O emissions potentially increase during FT events with increasing nitrate-N deposition in permafrost peatlands, which would contribute to global climate warming.

DT Article
DE permafrost; peatlands; climate change; hydrology; carbon
AB Permafrost peatlands are found in high-latitude regions and store globally-important amounts of soil organic carbon. These regions are warming at over twice the global average rate, causing permafrost thaw, and exposing previously inert carbon to decomposition and emission to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. However, it is unclear how peatland hydrological behaviour, vegetation structure and carbon balance, and the linkages between them, will respond to permafrost thaw in a warming climate. Here we show that permafrost peatlands follow divergent ecohydrological trajectories in response to recent climate change within the same rapidly warming region (northern Sweden). Whether a site becomes wetter or drier depends on local factors and the autogenic response of individual peatlands. We find that bryophyte-dominated vegetation demonstrates resistance, and in some cases resilience, to climatic and hydrological shifts. Drying at four sites is clearly associated with reduced carbon sequestration, while no clear relationship at wetting sites is observed. We highlight the complex dynamics of permafrost peatlands and warn against an overly-simple approach when considering their ecohydrological trajectories and role as C sinks under a warming climate.

AB This study of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany is based on the national greenhouse gas inventory, which was compiled as part of a report the EU's National Inventory Report (NIR) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in order to collect and evaluate data about all direct GHG emissions from agriculture at the state level. The purpose of this anallysis was (1) to determine which GHG sources are the most important and should, therefore, be primarily considered for the implementation of mitigation strategies; and (2) to find any possible connections between structural and technological changes as well as changes in management which have influenced the amount of GHG emissions from the individual sources over the past years since 1990.
   A business ABC analysis was used to analyse the data from the NIR as it is a method which allows a rating of the sources and sinks for GHG emissions, thereby enabling their importance to be determined. Based on this approach, individual strategies for different countries can be evaluated in order to determine the proper strategy out of a portfolio of mitigation measures for each country.
   Out of a total of 30 individual sources identified in Germany using the ABC analysis, four GHG sources contributed to 63.2% of the total emissions from the agricultural sector: agriculturally used peat soils, entric fermentation of cattle, drainage of grassland and usage of mineral fertilizer In the MR, five emission categories are given; namely, manure management, enteric fermentation, agricultural soils, land use and land use change (LULUC), and fuels. The categories dealing with the utilization of farmland, namely agricultural soils and LULUC, were found to cause 68.6% of the total of GHG emissions from agriculture. lnterestingly, the consumption of fuels, even in a highly mechanised agricultural system such as that found in Germany, only represents 6% of the total GHG emissions from agriculture. Sinks ill Germany are minor (is they only sequestrate 1.5% (if the total emissions. The evaluation of the agricultural GHG emission changes ill Germany, which decreased by about 16.0% within the period from 1990 to 2004, shows that the biggest part of GHG emission mitigation has been based oil structural change rather than oil abatement measures.

AB Wetlands and their ability to mitigate climate change motivates restorative and protective action; however, scientific understanding of land-atmosphere interactions is restricted by our limited continuous observations of gaseous fluxes. Many wetlands are small in spatial scale and embedded in forested landscapes. Yet, little is known about how the relative sheltering of forests affects net carbon (C) and energy balance. Here, we analyze coterminous USGS and Ameriflux eddy covariance flux tower observations over 3 years in two shrub fens in Northern Wisconsin, one more sheltered (US-ALQ) than the other (US-Los). Unsurprisingly, the open site showed higher overall wind speeds. This should have implications for atmospheric fluxes in wetlands as wind-forced processes are essential in promoting gas exchange over water. While both sites had similar half-hourly net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) during daytime, there were significant differences in nighttime NEE, as well as in net radiation partitioning in early spring and late summer. Sensible heat (H) fluxes were smaller at the sheltered fen except for the months of July-September. In contrast, latent heat (LE) fluxes were higher in every month except July. Additionally, sheltered fen ecosystem respiration had a weaker linear correlation with air temperature (R: 0.08 vs. 0.57 for the open fen). Our work suggests that canopy sheltering does not cause significant differences in half-hourly NEE during the day, but rather the largest differences such as lower CO2 emissions occur at nighttime due to higher variance at very low wind speeds. Sheltering also influenced direction of air flow, mean wind speeds in day vs. night, energy balance, and sensible and latent heat fluxes. We discuss implications of these findings for wetland restoration.

DE Sediment; Reuse; Land subsidence; GHG emissions; Nutrients
AB The Regional Water Authority of Schieland and Krimpenerwaard (HHSK), The-Netherlands will execute a pilot in 2018-2019 in which locally dredged sediment of high-organic composition will be upcycled, by blending it with other local waste products, e.g. green waste, animal manure and water purification deposits. This transforms the sediment into a valuable resource that can be used to elevate low-lying and sinking peatlands. Large areas of peatland in Dutch polders are compacting. This results in the last decades in sinking land elevation levels with big consequences for water management, bio diversity, economical and ecological utility, CO2 emissions etc. HHSK dredges yearly approx. 150.000 m(3) from waterways at an average costs of (sic)3.000.000. The HHSK pilot entails the first full-scale test of a promising concept, developed by Dutch engineers, called Topsurf [1]. The pilot investigates prevention of land subsidence of the low lying peatlands at risk of flooding as well as improvement of the soil quality with at the same time a positive effect on the reduction of sediment landfill, the costs of dredging, CO2 output and disturbance for the environment (no/less transport needed).

AB Coastal zones connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems forming a unique environment that is under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise.

AB The effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition to peatland ecosystem on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using the closed chamber method during one growing season within a peatland on the Tibetan Plateau. The highest N2O fluxes occurred during late spring (May), while fluxes of N2O were lowest during early autumn (September). No significant correlations were found between N2O emissions and soil temperature. Because of the sites stable hydrological conditions no evidence of correlations between N2O emissions and water content was found. There was a negative correlation between N2O fluxes and vegetation height. It was clearly shown that the emissions of N2O were significantly affected by increasing N availability. In contrast to that, no significant effect of P addition on the emissions of N2O was found in the present study.

AB Drained peat soils are important sources of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (NA)), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases are produced in soil and they can be emitted year-round. We measured N2O and CH4 flux rates and total respiration (R-TOT) over a year from a drained peatland with one subsite as a grass field and another forested. The field acted annually as a small source (0.36 +/- 0.73 kg C.ha(-1)) and the forest as a sink (-1.93 +/- 0.50 kg C.ha(-1)) for CH4. Mean annual R-TOT rates were 660 and 297 mg.m(-2).h(-1) in the field and in the forest, respectively. Annual N2O emission rates were 34.8 +/- 2.4 kg N.ha(-1) from the field and 25.5 +/- 5.5 kg N-ha(-1) from the forest. More than 80% of the annual N2O emissions took place during winter. In the field, high emissions were detected during thawing in April when N2O accumulated in soil during the winter was released. In the forest, N2O emissions peaked when the top soil was freezing in January and accumulation of N2O in soil was less than in the field. The timing of the episodic high N2O emissions thus differed depending on the land use.

AB Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural farming practice contribute significantly to European GHG inventories. For example, CO2 is emitted when grassland is converted to cropland or when peatlands are drained and cultivated. N2O emissions result from fertilization. Enabling farmers to reduce their GHG emissions requires sufficient information about its pressure-impact relations as well as incentives, such as regulations and funding, that support climate-friendly agricultural management. This paper discusses potentials to improve the supply of information on: farm-specific climate services or impacts, present policy incentives in Germany and England that support climate-friendly farm management and related adaptation requirements. Tools which have been developed for a farm environmental management software (to be added after review because of potential identification) are presented. These tools assess CO2 emissions from grassland conversion to cropland and peatland cultivation, as well as N2O emissions from nitrogen fertilization. As input data, the CO2 tool requires a classification of soil types according to soil organic carbon storage. The input data based on soil profile samples was compared with reference data from the literature. The N2O tool relies on farm data concerning fertilization. These tools were tested on three farms in order to determine their viability with respect to the availability of required data and the differentiation of results, which determines how well site-specific conservation measures can be identified. Assessing CO2 retention function of grassland conservation to cropland on the test farms leads to spatially differentiated results (similar to 100 to similar to 900 potentially mitigated t CO2 ha(-1)). Assessed N2O emissions varied from 0.41 to 1.1 t CO(2)eq. ha(-1) a(-1). The proposed methods support policies that promote a more differentiated funding of climate conservation measures. Conservation measures and areas can be selected so that they will have the greatest mitigation effects. However, even though present policy instruments in Germany and England, such as Cross Compliance and agri-environmental measures, have the potential to reduce agricultural GHG, they do not appear to guide measures effectively or site-specifically. In order to close this gap, agri-environmental measures with the potential to support climate protection should be spatially optimized. Additionally, the wetland restoration measures which are most effective in reducing GHG emissions should be included in funding schemes.

AB Wetlands are the single largest natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas, and occur extensively in the northern hemisphere. Large discrepancies remain between "bottom-up" and "top-down" estimates of northern CH4 emissions. To explore whether these discrepancies are due to poor representation of nongrowing season CH4 emissions, we synthesized nongrowing season and annual CH4 flux measurements from temperate, boreal, and tundra wetlands and uplands. Median nongrowing season wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 g/m(2) in bogs to 5.2 g/m(2) in marshes and were dependent on moisture, vegetation, and permafrost. Annual wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 gm(-2) year(-1) in tundra bogs to 78 gm(-2)year(-1) in temperate marshes. Uplands varied from CH4 sinks to CH4 sources with a median annual flux of 0.0 +/- 0.2 gm(-2)year(-1). The measured fraction of annual CH4 emissions during the nongrowing season (observed: 13% to 47%) was significantly larger than that was predicted by two process-based model ensembles, especially between 40 degrees and 60 degrees N (modeled: 4% to 17%). Constraining the model ensembles with the measured nongrowing fraction increased total nongrowing season and annual CH4 emissions. Using this constraint, the modeled nongrowing season wetland CH4 flux from >40 degrees north was 6.1 +/- 1.5 Tg/year, three times greater than the nongrowing season emissions of the unconstrained model ensemble. The annual wetland CH4 flux was 37 +/- 7 Tg/year from the data-constrained model ensemble, 25% larger than the unconstrained ensemble. Considering nongrowing season processes is critical for accurately estimating CH4 emissions from high-latitude ecosystems, and necessary for constraining the role of wetland emissions in a warming climate.

AB Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas whose concentration is increasing in the atmosphere(1). So far, the highest terrestrial nitrous oxide emissions have been measured in agricultural and tropical soils(2,3), and nitrous oxide emissions from northern natural soils have been considered negligible(4,5). Pristine tundra, one of the largest natural land cover types in the world, is a mosaic of different surface types including bare surfaces created by cryoturbation(6,7). Here we used a static chamber method to measure nitrous oxide emissions from the discontinuous permafrost zone in subarctic East European tundra. We show that nitrous oxide emissions from bare peat surfaces in the region, known as peat circles, range between 0.9 and 1.4 g nitrous oxide m(-2) from June to October, and are equivalent to those from tropical and agricultural soils. Extrapolation of our data to the whole Arctic reveals that the emissions from these hot spots could amount to similar to 0.1 Tg nitrous oxide yr(-1), corresponding to 4% of the global warming potential of Arctic methane emissions at present. Therefore, not only carbon, but also nitrogen stored in permafrost soils, has to be considered when assessing the present and future climatic impact of tundra.

AB Peatlands are complex ecosystems driven by many physical, chemical, and biological processes. Peat soils have a significant impact on water quality, ecosystem productivity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the extent of peatlands is decreasing across the world, mainly because of anthropogenic activities such as drainage for agriculture or groundwater abstractions in underlying aquifers. Potential changes in precipitation and temperature in the future are likely to apply additional pressure to wetland. In this context, a methodology for assessing and comparing the respective impacts of groundwater abstraction and climate change on a groundwater-fed wetland (135 km(2)) located in Northwest France, is presented. A groundwater model was developed, using flexible boundary conditions to represent surface-subsurface interactions which allowed examination of the extent of the wetland areas. This variable parameter is highly important for land management and is usually not considered in impact studies. The model was coupled with recharge estimation, groundwater abstraction scenarios, and climate change scenarios downscaled from 14 GCMs corresponding to the A1B greenhouse gas (GHG) scenario over the periods 1961-2000 and 2081-2100. Results show that climate change is expected to have an important impact and reduce the surface of wetlands by 5.3-13.6%. In comparison, the impact of groundwater abstraction (100% increase in the expected scenarios) would lead to a maximum decrease of 3.7%. Results also show that the impacts of climate change and groundwater abstraction could be partially mitigated by decreasing or stopping land drainage in specific parts of the area. Water management will require an appropriate compromise which encompasses ecosystem preservation, economic and public domain activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation plays a critical role in regulating ecosystem carbon (C) processes in peatlands, but vegetation faces serious degradation on the Tibetan Plateau, China. However, how vegetation degradation affects on carbon processes of peatlands remains unclear. Using the static chamber technique, we compared ecosystem respiration (Re) and methane (CH4) fluxes for healthy vegetation (HV) and degraded vegetation (DV) during two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) on peatlands of the Tibetan Plateau. We also determined the dominant factors controlling Re and CH4 fluxes. The average Re flux for DV (218.04 +/- 95.08 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 219.03 +/- 140.96 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014) was considerably larger than that at the HV(163.78 +/- 87.51 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 143.91 +/- 84.44 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014), whereas the average CH4 fluxes for DV (0.06 +/- 0.20 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 0.04 +/- 0.07 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014) were significantly lower than the corresponding fluxes for HV (2.19 +/- 2.05 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 0.85 +/- 0.95 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014). The Re fluxes for the two vegetative treatments had the same temporal trends, with the peaking flux observed in July 2014. The temporal patterns of CH4 fluxes were similar to Re for two vegetation treatments where fluxes peaked in July 2014. Soil temperatures were found to be the primary factors influencing temporal Re fluxes. Soil temperatures and soil water content (SWC) were found to be the dominant factors influencing temporal CH4 flux for HV, while the main control for CH4 emission was the SWC for DV. Therefore, vegetative condition must be considered when estimating Re and CH4 flux from peatlands, particularly under the current situation of climate warming.

AB Extreme summer droughts are expected to occur more often in the future in NW Europe due to climate change. These droughts might accelerate the rate of peat oxidation in drained peat areas, with impacts on soil subsidence, GHG emission and water quality. This study aimed at providing more insight in the oxidation of deep peat layers that had not previously been exposed to air, the so-called secondary decomposition.
   We incubated two types of peat (eutrophic and oligotrophic), sampled from permanently anoxic peat layers from nature reserves and agricultural peat meadows. Peat samples were incubated for thirteen weeks under anoxic conditions, but were exposed to air for one to eight weeks. The production of CO2 and CH4 was quantified as a proxy for decomposition; concentrations of soluble nutrients and phenolic compounds were also measured.
   The results showed that oxygenation led to a steep increase in the rate of decomposition, indicated by higher carbon loss rates during and after oxygenation compared to non-oxygenated samples. Carbon loss rates increased more for eutrophic peat (agricultural area: 352%, nature reserve: 182%) than for oligotrophic peat (83% and 159% respectively). Most peat samples investigated showed higher post-oxygenation CO2 and/or CH4 production compared to the anoxic pre-oxygenation period. This indicates that oxygenation stimulates decomposition, even after anoxic conditions have returned. Contrary to the enzymic latch theory, no effects of oxygenation on the concentrations of soluble or condensed phenolic compounds were detected. Soluble nutrient concentrations did not change due to oxygenation either. Noteworthy is the occurrence of pyrite mineralization and associated acidification in eutrophic peat. Thus, low summer water levels, for example due to climate change, should be avoided in order to limit exceptionally high decomposition rates and associated problems such as increasing subsidence rates, greenhouse gas emission, sulfate release and acidification.

AB A change in the European Union energy policy has markedly promoted the expansion of biogas production. Consequently, large amounts of nutrient-rich residues are being used as organic fertilizers. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to simulate the high-risk situation of enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions following organic fertilizer application in energy maize cultivation. We hypothesized that cattle slurry application enhanced CO2 and N2O fluxes compared to biogas digestate because of the overall higher carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) input, and that higher levels of CO2 and N2O emissions could be expected by increasing soil organic C (SOC) and N contents. Biogas digestate and cattle slurry, at a rate of 150 kg NH4+ ha(-1), were incorporated into 3 soil types with low, medium, and high SOC contents (Cambisol, Mollie Gleysol, and Sapric Histosol, termed C-low, C-medium, and C-high, respectively). The GHG exchange (CO2, CH4, and N2O) was measured on 5 replicates over a period of 22 d using the closed chamber technique. The application of cattle slurry resulted in significantly higher CO2 and N2O fluxes compared to the application of biogas digestate. No differences were observed in CH4 exchange, which was close to zero for all treatments. Significantly higher CO2 emissions were observed in C-high compared to the other two soil types, whereas the highest N2O emissions were observed in C-medium. Thus, the results demonstrate the importance of soil type-adapted fertilization with respect to changing soil physical and environmental conditions.

AB Previous pilot-scale studies have shown outstanding levels of efficiency in phosphorus removal by using hydrated oil shale ash (HOSA) sediments in horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) filters with low greenhouse gas emissions. However, no long-term full-scale experiment has been conducted using this material. From September 2013 to December 2015, two HSSF filters with different hydraulic loading regimes (NH1 with a stable loading regime and NH2 with a fluctuating regime), used to treat municipal wastewater, were analysed to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and to develop a treatment system with minimised GHG emissions. The fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O, as well as their emission factors were significantly lower when compared with studies where regular filter materials (sand, gravel, etc.) are in use. The fluctuating loading regime significantly increased CO2 and N2O fluxes (median values of -3.3 and 2.6 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), and 5.7 and 8.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) for NH1 and NH2 regimes, respectively), whereas no impact could be seen on CH4 emissions (median 93.3 and 95.6 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1), for NH1 and NH2, respectively). All GHG emissions were strongly affected by the chemical composition of the water entering into the system. The water purification efficiency of the system was satisfactory for most water quality parameters and excellent for phosphorus. Thus, the HOSA-filled filters have a good potential for municipal wastewater treatment with low GHG emission.

AB Fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured on a drained and forested peatland in 1992-1995. Net mineralization and nitrification were studied in situ in 1993-1994. Nitrogen additions in 1992 as KNO3, NH4Cl, or urea (100 kg N.ha(-1)) were used to study the fate and transformations of N in peat. The mean N2O emissions during the growth season in 1993 were 1.9, 2.6, 3.3, and 3.5 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Mean NO fluxes during the growth season in 1993 averaged 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.6 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea treatment, respectively. Annual net N mineralization was 87 kg N.ha(-1) in the control soil and 107, 129, and 91 kg.ha(-1) in the KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Added N increased the fluxes of N oxides at least for a year after the treatments. The study showed that forests on drained N-rich peat soils may be significant sources of N2O and NO and that their production of nitrogenous trace gases is enhanced by additional N.

AB Northern hemisphere peatlands play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, accounting for about 30% of global soil C and similar to 10-25% of global natural methane (CH4) emissions. Satellite remote sensing has the potential for extracting continuous information related to C exchange rates at regional and global extents, yet, few studies have focused on peatlands. In this study we examined the potential of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI and simple ratio, SR), MODIS light use efficiency (LUE) based gross primary production (GPP) and a MODIS derived phenological index (annual peak photosynthetic rate) for the estimation of eddy covariance (EC) flux-derived GPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) at four contrasting northern peatlands. At the four sites of this study MODIS NDVI and SR explained between 39% and 71%, and between 42% and 69% of the variation in EC-derived GPP, respectively; and between 25% and 53%, and between 29% and 39% of the variation in EC-derived NEP, respectively. The relationships were mostly consistent across sites and within sites, suggesting that data may be pooled across years and sites, which could simplify the prediction of gross and net C dioxide (CO2) uptake over large areas dominated by northern peatlands based on MODIS data. MODIS GPP explained between 68% and 89% of the variation in EC-derived GPP at the four study sites. The root mean square errors ranged between 0.62 and 1.16 g C m(-2) d(-1) and were similar to errors from ecosystem process model estimates reported in the literature. Annual peak MODIS GPP, NDVI and SR rates explained up to 50% of the variations in annual cumulative EC-derived GPP and NEP at two of the study sites. Our results show the potentials and limitations of MODIS data to monitor the C dynamics of northern peatlands; among the three studied approaches the MODIS LUE-based GPP approach showed better performance as a predictor of GPP and NEP. The other approaches (VIs and phenology) can provide important input data for LUE models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Intermittent loading is often used in constructed wetlands (CW) to improve water purification capacity, however, little is known of its impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.. We studied GHG fluxes in three CWs for municipal wastewater treatment in Estonia: the hybrid CW in Ko had an intermittently loaded (8-10 pulses a day) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) filter and a horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) filter with stable water level (10 cm below the surface), the HSSF filter in Kodijarve with higher (42 cm) but more fluctuating water level (from 5 to 75 cm) in inflow and lower (52 cm) but stable water level (30-70 cm) in outflow, and the HSSF filter in Paistu with fluctuating water table (0-70 cm). Intermittent loading enhanced N2O emissions from the VSSF filter in Ko and the inflow parts of the HSSF in Kodijarve. Due to higher organic loading rates in the inflow part of the HSSF in Kodijarve and in the VSSF filter in Ko, the fluctuating water table/intermittent loading did not influence the CO2 and CH4 fluxes. The lower water depths in Paistu resulted in higher CO2 and N2O, and lower CH4 emissions relative to other systems.

AB The area under the cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops on organic soils in the northern countries is fast increasing. To understand the impact of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinaceae L.) cultivation on the carbon dioxide (CO2) balance of an organic soil, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured for four years in a RCG cultivated cutover peatland in eastern Finland using the eddy covariance technique. There were striking differences among the years in the annual precipitation. The annual precipitation was higher during 2004 and 2007 and lower during 2005 and 2006 than the 1971-2000 regional mean. During wet growing seasons, moderate temperatures, high surface soil moisture and low evaporative demand favoured high CO2 uptake. During dry seasons, owing to soil moisture and atmospheric stress, photosynthetic activity was severely restricted. The CO2 uptake [gross primary productivity (GPP)] was positively correlated with soil moisture, air temperature and inversely with vapour pressure deficit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) increased with increasing soil temperature but decreased with increasing soil moisture. The relative responses of GPP and TER to moisture stress were different. While changes in TER for a given change in soil moisture were moderate, variations in GPP were drastic. Also, the seasonal variations in TER were not as conspicuous as those in GPP implying that GPP is the primary regulator of the interannual variability in NEE in this ecosystem. The ecosystem accumulated a total of 398 g Cm-2 from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2007. It retained some carbon during a wet year such as 2004 even after accounting for the loss of carbon in the form of harvested biomass. Based on this CO2 balance analysis, RCG cultivation is found to be a promising after-use option on an organic soil.

AB Biochar has been shown to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils, but the effect is highly variable across studies and the mechanisms are under debate. To improve our mechanistic understanding of biochar effects on N2O emission, we monitored kinetics of NO, N2O and N-2 accumulation in anoxic slurries of a peat and a mineral soil, spiked with nitrate and amended with feedstock dried at 105 degrees C and biochar produced at 372, 416, 562 and 796 C at five different doses. Both soils accumulated consistently less N2O and NO in the presence of high -temperature chars (BC562 and BC796), which stimulated reduction of denitrification intermediates to N-2, particularly in the acid peat. This effect appeared to be strongly linked to the degree of biochar carbonisation as predicted by the H:C ratio of the char. In addition, biochar surface area and pH were identified as important factors, whereas ash content and CEC played a minor role. At low pyrolysis temperature, the biochar effect was soil dependent, suppressing N2O accumulation in the mineral soil, but enhancing it in the peat soil. This contrast was likely due to the labile carbon content of low temperature chars, which contributed to immobilise N in the mineral soil, but stimulated denitrification and N2O emission in the peat soil. We conclude that biochar with a high degree of carbonisation, high pH and high surface area is best suited to supress N2O emission from denitrification, while low temperature chars risk supporting incomplete denitrification.

AB MoorFutures is the world's first carbon credit scheme from peatland rewetting. Thus far, MoorFutures rely on proxies (greenhouse gas emission site types or GESTs) to estimate emission reductions. Here, we tested the profitability of including direct greenhouse gas (GHG) measurements of project emissions for a range of re wetting costs and vegetation scenarios based on a hypothetical MoorFutures project. In almost all scenarios GEST assessments underestimated emission reductions compared with direct measurements. Including direct measurements was lucrative in > 50%, of all vegetation scenario/rewetting cost combinations with net profits ranging from EUR 8.18 to 26.31 per certificate. Profitability was achieved at rewetting costs of EUR 5400 ha(-1) upward. More sophisticated GHG measurements became profitable at twice the rewetting costs. In cases where direct flux measurements do not generate a profit they can strengthen reliability and buyers' trust and thus support higher prices of the certificates.

AB This study was aimed to understand the spatial variation of CH4 emissions from alpine wetlands in Southwest China on a field-scale in two phenological seasons, namely the peak growing season and the spring thaw. Methane emission rates were measured at 30 plots, which included three kinds of environmental types: dry hummock, Carex muliensis and Eleocharis valleculosa sites. There were highly spatial variations of methane emissions among and within different environmental types in both phenological seasons. Mean methane emission rates ranged from 1.1 to 37.0 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in the peak growing season and from 0.004 to 0.691 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in the spring thaw. In the peak growing season, coefficients of variation (CV) averaged 38% among environmental types and 64% within environmental types; while in the spring thaw, CV were on the average 61% among environmental types and 96% within environmental types. The key influencing factors were the standing water table and the plant community height in the peak growing season, while in the spring thaw, no significant correlations between factors and methane emissions were found.

AB Peatlands typically exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity which can lead to large uncertainties when catchment scale greenhouse gas fluxes are extrapolated from chamber measurements (generally <1 m(2)). Here we examined the underlying environmental and vegetation characteristics which led to within-site variability in both CH4 and N2O emissions and the importance of such variability in up-scaling. We also consider within-site variation in the controls of temporal dynamics. Net annual emissions (and coefficients of variation) for CH4 and N2O were 1.06 kg ha(-1) y(-1) (300%) and 0.02 kg ha(-1) y(-1) (410%), respectively. The riparian zone was a significant CH4 hotspot contributing similar to 12% of the total catchment emissions whilst covering only similar to 0.5% of the catchment area. In contrast to many other studies we found smaller CH4 emissions and greater uptake in chambers containing either sedges or rushes. We also found clear differences in the drivers of temporal CH4 dynamics across the site, e.g. water table was important only in chambers which did not contain aerenchymous plants. We suggest that depending on the heterogeneity of the site, flux models could be improved by incorporating a number of spatially distinct sub-models, rather than a single model parameterized using whole-catchment averages.

AB Canopy-Scale methane (CH4) flux measurement over a larch forest in eastern Siberia was conducted by eddy covariance method using an open-path CH4 gas analyzer. Though the uncorrected flux showed strong CH4 uptake in the daytime, this changed to CH4 emission after density and spectroscopic effects were corrected. Random flux errors calculated from cross-covariance functions suggested that CH4 flux was nearly the same as the upper boundary of the limit of flux detection at the 95th percentile, being barely resolved by the measurement system; and that most of the daytime CH4 flux remained positive even after uncertainties due to random flux errors were taken into consideration. CH4 flux showed clear diurnal variation, representing emission in the daytime and near-zero in the nighttime, irrespective of wind direction. The daytime CH4 flux was dependent on both air temperature and volumetric soil water content. The CH4 flux from May 29, to June 12, was calculated as net emissions of 4.9-13.8 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in daily average, ranging between the forest floor and a mesotrophic fen near this site measured by static chambers in a previous study.

AB Wetlands represent the dominant natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Thus, substantial effort has been spent examining the CH4 budgets of global wetlands via continuous ecosystem-scale measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. Robust error characterization for such measurements, however, remains a major challenge. Here, we quantify systematic, random and gap-filling errors and the resulting uncertainty in CH4 fluxes using a 3.5 year time series of simultaneous open- and closed path CH4 flux measurements over a sub-boreal wetland.
   After correcting for high- and low frequency flux attenuation, the magnitude of systematic frequency response errors were negligible relative to other uncertainties. Based on three different random flux error estimations, we found that errors of the CH4 flux measurement systems were smaller in magnitude than errors associated with the turbulent transport and flux footprint heterogeneity. Errors on individual half-hourly CH4 fluxes were typically 6%-41%, but not normally distributed (leptokurtic), and thus need to be appropriately characterized when fluxes are compared to chamber-derived or modeled CH4 fluxes.
   Integrated annual fluxes were only moderately sensitive to gap-filling, based on an evaluation of 4 different methods. Calculated budgets agreed on average to within 7% (<= 1.5 g-CH(4)m(-2) yr(-1)). Marginal distribution sampling using open source code was among the best-performing of all the evaluated gap-filling approaches and it is therefore recommended given its transparency and reproducibility.
   Overall, estimates of annual CH4 emissions for both EC systems were in excellent agreement (within 0.6 g-CH(4)m(-2) yr(-1)) and averaged 18 g-CH(4)m(-2) yr(-1). Total uncertainties on the annual fluxes were larger than the uncertainty of the flux measurement systems and estimated between 7-17%. Identifying trends and differences among sites or site years requires that the observed variability exceeds these uncertainties.

AB Improving knowledge on how the denitrifier community responds to grazing activity is essential to better understanding whether peatland nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions will react to grazing. To quantify the effects of grazing type on the denitrifier community, an experiment was conducted to determine how grazing types (pig uprooting, PU; yak tramping, YT) influence denitrification and the bacterial community in peatland. Soil samples were collected from control and two grazing types in the peatland of Southwest China. Soil physicochemical properties, denitrification rate (DR), and reductase assay activities were analyzed. Molecular methods were applied to determine the community ofnirSandnirKgenes. The relationship among DR, physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and denitrifier community was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). YT had a more significant influence on the ACE index, while PU affected the diversity index obviously. Grazing reduced unclassifiedBetaproteobacteriabut increased unclassifiedProteobacteriafornirS, while increasedBradyrhizobiaceaeand decreasedPhyllobacteriaceaefornirK.nirKwas more sensitive to grazing disturbances thannirS. YT increasedBradyrhizobiumand unclassifiedProteobacteria, butHyphomicrobiaceaedisappeared in YT, and a reverse trend was observed in PU. UnclassifiedChloroflexiandNitrosomonadaceaewere new denitrifier species that appeared in PU. Pig uprooting has a greater potential effect on denitrification than yak tramping in the peatland ecosystem. The alteration of soil environmental conditions is the dominant mechanism by which grazing type influences soil denitrification rate and the denitrifier community.

AB Soil respiration is a very important factor influencing carbon deposition in peat and reflecting the intensity of soil organic matter decomposition, root respiration, and the ease of transporting gases to the surface. Carbon dioxide release from three different peat soil profiles (0-80 cm) of the Polesie Lubelskie Region (Eastern Poland) was analyzed under laboratory conditions. Peat samples were incubated at 5, 10, and 20 degrees C in aerobic and anaerobic environments, and their CO2-evolution was analyzed up to 14 days. The respiration activity was found to be in the range of 0.013-0.497 g CO2 kg(-1) DW d(-1). The respiratory quotient was estimated to be in the range of 0.51-1.51, and the difference in respiration rates over 10 degrees C ranged between 4.15 and 8.72 in aerobic and from 1.15 to 6.53 in anaerobic conditions. A strong influence of temperature, depth, the degree of peat decomposition, pH, and nitrate content on respiration activity was found. Lack of oxygen at low temperature caused higher respiration activity than under aerobic conditions. These results should be taken into account when the management of Polish peatlands is considered in the context of climate and carbon storage, and physicochemical properties of soil in relation to soil respiration activity are considered.

AB Better insight in the possible range of future N2O emissions can help to construct mitigation and adaptation strategies and to adapt land use planning and management to climate objectives. The Dutch fen meadow landscape is a hotspot of N2O emission due to high nitrogen inputs combined with moist peat soils due to land use change. Socio-economic developments in the area are expected to have major impacts on N2O emission. The goals of this study are to estimate changes in N2O emissions for the period 2006-2040 under three different scenarios for the Dutch fen meadow landscape (rural production, rural fragmentation, and rural multifunctionality) and to quantify the share of different emission sources. Three scenarios were constructed and quantified based on the Story-And-Simulation approach. The rural production and the rural fragmentation scenarios are characterized by globalization and a market-oriented economy; in the rural production scenario dairy farming has a strong competitive position in the study region, while under the rural fragmentation scenario agriculture is declining. Under the rural multifunctionality scenario, the global context is characterized by regionalization and stronger regulation toward environmental issues. The N2O emission decreased between 2006 and 2040 under all scenarios. Under the rural production scenario, the N2O emission decreased by 7%. Due to measures to limit peat mineralization and policies to reduce agricultural emissions, the rural multifunctionality scenario showed the largest decrease in N2O emissions (44%). Under the rural fragmentation scenario, in which the dairy farming sector is diminished, the emission decreased by 33%. Compared to other uncertainties involved in N2O emission estimates, the uncertainty due to possible future land use change is relatively large and assuming a constant emission with time is therefore not appropriate.

AB Wetlands play a disproportionately large role in global terrestrial carbon stocks, and from 1 year to the next individual wetlands can fluctuate between carbon sinks and sources depending on factors such as hydrology, temperature, and land use. Although much research has been done on short-term seasonal to annual wetland biogeochemical cycles, there is a lack of experimental evidence concerning how the reversibility of wetland hydrological changes will influence these cycles over longer time periods. Five years of drought-induced declining water table at Lost Creek, a shrub fen wetland in northern Wisconsin, coincided with increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) as derived from long-term eddy covariance observations. Since then, however, the average water table level at this site has increased, providing a unique opportunity to explore how wetland carbon fluxes are affected by interannual air temperature differences as well as changing water table levels. Water table level, as measured by water discharge, was correlated with R-eco and GPP at interannual time scales. However, air temperature had a strong correlation with R-eco, GPP, and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) at monthly time scales and correlated with NEP at inter-annual time scales. Methane flux was strongly temperature-controlled at seasonal time scales, increasing an order of magnitude from April to July. Annual methane emissions were 51 g C m(-2). Our results demonstrate that over multi-year timescales, water table fluctuations can have limited effects on wetland net carbon fluxes and instead at Lost Creek annual temperature is the best predictor of interannual variation.

AB To understand spatial and temporal variations of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, we chose to measure N2O emissions from three plant stands (Kobresia tibetica, Carex muliensis, and Eleocharis valleculosa stands) in an open fen on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau during the growing seasons from 2005 to 2007. The overall mean N2O emission rate was about 0.018 +/- 0.056 mgN m(-2)h(-1) during the growing seasons from 2005 to 2007, with highly spatiotemporal variations. The hummock (K. tibetica stand) emitted N2O at the highest rate about 0.025 +/- 0.051 mgNm(-2)h(-1), followed by the hollow stands: the E. valleculosa stand about 0.012 +/- 0.046 mgNm(-2)h(-1) and the C. muliensis stand about 0.017 +/- 0.068 mgNm(-2)h(-1). Within each stand, we also noted significant variations of N2O emission. We also observed the significant seasonal and inter-annual variation of N2O fluxes during the study period. The highest N2O emission rate was all recorded in July or August in each year from 2005 to 2007. Compared with the mean value of 2005, we found the drought of 2006 significantly increased N2O emissions by 104 times in the E. valleculosa stand, 45 times in K. tibetica stand, and 18 times in the C. muliensis stand. Though there was no significant relation between standing water depths and N2O emissions, we still considered it related to the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water regime under climate change.

AB Rapid climate change and intensified human activities have resulted in water table lowering (WTL) and enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition in Tibetan alpine wetlands. These changes may alter the magnitude and direction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, affecting the climate impact of these fragile ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment combined with a metagenomics approach (GeoChip 5.0) to elucidate the effects of WTL (-20cm relative to control) and N deposition (30kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that WTL reduced CH4 emissions by 57.4% averaged over three growing seasons compared with no-WTL plots, but had no significant effect on net CO2 uptake or N2O flux. N deposition increased net CO2 uptake by 25.2% in comparison with no-N deposition plots and turned the mesocosms from N2O sinks to N2O sources, but had little influence on CH4 emissions. The interactions between WTL and N deposition were not detected in all GHG emissions. As a result, WTL and N deposition both reduced the global warming potential (GWP) of growing season GHG budgets on a 100-year time horizon, but via different mechanisms. WTL reduced GWP from 337.3 to -480.1g CO2-eq m(-2) mostly because of decreased CH4 emissions, while N deposition reduced GWP from 21.0 to -163.8g CO2-eq m(-2), mainly owing to increased net CO2 uptake. GeoChip analysis revealed that decreased CH4 production potential, rather than increased CH4 oxidation potential, may lead to the reduction in net CH4 emissions, and decreased nitrification potential and increased denitrification potential affected N2O fluxes under WTL conditions. Our study highlights the importance of microbial mechanisms in regulating ecosystem-scale GHG responses to environmental changes.

AB We have measured the land-atmosphere CO2 exchange using the eddy covariance technique in a high Arctic tundra heath in northeast Greenland (Zackenberg). On the basis of 11 years of measurements (2000-2010), it was found that snow cover dynamics was important for the CO2 exchange. The start of CO2 uptake period correlated significantly with timing of snowmelt. Furthermore, for years with deep and long-lasting snowpacks, the following springs showed increased CO2 emission rates. In the first part of the study period, there was an increase of approximately 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in both accumulated gross primary production (GPP) and CO2 sink strength during summer. However, in the last few years, there were no significant changes in GPP, whereas ecosystem respiration (R-eco) increased (8.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and ecosystem CO2 sink strength weakened (-4.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). It was found that temperature and temperature-related variables (maximum thaw depth and growing degree days) controlled the interannual variation in CO2 exchange. However, while R-eco showed a steady increase with temperature (5.8 g C m(-2) degrees C-1), the initial increase in GPP with temperature leveled off at the high end of observed temperature range. This suggests that future increases in temperature will weaken the ecosystem CO2 sink strength or even turn it into a CO2 source, depending on possible changes in vegetation structure and functioning as a response to a changing climate. If this trend is applicable also to other Arctic ecosystems, it will have implications for our current understanding of Arctic ecosystems dynamics.

AB Agricultural soils are a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O). Since mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is needed in all sectors of society, it is important to identify the processes producing N2O and the factors affecting the production rates in agricultural soils. This study aimed to elucidate the N2O production in peat, clay and loamy sand at four different soil moisture conditions (40, 60, 80 and 100% Water Filled Pore Space). The acetylene inhibition technique was used to evaluate the contribution of nitrification to N2O production. Nitrous oxide production responded markedly to soil moisture in all three soils. The highest N2O production, measured at the wettest soils (100% WFPS), was up to four orders of magnitude higher than that at the dry soils (40% WFPS). In dry conditions N2O production decreased in the order of peat>clay>loamy sand, while in wet conditions the highest N2O production was measured in loamy sand, then in peat, and the lowest in clay soils. Nitrification was the dominant N2O producing process in all the soils at 60% WFPS. In the sandy soil 70% of the total N2O production originated from nitrification, while in the peat soil most of the total N2O production originated from denitrification. Data on processes producing N2O in agricultural soils are needed to develop process-based models that could reduce the uncertainty of the emission estimates in greenhouse gas inventories.

AB Earthworms are important in determining the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of soils. In laboratory studies they have been shown to increase emissions of the potent GHG nitrous oxide (N2O). Here we test whether these earthworm-induced N2O emissions also occur in the field. We quantified N2O emissions in managed grassland in two different seasons (spring and autumn), applying two different types of fertilizer (organic and artificial fertilizer) and under two earthworm densities (175 individuals and 350 individuals m(-2)) of the species Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffmeister). We found an increase in earthworm-induced N2O emissions of 286 and 394% in autumn for low and high earthworm densities (P = 0.044 and P = 0.007, respectively). There were no effects of earthworms on N2O emissions in spring. Fertilizer additions significantly increased cumulative N2O emissions and grass N content in spring and autumn. For grass N content interactions between earthworm addition and fertilizer type existed in both seasons. Our results suggest that the pathways through which earthworms affect N cycling (and thereby N2O emission) differ with weather conditions. We postulate that in spring the dry weather conditions overruled any earthworm effects, whereas in autumn earthworms mainly improved soil aeration and thereby increased both plant N uptake and diffusion of N2O to the atmosphere. While we showed the presence of earthworm-induced N2O emissions in managed grassland under field conditions for the first time, the nature and intensity of the earthworm effect in the field is conditional on soil physicochemical parameters and thereby on meteorological and seasonal dynamics.

AB Peatland buffer zones with sedimentation ponds are established with the intention of capturing solids and nutrients liberated in drained forestry catchments. As noted in earlier fertilization experiments, added nitrogen (N) immediately increases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in such buffers, and we expected the same to happen after disturbances in the catchment caused by clear-cutting, soil preparation, and ditch cleaning. We measured N2O fluxes, water table dynamics, and vegetation cover from a wetland one year before and two years after the clear-cut and buffer establishment. The low pre-harvest emissions did not increase, but N2O emissions from the sedimentation pond exceeded those from humic lakes with a high N load. In the soil profile, N2O concentrations were high, indicating a potential to produce N2O in the buffer. In one sub-site the soil N2O concentration was below the atmospheric level, which was in accordance with the high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The change in vegetation along the overland flow paths could be explained by a shift in the species thriving in wet conditions but not in those requiring higher nutrient levels. In spite of the apparent potential of soil to produce N2O, the fluxes to the atmosphere remained low. Transformation of N2O to unobserved N-2 may explain some of the low N emissions, together with the low concentrations entering the buffer.

AB Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a clear and promising fossil fuel which emits less greenhouse gas (GHG) and has almost no environmentally damaging sulfur dioxide compared with other fossil fuels. An LNG import terminal is a facility that regasifies LNG into natural gas, which is supplied to industrial and residential users. Modeling and optimization of the LNG terminals may reduce energy consumption and GHG emission. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model of the LNG terminal is developed to minimize the energy consumption, where the numbers of boil-off gas (BOG) compressors and low-pressure (LP) pumps are considered as integer variables. A case study from an actual LNG terminal is carried out to verify the practicality of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed approach can decrease the operating energy consumption from 9.15% to 26.1% for different seasons.

AB A life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment of 1 kJ of strawberries, button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), and romaine/cos lettuces (Lactuca sativa) transported to retail outlets in Western Australia (WA) was examined and compared. The study included pre-farm, on-farm, and post-farm emissions. The pre-farm stage included GHG emissions from agricultural machinery and chemical production, and transport of raw materials (spawn, peat, and compost) in mushrooms. The on-farm stage included GHG emissions from agricultural machinery operation, chemical use, water for irrigation, waste generated, as well as electricity and energy consumption. The post-farm stage included transport of produce to Distribution Center (DC), storage in DC, and transport to retail outlets. The 'hotspots' or the stages that emit the highest GHG were determined for strawberries, button mushrooms and romaine/cos lettuces. The results have shown that the life cycle GHG emissions of strawberries and lettuces were higher than mushrooms due to intensive agricultural machinery operations during the on-farm stage. Mushrooms, however have significantly higher GHG emissions during pre-farm stage due to transport of peat, spawn, and compost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urine patches are considered to be important sites for nitrous oxide (N2O) production through nitrification and denitrification due to their high concentration of nitrogen (N). The aim of the present study was to determine the microbial source and size of production of N2O in different zones of a urine patch on grassland on peat soil. Artificial urine was applied in elongated patches of 4.5 m. Four lateral zones were distinguished and sampled for four weeks using an intact soil core incubation method. Incubation of soil cores took place without any additions to the headspace to determine total N2O production, with acetylene addition to determine total denitrification (N2O+N-2), and with methyl fluoride to determine the N2O produced through denitrification.
   Nitrous oxide production was largest in the centre and decreased towards the edge of the patch. Maximum N2O production was about 50 mg N m(-2) d(-1) and maximum denitrification activity was 70 mg N m(-2) d(-1). Nitrification was the main N2O producing process. Nitrous oxide production through denitrification was only of significance when denitrification activity was high. Total N loss through nitrification and denitrification over 31 days was 4.1 g N per patch which was 2.2% of the total applied urine-N.

AB The source strength of atmospheric trace gases from natural ecosystems must be quantified in order to assess the effect of such inputs on the background tropospheric chemistry. A static chamber technique and a gas exchange technique were used to determine the emissions of nitrous oxide from five sites within the Hudson Bay Lowland, as part of the Northern Wetland Study. Two mechanisms, one diffusive and the other episodic, were found likely to be responsible for the emissions of nitrous oxide. The annual diffusive flux ranged from -3.8 mg(N2O)/m(2) in a treed bog to 7.9 mg(N2O)/m(2) in an open fen. The addition of the episodic flux, increased this range to -2.1 mg(N2O)/m(2) and 18.5 mg(N2O)/m(2) respectively. These episodic emission occurred in from 2.5% to 16.7% of the samples during the late summer peak emission period. Since the gas exchange rate could not detect the episodic emissions, it was found to be a poor method for water emission rate determination within the wetland. LANDSAT-Thermatic Mapper (TM) imagery was used to scale the emissions, from the chamber level to an integrated average over the entire Hudson Bay Lowland. The total emission rate of N2O from the Hudson Bay Lowland, was determined to be 1.2 Gg(N2O)/year, of which 80% was attributed to episodic emissions.

AB Climate change policy for the land sector is challenged by complex biophysical and socioeconomic contexts. A target approach utilising land-use change indicators is often used to quantify and communicate progress, based upon assumed greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions. This paper investigated areal targets for woodland expansion and peatland restoration, both of which can deliver substantial carbon sequestration benefits, with uptake typically supported by grant incentives. A case study used empirical data to investigate realisation of such targets in Scotland referenced against ambitious policy commitments (net-zero emissions by 2045). Analysis of actual locations for recent afforestation and peatland restoration, referenced against biophysical data, showed that new woodland primarily occurred on land that was marginal for agriculture, usually on wetter uncultivated semi-natural land, often on organic soils. This acts to constrain net carbon gains. Both peatland restoration and new woodland show tendency to aggregate in specific zones or locations, regardless of biophysical opportunities, highlighting underlying socioeconomic factors. Differential patterns of uptake are also shown by grant applications across different land use groups. Socioeconomic factors act against more ubiquitous uptake of incentive schemes, especially for new woodland on improved agricultural land, which will constrain long-term decarbonisation objectives unless tackled directly. Investigation therefore shows that use of simple targets (e.g. trees planted) as headline progress indicators can be misleading, potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets. A more spatially targeted approach is required to maximise GHG reductions relative to local contexts. Recommendations are made for improved measures that recognise spatial and temporal variability, as exemplified by certification schemes.

AB Grazing systems represent a substantial percentage of the global anthropogenic flux of nitrous oxide (N2O) as a result of nitrogen addition to the soil. The pool of available carbon that is added to the soil from livestock excreta also provides substrate for the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) by soil microorganisms. A study into the production and emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O from cattle urine amended pasture was carried out on the Somerset Levels and Moors, UK over a three-month period. Urine-amended plots (50 g N m(-2)) were compared to control plots to which only water (12 mg N m-2) was applied. CO2 emission peaked at 5200 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) directly after application. CH4 flux decreased to -2000 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1) two days after application; however, net CH4 flux was positive from urine treated plots and negative from control plots. N2O emission peaked at 88 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1) 12 days after application. Subsurface CH4 and N2O concentrations were higher in the urine treated plots than the controls. There was no effect of treatment on subsurface CO2 concentrations. Subsurface N2O peaked at 500 ppm 12 days after and 1200 ppm 56 days after application. Subsurface NO3- concentration peaked at approximately 300 mg N kg dry soil(-1) 12 days after application. Results indicate that denitrification is the key driver for N2O release in peatlands and that this production is strongly related to rainfall events and water-table movement. N2O production at depth continued long after emissions were detected at the surface. Further understanding of the interaction between subsurface gas concentrations, surface emissions and soil hydrological conditions is required to successfully predict greenhouse gas production and emission.

AB Global change includes land-use change, elevated CO2 concentrations, increased temperature and increased rainfall variability. All four aspects by themselves and in combination will influence the role of roots in linking below- and above-ground ecosystem function via organic and inorganic resource flows. Root-mediated ecosystem functions which may be modified by global change include below-ground resource (water, nutrients) capture, creation and exploitation of spatial heterogeneity, buffering of temporal variations in above-ground factors, supply and storage of C and nutrients to the belowground ecosystem, mobilization of nutrients and C from stored soil reserves, and gas exchange between soil and atmosphere including the emission from soil of greenhouse gases.
   The theory of a functional equilibrium between root and shoot allocation is used to explore predicted responses to elevated CO2 in relation to water or nutrient supply as limiting root function. The theory predicts no change in root:shoot allocation where water uptake is the limiting root function, but substantial shifts where nutrient uptake is (or becomes) the limiting function. Root turnover will not likely be influenced by elevated CO2, but by changes in regularity of water supply. A number of possible mechanisms for root-mediated N mineralization is discussed in the light of climate change factors. Rhizovory (root consumption) may increase under global change as the balance between plant chemical defense and adapted root. consuming organisms may be modified during biome shifts in response to climate change. Root-mediated gas exchange allows oxygen to penetrate into soils and methane (CH4) to escape from wetland soils of tundra ecosystems as well as tropical rice production systems. The effect on net greenhouse gas emissions of biome shifts (fens replacing bogs) as well as of agricultural land management will depend partly on aerenchyma in roots.

AB Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were monitored in rewetted peatlands planted to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. The effect of N fertilization was examined with a rate trial (0, 80, and 160 kg N ha(-1)). Static chambers and C-13-CO2 pulse labeling at reproductive growth and grain-filling stages when maximum CH4 emission is anticipated were used to quantify the contribution of rice plants to soil C pools. Soil CH4 and N2O emissions were not affected by N fertilization and ranged from 66 to 123 kg CH4 ha(-1) and 1.2 to 3.7 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively. There was no stimulating effect of N fertilization on vegetative production, root biomass, or grain yield, indicating the existence of a large N pool in the rewetted peat soils. Nitrogen fertilization increased the contribution of rice C inputs to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool at the highest rate, but not to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pore water CH4 (CH4-pore), or emitted CH4. Across treatments, plant-derived C contributed up to 27% of emitted CH4, up to 9.1% of the DOC, and 13 to 78% of DIC. Negative N2O emissions were frequently observed during the growing season with a maximal consumption of -0.51 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1), which was not affected by N fertilization. These results demonstrate that N fertilization at rates up to 160 kg N ha(-1) in rewetted degraded peat soils does not affect annual CH4 and N2O emissions.

AB Overviewing the European carbon (C), greenhouse gas (GHG), and non-GHG fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP) is about 9.3 Pg yr-1, and fossil fuel imports are 1.6 Pg yr-1. GPP is about 1.25% of solar radiation, containing about 360 x 1018 J energy - five times the energy content of annual fossil fuel use. Net primary production (NPP) is 50%, terrestrial net biome productivity, NBP, 3%, and the net GHG balance, NGB, 0.3% of GPP. Human harvest uses 20% of NPP or 10% of GPP, or alternatively 1 parts per thousand of solar radiation after accounting for the inherent cost of agriculture and forestry, for production of pesticides and fertilizer, the return of organic fertilizer, and for the C equivalent cost of GHG emissions. C equivalents are defined on a global warming potential with a 100-year time horizon. The equivalent of about 2.4% of the mineral fertilizer input is emitted as N2O. Agricultural emissions to the atmosphere are about 40% of total methane, 60% of total NO-N, 70% of total N2O-N, and 95% of total NH3-N emissions of Europe. European soils are a net C sink (114 Tg yr-1), but considering the emissions of GHGs, soils are a source of about 26 Tg CO2 C-equivalent yr-1. Forest, grassland and sediment C sinks are offset by GHG emissions from croplands, peatlands and inland waters. Non-GHGs (NH3, NOx) interact significantly with the GHG and the C cycle through ammonium nitrate aerosols and dry deposition. Wet deposition of nitrogen (N) supports about 50% of forest timber growth. Land use change is regionally important. The absolute flux values total about 50 Tg C yr-1. Nevertheless, for the European trace-gas balance, land-use intensity is more important than land-use change. This study shows that emissions of GHGs and non-GHGs significantly distort the C cycle and eliminate apparent C sinks.

TI Peat-based emissions in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Peat-based emissions are reported under three different reporting sectors in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory: Agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Energy. Peat-based emissions comprise together around one third of the total reported net greenhouse gas emissions in Finland when also sinks and emissions from LULUCF sector are included. Most of the emissions come from the combustion of peat for energy but emissions from the agricultural use of peatlands and drained forest soils are also of importance. The IPCC (Intergovemmental Panel on Climate Change) provides the basic guidelines for the inventory calculations. However, the use of national methods and emission factors is encouraged. Introducing new country-specific methods or emission factors in the inventory calculations requires transparent documentation of the input parameters and the process how emission factors, parameters and models are derived. Here we describe the national system for estimating peat-based emissions for the greenhouse gas inventory, and the methods that are used in deriving the emission estimates, as well as possibilities to use new national emission factors for improving the estimates.

AB Wetland biogeochemistry is strongly influenced by water and temperature dynamics, and these interactions are currently poorly represented in ecosystem and climate models. A decline in water table of approximately 30 cm was observed at a wetland in Northern Wisconsin, USA over a period from 2001-2007, which was highly correlated with an increase in daily soil temperature variability. Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were compared with measured CO2 fluxes at two nearby forests in order to distinguish wetland effects from regional trends. As wetland water table declined, both ecosystem respiration and ecosystem production increased by over 20% at the wetland, while forest CO2 fluxes had no significant trends. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide at the wetland was not correlated with water table, but wetland evapotranspiration decreased substantially as the water table declined. These results suggest that changes in hydrology may not have a large impact on shrub wetland carbon balance over inter-annual time scales due to opposing responses in both ecosystem respiration and productivity.

AB The tracking of land use since 1990 presents a major challenge in greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol because there is often limited availability of data, especially for the base year of 1990. There is even less land management and soil moisture data, which are needed to track climate change mitigation activities since soil moisture is one of the main drivers of GHG emissions of organic soils. Information is also needed for the reporting of land-based activities such as grazing land management or wetland drainage and rewetting of organic soils. Different spatial and thematic resolutions of land-use data produce inconsistent time series with a strong overestimation of land-use change (LUC) if not adequately accounted for. Our aim was to create a consistent time series of land use since 1990 that is in line with GHG reporting under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol by combining official cadastral data with colour-infrared aerial photography used for biodiversity monitoring in six federal states in northern and eastern Germany. We developed a generic hierarchical classification by land use, management and drainage status, and a translation key for data harmonisation into a consistent time series. This time series enabled the quantification of LUC on organic soils between 1992 and 2013 in a spatially explicit manner. Furthermore we used this time series to develop indicators for changes in land management and drainage to evaluate the success of protection statuses on peatland restoration.
   The study area encompassed one million hectares, half of which had some type of legal nature protection status. Areas with no protection status tended to become more intensively farmed and drier, while highly protected areas (e.g. Natura 2000) showed the opposite trend. Land-use trends also differed greatly between federal states. In Schleswig-Holstein organic soils tended to become drier during the study period, while in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they tended to become wetter overall. The trends and differences in LUC between federal states were linked to German reunification, changes in the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Germany's Renewable Energy Act (EEG). A large-scale peatland protection programme also had major impact.
   In conclusion, our study demonstrates how data derived for biodiversity monitoring and other highly detailed land-use data can be used to track changes in land use, management and drainage status in accordance with the reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.

AB Human-induced groundwaterlevellowering in the Holocenecoastal-deltaic plain of the Netherlands causes oxidation of peat organic matter, resulting in land subsidence and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the distribution of the remaining peat organic matter is presented, to quantify the potential of this area to further subsidence and CO2 emissions by oxidation. Hereto, we established relations between dry mass ratios of organic matter and sediment in peat formed in different environmental settings. This was combined with a high-resolution 3D geological model of the subsurface of the Netherlands to map the proportions of organic matter, clastic sediment and void space in peat.
   The 3D model indicates that c. 15 km(3) of Holocene peat is embedded in the coastal-deltaic plain subsurface, of which c. 1.5 km(3) consists of organic matter, 0.4 km(3) of sediment, and 13.1 km(3) of void space. During future human-induced oxidation, this peat has a volumetric loss potential of 14.6 km(3), responsible for locally 0.4-6.0 m of subsidence, and a CO2 emission of 2.0 Gton.
   The 3D modelling revealed that the amount of peat organic matter varies considerably between regions. Especially the subsurface of urban areas overlying back-barrier peat were identified as hot-spots accommodating the highest quantities of peat organic matter. The peat in agricultural areas contains less organic matter but is more prone to oxidation than peat underlying urban areas, because in the latter settings anthropogenic brought-up soil restricts oxidation. Future mitigation strategies should therefore focus on restricting peat oxidation in the agricultural areas of the coastal-deltaic plain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of cattle slurry on denitrification losses and nitrous oxide emission was determined on a peat soil in the Netherlands. As well as measuring losses on a day-to-day basis after three different methods of slurry application, two methods for estimating denitrification and nitrous oxide emissions were compared, i.e. coring/incubation and enclosure techniques. Slurry was applied either in a conventional way, diluted 1:3 or acidified with nitric acid. There was much variation with time, method of assessment and method of slurry application in both apparent denitrification rates and N2O fluxes: it was not always possible to provide adequate explanation for all of the effects demonstrated. Major proportions of the variation in denitrification and N2O emission could be accounted for by variation in soil moisture, soil temperature and NH4+ (but not NO3-) content. It was suggested that nitrification was playing a key role in maintaining an adequate substrate supply (NO) for denitrification and perhaps contributing directly to an unknown extent to N2O emissions. There were overall differences in the extent of losses with the different methods of slurry application but these were highly dependent upon interactions with current soil and weather conditions.

AB This study investigated the effect of calcium superphosphate on compost maturity and gaseous emissions during pig manure composting with woody peat as the bulking agent. Two treatments were conducted with or without the addition of calcium superphosphate (10% dry weight of the composting mass), which were denoted as the control and superphosphate-amended treatment, respectively. Results show that the composting temperature of both treatments was higher than 50 degrees C for more than 5 days, which is typically required for pathogen destruction during manure composting. Compared to the control treatment, the superphosphate-amended treatment increased the emission of nitrogen oxide, but reduced the emission of methane, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide by approximately 35.5%, 37.9% and 65.5%, respectively. As a result, the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission during manure composting was reduced by nearly 34.7% with the addition of calcium superphosphate. The addition of calcium superphosphate increased the content of humic acid (indicated by E-4/E-6 ratio). Nevertheless, the superphosphate-amended treatment postponed the biological degradation of organic matter and produced the mature compost with a higher electrical conductivity in comparison with the control treatment.

AB A change in German energy policy has resulted in a strong increase in the number of biogas plants in Germany. As a consequence, huge amounts of nutrient-rich residues, the by-products of the fermentative process, are used as organic fertilizers. Drained peatlands are increasingly used to satisfy the huge demand for fermentative substrates (e. g., energy crops, grass silage) and the digestate is returned to the peatlands. However, drained organic soils are considered as hot spots for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and organic fertilization is additionally known to increase N2O emissions from managed grasslands. Our study addressed the questions (a) to what extent biogas digestate and cattle slurry application increase N2O and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as the mineral nitrogen use efficiency (NUEmin) and grass yield, and (b) how different soil organic matter contents (SOMs) and nitrogen contents promote the production of N2O. In addition NH3 volatilization was determined at one application event to obtain first clues with respect to the effects of soil and fertilizer types. The study was conducted at two sites within a grassland parcel, which differed in their soil organic carbon (SOC) and N contents. At each site (named C-org-medium and C-org-high) three plots were established: one was fertilized five times with biogas digestate, one with cattle slurry, and the third served as control plot. On each plot, fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured on three replicates over 2 years using the closed chamber method. For NH3 measurements we used the calibrated dynamic chamber method. On an annual basis, the application of biogas digestate significantly enhanced the N2O fluxes compared to the application of cattle slurry and additionally increased the plant N-uptake and NUEmin. Furthermore, N2O fluxes from the C-org-high treatments significantly exceeded N2O fluxes from the C-org-medium treatments. Annual cumulative emissions ranged from 0.91 +/- 0.49 to 3.14 +/- 0.91 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Significantly different CH4 fluxes between the investigated treatments or the different soil types were not observed. Cumulative annual CH4 exchange rates varied between -0.21 +/- 0.19 and -1.06 +/- 0.46 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Significantly higher NH3 losses, NUEmin and grass yields from treatments fertilized with biogas digestate compared to those fertilized with cattle slurry were observed. The total NH3 losses following the splash plate application were 18.17 kg N ha(-1) for the digestate treatments and 3.48 kg N ha(-1) for the slurry treatments (36 and 15% of applied NH4+-N). The observed linear increase of 16 days' cumulative N2O-N exchange or annual N2O emissions, with mean groundwater level and ammonium application rate, reveals the importance of site-adapted N fertilization and the avoidance of N surpluses in C-org-rich grasslands.

AB Woody peat was used as an additive to compost with pig manure in 1.2 m(3) composting reactors under aerobic conditions for a 77days period to estimate the effect on the compost maturity and gaseous emissions (NH3, N2O, and CH4). Pig manure was also composted with cornstalks (the traditional method) as a control treatment. The results showed that both cornstalks and woody peat composts reached the required maturity standard. Composting with woody peat as a bulking agent was found to reduced NH3 emissions by 36% than the cornstalks amended treatment. Although CH4 emission increased by adding woody peat, N2O emission was considerably reduced, resulting in a slight decrease in total greenhouse gas emissions. More importantly, woody peat could reduce the losses of total carbon and total nitrogen, improve the compost quality as fertilizer.

AB Reactive nitrogen (N) losses, and in particular nitrous oxide losses, from dairy grasslands on peat soils are generally high as a result of relative high soil organic matter contents, potential N mineralisation rates and shallow groundwater levels. Effects of the inclusion of the temperate forage species plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) (PL), which produces secondary compounds with biological nitrification inhibition capacity, on the fate of soil mineral N were studied in a combined mesocosm and field experiment. The experiments comprised four treatments differing in intentional herbage share of plantain versus perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (100%PL, 66%PL, 33%PL and 0%PL). Potential nitrification in the mesocosm experiment was significantly lower at 100%PL versus 0%PL (p = 0.018), but soil nitrate concentrations were not. Nitrous oxide fluxes reduced by 39% (p = 0.021) in the presence of plantain in the field experiment, without an obvious link to the quantity of plantain. N use efficiency of plantain tended to increase with the quantity of plantain in the sward in the mesocosm experiment (p = 0.098), but not in the field experiment. Our results suggest that the presence of plantain can affect the fate of soil mineral N of dairy grasslands on peat soils.

AB During the summertime of 2005/2006 net methane (CH4) fluxes and environmental variables were investigated in two tundra wetlands Wolong Marsh and Tuanjie Marsh of eastern Antarctica, using the closed chamber technique. At Wolong Marsh, the measurements were made at four wet tundra sites, four mesic tundra sites, and two dry sites. CH4 flux for wet tundra sites averaged 163.4 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and for the mesic sites 132.4 mu g m(-2) h(-1). For the dry sites, all the CH(4) fluxes showed the negative values with an average of -99.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1). At Tuanjie Marsh, flux measurements were made at two open ponds, two shallow fens and two dry sites. The average CH(4) flux for the pond sites was 170.4 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and for the fen sites 134.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1). For the dry sites CH(4) fluxes were approximately one order of magnitude lower than those for pond and fen sites and averaged 18.4 mu m(-2) h(-1). Spatial variations in CH(4) flux were primarily driven by the water table position at two tundra wetlands, whereas temporal variations in CH(4) flux from wet and mesic sites were related with the thermal regime of tundra soil layers. The fluxes from six observation sites showed a consistent diurnal cycle with the peak at 14:00 and the lowest at 2:00 (local time), which was correlated with ground temperature at the depth of 0-10cm. The CH(4) emissions from coastal wetlands could constitute an important part of the annual CH(4) budget for Antarctic tundra ecosystems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, microcosms were used to investigate the influence of temperature (4 and 28 degrees C) and water content (45% and 90% WHC) on microbial communities and activities in carbon-rich fen soil. Bacterial, archaeal and denitrifier community composition was assessed during incubation of microcosms for 12 weeks using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling of 16S rRNA and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes. In addition, microbial and denitrifier abundance, potential denitrification activity and production of greenhouse gases were measured. No detectable changes were observed in prokaryote or denitrifier abundance. In general, cumulatively after 12 weeks more carbon was respired at the higher temperature (3.7 mg CO2 g(-1) soil), irrespective of the water content, whereas nitrous oxide production was greater under wet conditions (98-336 mu g N2O g(-1) soil). After an initial lag phase, methane emissions (963 mu g CH4 g(-1) soil) were observed only under warm and wet conditions. T-RFLP analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA and nosZ genes revealed small or undetectable community changes in response to temperature and water content, suggesting that bacterial and denitrifying microbial communities are stable and do not respond significantly to seasonal changes in soil conditions. In contrast, archaeal microbial community structure was more dynamic and was strongly influenced by temperature.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) in soils is produced through nitrification and denitrification. The N2O produced is considered as a nitrogen (N) loss because it will most likely escape from the soil to the atmosphere as N2O or N-2. Aim of the study was to quantify N2O production in grassland on peat soils in relation to N input and to determine the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification to N2O production. Measurements were carried out on a weekly basis in 2 grasslands on peat soil (Feat I and Feat II) for 2 years (1993 and 1994) using intact soil core incubations. In additional experiments distinction between N2O from nitrification and denitrification was made by use of the gaseous nitrification inhibitor methyl fluoride (CH3F).
   Nitrous oxide production over the 2 year period was on average 34 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for mown treatments that received no N fertiliser and 44 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for mown and N fertilised treatments. Grazing by dairy cattle on Feat I caused additional N2O production to reach 81 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The sub soil (20-40 cm) contributed 25 to 40% of the total N2O production in the 0-40 cm layer. The N2O production:denitrification ratio was on average about 1 in the top soil and 2 in the sub soil indicating that N2O production through nitrification was important. Experiments showed that when ratios were larger than 1, nitrification was the major source of N2O. In conclusion, N2O production is a significant N loss mechanism in grassland on peat soil with nitrification as an important N2O producing process.

AB Characteristics Of CO2-C exchange were studied in a temperate herbaceous wetland in 2006 and 2007, years with contrasting hydrological regimes. The wetland Mokre Louky (the "Wet Meadows" near Trebon), Czech Republic (49 degrees 01'30 '' N, 14 degrees 46'20 '' E) is a sedge-grass marsh dominated by Carex acuta L The site is situated in the inundation area of a large human-made lake (Rozmberk fishpond, 5 km(2)). The water table is near the soil surface and is fairly stable throughout the year (+/- 0.1 m), except for flood events, when it can reach up to 2 m above the soil surface. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was calculated from the CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance technique and was compared with the seasonal course of plant live aboveground biomass. The results show that: (1) the annual net uptake Of CO2-C Was 199 and 220 g C m(-1) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The daily net CO2-C uptake reached 12-20 g C m(-2) day(-1) in sunny summer days. These values are among the highest values reported for wetlands of the northern hemisphere. (2) Although the observed wetland is adapted to floods, the summer flood substantially reduced its net CO2-C uptake. The daily courses of net CO2-C uptake point to reduced rates Of CO2-C fixation by the vegetation cover. (3) A recovery growth of plant biomass was associated with a second peak of NEP in September 2006. (4) Lack of knowledge on the dynamics of methane emissions presently limits deeper understanding of the effect of floods on carbon balance in wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring of air pollutants is an important instrument to detect threats and to observe temporal trends of emissions. Determining the spatial distribution of oxidized and reduced N species via modelling requires sufficient knowledge about innumerous small sources from traffic, settlements and agriculture. Empirical studies are required to validate the model data but measurements of the total N deposition (e.g. micrometeorological measurements) are very expensive.
   Against this background, the TONIS, a new suitable technique which combines a biomonitoring with plants and technical measurements was developed. During 6 exposures between 2012 and 2016 at different polluted sites in Northwest Germany, TONIS accumulated between 17 and 25 kg N ha-1 yr(-1)t. The results are feasible compared to simultaneously measured NH3 and NO2 concentration and bulk N deposition. At one site within a peat bog the accumulated N in TONIS was found to be in the range of total N deposition derived from a micrometeorological approach. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Soil organic matter decomposition under global warming has a potential to alter soil carbon and nitrogen storages in permafrost. The objectives of this study were to investigate the temperature sensitivity of greenhouse gas emissions from soil samples along a mountain wetland-forest ecotone in the continuous permafrost and determine its influencing mechanisms. The CO2, N2O and carbon, nitrogen substrates were measured at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C. The relation between greenhouse gas emission rates and temperature depended on substrate quality in the three ecosystems. Soil DOC, MBC, NH4+ and NO3- concentrations determined the higher CO2 and N2O emission rates in the thicket peatland and the surface soil layer. During the incubation period, the degrees of soil carbon and nitrogen losses in the thicket peatland were 0.6-4.7% and 1.0-143 (1000 x %), approximately 1.6 and 1.2 times higher than those in the forest and fen, respectively. The highest degrees of soil carbon and nitrogen losses in the thicket peatland indicated that more greenhouse gases would emit from soils when permafrost degradation induced the succession from wetlands or forest to the wetland-forest ecotone. Although the gas emission rates presented significant differences in the three ecosystems, the Q(10) values with 2.0 to 2.2 for CO2 and 2.4 to 3.0 for N2O, did not change significantly, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of gas emissions would not fluctuate much in the ecosystems along the mountain wetland-forest ecotone. However, the higher Q(10) values in the deeper soil layer in our study indicated that the decomposition of soil C and N in the deeper active layer of the permafrost region is more impressionable to global warming. As laboratory results could not actually reflect the situation in the field, more field work about temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition in different ecosystems should be encouraged in the future.

AB At the southern margin of permafrost in North America, climate change causes widespread permafrost thaw. In boreal lowlands, thawing forested permafrost peat plateaus ('forest') lead to expansion of permafrost-free wetlands ('wetland'). Expanding wetland area with saturated and warmer organic soils is expected to increase landscape methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we quantify the thaw-induced increase in CH4 emissions for a boreal forest-wetland landscape in the southern Taiga Plains, Canada, and evaluate its impact on net radiative forcing relative to potential long-term net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. Using nested wetland and landscape eddy covariance net CH4 flux measurements in combination with flux footprint modeling, we find that landscape CH4 emissions increase with increasing wetland-to-forest ratio. Landscape CH4 emissions are most sensitive to this ratio during peak emission periods, when wetland soils are up to 10 degrees C warmer than forest soils. The cumulative growing season (May-October) wetland CH4 emission of similar to 13 g CH4 m(-2) is the dominating contribution to the landscape CH4 emission of similar to 7 g CH4 m(-2). In contrast, forest contributions to landscape CH4 emissions appear to be negligible. The rapid wetland expansion of 0.26 +/- 0.05% yr(-1) in this region causes an estimated growing season increase of 0.034 +/- 0.007 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in landscape CH4 emissions. A long-term net CO2 uptake of >200 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) is required to offset the positive radiative forcing of increasing CH4 emissions until the end of the 21st century as indicated by an atmospheric CH4 and CO2 concentration model. However, long-term apparent carbon accumulation rates in similar boreal forest-wetland landscapes and eddy covariance landscape net CO2 flux measurements suggest a long-term net CO2 uptake between 49 and 157 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Thus, thaw-induced CH4 emission increases likely exert a positive net radiative greenhouse gas forcing through the 21st century.

AB There is growing interest in generalizing the impact of hydrogeomorphology and weather variables on riparian functions. Here, we used RZ-TRADEOFF to estimate nitrogen, phosphorus, water table (WT) depth, and greenhouse gas (GHG: N2O, CO2, CH4) functions for 80 riparian zones typical of the North American Midwest, Northeast (including Southern Ontario, Canada), and Mid-Atlantic. Sensitivity to weather perturbations was calculated for temperature and precipitation-dependent functions (CO2, phosphate concentration, and water table), and multivariate statistical analysis on model outputs was conducted to determine trade-offs between riparian functions. Mean model estimates were 93.10 cm for WT depth, 8.45 mg N L-1 for field edge nitrate concentration, 51.57% for nitrate removal, 0.45 mg PO43- L-1 for field edge phosphate concentration, 1.5% for subsurface phosphate removal, 91.24% for total overland phosphorus removal, 0.51 mg N m(-2) day(-1) for N2O flux, 5.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) for CO2 fluxes, and -0.41 mg C m(-2) day(-1) and 621.51 mg C m(-2) day(-1) for CH4 fluxes in non-peat sites and peat sites, respectively. Sites in colder climates were most sensitive to weather perturbations for CO2, sites with deep water tables estimates had the highest sensitivity for WT, and sites in warm climates and/or with deep confining layers had the lowest sensitivity for phosphate concentration. Slope, confining layer depth, and temperature were the primary characteristics influencing similarities and trade-offs between sites. This research contributes to understanding how to optimize riparian restoration and protection in watersheds based on both water (nitrogen, phosphorus) and air quality (GHG) goals.

AB Peatlands and other terrestrial ecosystems export large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to freshwater ecosystems. In catchments used for supplying drinking water, water treatment works (WTWs) can remove large quantities of this organic matter, and can therefore play a unique modifying role in DOC processing and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the fluvial system. During this study we quantified the GHG emissions due to processes associated with carbon (C) removal during water treatment at four contrasting WTWs in the UK. Our results demonstrate that the removal of DOC from raw water supplies via coagulation, leading to the formation of sludge, usually makes it less susceptible to short-term oxidation when compared to DOC remaining in the fluvial system. Although this could be considered a means of reducing CO2 emissions from waterborne carbon, the current practise of land spreading of sludge is unlikely to represent a long-term C sink and therefore water treatment probably only delays the rate at which fluvial C re-enters the atmosphere. Furthermore, we estimate that indirect CO2 emissions resulting from electricity use during water treatment, together with the use of chemicals and CO2 degassing from the water during treatment, far outweigh any potential CO2 reductions associated with DOC removal. Thus, the post-treatment handling of sludge has the potential to mitigate, but not to negate, GHG emissions associated with water treatment processes.

AB Acid organic soils drained for agriculture are hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Previous studies have indicated that water table (WT) depth and nitrogen (N) availability are important environmental controls, however, little is known about pathways leading to N2O emission. We investigated a raised bog drained for agriculture (pH 4.6 to 5.5) with, respectively, rotational grass and a potato crop in the experimental year and subplots with and without N fertilisation. The emissions and isotopic composition of N2O were monitored during spring and autumn periods with significant changes in WT depth, and in the availability of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrous oxide emissions were determined at 6-h intervals using eight automated chambers interfaced with a laser instrument for N2O isotopomer analysis. A threshold of 600 ppb N2O (final concentration) was adopted to stabilise estimates of site preference (SP) and delta N-15(bulk) of emitted N2O against the background of N2O in ambient air. Nitrous oxide emissions varied consistently with land use, slope position and time of day and year, but with little effect of N fertilisation. Isotopic signatures of N2O from the grassland site could not be investigated due to generally low emissions. In the potato field, in total 255 and 266 flux measurements exceeded the 600 ppb threshold in unfertilised and fertilised subplots, respectively. Both N2O emissions and isotopic signatures responded to WT dynamics, individual rain events, and soil N availability. Across eight individual periods, the delta N-15(bulk) of N2O emitted from the soil varied between - 55 and + 18 parts per thousand, while site preference (SP) varied between - 4 and + 25 parts per thousand. The first and the last period (shoulder seasons) were both N limited, and here isotopic signatures of N2O were similar and distinctly different from signatures in mid-season periods with mineral N accumulation. Nitrifier denitrification and chemodenitrification were proposed as potential pathways to N2O production in shoulder seasons, whereas in mid-season periods the isotopic signatures could be associated with either ammonia oxidation or fungal denitrication (late spring), or with bacterial denitrification (early autumn). The interpretation of isotopic signatures of N2O was confounded by the possible effect of N2O reduction. The study provides evidence that both sources and pathways of N2O emissions from managed organic soil vary dynamically with WT changes and N availability.

AB Cryoturbated peat circles (that is, bare surface soil mixed by frost action; pH 3-4) in the Russian discontinuous permafrost tundra are nitrate-rich `hotspots' of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in arctic ecosystems, whereas adjacent unturbated peat areas are not. N2O was produced and subsequently consumed at pH 4 in unsupplemented anoxic microcosms with cryoturbated but not in those with unturbated peat soil. Nitrate, nitrite and acetylene stimulated net N2O production of both soils in anoxic microcosms, indicating denitrification as the source of N2O. Up to 500 and 10 mu M nitrate stimulated denitrification in cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils, respectively. Apparent maximal reaction velocities of nitrite-dependent denitrification were 28 and 18 nmol N2O g(DW)(-1) h(-1), for cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils, respectively. Barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing of narG, nirK/nirS and nosZ (encoding nitrate, nitrite and N2O reductases, respectively) yielded approximate to 49 000 quality-filtered sequences with an average sequence length of 444 bp. Up to 19 species-level operational taxonomic units were detected per soil and gene, many of which were distantly related to cultured denitrifiers or environmental sequences. Denitrification-associated gene diversity in cryoturbated and in unturbated peat soils differed. Quantitative PCR (inhibition-corrected per DNA extract) revealed higher copy numbers of narG in cryoturbated than in unturbated peat soil. Copy numbers of nirS were up to 1000 x higher than those of nirK in both soils, and nirS nirK(-1) copy number ratios in cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils differed. The collective data indicate that the contrasting N2O emission patterns of cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils are associated with contrasting denitrifier communities.

AB Ecosystems exchange climate-relevant trace gases with the atmosphere, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are a small but highly reactive part of the carbon cycle. VOCs have important ecological functions and implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured the ecosystem-level surface-atmosphere VOC fluxes using the eddy covariance technique at a shallow subarctic lake and an adjacent graminoid-dominated fen in northern Sweden during two contrasting periods: the peak growing season (mid-July) and the senescent period post-growing season (September-October).
   In July, the fen was a net source of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, dimethyl sulfide, isoprene, and monoterpenes. All of these VOCs showed a did cycle of emission with maxima around noon and isoprene dominated the fluxes (93 +/- 22 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), mean +/- SE). Isoprene emission was strongly stimulated by temperature and presented a steeper response to temperature (Q(10) = 14.5) than that typically assumed in biogenic emission models, supporting the high temperature sensitivity of arctic vegetation. In September, net emissions of methanol and isoprene were drastically reduced, while acetaldehyde and acetone were deposited to the fen, with rates of up to -6.7 +/- 2.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for acetaldehyde.
   Remarkably, the lake was a sink for acetaldehyde and acetone during both periods, with average fluxes up to -19 +/- 1.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetone in July and up to -8.5 +/- 2.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetaldehyde in September. The deposition of both carbonyl compounds correlated with their atmospheric mixing ratios, with deposition velocities of -0.23 +/- 0.01 and -0.68 +/- 0.03 cm s(-1) for acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively.
   Even though these VOC fluxes represented less than 0.5 % and less than 5 % of the CO2 and CH4 net carbon ecosystem exchange, respectively, VOCs alter the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Thus, understanding the response of their emissions to climate change is important for accurate prediction of the future climatic conditions in this rapidly warming area of the planet.

AB Comparing of different CH4 flux measurement techniques allows for the independent evaluation of the performance and reliability of those techniques. We compared three approaches, the traditional discrete Manual Static Chamber (MSC), Continuous Automated Chamber (CAC) and Eddy Covariance (EC) methods of measuring the CH4 fluxes in an alpine wetland. We found a good agreement among the three methods in the seasonal CH4 flux patterns, but the diurnal patterns from both the CAC and EC methods differed. While the diurnal CH4 flux variation from the CAC method was positively correlated with the soil temperature, the diurnal variation from the EC method was closely correlated with the solar radiation and net CO2 fluxes during the daytime but was correlated with the soil temperature at nighttime. The MSC method showed 25.3% and 7.6% greater CH4 fluxes than the CAC and EC methods when measured between 09:00 h and 12:00 h, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To estimate the probable contribution of northern forest soils to the global budget of greenhouse microgases. the cryogenic soils along the Yenisei meridian have been studied with respect to their potential denitrification and carbon mineralization activities. It is shown that the forest soils of the boreal zone have a high denitrification potential and, under conditions of a high nitrate nitrogen content, may be a source of nitrous c oxide emission. A significant correlation is observed between N2O and CO2 emissions (r = 0.85, p < 0.001).

AB The extensive use of peat moss as potting medium in nurseries worldwide is not sustainable causing peatland depletion and greenhouse gas emissions. This research seeks to explore whether wood biochar produced by the environment-friendly flame curtain method can partially substitute peat moss in plant nurseries without affecting plant growth and health. Biochar was produced from durian wood logs in a top-quenched Kon-Tiki earth kiln, crushed, and mixed with peat moss at dosages of 0, 1, 2.5 and 5% (w/w). Durian seedlings were grown in 2.5 L polybags arranged in randomised complete block design with 4 replicates per treatment. Plant height, collar diameter, pH, moisture content, number of branches and leaves, and plant health were monitored weekly for 94 days. Liquid fish fertiliser was used as organic fertiliser. Our results demonstrated that biochar can substitute at least 5% (w/w) peat moss without negatively affecting plant height, collar diameter, number of leaves and branches, and plant health. In addition, organic fertiliser is not required during the first 3 months of cultivation resulting in cost savings to the nursery operator. Plant height was found to be the most accurate yet simple monitoring parameter studied. A better understanding of the effect of higher biochar application rates as well as the number of times the potting medium can be reused without loss of potting medium properties and health can help to further cut nursery cost and reduce reliance on peat moss.

AB We critically review recent literature on carbon storage and fluxes within natural and constructed freshwater wetlands, and specifically address concerns of readers working in applied science and engineering. Our purpose is to review and assess the distribution and conversion of carbon in the water environment, particularly within wetland systems. A key aim is to assess if wetlands are carbon sinks or sources. Carbon sequestration and fluxes in natural and constructed wetlands located around the world has been assessed. All facets of carbon (solid and gaseous forms) have been covered. We draw conclusions based on these studies. Findings indicate that wetlands can be both sources and sinks of carbon, depending on their age, operation, and the environmental boundary conditions such as location and climate. Suggestions for further research needs in the area of carbon storage in wetland sediments are outlined to facilitate the understanding of the processes of carbon storage and removal and also the factors that influence them.

AB Only few estimates of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are available from Antarctic tundra ecosystems. During the summer of 2005/2006, for the first time field measurements of N2O emissions were conducted by a static chamber technique in two coastal marshes (Wolong Marsh and Tuanjie Marsh) of eastern Antarctica. In Wolong Marsh, the N2O fluxes ranged from -20.6 to 85.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2)h(-1), -5.3 to 50.8 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 6.4 to 27.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the wet, mesic and dry sites, respectively. In Tuanjie Marsh, the fluxes ranged from -5.9 to 12.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), -3.6 to 12.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 12.8 to 59.8 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the ponds, shallow fens and dry tundra sites, respectively. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes followed the warming of the sediment/soil, indicating that the variation of ground temperatures had an important effect. on N2O emissions. The freezing-thawing cycle seemed to increase the N2O emissions from the wetlands, and water table was the major parameter for spatial variations of controlling N2O fluxes. There was a consistent diurnal pattern in the N2O emission rates from two wetlands and a good correlation with ground temperatures. The sparse data in this study hint at the potential importance of coastal tundra wetlands in the total local atmospheric NO load in eastern Antarctica. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we present summertime concentrations and fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) measured at a sub-arctic wetland in northern Sweden using a disjunct eddy-covariance (DEC) technique based on a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). The vegetation at the site was dominated by Sphagnum, Carex and Eriophorum spp. The measurements reported here cover a period of 50 days (1 August to 19 September 2006), approximately one half of the growing season at the site, and allowed to investigate the effect of day-to-day variation in weather as well as of vegetation senescence on daily BVOC fluxes, and on their temperature and light responses. The sensitivity drift of the DEC system was assessed by comparing H3O+-ion cluster formed with water molecules (H3O+(H2O) at m37) with water vapour concentration measurements made using an adjacent humidity sensor, and the applicability of the DEC method was analysed by a comparison of sensible heat fluxes for high frequency and DEC data obtained from the sonic anemometer. These analyses showed no significant PTR-MS sensor drift over a period of several weeks and only a small flux-loss due to high-frequency spectrum omissions. This loss was within the range expected from other studies and the theoretical considerations. Standardised (20 degrees C and 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PAR) summer isoprene emission rates found in this study of 329 mu g Cm-2 (ground area) h(-1) were comparable with findings from more southern boreal forests, and fen-like ecosystems. On a diel scale, measured fluxes indicated a stronger temperature dependence than emissions from temperate or (sub) tropical ecosystems. For the first time, to our knowledge, we report ecosystem methanol fluxes from a sub-arctic ecosystem. Maximum daytime emission fluxes were around 270 mu g m(-2) h(-1) (ca. 100 mu g Cm-2 h(-1)), and during most nights small negative fluxes directed from the atmosphere to the surface were observed.

AB In situ denitrification N-losses and nitrous oxide emissions were measured over 12 months from a beech and a drained black alder forest of Northern Germany. Annual N-losses from the alder forest soil were approximately 15 times greater than from the beech forest soil (denitrification: 7.0 vs 0.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1); nitrous oxide: 4.9 vs 0.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). These results were attributed to the soil moisture content, and contents of nitrate and water-soluble organic C compounds in the alder forest soil being significantly greater than in the beech forest soil. The ratio denitrification N-losses-to-nitrous oxide emissions revealed high denitrifier activity in the alder forest soil while in the beech forest soil nitrification predominated. The time course of nitrous oxide emissions and denitrification N-losses on both sites were similar and underwent seasonal changes. The best predictor for the emissions of the alder forest soil was the soil temperature (r(2)=0.63 and 0.44 for nitrous oxide and denitrification, respectively).

AB In this study we investigated the role of intensive and extensive dairy farm practices on CO2 exchange and the carbon balance of peatlands by means of eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Year long EC measurements were made in two adjacent farm sites on peat soil in the western part of the Netherlands. One site (Stein) is a new meadow bird reserve and is managed predominantly by mowing in June and August. The second site (Oukoop) is an intensive dairy farm. Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0.02 and 0.08 (mean 0.045) mu mol CO2 mu mol(-1) photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season. Ecosystem Respiration at 10 degrees C (R-10) calculated from the year round data set was 3.35 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at Stein and 3.69 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at Oukoop. Both sites were a source of carbon in winter and a sink during summer with net ecosystem exchange varying between 50 to 100 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in winter to below -400 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in summer. Periodically, both sites became a source after mowing. Net annual ecosystem exchange (NEE) for Stein was -5.7 g C m(-2) a(-1) and for Oukoop 133.9 g C m(-2) a(-1). When biomass removal, manure applications and estimates of methane emissions ware taken into account, both eutrophic peat meadows are a strong source for C around 420 g C m(-2) a(-1).

AB Drained organic forest soils in boreal and temperate climate zones are believed to be significant sources of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), but the annual fluxes are still highly uncertain. Drained organic soils exemplify systems where many studies are still carried out with relatively small resources, several methodologies and manually operated systems, which further involve different options for the detailed design of the measurement and data analysis protocols for deriving the annual flux. It would be beneficial to set certain guidelines for how to measure and report the data, so that data from individual studies could also be used in synthesis work based on data collation and modelling. Such synthesis work is necessary for deciphering general patterns and trends related to, e.g., site types, climate, and management, and the development of corresponding emission factors, i.e. estimates of the net annual soil GHG emission and removal, which can be used in GHG inventories. Development of specific emission factors also sets prerequisites for the background or environmental data to be reported in individual studies. We argue that wide applicability greatly increases the value of individual studies. An overall objective of this paper is to support future monitoring campaigns in obtaining high-value data. We analysed peer-reviewed publications presenting CO2, CH4 and N2O flux data for drained organic forest soils in boreal and temperate climate zones, focusing on data that have been used, or have the potential to be used, for estimating net annual soil GHG emissions and removals. We evaluated the methods used in data collection and identified major gaps in background or environmental data. Based on these, we formulated recommendations for future research.

AB Large uncertainties persist in estimates of soil-atmosphere exchange of important trace gases. One significant source of uncertainty is the combined effect of wind and pressure on these fluxes. Wind and pressure effects are mediated by surface topography: few surfaces are uniform and over scales of tenths of a metre to tens of metres, air pressure and wind speed at the ground surface may be very variable. In this paper we consider how such spatial variability in air pressure and wind speed affects fluxes of trace gases. We used a novel nested wind tunnel design comprising a toroidial wind tunnel, in which wind speed and pressure may be controlled, set within a larger, linear wind tunnel. The effects of both wind speed and pressure differentials on fluxes of CO2 and CH4 within three different ecosystems (forest, grassland, peat bog) were quantified. We find that trace gas fluxes are positively correlated with both wind speed and pressure differential near the surface boundary. We argue that wind speed is the better proxy for trace gas fluxes because of its stronger correlation and because wind speed is more easily measured and wind speed measurement methodology more easily standardized. Trace gas fluxes, whether into or out of the soil, increase with wind speed within the toroidal tunnel (+55 % flux per m s(-1)), while faster, localized surface winds that are external to the toroidal wind tunnel reduce trace gas fluxes (-13 % flux per m s(-1)). These results are consistent for both trace gases over all ecosystem soil types studied. Our findings support the need for a revised conceptualization of soil-atmosphere gas exchange. We propose a conceptual model of the soil profile that has a 'mixed layer', with fluxes controlled by wind speed, wind duration, porosity, water table, and gas production and consumption.

AB Forests in Europe are changing due to interactions between climate change, nitrogen (N) deposition and new forest management practices. The concurrent impact on the forest greenhouse gas (GHG) balance is at present difficult to predict due to a lack of knowledge on controlling factors of GHG fluxes and response to changes in these factors. To improve the mechanistic understanding of the ongoing changes, we studied the response of soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) at twelve experimental or natural gradient forest sites, representing anticipated future forest change. The experimental manipulations, one or more per site, included N addition (4 sites), changes of climate (temperature, 1 site; precipitation, 2 sites), soil hydrology (3 sites), harvest intensity (1 site), wood ash fertilisation (1 site), pH gradient in organic soil (1 site) and afforestation of cropland (1 site).
   On average, N2O emissions increased by 0.06+/-0.03 (range 0-0.3) g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) across all treatments on mineral soils, but the increase was up to 10 times higher in an acidic organic soil. Soil moisture together with mineral soil C/N ratio and pH were found to significantly influence N2O emissions across all treatments. Emissions were increased by elevated N deposition, especially in interaction with increased soil moisture. High pH reduced the formation of N2O, even under otherwise favourable soil conditions.
   Oxidation (uptake) of CH4 was on average reduced from 0.16+/-0.02 to 0.04+/-0.05 g CH4-Cm-2 yr(-1) by the investigated treatments. The CH4 exchange was significantly influenced by soil moisture and soil C/N ratio across all treatments, and CH4 emissions occurred only in wet or water-saturated conditions.
   For most of the investigated forest manipulations or natural gradients, the response of both N2O and CH4 fluxes was towards reducing the overall GHG forest sink. The most resilient forests were dry Mediterranean forests, as well as forests with high soil C/N ratio or high soil pH. Mitigation strategies may focus on (i) sustainable management of wet forest areas and forested peatlands, (ii) continuous forest cover management, (iii) reducing atmospheric N input and, thus, N availability, and (iv) improving neutralisation capacity of acid soils (e.g. wood ash application).

AB Palsa peats are characterized by elevated, circular frost heaves (peat soil on top of a permanently frozen ice lens) and are strong to moderate sources or even temporary sinks for the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Palsa peats are predicted to react sensitively to global warming. The acidic palsa peat Skalluvaara (approximate pH 4.4) is located in the discontinuous permafrost zone in northwestern Finnish Lapland. In situ N2O fluxes were spatially variable, ranging from 0.01 to -0.02 mu mol of N2O m(-2) h(-1). Fertilization with nitrate stimulated in situ N2O emissions and N2O production in anoxic microcosms without apparent delay. N2O was subsequently consumed in microcosms. Maximal reaction velocities (nu(max)) of nitrate-dependent denitrification approximated 3 and 1 nmol of N2O per h per gram (dry weight [g(DW)]) in soil from 0 to 20 cm and below 20 cm of depth, respectively. nu(max) values of nitrite-dependent denitrification were 2- to 5-fold higher than the nu(max). nitrate-dependent denitrification, and nu(max) of N2O consumption was 1- to 6-fold higher than that of nitrite-dependent denitrification, highlighting a high N2O consumption potential. Up to 12 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of narG, nirK and nirS, and nosZ were retrieved. Detected OTUs suggested the presence of diverse uncultured soil denitrifiers and dissimilatory nitrate reducers, hitherto undetected species, as well as Actino-, Alpha-, and Betaproteobacteria. Copy numbers of nirS always outnumbered those of nirK by 2 orders of magnitude. Copy numbers of nirS tended to be higher, while copy numbers of narG and nosZ tended to be lower in 0- to 20-cm soil than in soil below 20 cm. The collective data suggest that (i) the source and sink functions of palsa peat soils for N2O are associated with denitrification, (ii) actinobacterial nitrate reducers and nirS-type and nosZ-harboring proteobacterial denitrifiers are important players, and (iii) acidic soils like palsa peats represent reservoirs of diverse acid-tolerant denitrifiers associated with N2O fluxes.

AB Peat in the discontinuous permafrost zone contains a globally significant reservoir of carbon that has undergone multiple permafrost-thaw cycles since the end of the mid-Holocene (similar to 3700 years before present). Periods of thaw increase C decomposition rates which leads to the release of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere creating potential climate feedback. To determine the magnitude and direction of such feedback, we measured CO2 and CH4 emissions and modeled C accumulation rates and radiative fluxes from measurements of two radioactive tracers with differing lifetimes to describe the C balance of the peatland over multiple permafrost-thaw cycles since the initiation of permafrost at the site. At thaw features, the balance between increased primary production and higher CH4 emission stimulated by warmer temperatures and wetter conditions favors C sequestration and enhanced peat accumulation. Flux measurements suggest that frozen plateaus may intermittently (order of years to decades) act as CO2 sources depending on temperature and net ecosystem respiration rates, but modeling results suggest that-despite brief periods of net C loss to the atmosphere at the initiation of thaw-integrated over millennia, these sites have acted as net C sinks via peat accumulation. In greenhouse gas terms, the transition from frozen permafrost to thawed wetland is accompanied by increasing CO2 uptake that is partially offset by increasing CH4 emissions. In the short-term (decadal time scale) the net effect of this transition is likely enhanced warming via increased radiative C emissions, while in the long-term (centuries) net C deposition provides a negative feedback to climate warming.

AB Wetlands contribute considerably to the global greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. In these ecosystems, groundwater level (GWL) and temperature, two factors likely to be altered by climate change, exert important control over CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes. However, little is known about the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of the combined GHG emissions from hydromorphic soils and how this Q(10) varies with GWL. We performed a greenhouse experiment in which three different (plant-free) hydromorphic soils from a temperate spruce forest were exposed to two GWLs (an intermediate GWL of -20 cm and a high GWL of -5 cm). Net CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured continuously. Here, we discuss how these fluxes responded to synoptic temperature fluctuations. Across all soils and GWLs, CO2 emissions responded similarly to temperature and Q(10) was close to 2. The Q(10) of the CH4 and N2O fluxes also was similar across soil types. GWL, on the other hand, significantly affected the Q(10) of both CH4 and N2O emissions. The Q(10) of the net CH4 fluxes increased from about 1 at GWL = -20 cm to 3 at GWL = -5 cm. For the N2O emissions, Q(10) varied around 2 for GWL = -20 cm and around 4 for GWL = -5 cm. This substantial GWL-effect on the Q(10) of CH4 and N2O emissions was, however, hardly reflected in the Q(10) of the total GHG emissions (which varied around 2), because the contribution of these gases was relatively small compared to that of CO2.

AB This paper describes a new low-power instrument for measuring methane flux by eddy covariance method at sites without grid power. Design and field performance of the LI-7700 Methane Analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences) are examined in this study. The instrument uses 8 W of power in steady-state operation and employs a tunable diode laser in an open Herriott cell configuration with 0.47 m base path and 30 m optical path length. Methane number density is measured using wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) with 2f detection. Typical signal noise is < 5 ppb rms at 10 Hz. Corrections for variations in temperature, pressure and water vapor are described. Data losses due to mirror contamination and condensation are minimized by a radiation shield and automatic mirror cleaning system and are shown to be small. Measured spectra and co-spectra are shown to follow the Kaimal model at deployment sites meeting classical criteria, and to follow sensible heat flux co-spectra from the sonic anemometer in most other cases, including difficult ones. Measured fluxes are similar in magnitude to those expected from the literature, and zero flux was measured during both summer and winter at a site known to have fluxes at or very near zero.

AB Recent advances in laser spectrometry offer new opportunities to investigate ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of environmentally relevant trace gases. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) absorption spectrometer to continuously measure ammonia concentrations at high time resolution and thus to quantify the net exchange between a seminatural peatland ecosystem and the atmosphere based on the eddy-covariance approach. Changing diurnal patterns of both ammonia concentration and fluxes were found during different periods of the campaign. We observed a clear tipping point in early spring with decreasing ammonia deposition velocities and increasingly bidirectional fluxes that occurred after the switch from dormant vegetation to CO2 uptake but was triggered by a significant weather change. While several biophysical parameters such as temperature, radiation, and surface wetness were identified to partially regulate ammonia exchange at the site, the seasonal concentration pattern was clearly dominated by agricultural practices in the surrounding area. Comparing the results of a compensation point model with our measurement-based flux estimates showed considerable differences in some periods of the campaign due to overestimation of non-stomatal resistances caused by low acid ratios. The total cumulative campaign exchange of ammonia after 9 weeks, however, differed only in a 6% deviation with 911 and 857 gNH(3)-N ha(-1) deposition being found by measurements and modeling, respectively. Extrapolating our findings to an entire year, ammonia deposition was lower than reported by Hurkuck et al. (2014) for the same site in previous years using denuder systems. This was likely due to a better representation of the emission component in the net signal of eddy-covariance fluxes as well as better adapted site-specific parameters in the model. Our study not only stresses the importance of high-quality measurements for studying and assessing land surface-atmosphere interactions but also demonstrates the potential of QCL spectrometers for continuous observation of reactive nitrogen species as important additional instruments within long-term monitoring research infrastructures such as ICOS or NEON at sites with strong nearby ammonia sources leading to relatively high mean background concentrations and fluxes.

AB Continuous eddy-covariance measurements of turbulent methane exchange between the ground and the atmosphere were carried out during the period from July 2013 to September 2015. The measurement sites were located in areas characterized by different types of use: the city (Lodz, central Poland) and the wetlands of Biebrza National Park (northeastern Poland). Regardless of the type of surface, such long-term, continuous measurements of the turbulent fluxes of methane are rare. Our aim was to investigate the temporal variability of the turbulent methane exchange in the surface-atmosphere system, while considering the impact of land use. Because cities are a huge source of atmospheric carbon dioxide, we compared the intensity of methane emissions from the city as compared to the wetland, which is considered to be the most intense natural source atmospheric methane. In both cases, the results show a clear prevalence of positive as compared with negative fluxes. This shows that both areas are net sources of methane to the troposphere. The measurements also demonstrated the existence of a clear annual cycle of turbulent methane flux in the centre of the city (average values in winter ranged from similar to 40 to 60 nmol m(-2).s(-1) and were significantly greater than values measured, in summer) as well as in the wetlands, where maximum values were observed during the warm part of the year (approximately 80 nmol m(-2).s(-1) or more). The different times of maximum CH4 flux (FCH4) occurrence resulted from the differentiation of processes that determine methane emissions: in the city these are anthropogenic emissions (strongest in winter); in the wetland, natural processes dominate. The diurnal variability of FCH4 was faintly detectable, except for the cold half of the year in the city and the warm half of the year in the wetland. The studied area of the centre of Lodz, in turn, is also characterized by a weekly cycle of methane exchange: the values measured on working days were higher by 6.6% (winter) to 5.6% (summer) than those observed on weekends. Differences in the annual exchange of methane in 2014 were insignificant: the centre of Lodz emitted 17.4 g m(-2) net, while the wetland emitted about 18.7 g m(-2) net. The results of the measurements performed during the period from January to September 2015, however, suggest that a very dry summer, drying of the soil and, consequently, a reduced water level in the fen significantly reduced the ability of the wetland to emit methane. This pattern was not observed in the city. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural peat soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions of N2O were measured from field plots of grass, barley, potatoes and fallow on a peat field in northern Finland during 2000-2002 and in southern Finland in 1999-2002. In the north the mean annual fluxes of N2O (with their standard errors) during 2 years were 4.0 (+/-1.2), 13 (+/-3.0) and 4.4 (+/-0.8) kg N ha(-1) from the plots of grass, barley and fallow, respectively. In the north there were no significant thaw periods in the middle of winter. As a result, the thawing in the spring did not induce especially large N2O emissions. Emissions of N2O were larger in the south than in the north. In the southern peat field the mean annual fluxes during 3 years were 7.3 (+/-1.2), 15 (+/-2.6), 10 (+/-1.9) and 25 (+/-6.9) kg N2O-N ha(-1) for grass, barley, potato and fallow plots, respectively. Here, the largest single episodes of emission occurred during the spring thaw each year, following winter thaw events. An emission factor of 10.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) for the N2O emission from the decomposition of the peat results from these data if the effect of fertilization according to the IPCC default emission factor is omitted. The direct effect of adding N as fertilizer on N2O emissions was of minor importance. On average, 52% of the annual N2O flux entered the atmosphere outside the cropping season (October-April) in the north and 55% in the south. The larger N2O fluxes from the peat soil in the south might be due to the more humified status of the peat, more rapid mineralization and weather with more cycles of freezing and thawing in the winter.

AB Knowledge about nitrate transformation processes and how they are affected by different plants is essential in order to reduce the loss of valuable N fertiliser as well as to prevent environmental pollution due to nitrate leaching or N2O emission after fertilisation or the reflooding of degraded fens with nitrate-containing municipal sewage. Therefore four microcosm N-15 tracer experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of common wetland plants (Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis) combined with different soil moisture conditions (from dry to reflooded) on nitrate turnover processes. At the end of experiment, the total formation of gaseous N compounds was calculated using the N-15 balance method. In two experiments (wet and reflooded soil conditions) the N2O and N-2 emissions were also directly determined.
   Our results show that in degraded fen soils, which process mainly takes place-denitrification or transformation into organic N compounds-is determined by the soil moisture conditions. Under dry soil moisture conditions (water filled pore space: 31%) up to 80% of the N-15 nitrate added was transformed into organic N compounds. This transformation process is not affected by plant growth. Under reflooded conditions (water filled pore space: 100%), the total gaseous N losses were highest (77-95% of the N-15-nitrate added) and the transformation into organic N compounds was very low (1.8% of N-15 nitrate added). Under almost all soil conditions plant growth reduced the N losses by 20-25% of the N-15 nitrate added due to plant uptake. The N-2 emissions exceeded the N2O emissions by a factor of 10-20 in planted soil, and as much as 30 in unplanted soil. In the treatments planted with Phragmites australis, N2O emission was about two times higher than in the corresponding implanted treatment. 15% of the N2O and N-2 formed was transported via the Phragmites shoots from the soil into the atmosphere. By contrast, Phalaris arundinacea did not affect N2O emissions and no emission via the shoots was observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DENITRIFICATION
AB Intensively managed grasslands are potentially a large source of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Netherlands because of the large nitrogen (N) input and the fairly wet soil conditions. To quantify the effects of soil type, N-fertilizer application and grazing on total N2O losses from grassland, fluxes of N2O were measured weekly from unfertilized and mown, N fertilized and mown, and N fertilized and predominantly grazed grassland on a sand soil, a clay soil, and two peat soils during the growing season of 1992.
   Total N2O losses from unfertilized grassland were 2.5-13.5 times more from the peat soils than from the sand and clay soils. Application of calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer significantly increased N2O flux on all sites, especially when the soil was wet. The percentage of fertilizer N applied lost to the atmosphere as N2O during the season ranged from 0.5 on the sand soil to 3.9 on one of the peat soils. Total N2O losses were 1.5-2.5 times more from grazed grassland than from mown grassland, probably because of the extra N input from urine and dung. From 1.0 to 7.7% of the calculated total amount of N excreted in urine and dung was emitted as N2O on grazed grassland. The large N2O losses measured from the peat soils, combined with the large proportion of grassland on peat in the Netherlands, mean that these grasslands contribute significantly to the total emission from the country.

ID SOIL COMPACTION; NITROUS-OXIDE; WETTING PROPERTIES
AB N loss by denitrification from potted plants is subject to high variability. It was suggested that variability partly resulted from characteristics of the potting medium. Thus, peat properties were investigated with regard to their influence on denitrification N loss. The wettability of peat, which depended on substrate water content, showed a strong effect on N loss. Dry substrate produced less N emissions after irrigation than moist substrate. Sieving as well as compacting peat substrate increased denitrification N loss. This was mainly attributed to decreased air capacity. While compacted peat showed increased water and decreased air capacity already before planting, sieved substrate presumably changed during cultivation. Mixing sieved peat with rice husks or wood fibres (30 Vol.%) increased air capacity as measured by the 'Quick' method. Nevertheless, observed N emissions from the mixed substrate were at least as high as from peat. It was suggested that rice husks as well as wood fibres broke down and decomposed during the cultivation period and thus lost their positive effect on substrate aeration. In all experiments denitrification N loss sensitively reflected changes in substrate properties. It was concluded that substrate properties influenced the extent of denitrification N loss and significantly contributed to its variability.

TI New estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning and peat

DE Biomass burning; GHG emissions; MODIS burned area
ID VALIDATION
AB The Paris Agreement calls on parties to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change by engaging in appropriate policies and measures as put forward through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), to strengthen transparency when reporting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to increase their mitigation contributions to climate action from 2020. It also calls for regular and transparent monitoring and reporting of the GHG emissions and on the NDCs implementation efforts. Biomass fires significantly affect the GHG atmospheric balance, with fire emissions representing more than 5% of total emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), according to recent estimates produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). We update previously published Tier 1 estimates of GHG emissions in FAOSTAT-which had been used in the IPCC AR5 analysis-by using new burned area activity data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) known as MCD64A1, Collection 6. The previous FAOSTAT estimates had used as input the Global Fire Emission Database v.4 (GFED4) burned area product, based on older MODIS Collection 5.1 burned area product. In line with differences between the input data used, the new FAOSTAT estimates indicate roughly 30% higher fire emissions globally than previously published. Our analysis also confirms that the FAOSTAT Tier 1 approach produces fire emissions estimates that are comparable to those computed at Tier 3 by GFED, and thus represent a useful complementary tool in support of country GHG reporting.

AB Three measurement campaigns were carried out to answer questions related to the factors controlling variations in nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from intensively managed grassland on peat soil, comparison of flux measurements with a closed flux chamber method and a flux gradient technique and the development and testing of a simple empirical model for the estimation of N2O fluxes from intensively managed grassland on peat soils. Fluxes of N2O were measured with 42-48 flux chambers and ranged from less than 0.01 to 6.66 mg N m(-2) hr(-1). Fluxes were significantly correlated with denitrification activity (R-2 = 0.34-0.56). Contents of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) in the top soil and the water-filled pore space (WFPS) explained 37-77% of the variance in N2O flux. Spatial variability of N2O fluxes was large with coefficients of variation ranging from 101 to 320%. Spatial variability was suggested to be related to distribution of mineral N fertilizer and cattle slurry, urine and dung patches and variations in groundwater level within the field. Average field fluxes obtained with the closed flux chamber method were about a factor 10 larger than those with the flux gradient technique on one measurement day but were similar on two other measurement days. The results of the measurement campaigns were used to derive a simple empirical model including total mineral N content and WFPS. This model was tested using an independent data set, i.e. the results of a monitoring study of two years carried out on two other grassland sites on peat soil. The model reasonably predicted magnitude of and temporal variations in N2O fluxes. It is suggested that a simple empirical model which requires only easily obtainable data such as mineral N content and moisture content, in combination with a few days lasting measurement campaigns, may be a valuable tool to predict N2O fluxes from similar sites.

AB Freshwater marshes have been shown to be strong sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) on an annual basis relative to other wetland types; however it is likely that these ecosystems are also strong emitters of methane (CH4), reducing their carbon (C) sequestration potential. Multiyear C balances in these ecosystems are necessary therefore to determine their contribution to the global C cycle. Despite this, the number of multiyear studies in marshes is few, with, to the best of our knowledge, only one other Northern marsh C balance reported. This study presents five years of eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2, and four years of warm-season chamber measurements of CH4 at a cool-temperate Typha angustifolia marsh. Annual average cumulative net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at the marsh was -224 +/- 54 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SD) over the five-year period, ranging from -126 to -284 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Enhancement of the ecosystem respiration during warmer spring, autumn and winter periods appeared the strongest determinant of annual NEE totals. Warm season fluxes of CH4 from the Typha vegetation (avg. 1.0 +/- 1.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) were significantly higher than fluxes from the water surface (0.5 +/- 0.4 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and unvegetated mats (0.2 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Air temperature was a primary driver of all CH4 fluxes, while water table was not a significant correlate as water levels were always at or above the vegetative mat surfaces. Weighting by the surface cover proportion of water and vegetation yielded a net ecosystem CH4 emission of 127 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Combining CO2 and CH4, the annual C sink at the Mer Bleue marsh was reduced to -97 +/- 57 g C m(-2) yr(-1), illustrating the importance of accounting for CH4 when generating marsh C budgets.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane flux were carried out in an arctic tundra landscape in the central Lena River Delta at 72 degrees N. The measurements covered the seasonal course of mid-summer to early winter in 2003 and early spring to mid-summer in 2004, including the periods of spring thaw and autumnal freeze back. The study site is characterized by very cold and deep permafrost and a continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of -14.7 degrees C. The surface is characterized by wet polygonal tundra, with a micro-relief consisting of raised moderately dry sites, depressed wet sites, polygonal ponds, and lakes. We found relatively low fluxes of typically 30 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) during mid-summer and identified soil temperature and near-surface atmospheric turbulence as the factors controlling methane emission. The influence of atmospheric turbulence was attributed to the high coverage of open water surfaces in the tundra. The soil thaw depth and water table position were found to have no clear effect on methane fluxes. The excess emission during spring thaw was estimated to be about 3% of the total flux measured during June-October. Winter emissions were modeled based on the functional relationships found in the measured data. The annual methane emission was estimated to be 3.15 g m(-2). This is low compared with values reported for similar ecosystems. Reason for this were thought to be the very low permafrost temperature in the study region, the sandy soil texture and low bio-availability of nutrients in the soils, and the high surface coverage of moist to dry micro-sites. The methane emission accounted for about 14% of the annual ecosystem carbon balance. Considering the global warming potential of methane, the methane emission turned the tundra into an effective greenhouse gas source.

AB Every year, nurseries waste about 40 t of residual biomass for each ha of potted plants cultivation. The European nursery sector deals with about 90,000 ha of cultivated land and 120,000 ha of nurseries, with a turnover of 19.8 billion Euros in 2011. In recent years, a number of Italian projects highlighted that GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions for the nursery sector range between 37 tCO(2)eq/ha/year and 45 tCO(2)eq/ha/year for potted plants, mainly due to the consumption of electric energy, plastics and peat. Moreover, other studies analyse the impacts associated to nurseries, recommending best practices for energy reductions and waste recycle or reuse. Therefore, the present work focused its attention to the possible environmental benefits associated to the reuse of residues (wood and substrate) of potted plants that are discarded from the nursery production chain. GHG emissions and fossil energy requirement were quantified by considering the CO(2)eq (CO2 equivalent) and the CER (cumulative energy requirement) respectively, in order to assess the environmental impacts of two different scenarios proposed for the materials recovery. Final results highlighted that the solutions which are able to recover the substrate and the wood allow impact reductions compared to landfill disposal. In particular, the scenario consisting in the immediate separation of the substrate from the root-plant system and the successive chipping of wood for energetic reuse, allows higher savings than those obtainable through shredding and subsequent wind separation. Moreover, for what concerns the CO(2)eq, an adequate use of the residual biomass make it possible to compensate the GHG emissions of the nurseries up to 15%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ID RENEWABLE-ENERGY; CO2 EMISSIONS; CYCLE
AB The energy sector in Poland is the source of 81% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Poland, among other European Union countries, occupies a leading position with regard to coal consumption. Polish energy sector actively participates in efforts to reduce GHG emissions to the atmosphere, through a gradual decrease of the share of coal in the fuel mix and development of renewable energy sources. All evidence which completes the knowledge about issues related to GHG emissions is a valuable source of information. The article presents the results of modeling of GHG emissions which are generated by the energy sector in Poland. For a better understanding of the quantitative relationship between total consumption of primary energy and greenhouse gas emission, multiple stepwise regression model was applied. The modeling results of CO2 emissions demonstrate a high relationship (0.97) with the hard coal consumption variable. Adjustment coefficient of the model to actual data is high and equal to 95%. The backward step regression model, in the case of CH4 emission, indicated the presence of hard coal (0.66), peat and fuel wood (0.34), solid waste fuels, as well as other sources (-0.64) as the most important variables. The adjusted coefficient is suitable and equals R-2 = 0.90. For N2O emission modeling the obtained coefficient of determination is low and equal to 43%. A significant variable influencing the amount of N2O emission is the peat and wood fuel consumption. (C) 2015 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from inland waters is recognized as highly important and an understudied part of the terrestrial carbon (C) biogeochemical cycle. These emissions are still poorly quantified in subarctic regions that contain vast amounts of surface C in permafrost peatlands. This is especially true in NE European peatlands, located within sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zones which are highly vulnerable to thaw. Initial measurements of C emissions from lentic waters of the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (BZT; 200,000 km(2)) demonstrated sizable CO(2)and CH(4)concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere in 98 depressions, thaw ponds, and thermokarst lakes ranging from 0.5 x 10(6)to 5 x 10(6) m(2)in size. CO(2)fluxes decreased by an order of magnitude as waterbody size increased by > 3 orders of magnitude while CH(4)fluxes showed large variability unrelated to lake size. By using a combination of Landsat-8 and GeoEye-1 images, we determined lakes cover 4% of BZT and thus calculated overall C emissions from lentic waters to be 3.8 +/- 0.65 Tg C yr(-1)(99% C-CO2, 1% C-CH4), which is two times higher than the lateral riverine export. Large lakes dominated GHG emissions whereas small thaw ponds had a minor contribution to overall water surface area and GHG emissions. These data suggest that, if permafrost thaw in NE Europe results in disappearance of large thermokarst lakes and formation of new small thaw ponds and depressions, GHG emissions from lentic waters in this region may decrease.

AB Identifying options of climate change mitigation is of global interest to researchers. Whereas wide range of techniques of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration have been studied in row crops and forest systems, little research has been done on the ornamental horticulture. The ornamental industrial sector has indeed some negative impacts on the global environment, but also presents opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and increase C sequestration. Thus the objective of this study was to synthesize the potential contributions of some substrates used in the horticultural sector to carbon sequestration. The specific focus of the review is on the possible use of compost, vermicompost and biochar as soilless substrate substitutes for containerized ornamental plants production. Around 11 million kilograms of sphagnum peat moss are used annually in the world for horticultural production. Therefore, the potential of using compost, vermicompost and biochar as growing media is assessed on the basis of data from greenhouse studies. Peat-based substrate can be substituted up to 30% to 35% by compost or vermicompost and up to 20% to 25% by biochar. Some examples from field studies are included to conduct the life cycle assessment of using these growth media. An estimate of C storage on the long-term basis in soil indicates up to 3 million tons of CO2 equivalent as the maximum C potential storage per year in the global productive sector if the peat-based growing media are substituted by compost/vermicompost and biochar at the ratios mentioned above. Finally, synergies between compost vermicompost and biochar are discussed when these materials are combined as growing media additives and research gaps in this area of activity have been identified for further research.

ID ORGANIC SOILS; INVENTORY; FINLAND
AB Digitised maps of Quaternary deposits, (40)K radiation data and Integrated Agricultural Control System databases (IACS) were used in a GIS analysis to estimate the distribution and land use of agricultural peat and gyttja soils in Sweden. The total area of agricultural land (cropland and pastures) in Sweden was estimated at 3,496,665 ha and 8.6% of this area (301,489 ha) was classified as agricultural peat and gyttja soils, with 202,383 ha of deep peat, 50,191 ha of shallow peat and 48,915 ha of gyttja soils. Using detailed information on crop distribution from agricultural databases, it was possible to estimate the Cultivation intensity (land use) of the agricultural land. One-quarter of the agricultural area of peat soils was intensively cultivated with annual crops and the remaining area was extensively used, dominated by managed grasslands and pastures. There was great variation in cultivation intensity between areas, from 50% annual crops down to 10%. The gyttja soils were in general more intensively cultivated than the peat soils. The improved estimates of acreage and cultivation intensity of agricultural peat soils were used to calculate annual greenhouse gas emissions from subsidence data. The total carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from Swedish agricultural peat soils in 2003 were estimated to be between 3100 Gg CO(2) and 4600 Gg CO(2), which is similar to or lower than previously reported values. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) were estimated at 3.2 Gg N(2)O in 2003. Estimated combined total emissions Of CO(2) and N(2)O from agricultural peat soils in Sweden in 2003 amounted to 4000-5600 Gg CO(2)-equivalents, which Corresponds to approximately 6-8% of the total emissions of all greenhouse gases reported by Sweden (excluding the sink for land use, land use change and forestry - LULUCF). Agricultural peat soils represent a minor fraction of the agricultural land in Sweden but still have a significant effect on total national greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study was conducted to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in fields growing paddy and fallow (PF), soybean and winter wheat (SW), and spring and winter wheat (WW) on peatland dressed with mineral soil. Field measurements were carried out from June 2002 to May 2003. GHG fluxes were measured in a closed chamber. Soil respiration was measured in the SW and WW fields, and photosynthetic CO2 flux during the daytime (net ecosystem production, NEPday) was measured in the PF field. Microbial respiration (R.) in the SW and WW fields was approximated as 60% of the total soil respiration. NEP was calculated as the difference between plant dry matter (net primary production, NPP) and R-m. Aboveground plant parts were collected from each field to calculate NPP of each crop. Rm in the PF field was calculated as (3)/2NPP - NEPday, because aboveground respiration is 50% of NPP. The global warming potential (GWP) in each ecosystem was calculated using a 100-year time horizon, as recommended by the IPCC (with factors of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O).
   R-m was 682 g Cm-2 y(-1) in PF, 533 in SW, and 388 in WW. NPP was 651, 397, and 152 g C m(-2) y(-1), respectively. Therefore, NEP was -31, -136, and -236 g C m(-2) y(-1), respectively. The PF field acted as a large CH4 source (85.2 g C m(-2) y(-1)) because of flooding. The WW field was a small source of CH4 (0.16 g C m(-2) y(-1)), and the SW field was a small sink (0.14 g C m(-2) y(-1)). All fields were sources of N2O (1.36 g N m(-2) y(-1) in SW, 0.60 in WW, and 0.05 in PF). The rate of mineralization was higher than the rate of N fertilizer application in SW and WW.
   The GWP was equivalent to 2522 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the PF field, 11619 CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the WW field, and 1157 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the SW field. The high value in the PF field was due to high CH4 emissions there.

AB In the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, boreal forest carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes will be altered directly by climate change through changing meteorological forcing and indirectly through changes in landscape functioning associated with thaw-induced collapse-scar bog (` wetland') expansion. However, their combined effect on landscape-scale net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEELAND), resulting from changing gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), remains unknown. Here, we quantify indirect land cover change impacts on NEELAND and direct climate change impacts on modeled temperature-and light-limited NEELAND of a boreal forestwetland landscape. Using nested eddy covariance flux towers, we find both GPP and ER to be larger at the landscape compared to the wetland level. However, annual NEELAND (-20 g C m(-2)) and wetland NEE (-24 g C m(-2)) were similar, suggesting negligible wetland expansion effects on NEELAND. In contrast, we find non-negligible direct climate change impacts when modeling NEELAND using projected air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation. At the end of the 21st century, modeled GPP mainly increases in spring and fall due to reduced temperature limitation, but becomes more frequently light-limited in fall. In a warmer climate, ER increases year-round in the absence of moisture stress resulting in net CO2 uptake increases in the shoulder seasons and decreases during the summer. Annually, landscape net CO2 uptake is projected to decline by 25 +/- 14 g C m(-2) for a moderate and 103 +/- 38 g C m(-2) for a high warming scenario, potentially reversing recently observed positive net CO2 uptake trends across the boreal biome. Thus, even without moisture stress, net CO2 uptake of boreal forest-wetland landscapes may decline, and ultimately, these landscapes may turn into net CO2 sources under continued anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We conclude that NEELAND changes are more likely to be driven by direct climate change rather than by indirect land cover change impacts.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from agricultural land is an important component of the total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. In addition, uncertainties associated with agricultural N2O emissions are large. The goals of this work were (i) to quantify the uncertainties of modelled N2O emissions caused by model input uncertainty at point and landscape scale (i.e. resolution), and (ii) to identify the main sources of input uncertainty at both scales. For the Dutch western fen meadow landscape, we performed a Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation analysis using the INITIATOR model. The Monte Carlo analysis used novel and state-of-the-art methods for estimating and simulating continuous-numerical and categorical input variables, handling spatial and cross-correlations and analyzing spatial aggregation effects. Spatial auto- and cross-correlation of uncertain numerical inputs that are spatially variable were represented by the linear model of coregionalization. Bayesian Maximum Entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of spatially variable categorical model inputs. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to analyze the contribution of groups of uncertain inputs to the uncertainty of the N2O emission at point and landscape scale. The average N2O emission at landscape scale had a mean of 20.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and a standard deviation of 10.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1), producing a relative uncertainty of 52%. At point scale, the relative error was on average 78%, indicating that upscaling decreases uncertainty. Soil inputs and denitrification and nitrification inputs were the main sources of uncertainty in N2O emission at point scale. At landscape scale, uncertainty in soil inputs averaged out and uncertainty in denitrification and nitrification inputs was the dominant source of uncertainty. This was partly because these inputs were assumed constant across areas with the same soil type and land use, which is probably not very realistic. Experiments at landscape scale are needed to assess the spatial variability of these fractions and analyze how a more realistic representation influences the uncertainty budget at landscape scale. This research confirms that results from uncertainty analyses are often scale dependent and that results for one scale cannot directly be extrapolated to other scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the spatial representativeness of eddy covariance (EC) methane (CH4) measurements was examined by comparing parallel CH4 fluxes from three short (6 m) towers separated by a few kilometres and from two higher levels (20 m and 60 m) at one location. The measurement campaign was held on an intensively managed grassland on peat soil in the Netherlands. The land use and land cover types are to a large degree homogeneous in the area.
   The CH4 fluxes exhibited significant variability between the sites on 30-min scale. The spatial coefficient of variation (CVspa) between the three short towers was 56% and it was of similar magnitude as the temporal variability, unlike for the other fluxes (friction velocity, sensible heat flux) for which the temporal variability was considerably larger than the spatial variability. The CVspa decreased with temporal averaging, although less than what could be expected for a purely random process (1/root N), and it was 14% for 26-day means of CH4 flux. This reflects the underlying heterogeneity of CH4 flux in the studied landscape at spatial scales ranging from 1 ha (flux footprint) to 10 km(2) (area bounded by the short towers). This heterogeneity should be taken into account when interpreting and comparing EC measurements. On an annual scale, the flux spatial variability contributed up to 50% of the uncertainty in CH4 emissions. It was further tested whether EC flux measurements at higher levels could be used to acquire a more accurate estimate of the spatially integrated CH4 emissions. Contrarily to what was expected, flux intensity was found to both increase and decrease depending on measurement height. Using footprint modelling, 56% of the variation between 6 m and 60 m CH4 fluxes was attributed to emissions from local anthropogenic hotspots (farms). Furthermore, morning hours proved to be demanding for the tall tower EC where fluxes at 60 m were up to four-fold those at lower heights. These differences were connected with the onset of convective mixing during the morning period. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB About 65% of all emissions of nitrous oxide, N2O, are from soils, and are caused by aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification. Tropical forest soils are probably the most important single source, followed by cultivated soils. Emission rates in natural systems are related to the rate of N mineralization from organic matter, and N deposition; in agricultural systems they are related to the quantities of N used as fertilizers and, where relevant, to recent land use change. The global budget for N2O is not well balanced, and sources may still be underestimated. Direct evidence of a positive feedback of global warming on N2O emissions comes from studies of air in ice cores. One of the projected effects of future global warming is a lowering of water tables in northern peatlands; experiments suggest that this would lead to increased emissions, but that the effect on total emissions would be small. The results of many experiments with non-peatland soils indicate that the effect of temperature on soil emissions is generally positive, and that the rate of increase may be very steep when denitrification is the principal process involved. process-level modelling suggests that the reason is increased soil respiration, which causes an increase in anaerobic volume in which denitrification can take place, in addition to the increased denitrification rate per unit anaerobic volume brought about directly by the rise in temperature. These results imply that generally a positive feedback on emissions from soils is likely. However, in some environments, a large proportion of total annual emissions can occur during freeze-thaw cycles; such cycles may become more or less frequent, depending on the climatic zone, and this may result in either a positive or negative feedback effect due to global warming. Models of global and regional trends give very conflicting predictions of the direction and the magnitude of climatic impacts on fluxes, but the prediction of a positive feedback seems to be the more soundly based.

AB Inland waters emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. On a global scale, these emissions are large enough that their contribution to climate change is now recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Much of the past focus on GHG emissions from inland waters has focused on lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, and the role of small, artificial waterbodies such as ponds has been overlooked. To investigate the spatial variation in GHG fluxes from artificial ponds, we conducted a synoptic survey of forty urban ponds in a Swedish city. We measured dissolved concentrations of CH4 and CO2, and made complementary measurements of water chemistry. We found that CH4 concentrations were greatest in high-nutrient ponds (measured as total phosphorus and total organic carbon). For CO2, higher concentrations were associated with silicon and calcium, suggesting that groundwater inputs lead to elevated CO2. When converted to diffusive GHG fluxes, mean emissions were 30.3 mg CH4 center dot m(-2).d(-1) and 752 mg CO2 center dot m(-2).d(-1). Although these fluxes are moderately high on an areal basis, upscaling them to all Swedish urban ponds gives an emission of 8336 t CO(2)eq/yr (+/- 1689) equivalent to 0.1% of Swedish agricultural GHG emissions. Artificial ponds could be important GHG sources in countries with larger proportions of urban land.

AB Nitrogen deposition was experimentally increased on a Scottish peatbog over a period of 13 years (2002-2015). Nitrogen was applied in three forms, NH3 gas, NH4Cl solution, and NaNO3 solution, at rates ranging from 8 (ambient) to 64 kgNha(-1) yr(-1), and higher near the NH3 fumigation source. An automated system was used to apply the nitrogen, such that the deposition was realistic in terms of rates and high frequency of deposition events. We measured the response of nitrous oxide (N2O) flux to the increased nitrogen input. Prior expectations, based on the IPCC default emission factor, were that 1% of the added nitrogen would be emitted as N2O. In the plots treated with NH4+ and NO3- solution, no response was seen, and there was a tendency for N2O fluxes to be reduced by additional nitrogen, though this was not significant. Areas subjected to high NH3 emitted more N2O than expected, up to 8.5% of the added nitrogen. Differences in the response are related to the impact of the nitrogen treatments on the vegetation. In the NH4+ and NO3- treatments, all the additional nitrogen is effectively immobilised in the vegetation and top 10 cm of peat. In the NH3 treatment, much of the vegetation was killed off by high doses of NH3, and the nitrogen was presumably more available to denitrifying bacteria. The design of the wet and dry experimental treatments meant that they differed in statistical power, and we are less likely to detect an effect of the NH4+ and NO3- treatments, though they avoid issues of pseudo-replication.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from managed and grazed grasslands on peat soils are amongst the highest emissions in the world per unit of surface of agriculturally managed soil. According to the IPCC methodology, the direct N2O emissions from managed organic soils is the sum of N2O emissions derived from N input, including fertilizers, urine and dung of grazing cattle, and a constant 'background' N2O emission from decomposition of organic matter that depends on agro-climatic zone. In this paper we questioned the constant nature of this background emission from peat soils by monitoring N2O emissions, groundwater levels, N inputs and soil NO3 (-)-N contents from 4 grazed and fertilized grassland fields on managed organic peat soil. Two fields had a relatively low groundwater level ('dry' fields) and two fields had a relatively high groundwater level ('wet' fields). To measure the background N2O emission, unfertilized sub-plots were installed in each field. Measurements were performed monthly and after selected management events for 2 years (2008-2009). On the managed fields average cumulative emission equaled 21 +/- A 2 kg N ha(-1)y(-1) for the 'dry' fields and 14 +/- A 3 kg N ha(-1)y(-1) for the 'wet' fields. On the unfertilized sub-plots emissions equaled 4 +/- A 0.6 kg N ha(-1)y(-1) for the 'dry' fields and 1 +/- A 0.7 kg N ha(-1)y(-1) for the 'wet' fields, which is below the currently used estimates. Background emissions were closely correlated with groundwater level (R (2) = 0.73) and accounted for approximately 22% of the cumulative N2O emission for the dry fields and for approximately 10% of the cumulative N2O emissions from the wet fields. The results of this study demonstrate that the accuracy of estimating direct N2O emissions from peat soils can be improved by approximately 20% by applying a background emission of N2O that depends on annual average groundwater level rather than applying a constant value.

AB This work reviews and performs a meta-analysis of the recent life cycle assessment and flow analyses studies palm oil biodiesel. The best available data and information are extracted, summarized, and discussed. Most studies found palm oil biodiesel would produce positive energy balance with an energy ratio between 2.27 and 4.81, and with a net energy production of 112 GJ ha-1y-1. With the exception of a few studies, most conclude that palm oil biodiesel is a net emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). The origin of oil palm plantation (planted area) is the foremost determinant of GHG emissions and C payback time (CPBT). Converting peatland forest results in GHG emissions up to 60 tons CO2equivalent (eq) ha-1y-1 leading to 420 years of CPBT. In contrast, converting degraded land or grassland for plantation can positively offset the system to become a net sequester of 5 tons CO2eq ha-1y-1. Few studies have discussed cradle-to-grave environmental impacts such as acidification, eutrophication, toxicity, and biodiversity, which open opportunity for further studies.

AB PurposeIn Italy, composting olive mill waste has become a common practice, since it mitigates the environmental problems associated with spreading the waste on land. Compost can be used to prepare growth media for plant nursery cultivation as a substitute for peat, a non-renewable resource whose extraction has long raised environmental concerns. Here, we investigate two common composting proceduresopen windrow and static-pile in gas-permeable bagsand compare them to evaluate their environmental impact.MethodsWe perform a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) in accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044. The LCA considers carbon storage in the soil after 100years, fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the impacts avoided by substituting for peat. We use cumulative energy demand, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, and eutrophication potential indicators in a contribution analysis and explore how the re-use of olive pits for energy production and reduction of commercial fertilizers improves the environmental balance. We also present a scenario analysis that indicates how parameter fluctuations affect the results.Results and discussionOur study shows that peat's impacts can be significantly reduced from 1162.3 to96.3kg CO2-eq/Mg for open windrow compost or 43.1kg CO2-eq/Mg for static-pile compost in gas-permeable bags. For static-pile composting, the lack of volatile organic compound and ammonia emissions and the detection of oxygen concentrations above 12% vol. suggest fully aerobic conditions. Fugitive greenhouse gas emissions were the most important contributions to the GWP. In the contribution analysis for static-pile composting, the avoidance of compost spreading and the carbon storage effect (due to compost usage) contributed 54% of the overall impacts to GWP and between 21 and 45% to the other indicators.ConclusionsThis LCA study illustrates how horticulturists can improve their resource management practices by recycling olive mill waste materials. Proper management of composting unit aeration can reduce fugitive GHG emissions.

AB Upland blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Read.) requires acidic and organic matter rich soils for its cultivation. Recently, the raised bed cultivation system has widely been used for blueberry cultivation, but it has a potential to cause nitrogen (N) losses via leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission especially with high rate of N application. We investigated the effects of organic amendments on N losses; via leaching ammonium ([image omitted]) and nitrate ([image omitted]) and N2O emission under acid soil conditions. The treatments were (i) ammonium sulfate application (AS), (ii) AS with peat moss (AS + PM), and (iii) AS with sawdust compost (AS + SD). A container (surface area: 47 cm x 40 cm = 0.188 m2) experiment to simulate raised bed cultivation system using an ochric Cambisol was conducted at Chiba University, Japan, during 2008 and 2009. A blueberry plant in each container received N fertilizer three times: 14.8, 23.8, and 14.8 g N m-2 in July 2008, March, and July 2009, respectively. Incorporation of peat moss and sawdust compost with ferrous sulfate effectively decreased soil pH to its optimal ranges (4.0-5.2) and resulted in increased growth and yield of blueberry (berry yield of 2009: 93, 285, and 348 g plant-1 in AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD treatment, respectively) due to increased soil porosity and consequently enhanced plant root biomass. Concurrently, the AS + SD treatment resulted in the least N losses, followed by AS + PM and AS treatment both through leaching and N2O emission. The emitted N2O amount over about two-year blueberry cultivation were 1.28, 0.80, and 0.58 g N m-2 for AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD treatments, respectively. These results indicated that application of organic amendments decreased N losses to the environment most likely due to increased plant N uptake, microbial N immobilization, and consequent reduction in nitrification, denitrification, and leaching.

AB The main objective of this life cycle assessment (LCA) study is to determine the environmental consequences of the inclusion of second-generation biofuels (bioethanol from palm oil biomass) toward current palm oil biodiesel production through a 'seed-to-wheel' LCA analysis. Their energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission indicators are evaluated with consequential approach for system delimitation. Although all scenarios provide positive environmental impact, it is found that the inclusion of bioethanol production in the current palm oil processing will decrease the net energy ratio (NER) and net carbon emission ratio (NCER) values by 27.5% and 66.6%, respectively. Moreover, carbon emission savings (CES) value is also found to decrease by a total of 21.9%. This indicates that a higher amount of energy input and GHG emissions is actually required for the bioethanol processing than the amount of energy it will produce and the GHG from fossil fuels it will displace. The sensitivity analysis performed on the yields of bioethanol shows that the minimum conversion threshold should be larger than 60% in order to have a higher energy and GHG emission ratio than current palm oil biodiesel processing. Sensitivity analysis on direct land use change and waste-water treatment is also carried out which discourages the expansion of palm oil plantation to primary forest (including peatland) and emphasizes the need for a biogas harvesting system.

AB The primary objective of this study was to clarify the influence of crop plants on atmospheric methane (CH4) in an agriculture-dominated landscape in the Upper Midwest of the United States. Measurements were carried out at two contrasting scales. At the plant scale, CH4 fluxes from soybean and corn plants were measured with a laser-based plant chamber system. At the landscape scale, the land surface flux was estimated with a modified Bowen ratio technique using measurements made on a tall tower. The chamber data revealed a diurnal pattern for the plant CH4 flux: it was positive (an emission rate of 0.4 +/- 0.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1), average of soybean and corn, in reference to the unit ground area) during the day, and negative (an uptake rate of -0.8 +/- 0.8 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) during the night. At the landscape scale, the flux was estimated to be 14.8 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at night and highly uncertain during the day, but the available references and the flux estimates from the equilibrium methods suggested that the CH4 flux during the entire observation period was similar to the estimated nighttime flux. Thus, soybean and corn plants have a negligible role in the landscape-scale CH4 budget.

AB Agro-economic modeling studies have shown that indirect land-use change (iLUC) emissions of first-generation biofuels can be significant, reducing or eliminating the climate change mitigating potential of these fuels. Recognizing this, proposed amendments to the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) would require reporting iLUC emissions of biofuels. The objective of this paper was to provide additional evidence of the iLUC emissions of oilseed rape (OSR) biodiesel using a noneconomic modeling approach called the causal descriptive (CD) model. The CD model originally developed by E4tech (A Causal Descriptive Approach to Modelling the GHG Emissions Associated with the Indirect Land Use Impacts of Biofuels, 2010, E4tech, London, UK) is one of the first noneconomic modeling approaches used for estimating indirect land-use change (iLUC). Using the E4tech CD modeling framework, we refine assumptions for key parameters such as yields in marginal land, displacement of OSR oil by palm oil, land availability for OSR expansion in the EU, imports of OSR from Canada and Ukraine, and palm oil expansion on peatland and thereby estimate iLUC GHG emissions for a likely scenario (Central Scenario). We find GHG emissions of OSR biodiesel to be 57g CO2 eq./MJ for the Central Scenario. To capture the possible range of iLUC GHG emissions, we calculate iLUC GHG emissions by changing assumptions for the Central Scenario and land-use emission factors. We find that GHG emissions of OSR biodiesel may vary from 18 to 101 CO2 eq./MJ. The results provide additional evidence supporting the previous conclusions derived from agro-economic modeling studies that iLUC emissions of food-based biofuels can be expected to be significant compared to potential savings. Hence, to achieve meaningful GHG reductions from biofuel use and avoid policy failure, it is important that the EU should take concrete policy action to target support for biofuels toward those with the lowest expected iLUC emissions.

AB Robin Matthews(+1) & George Dyer(1) Globally, deforestation and forest and peatland degradation account for approximately 15% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation Plus (REDD+) has been proposed as a cost-effective way of reducing this figure. However, while there has been much discussion on global institutional architectures required to channel international finance streams to individual countries, what has been largely missing from the debate so far has been how these benefits reaching the national level will be used to encourage change in behaviors at the local level. To devise appropriate policies to achieve this, it is necessary to understand the many factors that influence land use decisions, and also how they interact with each other and other sectors of the economy. In this paper, we discuss some of the frameworks and modeling approaches potentially suitable for analyzing the impacts of REDD+ benefits on reducing GHG emissions at subnational scales.

AB The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is a non-profit association promoting sustainable palm oil through a voluntary certification scheme. Two successive science-based working groups on greenhouse gas (GHG) were active in RSPO from 2009 to 2011, with the aim of identifying ways of achieving meaningful and verifiable reductions of GHG emissions. One of the outputs of the second group is PalmGHG, a GHG calculator using the life cycle assessment approach to quantify major sources of emissions and sequestration for individual palm oil mills and their supply base. A pilot study was carried out in 2011 with nine RSPO member companies that gave an average of 1.67 t CO(2)e/t crude palm oil (CPO), with a range of 0.02 to +8.32 t CO(2)e/t CPO. Previous land use and the area of peat soil used were the main causes of the variation. Further modifications to PalmGHG continue to be made in order to make the tool more flexible and comprehensive, to refine default values, and to render it more user-friendly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For soils with shallow groundwater and high organic carbon content, water table depth (WTD) is a key parameter to describe their hydrologic state and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Since the microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 satellite data might support the monitoring of these climate-relevant soils at high spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) by detecting spatial and temporal changes in local field and water management. Despite the low penetration depth of the C-band, sigma(0) is influenced by shallow WTD fluctuations via the soil hydraulic connection between the water table and surface soil. Here, we analyzed sigma(0) at 60 monitoring wells in a drained temperate peatland with degraded organic soils used as extensive grassland. We evaluated temporal Spearman correlation coefficients between sigma(0) and WTD considering the soil and vegetation information. To account for the effects of seasonal vegetation changes, we used the cross-over (incidence) angle method. Climatologies of the slope of the incidence angle dependency derived from two years of Sentinel-1 data and their application to the cross-over angle method did improve correlations, though the effect was minor. Overall, averaged over all sites, a temporal Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.45 (+/- 0.17) was obtained. The loss of correlation during summer (higher vegetation, deeper WTD) and the effects of cuts and grazing are discussed. The site-specific general wetness level, described by the mean WTD of each site was shown to be a major factor controlling the strength of the correlation. Mean WTD deeper than about -0.60 m lowered the correlations across sites, which might indicate an important limit of the application.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are highly variable in time, with high peak emissions lasting a few days to several weeks and low background emissions. This temporal variability is poorly understood which hampers the simulation of daily N2O emissions. In structured soils, like clay and peat, aggregates hamper the diffusion of oxygen, which leads to anaerobic microsites in the soil, favourable for denitrification. Diffusion of N2O out of the aggregates is also hampered, which leads to delayed emissions and increased reduction of N2O to N-2. In this model simulation study we investigate the effect of aggregates in soils on the N2O emissions. We present a parameterization to simulate the effects of aggregates on N2O production by denitrification and on N2O reduction. The parameterization is based on the mobile-immobile model concept. It was implemented in a field-scale hydrological-biogeochemical model combination. We compared the simulated fluxes with observed fluxes from a fertilized and drained peat soil under grass.
   The results of this study show that aggregates strongly affect the simulated N2O emissions: peak emissions are lower, whereas the background emissions are slightly higher. Including the effect of aggregates caused a 40% decrease in the simulated annual emissions relative to the simulations without accounting for the effects of aggregates. The new parameterization significantly improved the model performance regarding simulation of observed daily N2O fluxes; r(2) and RMSE improved from 0.11 and 198 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) to 0.41 and 40 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Our analyses of the model results show that aggregates have a larger impact on the reduction than on the production of N2O. Reduction of N2O is more sensitive to changes in the drivers than production of N2O and is in that sense the key to understanding N2O emissions from denitrification. The effects of changing environmental conditions on reduction of N2O relative to N2O production strongly depend on the NO3 content of the soil. More anaerobic conditions have hardly any effect on the ratio of production to reduction if NO3 is abundant, but will decrease this ratio if NO3 is limiting. In the first case the emissions will increase, whereas in the second case the emissions will decrease. This study suggests that the current knowledge of the hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes may be sufficient to understand the observed N2O fluxes from a fertilized clayey peatland. Further research is needed to test how aggregates affect the N2O fluxes from other soils or soils with different fertilization regimes.

AB Ponds and lakes are widespread across the rapidly changing permafrost environments. Aquatic systems play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges between terrestrial systems and the atmosphere. The source, speciation and emission rate of carbon released from permafrost landscapes are strongly influenced by local conditions, hindering pan-Arctic generalizations. This study reports on GHG ages and emission rates from aquatic systems located on Bylot Island, in the continuous permafrost zone of the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Dissolved and ebullition gas samples were collected during the summer season from different types of water bodies located in a highly dynamic periglacial valley: polygonal ponds, collapsed ice-wedge trough ponds, and larger lakes. The results showed strikingly different ages and fluxes depending on aquatic system types. Polygonal ponds were net sinks of dissolved CO2, but variable sources of dissolved CH4. They presented the highest ebullition fluxes, 1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher than from other ponds and lakes. Trough ponds appeared as substantial GHG sources, especially when their edges were actively eroding. Both types of ponds produced modern to hundreds of years old (<550 yr BP) GHG, even if trough ponds could contain much older carbon (>2000 yr BP) derived from freshly eroded peat. Lakes had small dissolved and ebullition fluxes, however they released much older GHG, including millennium-old CH4 (up to 3500 yr BP) from lake central areas. Acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated at all study sites and there was minimal, if any, methane oxidation in gas emitted through ebullition. These findings provide new insights on GHG emissions by permafrost aquatic systems and their potential positive feedback effect on climate.

AB Climate change could alter terrestrial ecosystems, which are important sources and sinks of the potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), in ways that either stimulate or decrease the magnitude and duration of global warming. Using manipulative field experiments, we assessed how N2O and CH4 soil fluxes responded to a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and to increased air temperature. Nitrous oxide and CH4 responses varied greatly among studied ecosystems. Elevated CO2 often stimulated N2O emissions in fertilized systems and CH4 emissions in wetlands, peatlands, and rice paddy fields; both effects were stronger in clayey soils than in sandy upland soils. Elevated temperature, however, impacted N2O and CH4 emissions inconsistently. Thus, the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on N2O and CH4 emissions may further enhance global warming, but it remains unclear whether increased temperature generates positive or negative feedbacks on these GHGs in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB In a 338-d microcosm incubation experiment, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and bacterial diversity were studied in a clayey soil amended with 5% (w/w) biochar in the presence or absence of 4% (w/w) peat- and shrimp-based compost used as an additional C source. Two maple biochars produced at 400 degrees C (M400) or 700 degrees C (M700) and pine chips produced at 700 degrees C (P700) were tested. In comparison with soil supplemented or not with compost, the addition of any biochar resulted in lower total cumulative N2O emission (90% to 97%). The low porosity of M400 and M700 increased soil anaerobic conditions and resulted in higher total cumulative CH4 emission compared to the other soil treatments. In addition, the lowest total cumulative CO2 emission was observed with M700, probably due to its low-priming effect on native soil C decomposition. In all treatments, compost addition had the highest impact on both soil bacterial richness and community composition, particularly on bacteria of the class Anaerolineae. At day 338, results showed that modification of soil properties by maple biochars reduced bacterial diversity and induced shifts in the taxonomic composition of their community. In fact, heterotrophic bacteria involved in denitrification, such as genera Haliangium, Hyphomicrobium, Opititus, and Pedomicrobium, increased in abundance in response to the amendment with maple biochars. We conclude that the nature of biochar feedstock can impact soil bacterial diversity by changing soil physicochemical properties, thus influencing C dynamics, porosity, and pH, and by mitigating total cumulative GHG emissions.

AB Temperate grasslands on organic soils are diverse due to edaphic properties but also to regional management practices and this heterogeneity is reflected in the wide range of greenhouse gas (GHG) flux values reported in the literature. In Ireland, most grasslands on organic soils were drained several decades ago and are managed as extensive pastures with little or no fertilisation. This study describes a 2-year study of the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of two such sites. We determined GHG fluxes and waterborne carbon (C) emissions in a nutrient-rich grassland and compared it with values measured from two nutrient-poor organic soils: a deep-drained and a shallow-drained site. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were determined using the chamber technique, and fluvial C fluxes were estimated by combining drainage water concentrations and flows.
   The nutrient-rich site was an annual source of CO2 (233 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), CH4 neutral, and a small source of N2O (0.16 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at the shallow-drained nutrient-poor site was -89 and -99 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Years 1 and 2 respectively, and NEE at the deep-drained nutrient-poor site was 85 and -26 g C m(-2) yr(-1) respectively. Low CH4 emissions (1.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) were recorded at the shallow-drained nutrient-poor site. Fluvial exports from the nutrient-rich site totalled 69.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with 54% as dissolved organic C. Waterborne C losses from the nutrient-poor site reflected differences in annual runoff totalling 44 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 30.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 2.
   The NECB of the nutrient-rich grassland was 663 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with biomass exports being the major component accounting for 53 %. The NECB of the nutrient-poor deep-drained site was less than half of the nutrient-rich site (2-year mean 267 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Although NEE at the nutrient-poor shallow-drained site was negative in both years, high biomass export meant it was a net C source (2-year mean NECB 103 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). While the impacts of the nutrient and drainage status on NEE, biomass exports and fluvial C losses were confirmed, inter-regional differences in management practice and climate were also significant factors which impacted on the overall NECB of these ecosystems. Contrary to expectation, the NECB of nutrient-poor drained organic soils under grasslands is not necessarily a large C source and this has implications for Ireland's choice of national GHG inventory reporting methodologies. This study can also aid the development of strategies to deliver reduced emissions tailored to local grassland types.

AB Alpine wetlands are an important natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, the temporal variations and main driving factors of CH4 fluxes in alpine wetlands are not yet well understood. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured from an alpine wetland in the Qinghai Lake using eddy covariance (EC) technique. Strong seasonal variability in the daily CH4 fluxes was observed, ranging from - 18.24 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the non-growing season to 117.44 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the growing season in 2017. The annual CH4 budget was 9.41 g CH4 m(- 2). The growing season CH4 flux accounted for 91.5 % of the annual budget. At the daily scale, the CH4 fluxes increased significantly as the net radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at 5 cm depth increased. Additionally, correlation analysis also revealed that daily CH4 flux was significantly related to CO2 flux when daily CO2 flux was negative, but there was no correlation when daily CO2 flux was positive. Path analysis showed that seasonal variations of soil temperature at 5 cm depth and CO2 flux had strong direct effects on daily CH4 fluxes.

AB Soil respiration (R-s) is the largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) next to photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems. With the absorption of atmospheric methane (CH4), upland soils become a large CO2 source and CH4 sink. These soil carbon (C) fluxes are key factors in the mitigation and adaption of future climate change. The Asian region spans an extensive area from the northern boreal to tropical regions in Southeast Asia. As this region is characterised by highly diverse ecosystems, it is expected to experience the strong impact of ecosystem responses to global climate change. For the past two decades, researchers in the AsiaFlux community have meaningfully contributed to improve the current understanding of soil C dynamics, response of soil C fluxes to disturbances and climate change, and regional and global estimation based on model analysis. This review focuses on five important aspects: 1) the historical methodology for soil C flux measurement; 2) responses of soil C flux components to environmental factors; 3) soil C fluxes in typical ecosystems in Asia; 4) the influence of disturbance and climate change on soil C fluxes; and 5) model analysis and the estimation of soil C fluxes in research largely focused in Asia.

AB Grassland is a land cover in the area of conflict between agriculture and conservation, where intensification of land use is a major threat to grassland biodiversity. Grassland use intensity is a key factor for the conservation value of grassland, and detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed to improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A new remote sensing-based approach using multi-temporal high resolution RapidEye satellite data was developed in the present study that makes a large-scale assessment of grassland use intensity possible. RapidEye is a constellation of five satellites with 6.5 m spatial resolution, which allows frequent and timely image acquisition targeted at specific growing seasons. Semi-natural grassland, extensively used grassland, intensively used grassland and tilled grassland could be reliably differentiated at the management plot level in a study area in southern Germany. Various combinations of images from different observation dates have been tested as classification input and their overall classification accuracies were validated by field data. Best results were achieved using a combination of five multi-temporal scenes with an overall accuracy of 85.7%. A three-scene combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 82.2%. The analysis showed that seasonal aspects are very important when selecting adequate observation dates. Grassland use intensity was also assessed on peatlands using a peat soil map, since land use intensity significantly affects greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. The results demonstrate the potential of targeted multi-spectral, high spatial resolution remote sensing for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic habitats, which is of vital importance to support various environmental conservation schemes through improved monitoring and reporting capabilities.

AB The objectives of this study were to test the effects of soil temperature, flooding, and raw organic matter input on N2O emissions in a soil sampled at Hongze Lake wetland, Jiangsu Province, China. The treatments studied were-peat soil (I), peat soil under flooding (II), peat soil plus raw organic matter (III), and peat soil under flooding plus organic matter. These four treatments were incubated at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The result showed that temperature increase could enhance N2O emissions rate and cumulative emissions significantly; moreover, the flooded soil with external organic matter inputs showed the lowest cumulative rise in N2O emissions due to temperature increment. Flooding might inhibit soil N2O emissions, and the inhibition was more pronounced after organic matter addition to the original soil. Conversely, organic matter input explained lower cumulative N2O emissions under flooding. Our results suggest that complex interactions between flooding and other environmental factors might appear in soil N2O emissions. Further studies are needed to understand potential synergies or antagonisms between environmental factors that control N2O emissions in wetland soils.

AB Shallow fresh water bodies in peat areas are important contributors to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. In this study we determined the magnitude of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from 12 water bodies in Dutch wetlands during the summer season and studied the factors that might regulate emissions of CH4 and CO2 from these lakes and ditches. The lakes and ditches acted as CO2 and CH4 sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1 +/- A 8.2 (mean +/- A SE) and 61.5 +/- A 7.1 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CO2 and 33.7 +/- A 9.3 and 3.9 +/- A 1.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87% of the variation in CH4 could be explained by PO4 (3-) concentration in the sediment and Fe2+ concentration in the water, and 89% of the CO2 flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these water bodies.

AB Wetlands are predicted to experience lowered water tables due to permafrost degradation in the Tibetan Plateau. These changes may affect carbon cycle processes such as soil respiration (R-s). However, the magnitude, patterns and controls of R-s remain poorly understood in alpine wetlands with their distinct hydrological regimes. Here, we conducted a field study on R-s from 2012 to 2014 in three alpine ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau-fen, wet meadow and meadow-with soil water decreases along hydrological gradients. From 2012 to 2014, the annual R-s was 128.9-193.3 g C m(-2)yr(-1), 281.5-342.9 g C m(-2)yr(-1), and 663.4-709.1 g C m(-2)yr(-1) for the fen, wet meadow, and meadow, respectively. An abrupt increase in CO2 emissions was caused by the spring thawing of the frozen soil in the fen and wet meadow, contributing 20.4-37.6% and 13.2-17.4%, respectively, to the annual R-s. The diurnal variation in the R-s was site specific among the three ecosystems, with one peak at 1300 h in the fen and meadow and two peaks at 1300 h and 1900 h in the wet meadow. The temperature-independent components of the diurnal variation in R-s were generally explained by photosynthetically active radiation in the fen and wet meadow, but not in the meadow. The temperature sensitivity of the R-s (unconfounded Q(10)) varied significantly among the three ecosystems, with the highest values occurring in the wet meadow, implying that permafrost thaw-induced wetland drying from the fen to the wet meadow could enhance the response of CO2 emissions to climate warming but that further drying from the wet meadow to the meadow probably weakens the effect of warming on the R-s. Our study emphasized the important role of the hydrological regime in regulating the temporal variation in R-s and its response to climate warming.

AB The effects of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under low (10 cm below soil surface) and high (at soil surface) water tables were investigated in the laboratory. Undisturbed soil columns from the alpine peatland of the Tibetan Plateau were analyzed. CH4 emission was higher and N2O emission was lower at the high water table than those at the low water table regardless of nutrient application. Addition of N (NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), 5 g N m(-2)) decreased CH4 emission up to 57% and 50% at low and high water tables, respectively, but correspondingly increased N2O emission by 2.5 and 10.4 times. Addition of S (Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate), 2.5 g S m(-2)) decreased CH4 and N2O emission by 64% and 79% at the low water table, respectively, but had a slightly positive effect at the high water table. These results indicated that the responses of CH4 and N2O emissions to the S deposition depend on the water table condition in the high-altitude peatland.

AB A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was used to identify the processes and stages in organic waste composting that have the largest environmental impacts. The LCA included impacts associated with the collection of feedstock, production and distribution of compost, and its use as a replacement for peat for soil conditioning. The use phase of the compost product has not been included in previous LCA studies in the United States. Nine LCA impact categories were analyzed (global warming potential, ozone depletion, smog, acidification, eutrophication, carcinogens, non-carcinogens, respiratory effects, and ecotoxicity) using TRACI 2 methodology.
   The functional unit was defined as the collection, processing, transportation, and application of one tonne of compost that meets USEPA composting standards. The compost was produced at the Organics Material Processing and Education Center (OMPEC) at The Pennsylvania State University. The data used in the assessment was collected from seven composting windrows over thirteen consecutive months (December 2010 January 2012). Given the wide range of decomposition emission factors reported in the literature for methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3), three emission scenarios were calculated: average, minimum, and maximum emission scenarios. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the compost were considered biogenic and not included in the assessment.
   For all scenarios, compost processing was the stage with the largest environmental impact, with decomposition emissions contributing the most to global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication impact categories under the average and maximum emissions scenarios. To account for the avoided environmental impacts of peat mining and transport, these values were subtracted from the composting life cycle. The avoided impacts from peat replacement were higher than the impacts from composting for all categories, illustrating that using compost instead of peat results in net environmental gains. This study highlights the importance of minimizing life cycle impacts associated with CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions during the decomposition process and the need for more consensus in the literature on emission values from composting processing.

AB Extensively grazed grasslands are understudied in terms of their contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock production. Mountains, moorlands and heath occupy 18% of the UK land area, however, in situ studies providing high frequency N2O emissions from sheep urine deposited to such areas arc lacking. Organic soils typical of these regions may provide substrates for denitrification-related N2O emissions, however, acidic and anoxic conditions may inhibit nitrification (and associated emissions from nitrification and denitrification). We hypothesised urine N2O-N emission factors (EFs) would be lower than the UK country-specific and IPCC default value for urine, which is based on lowland measurements. Using automated GHG sampling chambers, N2O emissions were determined from real sheep urine (930 kg N ha(-1)) and artificial urine (920 kg N ha(-1)) applied in summer, and from an artificial urine treatment (1120 kg N ha(-1)) and a combined NO3- and glucose treatment (106 kg N ha(-1); 213 kg C ha(-1)) in autumn. The latter treatment provided an assessment of the soils capacity for denitrification under non -substrate limiting conditions. The artificial urine-N2O EF was 0.01 +/- 0.00% of the N applied in summer and 0.00 +/- 0.00% of the N applied in autumn. The N2O EF for real sheep urine applied in summer was 0.01 +/- 0.02% A higher flux was observed in only one replicate of the real urine treatment, relating to one chamber where an increase in soil solution NO3- was observed. No lag phase in N2O emission was evident following application of the NO3- and glucose treatment, which emitted 0.69 +/- 0.15% of the N applied. This indicates nitrification rates are the bottle-neck for N2O emissions in upland organic soils. We calculated the potential impact of using hill-grazing specific urine N2O EFs on the UK inventory of N2O emissions from sheep excreta, and found a reduction of ca. 435 in comparison to the use of a country-specific excretal EF.

AB Wetlands are the largest natural sources for atmospheric methane (CH4). In wetlands with permanent shallow inundation, the seasonal variation of CH4 exchange is mainly controlled by temperature and phenology. In addition, ecosystem CH4 exchange varies considerably on smaller temporal scales such as days or weeks. Several single processes that control CH4 emissions on the local soil-plant-atmosphere continuum are well investigated, but their interaction on ecosystem level is not well understood yet. We applied wavelet analysis to a quasi-continuous eddy covariance CH4 flux time series to describe the temporal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange within the growing season of a permanently inundated temperate fen. Moreover, we addressed time scale-specific controls and investigated whether their impact changes during the course of the growing season.
   On large time scales of two weeks to three months, temperature explained most of the variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange. In general, the temperature in the shallow water column had the largest impact as explanatory variable, however, air temperature and soil temperature became increasingly important as explanatory variables when water level dropped slightly up to June. The diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange shifted during the course of the growing season: During a short time period at the end of April, plant activity (expressed by canopy photosynthesis) caused a diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange with peak time around noon. In the following weeks, the daily cycle of convective mixing within the water column (expressed by the water temperature gradient) gradually gained importance and caused high night-time CH4 emissions, thereby levelling off the diurnal CH4 emission pattern. Moreover, shear-induced turbulence caused short-term fluctuations of ecosystem CH4 exchange on time scales up to two hours.
   Our study highlights the need for multi-scale approaches that consider the non-stationarity of the underlying processes to adequately describe the complexity of ecosystem CH4 exchange. Moreover, we show that CH4 release processes such as convective mixing of the water column which have been mainly considered for aquatic ecosystems (see recent exceptions in Godwin et al., 2013; Poindexter and Variano, 2013) might also be of importance in shallowly flooded terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Flux measurements of reactive nitrogen compounds are of increasing importance to assess the impact of unintended emissions on sensitive ecosystems and to evaluate the efficiency of mitigation strategies. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the exchange of reactive nitrogen gases with the highest possible accuracy. This study gives insight into the performance of flux correction methods and their usability for reactive nitrogen gases. The eddy-covariance (EC) technique is today widely used in experimental field studies to measure land surface-atmosphere exchange of a variety of trace gases. In recent years, applying the EC technique to reactive nitrogen compounds has become more important since atmospheric nitrogen deposition influences the productivity and biodiversity of (semi)natural ecosystems and their carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. Fluxes, which are calculated by EC, have to be corrected for setup-specific effects like attenuation in the high-frequency range. However, common methods for correcting such flux losses are mainly optimized for inert greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane or water vapor. In this study, we applied a selection of correction methods to measurements of total reactive nitrogen (Sigma N-r) conducted in different ecosystems using the Total Reactive Atmospheric Nitrogen Converter (TRANC) coupled to a chemiluminescence detector (CLD). Average flux losses calculated by methods using measured cospectra and ogives were approximately 26 %-38% for a seminatural peatland and about 16 %-22% for a mixed forest. The investigation of the different methods showed that damping factors calculated with measured heat and gas flux cospectra using an empirical spectral transfer function were most reliable. Flux losses of Sigma N-r with this method were on the upper end of the median damping range, i.e., 38% for the peatland site and 22% for the forest site. Using modified Kaimal cospectra for damping estimation worked well for the forest site but underestimated damping for the peatland site by about 12 %. Correction factors of methods based on power spectra or on site-specific and instrumental parameters were mostly below 10 %. Power spectra of Sigma N-r were heavily affected - likely by white noise - and deviated substantially at lower frequencies from the respective temperature (power) spectra. Our study supports the use of an empirical method for estimating flux losses of Sigma N-r or any reactive nitrogen compound and the use of locally measured cospectra.

AB Since each greenhouse gas (GHG) has its own radiative capacity, all three gasses (CO2, CH4 and N2O) must be accounted for by calculating the net global warming potential (GWP) in a crop production system. To compare the impact of GHG fluxes from the rice growing and the fallow season on the annual gas fluxes, and their contribution to the GWP and carbon sequestration (CS) were evaluated. From May to April in Bibai (43 degrees 18 ' N, 141 degrees 44 ' E), in central Hokkaido, Japan, three rice paddy fields under actual management conditions were investigated to determine CS and the contribution of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes to GWP. Methane and N2O fluxes were measured by placing the chamber over the rice plants covering four hills and CO2 fluxes from rice plants root free space in paddy fields were taken as an indicator of soil microbial respiration (R-m) using the closed chamber method. Soil CS was calculated as the difference between net primary production (NPP) and loss of carbon (C) through R-m, emission of CH4 and harvest of crop C. Annual cumulative R-m ranged from 422 to 519 g C m(-2) yr(-1); which accounted for 54.7 to 55.5% of the rice growing season in particular. Annual cumulative CH4 emissions ranged from 75.5 to 116 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and this contribution occurred entirely during the rice growing period. Total cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.091 to 0.154 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and from 73.5 to 81.3% of the total N2O emissions recorded during the winter-fallow season. The CS ranged from -305 to -365 g C m(-2) yr(-1), suggesting that C input by NPP may not be compensate for the loss of soil C. The loss of C in the winter-fallow season was much higher (62 to 66%) than in the growing season. The annual net GWP from the investigated paddy fields ranged from 3823 to 5016 g CO2 equivalent m(-2) yr(-1). Annual GWP(CH4) accounted for 71.9 to 86.1% of the annual net GWP predominantly from the rice growing period. These results indicate that CH4 dominated the net GWP of the rice paddy.

AB Methane and carbon dioxide fluxes were quantified for 14 ditches and larger water bodies in Dutch peatlands, surrounded by different habitat types, using concentration changes in floating flux chambers. Average fluxes from these waters were 11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SE) mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (n = 66) and 86 +/- 21 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) (n = 55). Variability among water bodies was substantial in both gases and could be explained by water depth and surrounding habitat. Ditches in intensively used dairy land or rough pastures had significantly higher CH4 emission rates (17 +/- 6 and 18 +/- 8 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) than those in reed and sedge beds or open water (7 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Bubbles contributed between 34 and 69% to the total CH4 flux, with higher proportions observed in ditches sheltered by tall vegetation. Observed day-time CO2 fluxes were either positive (shaded ditches in reed and sedge stands or rough pasture; 120-150 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) or did not differ from zero (open water, ditches in intensively managed pasture). Since these peatlands have substantial areas of permanent surface water (6-43%), landscape-scale carbon flux estimates are improved by incorporating specific flux estimates for these waters.

AB Nitrous oxide is an important greenhouse gas and its origin and fate are thus of broad interest. Most studies on emissions of nitrous oxide from soils focused on fluxes between soil and atmosphere and hence represent an integration of physical and biological processes at different depths of a soil profile. Analysis of N2O concentration and isotope signature along soil profiles was suggested to improve the localisation of sources and sinks in soils as well as underlying processes and could therefore extend our knowledge on processes affecting surface N2O fluxes. Such a mechanistic understanding would be desirable to improve N2O mitigation strategies and global N2O budgets. To investigate N2O dynamics within soil profiles of two contrasting (semi)natural ecosystem types (a temperate acidic fen and a Norway spruce forest), soil gas samplers were constructed to meet the different requirements of a water-saturated and an unsaturated soil, respectively. The samplers were installed in three replicates and allowed soil gas sampling from six different soil depths. We analysed soil air for N2O concentration and isotope composition and calculated N2O net turnover using a mass balance approach and considering diffusive fluxes. At the fen site, N2O was mainly produced in 30-50cm soil depth. Diffusion to adjacent layers above and below indicated N2O consumption. Values of 15N and 18O of N2O in the fen soil were always linearly correlated and their qualitative changes within the profile corresponded with the calculated turnover processes, suggesting further reduction of N2O. In the spruce forest, highest N2O production occurred in the topsoil, but there was also notable production occurring in the subsoil at a depth of 70cm. Changes in N2O isotope composition as to be expected from local production and consumption processes within the soil profile did hardly occur, though. This was presumably caused by high diffusive fluxes and comparatively low net turnover, as isotope signatures approached values measured for ambient N2O towards the topsoil. Our results demonstrate a highly variable influence of diffusive versus production/consumption processes on N2O concentration and isotope composition, depending on the type of ecosystem. This finding indicates the necessity of further N2O concentration and isotope profile investigations in different types of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems in order to generalise our mechanistic understanding of N2O exchange between soil and atmosphere.

AB The majority of operational liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling stations in the world have no boil-off gas (BOG) management and rely on regular LNG delivery to condense the BOG. To reduce the pressure of LNG tanks onboard vehicles prior to filling, the BOG is vented to the atmosphere, is collapsed in the tank, or is returned to the refueling station. In this study, different onboard LNG tank architectures are discussed, and the design strategies for LNG conditioning and BOG management technologies employed in LNG refueling stations are analyzed. The critical analysis of different designs of LNG refueling stations indicates that 44% of designs have no BOG management, 28% of designs rely on liquid nitrogen condenser or a liquefier to condense the BOG, and 28% of designs compress the BOG to produce compressed natural gas. Our research shows that in China and the U.S., where stations with BOG management are rare, the number of LNG refueling stations has increased by 32 and 3 times, respectively, between 2010 and 2015. This study highlights the fact that as heavy fuel oil and diesel ate replaced by LNG, it is critical to pay proper attention to the design of the LNG supply chain and LNG refueling stations to minimize or eliminate BOG venting and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Freezing-thawing in mid-high latitudes is an important factor controlling nutrient dynamics. We transplanted peatland columns (TQ) and freshwater marsh columns (SJ) in different latitudes into south seasonal frozen regions to determine the responses of greenhouse gas emissions from different wetlands to the freezing-thawing under climate warming. The decrease in CO2 and CH4 emissions during freezing stage were interrupted by a short emission peak. While N2O uptake rate reduced with decreasing temperature. In the thawing stage, all the three greenhouse gases exhibited emission peaks. CO2 were 159.83 mg m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 86.83 mg m(-2) h(-1) (SJ); CH4 were 1.32 mg m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 4.07 mg m(-2) h(-1) (SJ); N2O were 72.14 ug m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 22.15 ug m(-2) h(-1) (SJ). Meanwhile, N2O transferred from sink into source. With temperature increase, the emission rate of CO2 increased fast, while CH4 and N2O decreased. CO2 emission during freezing-thawing periods was significantly correlated with soil temperature and CH4 emission. Soil active organic carbon also played important roles in greenhouse gases emissions. Our study suggested that more greenhouse gases may release from wetlands into atmosphere in the context of global warming, and the potential release of CO2 and N2O during freezing-thawing periods was much higher in peatlands of permafrost zone.

AB The energy sector is the major contributor to GHG (greenhouse gas emissions) in Ireland. Under EU Renewable energy targets, Ireland must achieve contributions of 40%, 12% and 10% from renewables to electricity, heat and transport respectively by 2020, in addition to a 20% reduction in GHG emissions. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to carry out a comprehensive, holistic evaluation of biomass-to-energy systems in 2020 based on indigenous biomass supply chains optimised to reduce production and transportation GHG emissions. Impact categories assessed include; global warming, acidification, eutrophication potentials, and energy demand. Two biomass energy conversion technologies are considered; co-firing with peat, and biomass CHP (combined heat and power) systems. Biomass is allocated to each plant according to a supply optimisation model which ensures minimal GHG emissions. The study shows that while CHP systems produce lower environmental impacts than co-firing systems in isolation, determining overall environmental impacts requires analysis of the reference energy systems which are displaced. In addition, if the aims of these systems are to increase renewable energy penetration in line with the renewable electricity and renewable heat targets, the optimal scenario may not be the one which achieves the greatest environmental impact reductions.

AB A pre-requisite for denitrification and nitrification is the availability of inorganic nitrogen (N). In many natural ecosystems, atmospheric N deposition as well as moss-associated N-2 fixation are the main sources of 'new' N to the ecosystem N pool and could provide inorganic N to sustain N2O production. While a link between N-2 fixation and N2O emissions is plausible, hardly any attempts have been undertaken to test this link in areas with a moss dominated understory. Here, we report results from a combined field and laboratory study in which we assessed N-2 fixation, net N2O emission under different conditions, and potential nitrification and denitrification in three moss species from a Sphagnum-moss dominated, temperate bog. The three moss species were chosen to represent a gradient of N-2 fixation activity. Sphagnum mosses emitted less N2O than the other two moss species (Pleurozium schreberi, Hypnwn cupressiforme), but at the same time, showed the highest N-2 fixation activity. The lack of a link between N-2 fixation and net N2O emissions in three abundant and common moss species indicates that N transformation processes may be decoupled within the moss carpet. This raises new questions on N supply for N2O production and the fate of fixed N-2 in moss-dominated systems.

AB Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) is highly variable in semiarid ecosystems. After a period of drought, R-eco can jump to a high value in response to rain events, and afterward it decays exponentially with time. To better understand the timing, size, and duration of rain-induced respiration pulses, we examined 57 rain events from over 23 site-years of eddy covariance measurements at an open annual grassland, a woodland understory, and a peatland pasture in California, USA. To explain these findings, we conducted a factorial litter-watering experiment on grass and soil plots exposure to varying amounts of sunlight and water. To interpret and compare the population of rain-induced respiration pulses, we fitted the data with a two pool, 4-parameter exponential decay model.
   At the field scale, the total amounts of CO2 emission emanating from a single and sustained respiration pulse (mean+/-standard deviation) were 44.4+/-38.0, 24.2+/-17.8, and 94.6+/-45.8 gC m(-2) at the open grassland, the woodland understory, and the peatland pasture, respectively. The large variations in precipitation of these respiration-triggering rain events were associated with 73-84% of variation in the total amount of CO2 emission.
   Litter that experienced antecedent photodegradation tended to enhance respiration pulses. Biotic and abiotic processes involved in the dynamic of respiration pulses were pulse-specific, and we summarized them into two pulse scenarios. This study illustrates an emerging connection of ecosystem processes, and these findings may help to improve models on the dynamics of ecosystem CO2 cycling. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The contribution of potentially intense denitrification in the saturated zone of hydromorphic soils to atmospheric N2O levels is poorly understood because few data exist on shallow ground water N2O production, consumption and transport to the atmosphere. The objective of the present study was to investigate the contribution of the saturated zone to surface N2O emission for two fen soils and a Gleyic Luvisol with ground water tables at the surface during the experimental period. Total denitrification, denitrifier N2O production, ground water dissolved N-2 and/or N2O, and surface N2O emissions were measured in situ. Concentrations of dissolved gases and surface emissions were also simulated with a simple process-based model assuming measured rates of N(2)and N2O production or constant profiles of dissolved N2O concentration. NO3- and N2O were abundant in all samples of the three sites. Substantial N2O surface emission originating from the saturated zone was measured at both fen sites. Total denitrification ranged from 0.9 to 1.58 mg N l(-1) day(-1) in the 15 - 35-cm layer of the fen soils and from 0.005 to 0.13 mg N l(-1) day(-1) in the 50 - 100-cm layer of the Gleyic Luvisol. The ratio of N2O production to total denitrification ranged from 0.07 to 0.32 in the fen soils and from 0.06 to 0.08 in the Gleyic Luvisol. The ratio of N2O production to total denitrification ranged from 0.07 to 0.32, and from 0.06 to 0.08, respectively. Concentrations of dissolved N2O measured at the fen sites were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than simulated concentrations. In contrast, measured N2O emissions were within the order of magnitude of emissions simulated assuming measured N-2 and N2O production rates. The agreement between measured and simulated N2O concentrations and surface emissions was satisfactory when gas diffusivity was multiplied by 10 and N2O reduction rate was multiplied by 20 in the simulation. Simulation of diffusive N2O emission assuming constant values of measured N2O concentration profiles resulted in emissions approximately one order of magnitude lower than the measured values. At the Lake Creek site, the measured peak concentration of dissolved N-2 and the concentration simulated assuming measured values of N-2 production were relatively close with values of 2.4 and 3.5 times the atmospheric equilibrium concentration, respectively. It was concluded that the disagreements between measured and simulated values of N2O concentrations and emissions resulted from the underestimation of model parameters for gas transfer and/or for N2O reduction to N-2,which were not measured. Future modeling attempts should include use of measured values for all model parameters to obtain a more realistic description of the dynamics of N2O emission from the saturated zone.

To gain an understanding of the nitrosation chemistry on a molecular level, soil and aquatic humic substances were reacted with N-15-labeled NaNO2, and analyzed by liquid phase N-15 and UC nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) Pahokee peat and peat humic acid were also reacted with (NaNO2)-N-15 and analyzed by solid-state N-15 NMR. In Suwannee River, Armadale, and Laurentian fulvic acids, phenolic rings and activated methylene groups underwent nitrosation to form nitrosophenols (quinone monoximes) and ketoximes, respectively. The oximes underwent Beckmann rearrangements to 2 degrees amides, and Beckmann Fragmentations to nitriles. The nitriles in turn underwent hydrolysis to 1 degrees amides. Peaks tentatively identified as imine, indophenol, or azoxybenzene nitrogens were clearly present in spectra of samples nitrosated at pH 6 but diminished at pH 3. The N-15 NMR spectrum of the peat humic acid exhibited peaks corresponding with N-nitroso groups in addition to nitrosophenols, ketoximes, and secondary Beckmann reaction products. Formation of N-nitroso groups was more significant in the whole peat compared with the peat humic acid. Carbon-13 NMR analyses also indicated the occurrence of nitrosative demethoxylation in peat and soil humic acids. Reaction of N-15-NH3 fixated fulvic acid with unlabeled NO2- resulted in nitrosative deamination of aminohydroquinone N, suggesting a previously unrecognized pathway for production of N-2 gas in soils fertilized with NH3.

AB Organic-rich, eutrophic peat soils (Histosols) represent a major store of carbon (C) within the terrestrial biosphere. However, these soils are also highly susceptible to damage, particularly when used for intensive agricultural production. Sustainable management of such soils is contingent upon improved understanding of the impact of their management on the environment. In this context, we report the first annual budget of greenhouse gas emissions from temperate peat soils under intensive horticultural production. Fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured using static chambers on three farms along an organic matter loss gradient (similar to 20%, similar to 35%, and similar to 70% soil organic matter (SOM) content respectively), under a number of commercially important crops in similar rotations. Cumulative annual fluxes of CO2 in fallow and cropped soils were large and ranged from 13.0 +/- 2.4 to 30.9 +/- 2.5 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1), showing a general increase with SOM, and on cropped compared to bare soils. Annual emissions of N2O varied from 5.0 +/- 0.7 to 13.9 +/- 1.9 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1), and CH4 from 0.02 +/- 0.08 to 0.04 +/- 0.02 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1); neither showed a significant relationship with either SOM content or cropping. Distinct seasonal patterns of CO2 and N2O fluxes were observed, corresponding to significant correlations between emissions and soil and air temperature, soil moisture content, water table depth, and soil nitrate on some soil types. No discernible seasonal pattern in CH4 fluxes was observed, and very few significant correlations with soil environmental variables were found. Compared to emissions estimates suggested in IPCC inventory guidelines for cultivated peat soils, the observed emissions in this study were relatively high, and net annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are equivalent to a loss of soil depth of 0.33-0.75 cm y(-1). We conclude that arable farming is promoting extreme mineralization of the soil's organic carbon reserves and that a change in land use or management regime is needed to protect and preserve this natural capital.

AB An inventory was made to quantify the emission of the waterborne greenhouse gases CH4, N2O and CO2 from fresh surface waters and wetlands in the Netherlands. The aim of the study was to give an overview of the existing fluxes and balances and to quantify the role of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats in the total emissions of these gases in the Netherlands. The CO2 uptake of surface waters and wetlands turned out to be very low. Only 0.6% of the total annual CO2 emission from the Netherlands is absorbed by the ecosystems in these habitats. However, they are significant sources for N2O and CH4; respectively, 18% and 19% (including sewage treatment plants) of the total annual emission in the Netherlands. It is indicated that especially in the case of N2O and CH4 the reduction of the eutrophication will also reduce the output of these gases from the surface waters and the wetlands. However, attention should be paid to the operation of sewage treatment plants because reducing the discharge of nitrogen by extending the denitrification capacity could easily lead to more nitrous oxide release from these plants.

AB An experiment was conducted to study the impact of water logging and addition of organic amendments on green house gas (GHG) emissions in a saline soil. The treatments comprised of water levels maintained at three levels viz., complete saturation, 10 cm and 15 cm below the soil surface. Organic amendment at the rate of 7.5 t ha(-1) was added. Gas samples were collected at periodic intervals and analysed. The results revealed that CO2, N2O and C2H2 emissions were lower under a water logged condition and were found to be higher at water levels 10 cm / 15 cm below the soil surface. There was an increase in emissions from 100 to 400 mg kg(-1) at 7 days after incubation (DAI). Methane emission was found to be higher in completely saturated soil. Soils at 10 cm water level and amended with the organic material registered a higher value of soil microbial biomass - C of 1320 mg kg(-1). Emissions of GHG were enhanced with the addition of organic material. This suggests that lack of C substrate is the dominant limitation for GHG emissions on saline soil. Lower q CO2 values in water logged soils indicate low microbial activity.

AB A field lysimeter experiment was conducted over a 406 day period to determine the effect of different soil types on the fate of synthetic urinary nitrogen (N). Soil types included a sandy loam, silty loam, clay and peat. Synthetic urine was applied at 1000 kg N ha(-1), during a winter season, to intact soil cores in lysimeters. Leaching losses, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and plant uptake of N were monitored, with soil N-15 content determined upon destructive sampling of the lysimeters. Plant uptake of urine-N ranged from 21.6 to 31.4%. Soil type influenced timing and form of inorganic-N leaching. Macropore flow occurred in the structured silt and clay soils resulting in the leaching of urea. Ammonium (NH4+-N), nitrite (NO2--N) and nitrate (NO3--N) all occurred in the leachates with maximum concentrations, varying with soil, type and ranging from 2.3-31.4 mu g NH4+-N mL(-1), 2.4-35.6 mu g NO2--N mL(-1), and 62-102 mu g NO3--N mL(-1), respectively. Leachates from the peat and clay soils contained high concentrations of NO2--N. Gaseous losses of N2O were low (<2% of N applied) over a 112 day measurement period. An associated experiment showed the ratio of N-2-N:N2O-N ranged from 6.2 to 33.2. Unrecovered N-15 was presumed to have been lost predominantly as gaseous N-2. It is postulated that the high levels of NO2--N could have contributed to chemodenitrification mechanisms in the peat soil.

AB High Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions have been identified in hemiboreal forests in association with draining organic soils. However, the specific controlling factors that regulate the emissions remain unclear. To examine the importance of different factors affecting N2O emissions in a spruce forest on drained organic soil, a process-based model, CoupModel, was calibrated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method. The calibration also aims to estimate parameter density distributions, the covariance matrix of estimated parameters and the correlation between parameters and variables information, useful when applying the model on other peat soil sites and for further model improvements. The calibrated model reproduced most of the high resolution data (total net radiation, soil temperature, groundwater level, net ecosystem exchange, etc.) very well, as well as cumulative measured N2O emissions (simulated 8.7 +/- 1.1 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) (n =97); measured 8.7 +/- 2.7 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) (n = 6)), but did not capture every measured peak. Parameter uncertainties were reduced after calibration, in which 16 out of 20 parameters changed from uniform distributions into normal distributions or log normal distributions. Four parameters describing bypass water flow, oxygen diffusion and soil freezing changed significantly after calibration. Inter-connections and correlations between many calibrated parameters and variables reflect the complex and interrelated nature of pedosphere, biosphere and atmosphere interactions. This also highlights the need to calibrate a number of parameters simultaneously. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that N2O emissions during growing seasons are controlled by competition between plants and microbes for nitrogen, while during the winter season snow melt periods are important. Our results also indicate that N2O is mainly produced in the capillary fringe close to the groundwater table by denitrification in the anaerobic zone. We conclude that, in afforested drained peatlands, the plants and groundwater level have important influences on soil N availability, ultimately controlling N2O emissions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Soil-atmosphere fluxes of trace gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are determined by complex interactions between biological activity and soil conditions. Soil gas concentration profiles may, in combination with other information about soil conditions, help us to understand emission controls. This paper describes a simple and robust diffusion probe for soil gas sampling as part of flux monitoring programmes. It can be deployed with minimum disturbance of in-situ conditions, and also at sites with a high or fluctuating water table. Separate probes are used for each sampling depth, in this study ranging from 5 to 100 cm. The probe has a 10-ml diffusion cell with a 3-mm diameter opening covered by a 0.5-mm silicone membrane. At sampling the diffusion cell is flushed with 10 ml N-2 containing 50 mu l l(-1) ethylene (C2H4) as a tracer; tracer recovery is used to calculate sample concentrations. Ethylene is immediately removed by flushing with unamended N-2. Equations are presented to correct for dead volumes of connecting tubing and valves. Laboratory tests evaluated recovery of CH4, N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2), removal of C2H4 and equilibration of CH4, N2O and CO2 in air and water. Field tests on peat soils used for grazing showed soil gas concentrations of CH4 and N2O as influenced by topography, site conditions and season. The applicability of the diffusion probe for trace gas monitoring is discussed.

AB Simulation of emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O from agricultural land is still a challenge. This is mainly due to its high temporal variability, with low background emissions and a few transient peaks. In this study, a first attempt was made to simulate observations of N2O fluxes with a daily time step from managed peat soils. We used a new N2O module added to the extensively tested hydrological-biogeochemical model combination SWAP-ANIMO, hypothesizing that accurate simulation of the controlling factors would imply accurate simulation of the dynamics of the N2O emissions as well. We used daily N2O emission data from three sites in the Netherlands, with complementary data on soil moisture, mineral N content, and soil N2O concentration. Simulation of soil moisture, mineral N, and N2O concentration was reasonable to good. Still, simulation of the daily N2O emissions was poor, with model efficiencies <0, mainly due to overestimation of N2O emission from denitrification in the topsoil. We expect that the model overestimated diffusion of N2O from the topsoil to the atmosphere, thereby underestimating further reductions of N2O to N-2. This was probably linked to the complex peat pore geometry. We concluded that the description of the N2O processes in our model was insufficient to accurately simulate daily N2O emissions from peat soils, even when the main controlling factors are accurately simulated. Improvement is expected from incorporation of the effects of (peat) pore geometry on soil moisture and consequently on N2O production, reduction, storage, and transport.

AB The purpose of this study was to substitute sphagnum peat from plant growing media with urban biochar (UB) and evaluate its impact on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability. The UB was produced from the pyrolysis (650 degrees C) of a 2 : 1 ratio of biosolids to green waste. We compared three mixes -20% sphagnum peat mixed with composted pine bark (BO), 20% LIB mixed with composted pine bark (B20) and 60% LIB mixed with composted pine bark (B60) - for their ability to promote plant growth and minimise leaching losses in a greenhouse experiment using silverbeet (Beta vulgaris ssp. cicla). Plants were grown in 4.0-L custom-made chambers with the capacity to collect leachate and measure nitrous oxide gas flux. Both biochar mixes increased media pH, air filled porosity, bulk density and nutrient content relative to BO. The BO had the highest cation exchange capacity and electrical conductivity. The UB-based mixes, B20 and B60, had no significant effect on silverbeet biomass after 11 weeks of growth but had higher N use efficiency and P availability than BO. These results indicate that UB can completely replace sphagnum peat from growing media and can be used at the rate of 60% on volume basis while improving N and P availability. Using a higher rate of biochar in growing media has the additional advantage of sequestering more carbon and reducing urban waste streams and landfill costs.

AB Riparian zones along streams and other small wetlands perform important ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. They improve water quality by retaining nutrients and sediment from through-flowing water, sequester carbon and attenuate flood peaks at high discharge. At the same time, they have been shown to enhance biodiversity at the landscape as well as regional scale. However, there is concern about loss of biodiversity and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions where wetlands have become overloaded with nutrient-rich surface water or groundwater. This paper discusses conditions for the best performance of riparian zones and other small wetlands in agricultural landscapes in terms of nutrient and greenhouse gas retention and biodiversity.
   High nitrous oxide emissions have been identified in riparian zones used for N removal and could be a concern which would diminish their overall environmental benefit. However, it has been shown in riparian zones in the Rhine and Scheldt catchment that nitrous oxide emissions mainly occur when soil pH values are lower than 5. Such conditions occur mostly in stream headwater areas only where sandy sediments have a low buffering capacity, whereas higher-order streams and their riparian zones often have fine silty clay or loam sediments with higher pH values, supporting effective denitrification with low nitrous oxide emission.
   The question whether the nutrient attenuation service comes at the expense of biodiversity losses should be answered differently for existing, (semi-)natural wetlands and for new wetlands created in the agricultural landscape. Existing wetlands are quite vulnerable for nutrient loading, depending on their natural nutrient richness. Oligotrophic and mesotrophic wetlands such as bogs and fens are negatively affected by nutrient loadings > 4 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 0.5 g P m(-2) y(-1), which lead to loss of diversity and characteristic species. Wetlands in riparian zones are naturally more nutrient-rich and can tolerate much higher nutrient loadings without consequences for ecosystem health and diversity, their loading limits are 50 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 4 g P m(-2) y(-1). For nitrogen the relatively high limit is explained by significant denitrification activities in wetlands, transforming nitrate to mostly inert elemental nitrogen gas. There are also indications that only one of the major nutrients needs to be in short supply (i.e. below the limits indicated) in order to avoid major eutrophication problems. In agricultural areas where large numbers of wetlands have been created for N removal and biodiversity enhancement, the experience of this 'dual purpose' are generally positive, particularly in landscapes where not much of the original wetland resource remains.

AB Landscape representations based on land cover databases differ significantly from the real landscape. Using a land cover database with high uncertainty as input for emission inventory analyses can cause propagation of systematic and random errors. The objective of this study was to analyze how different land cover representations introduce systematic errors into the results of regional N2O emission inventories. Surface areas of grassland, ditches, and ditch banks were estimated for two polders in the Dutch fen meadow landscape using five land cover representations: four commonly used databases and a detailed field map, which most closely resembles the real landscape. These estimated surface areas were scaled up to the Dutch western fen meadow landscape. Based on the estimated surface areas agricultural NO emissions were estimated using different inventory techniques. All four common databases overestimated the grassland area when compared to the field map. This caused a considerable overestimation of agricultural N2O emissions, ranging from 9% for more detailed databases to 11% for the coarsest database. The effect of poor land cover representation was larger for an inventory method based on a process model than for inventory methods based on simple emission factors. Although the effect of errors in land cover representations may be small compared to the effect of uncertainties in emission factors, these effects are systematic (i.e., cause bias) and do not cancel out by spatial upscaling. Moreover, bias in land cover representations can be quantified or reduced by careful selection of the land cover database.

AB We have examined how some major catchment disturbances may affect the aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes in the boreal zone, using gas flux data from studies made in 1994-1999 in the pelagic regions of seven lakes and two reservoirs in Finland. The highest pelagic seasonal average methane (CH4) emissions were up to 12 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from eutrophied lakes with agricultural catchments. Nutrient loading increases autochthonous primary production in lakes, promoting oxygen consumption and anaerobic decomposition in the sediments and this can lead to increased CH4 release from lakes to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were higher from reservoirs and lakes whose catchment areas were rich in peatlands or managed forests, and from eutrophied lakes in comparison to oligotrophic and mesotrophic sites. However, all these sites were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. The pelagic CH4 emissions were generally lower than those from the littoral zone. The fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were negligible in the pelagic regions, apparently due to low nitrate inputs and/or low nitrification activity. However, the littoral zone, acting as a buffer for leached nitrogen, did release N2O. Anthropogenic disturbances of boreal lakes, such as increasing eutrophication, can change the aquatic greenhouse gas balance, but also the gas exchange in the littoral zone should be included in any assessment of the overall effect. It seems that autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources, which contribute to the CH4 and Co-2 production in lakes, also have importance in the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.

AB Liquid manure (slurry) storages arc, sources of detrimental gases. Floating covers are a potential mitigation measure that can be implemented on many storage facility types. This article reviews the use of floating covers to reduce the emissions of odors, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), ammonia (NH(3)), and greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O). Covers have been established with materials of natural origin (e.g. natural crusts, straw, peat, and light expanded clay aggregates), synthetic origin (e.g. geotextile, plastic, and rubber), and composites of both. Nearly all cover types have been capable of substantially reducing NI 3 emissions (compared to uncovered controls). Reductions of odor and H(2)S have also been good, though fewer cover types have been assessed with respect to these parameters. When used alone, oil covers can produce foul odors and should not be used. Less information is available oil the influence of covers on GHG emissions. In studies >2 weeks long, covers generally increased CH(4) and CO(2) emissions. All studies where N(2)O was measured found that permeable covers increased its emission. There is some difficulty comparing laboratory and field observations, which may be due to study duration, hydrologic influences, or slurry characteristics. Principles of mass transfer are discussed with respect to the mechanisms of cover operation. Though evidence of microbial gas consumption in permeable covers exists, its relative importance is unclear Currently, information on many cover materials is limited to one or two studies, and simultaneous assessments of the effects on all aforementioned gases is lacking for all covers.

AB Substantially extending the life span of peat- and perlite-based growing media is a measure to increase the sustainability of soilless cultivation. The extraction of peat from pristine peatlands threatens these sensitive ecosystems and carbon sinks, meanwhile resulting in increased emissions of greenhouse gasses. Each batch of peat that is reused, results in a clear reduction in CO2 emissions and a lower impact on the climate. After using growing media for one cultivation, we aim at reusing the spent material as growing medium for another crop. Spent peat and perlite-based growing media from strawberry and cucumber cultivation were upcycled after steam treatment. We tested the effectiveness of steaming to reduce phytosanitary risks. The hygienisation efficiency of the steam treatment was confirmed: plant pathogenic fungi, larvae of vine weevils and weed seeds added or already present before the process were killed by the steam treatment. As the upcycled spent growing medium already contained high nutrient levels, the fertilizer application in the reused growing medium should be reduced, especially for P and K. Five indicators for assessing stability of the materials were used: CO2 flux measurements, oxygen uptake rate (OUR), biodegradation potential, mineral N content and risk for N immobilization. The spent growing media had a low decomposition rate and the release of nutrients in a leaching experiment was lower than for a fertilized peat-based growing medium, being a reference blend for open field cultivated Chrysanthemum. N mineralisation and P uptake were tested in an incubation and pot trial, respectively, and the upcycled spent growing medium was found to be an important source of plant-available K and P. Steam treatment did not severely affect the microbial biomass and diversity of the spent growing media. Blending the steam-treated spent media with other materials or inoculating by a commercially available biocontrol fungus also had a limited effect, indicating that newly introduced microorganisms do not easily establish in steamed-treated spent growing media (SSGM). Acidification of the SSGM was achieved by a low dose of elemental S. The steam-treated growing medium was tested for growing Chrysanthemum cuttings and plantlets. Spent growing media were not able to supply sufficient mineral N, but the stored amounts of P and K in the media were sufficiently plant available for optimal crop growth. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB We estimated CH4 and N2O emissions from the main land-use types in rural landscapes using data from the literature (950 study sites/experiments from the temperate and boreal zone published from 1980 to 2009 in 165 scientific papers indexed by the ISI Web of Science) and assessed the emission potential of CH4 and N2O from rural landscapes in Estonia. According to this analysis, natural peatlands and marshes appeared to be the most important CH4 emitters, whereas N2O is emitted mainly from drained peatlands and marshes, set aside areas, conventional arable lands, fertilized grasslands, and coniferous and mixed forests - all on hydromorphic soils. The estimated median value of annual CH4-C and N2O-N fluxes for Estonian rural landscapes are 25,519 and 11,050t respectively. CH4 consumption makes up 13.2% of the emission. The largest CH4 emitters are peatlands (17,746 tCH(4)-C year(-1); 60%), whereas coniferous and mixed forests on hydromorphic soils with altered hydrologic regime are responsible for the bulk (51%) of N2O fluxes. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of Estonian rural land-use types (42,685 km(2)) from potential CH4 and N2O fluxes is 5.99 million t of CO2 equivalents, of which N2O is responsible for 86%. Several measures for the further mitigation of greenhouse gas emission from rural landscapes are proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since the advancement in CH4 gas analyser technology and its applicability to eddy covariance flux measurements, monitoring of CH4 emissions is becoming more widespread. In order to accurately determine the greenhouse gas balance, high quality gap-free data is required. Currently there is still no consensus on CH4 gap-filling methods, and methods applied are still study-dependent and often carried out on low resolution, daily data.
   In the current study, we applied artificial neural networks to six distinctively different CH4 time series from high latitudes, explain the method and test its functionality. We discuss the applicability of neural networks in CH4 flux studies, the advantages and disadvantages of this method, and what information we were able to extract from such models.
   Three different approaches were tested by including drivers such as air and soil temperature, barometric air pressure, solar radiation, wind direction (indicator of source location) and in addition the lagged effect of water table depth and precipitation. In keeping with the principle of parsimony, we included up to five of these variables traditionally measured at CH4 flux measurement sites. Fuzzy sets were included representing the seasonal change and time of day. High Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of up to 0.97 achieved in the final analysis are indicative for the high performance of neural networks and their applicability as a gap-filling method for CH4 flux data time series. This novel approach which we show to be appropriate for CH4 fluxes is a step towards standardising CH4 gap-filling protocols.

AB Swamp forests have been insufficiently studied yet in comparison with thoroughly examined carbon pools and greenhouse gas fluxes of peat bogs. This is primarily since the GHGs in swamp forests have huge spatial (due to the developed microrelief) and temporal variations (due to strong fluctuations in the groundwater level (GWL)). This significantly complicates their study, producing ambiguous results, especially in short-term field research. From June to October 2013-2016, we measured soil respiration (R-soil) in an alder swamp using the static chamber method at five microsites: depression (DEP), flat surface (FL), elevations (EL), tussocks (TUS), and near-stem tussocks (STUS). We carried out a computer simulation of the total R-soil for the season based on R-soil measurements, monitoring of GWL, and soil temperature. In 2013-2016, the average R-soil values (mgC m(-2) h(-1) +/- sigma) on DEP, FL, EL, TUS and STUS comprised 54 +/- 50, 94 +/- 72, 146 +/- 89, 193 +/- 96, and 326 +/- 183, respectively, whereas the total R-soil values for the season (tC ha(-1) season(-1) +/- sigma) comprised 2.0 +/- 0.5, 3.5 +/- 0.5, 5.3 +/- 1.6, 5.4 +/- 2.7, and 12.6 +/- 3.2. According to the results of observations, GWL was at the level of several cm below the soil surface for most of the season. In 2014 and 2015, there were extra dry periods that led to a drop in GWL to a mark of 30-40 cm below the soil surface. Despite their short duration (2-3 weeks), these dry periods can lead to an increase in the total R-soil for the season from 9 to 45% in the TUS-EL-STUS-FL-DEP sequence.

AB Using a culture-based nitrous oxide (N2O) emission assay, three active N2O emitters were isolated from Sphagnum fuscum leaves and all identified as members of Burkholderia. These isolates showed N2O emission in the medium supplemented with NO3- but not with NH4+, and Burkholderia sp. SF-E2 showed the most efficient N2O emission (0.20 mu g.vial(-1).day(-1)) at 1.0 mM KNO3. In Burkholderia sp. SF-E2, the optimum pH for N2O production was 5.0, close to that of the phyllosphere of Sphagnum mosses, while the optimum temperature was uniquely over 30 degrees C. The stimulating effect of additional 1.5 mM sucrose on N2O emission was ignorable, but Burkholderia sp. SF-E2 upon exposure to 100 mg.L-1 E-caffeic acid showed uniquely 67-fold higher N2O emission. All of the three N2O emitters were negative in both acetylene inhibition assay and PCR assay for nosZ-detection, suggesting that N2O reductase or the gene itself is missing in the N2O-emitting Burkholderia.

   footprint: A case study of the pulp and paper sector
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Environmental tax; Life cycle analysis; Environmental input-output
   analysis
AB The main aim of this work is to define an environmental tax on products based on their carbon footprint. We examine the relevance of life cycle analysis (LCA) and environmentally extended input-output analysis (EIO) as methodological tools for identifying the emission intensities on which the tax is based. The price effects of the tax and the policy implications of considering non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) are also analyzed. The results from the case study on pulp production show that the environmental tax rate based on LCA (1.8%) is higher than both EIO approaches (0.8 and 1.4% for product and industry, respectively), but they are of the same order of magnitude. Although LCA is more product specific and provides a more detailed analysis, we recommend EIO as a more relevant approach to applying an economy-wide environmental tax. If an environmental tax were applied to non-CO2 GHG instead to CO2 alone, the tax would greatly affects sectors such as agriculture, mining of coal, extraction of peat, and food. Therefore, it is worthwhile for policy-makers to pay attention to the implications of considering either a CO2 tax or a global GHG emissions tax in order to make their policy measures effective and meaningful.

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB Logging residue piles have been suggested to markedly increase the decomposition of the underlying peat soil leading to large carbon dioxide emissions. We aimed at scrutinizing this postulate with straightforward decomposition (mass loss) measurements. For the purpose, authentic soil organic matter (humus and peat) was incubated in mesh bags under piles and at control plots. The effect of piles was assumed to result from physical (shading and insulation on soil surface) and chemical-biological (leaching of nutrients and fresh organic matter) sources. To distinguish between the two, artificial piles of inorganic matter were established to mimic the bare physical effects. Enhancement of decomposition in the soil under the real and artificial piles was assessed by measuring the mass loss of cellulose strips.
   Logging residue piles had clear physical effects on soil: temperatures were lowered and their diurnal variation subdued, and relative humidity at the soil surface was higher. The effect on soil moisture was also evident, but more variable, including both decreases and increases. These effects, mimicked by the artificial piles, decreased rather than increased cellulose mass loss. As the real piles, on the other hand, increased mass loss, we conclude that logging residue piles may enhance decomposition in soil due to chemical-biological mechanisms.
   Also the results on humus and peat mass loss indicate that piles can both increase and decrease decomposition. Consistent, remarkable increase in mass loss was not observed. Thus, our results do not support the postulate of logging residue piles dramatically increasing decomposition of soil organic matter. Rather, they hint that the effect of logging residue piles on soil is an interplay of physical and chemical-biological effects and carbon transport via roots and fungi. To fully understand and quantify these effects, vertical C fluxes between piles and soil and horizontal C fluxes within soil need to be assessed in addition to decomposition in soil and piles.

AB Forested black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands are an important economic, cultural, and ecological resource in the northern Great Lake States, USA, and are threatened by the invasive insect, emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmmaire [EAB]). These wetlands are likely to experience higher water tables and warmer temperatures if they are impacted by large-scale ash mortality and other global change factors. Therefore, it is critical to understand how temperature, hydrology, and their interaction affect greenhouse gas fluxes in black ash wetland soils. In order to predict potential ecosystem changes, we sampled and incubated intact soil cores containing either mineral or organic (peat) soils from two black ash wetlands, monitored soil oxidation-reduction potential (Eh), and measured the efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) at two water-level treatments nested in three temperature treatments, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, or 20 degrees C. The water-level treatments were either saturated or drawdown, designed to mimic wetlands impacted or not impacted by EAB. Mean CO2 fluxes increased with increasing temperature but did not vary significantly by soil type or water-level. Peat soil had 60 to 135 times significantly greater CH4 flux in the saturated treatment and had minimal N2O loss across all treatments, while mineral soils had 8 to 43 times significantly greater N2O flux in the saturated treatment, and minimal CH4 loss across all treatments. Gas fluxes generally increased and had greater variation with increasing temperature. The drawdown treatment resulted in significantly higher Eh during unsaturated periods in both soil types, but the response was more variable in the peat soil. Our findings demonstrate potential indirect effects of EAB in black ash wetlands, with implications for ecosystem functions associated with C and N cycling.

AB Agricultural soils are the most important sources for the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), which is produced and emitted from soils also at low temperatures. The processes behind emissions at low temperatures are still poorly known. Snow is a good insulator and it keeps soil temperature rather constant. To simulate the effects of a reduction in snow depth on N2O emission in warming climate, snow pack was removed from experimental plots on three different agricultural soils (sand, mull, peat). Removal of snow lowered soil temperature and increased the extent and duration of soil frost in sand and mull soils. This led to enhanced N2O emissions during freezing and thawing events. The cumulative emissions during the first year when snow was removed over the whole winter were 0.25, 0.66 and 3.0 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) in control plots of sand, mull and peat soils, respectively. In the treatment plots, without snow cover, the respective cumulative emissions were 0.37, 1.3 and 3.3 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). Shorter snow manipulation during the second year did not increase the annual emissions. Only 20% of the N2O emission occurred during the growing season. Thus, these results highlight the importance of the winter season for this exchange and that the year-round measurements of annual N2O emissions from boreal soils are integral for estimating their N2O source strength. N2O accumulated in the frozen soil during winter and the soil N2O concentration correlated with the depth of frost but not with the winter N2O emission rates per se. Also laboratory incubations of soil samples showed high production rates of N2O at temperatures below 0 degrees C, especially in the sand and peat soils.

AB An environmental assessment of the management of organic household waste (OHW) was performed from a life cycle perspective by means of the waste-life cycle assessment (LCA) model EASEWASTE. The focus was on home composting of OHW in Denmark and six different home composting units (with different input and different mixing frequencies) were modelled. In addition, incineration and landfilling was modelled as alternatives to home composting. The most important processes contributing to the environmental impact of home composting were identified as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (load) and the avoided emissions in relation to the substitution of fertiliser and peat when compost was used in hobby gardening (saving). The replacement of fertiliser and peat was also identified as one of the most sensible parameters, which could potentially have a significant environmental benefit. Many of the impact categories (especially human toxicity via water (HTw) and soil (HTs)) were affected by the heavy metal contents of the incoming OHW. The concentrations of heavy metals in the compost were below the threshold values for compost used on land and were thus not considered to constitute a problem. The GHG emissions were, on the other hand, dependent on the management of the composting units. The frequently mixed composting units had the highest GHG emissions. The environmental profiles of the home composting scenarios were in the order of -2 to 16 milli person equivalents (mPE) Mg(-1) wet waste (ww) for the non-toxic categories and -0.9 to 28 mPE Mg(-1) ww for the toxic categories. Home composting performed better than or as good as incineration and landfilling in several of the potential impact categories. One exception was the global warming (GW) category, in which incineration performed better due to the substitution of heat and electricity based on fossil fuels. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Renewable energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets are driving an acceleration in the use of bioenergy resources. The environmental impact of national and regional development plans must be assessed in compliance with the EU Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive (2001/42/EC). Here, we quantify the environmental impact of an Irish Government bioenergy plan to replace 30% of peat used in three peat-burning power stations, located within the midlands region, with biomass. Four plan alternatives for supplying biomass to the power plant were considered in this study: (1) importation of palm kernel shell from south-east Asia, (2) importation of olive cake pellets from Spain and (3) growing either willow or (4) Miscanthus in the vicinity of the power stations. The impact of each alternative on each of the environmental receptors proposed in the SEA Directive was first quantified before the data were normalized on either an Irish, regional or global scale. Positive environmental impacts were very small compared to the negative environmental impacts for each of the plan alternatives considered. Comparison of normalized indicator values confirmed that the adverse environmental consequences of each plan alternative are concentrated at the location where the biomass is produced. The analysis showed that the adverse environmental consequences of biomass importation are substantially greater than those associated with the use of willow and Miscanthus grown on former grassland. The use of olive cake pellets had a greater adverse environmental effect compared to the use of peat whereas replacement of peat with either willow or Miscanthus feedstocks led to a substantial reduction in environmental pressure. The proposed assessment framework combines the scope of SEA with the quantitative benefits of life cycle assessment and can be used to evaluate the environmental consequences of bioenergy plans.

AB We quantified the effects of the water table on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from microcosms in a freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. From July to September in 2005, CO2, CH4 and N2O emission rates were measured in an undisturbed natural marsh (in natural) and microcosms of three manipulated water table treatments: a reference, a high water table (HW) and a low water table (LW). The averages of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions were 360.2 mg m(-2) h(-1), 7.43 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 12.84 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively, close to those in reference (p < 0.05), averaging 394.5 mg m(-2) h(-1), 8.92 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 13.3 mu g m(-2) h(-1). This means microcosm installation had no significant effect on CO2 efflux. Averaged CO2 (p = 0.03) and CH4 (p = 0.001) emissions were significantly different across the treatments, but that of N2O emission (p = 0.36) was not. To quantify the effects of water table position, three typical classes of water table were considered, i.e. +2 to +14 cm, -11 to 0 cm and -28 to -11.3 cm (+, above the soil surface. -, below the soil surface). Mean CO2 and N2O emissions were lowest at the higher water table positions (+2 to +14 cm) and increased by 120% and 60% at the lower water table positions (-11 to 0 cm), respectively, and the corresponding CH4 emissions decreased by 75%. However, at lowest water table positions (-28 to -11.3 cm), little additional effects on gas emissions were not found. Our results suggested that there could be considerable changes of greenhouse emissions as a response of water drawdown due to wetland drainage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas accounting for 60% of the total greenhouse effect. Soil is a major source for atmospheric CO2. In the event of growing threats of global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, reducing CO2 emission by sequestering C in the soil is of prime importance. Soil management practices like increasing soil organic carbon content, reduced tillage, manuring, residue incorporation, improving soil biodiversity, micro-aggregation and mulching can play an important role in sequestering C in soil.

AB A cutting management regime maintains high levels of biodiversity in semi-natural habitats across Europe. We utilise three years of annual yield data from Welsh semi-natural areas to calculate the mean feedstock production from cutting management to be 1.05 x 10(6) t DM annum(-1). Using formulae based upon Fischer Tropsch (FT) fuel process models, we predict that 2.12 x 10(5) t of FT fuel annum(-1) could be produced. That represents 38% of the Welsh transport sector's green house gas (GHG) reduction target for 2020. Alternatively, predictive formulae reveal that methane yields from anaerobic digestion of the feedstock could reduce GHG emissions by 11% of the domestic sector's reduction target for 2020. Electricity generation from methane is also explored. The results presented encourage further investigation into the contribution of this resource to sustainable domestic energy supply. Furthermore, the proposed system would potentially protect a broad range of ecosystem services and maintain biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vermicomposting is a promising method to disposal dairy manures, and the dairy manure vermicompost (DMV) to replace expensive peat is of high value in the application of seedling compressed substrates. In this research, three main components: DMV, straw, and peat, are conducted in the compressed substrates, and the effect of individual components and the corresponding optimal ratio for the seedling production are significant. To address these issues, the simplex-centroid experimental mixture design is employed, and the cucumber seedling experiment is conducted to evaluate the compressed substrates. Results demonstrated that the mechanical strength and physicochemical properties of compressed substrates for cucumber seedling can be well satisfied with suitable mixture ratio of the components. Moreover, DMV, straw, and peat) could be determined at 0.5917:0.1608:0.2475 when the weight coefficients of the three parameters (shoot length, root dry weight, and aboveground dry weight) were 1:1:1. For different purpose, the optimum ratio can be little changed on the basis of different weight coefficients.Implications: Compressed substrate is lump and has certain mechanical strength, produced by application of mechanical pressure to the seedling substrates. It will not harm seedlings when bedding out the seedlings, since the compressed substrate and seedling are bedded out together. However, there is no one using the vermicompost and agricultural waste components of compressed substrate for vegetable seedling production before. Thus, it is important to understand the effect of individual components to seedling production, and to determine the optimal ratio of components.

AB Agriculture is the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O). Cultivation of perennial crops is a potential way to reduce N2O emissions. We quantified multi-year N2O emissions from two perennial cropping systems, reed canary grass (RCG) and a mixture of timothy and meadow fescue (TIM), on a boreal mineral soil. Mean annual emissions from TIM and RCG were rather similar, 600 mg N2O m(-2) yr(-1) and 670 mg N2O m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Compared to the median N2O emissions from cropping systems in mineral soils in northern Europe (230 mg N2O m(-2) yr(-1)), those in this study (720 mg N2O m(-2) yr(-1)) were higher. The higher annual emissions and the observed decrease in annual emissions in our study with time was likely associated with the use of organic fertilizer during the pre-trial period.

TI Burkholderiaceae Are Key Acetate Assimilators During Complete

DT Article

   permafrost affected soils; isotope tracing
AB Cryoturbated peat circles (pH 4) in the Eastern European Tundra harbor up to 2 mM pore water nitrate and emit the greenhouse gas N2O like heavily fertilized agricultural soils in temperate regions. The main process yielding N2O under oxygen limited conditions is denitrification, which is the sequential reduction of nitrate/nitrite to N2O and/or N-2. N2O reduction to N-2 is impaired by pH < 6 in classical model denitrifiers and many environments. Key microbes of peat circles are important but largely unknown catalysts for C- and N-cycling associated N2O fluxes. Thus, we hypothesized that the peat circle community includes hitherto unknown taxa and is essentially unable to efficiently perform complete denitrification, i.e., reduce N2O, due to a low in situ pH. 16S rRNA analysis indicated a diverse active community primarily composed of the bacterial class-level taxa Alphaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobiae, and Bacteroidia, as well as archaeal Nitrososphaeria. Euryarchaeota were not detected. C-13(2)- and C-12(2)-acetate supplemented anoxic microcosms with endogenous nitrate and acetylene at an in situ near pH of 4 were used to assess acetate dependent carbon flow, denitrification and N2O production. Initial nitrate and acetate were consumed within 6 and 11 days, respectively, and primarily converted to CO2 and N-2, suggesting complete acetate fueled denitrification at acidic pH. Stable isotope probing coupled to 16S rRNA analysis via Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing identified acetate consuming key players of the family Burkholderiaceae during complete denitrification correlating with Rhodanobacter spp. The archaeal community consisted primarily of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea of Nitrososphaeraceae, and was stable during the incubation. The collective data indicate that peat circles (i) host acid-tolerant denitrifiers capable of complete denitrification at pH 4-5.5, (ii) other parameters like carbon availability rather than pH are possible reasons for high N2O emissions in situ, and (iii) Burkholderiaceae are responsive key acetate assimilators co-occurring with Rhodanobacter sp. during denitrification, suggesting both organisms being associated with acid-tolerant denitrification in peat circles.

AB To reveal the impact of vertical non-uniform distribution of soil moisture on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, incubated experiments were conducted from April to August 2013 on silty clay and sandy loam with four watering regimes [surface watering (SW) and subsurface watering application to levels 12, 15, and 18 cm below soil surface (SUW12, SUW15, SUW18)]. Short-term pulse emissions of N2O from both soils during the drying process were observed. The soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 0-12 cm depths for peak N2O fluxes in SW and SUW soils fell within 34-66%, 22-72%, 25-35%, and 19-39% for silty clay and sandy loam, respectively. Our results also suggest that the N2O fluxes from soil of sily clay with higher N content are much higher than that from sandy loam, and N2O were more easily influenced by soil moisture in SW soils than in SUW soils. However, more research is needed to identify an ideal soil-wetting pattern and the way to realize the ideal soil-wetting pattern, especially on soil with plant growth and fertilization.

   climate-friendly peat land management in Germany
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Agricultural peat land use; Reduction of greenhouse gases; Farm survey;
   Economic consequences
AB About 30% of the world's soil carbon is stored in peat soils. Peat land's functional principle of carbon storage greatly depends on management strategies. Therefore, agricultural peat land use becomes a focal point of interest in the current debate on climate protection. Agricultural management demands a drawdown of the water-level that causes degradation of the soils, as well as trace-gas emissions which have a negative impact on greenhouse-gas balance. Climate-friendly peat land management strategies, however, demand enhanced groundwater tables and decreased land-use intensity. Against this background, we analyse ways of re-organising agricultural peat land use within a case study located in Germany, where intensive peat land use accounts for 2.3-5.1% of the country's overall greenhouse-gas emission. The study takes place in six regions which represent all possible socio-economic and natural conditions with regard to the range of existing peat land types, range of management and cultivation types, as well as the range of land-use intensity. To analyse potentials and effects of re-organising peat land use, stakeholder workshops and extensive farm surveys were carried out. The results indicate that reservations exist as regards a re-organisation of peat land management. Financial compensation for farmers appears necessary. The results also show that the potential of rearrangement throughout the regions varies significantly, mainly according to the existing level of interconnection and cooperation between local stakeholders, the technical feasibility of restoration and water logging and the level of agricultural profitability of peat land cultivation with regard to income, capital commitment and the share of affected peat land area.

AB This study attempted to improve the properties and energy efficiency of torrefied biochar produced from the waste of two common street trees, namely, Washingtonia filifera and Sterculia foetida. The effects of various torrefaction temperatures (210-300 degrees C) and reaction times (30 and 60 min) were evaluated. W. filifera petiole (WFP) biochar exhibited a higher weight loss and energy yield than S. foetida follicle (SFF) biochar. As the torrefaction temperature and time increased, the higher heating values (HHVs) and fuel ratios of both types of biochar increased, and the H/C and O/C atomic ratios became similar to the atomic ratios of lignite and peat due to the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose in the biomass structures. Furans and acetic acid, respectively, were the major gaseous products of WFP and SFF torrefaction. The maximum energy return on investment (EROI) of 23.2 was achieved for WFP biochar torrefied at 210 degrees C for 30 min. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced markedly by 74.7-91.6% if biochar is used as a substitute for bituminous coal. Moreover, cofiring WFP or SFF biochar with bituminous coal at power plants is sustainable and economically beneficial because of the high HHV, stability, thermal performance, sufficient EROI, and low GHG emissions.

AB Despite the spatial significance of Canada's boreal forest, there is very little known about CH4 and N2O emissions from non-peatlands within it. The primary objective of this project was to study the atmosphere-soil exchange of CH4 and N2O at three sites in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan. In the summers of 2006 and 2007, CH4 and N2O emissions were measured along transects in three different mature forest stands (aspen, black spruce and jack pine) using a sealed chamber method. At the aspen site, the gross rates of mineralization and nitrification, and the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions, were also measured using the N-15 isotope dilution technique. Results indicated that the jack pine and black spruce sites were slight sinks of CH4 (-0.123 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) and -0.017 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) respectively in 2006 and -0.095 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.045 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) respectively in 2007), whereas the aspen site was a net source (4.40 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2006 and 19.60 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2007). The high CH4 emissions at the aspen site occurred at depressions that were water-filled due to above-average precipitation levels in 2005-2007. All three sites had very low cumulative N2O emissions, ranging from -0.002 to 0.014 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) in both years. The N-15 results indicated that N cycling at the aspen site was very conservative, allowing little N to escape the system as N2O; the emissions that did occur were due primarily to a nitrification-related process.

   FUTURE; FLUXES; SOILS; SEA
AB Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects (sometimes referred to as "Blue Carbon"), through preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane (CH4) and CO2 emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given that GHG emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of an equal quantity of fossil fuel GHG. Thus, as a landuse-based climate change intervention, reducing CH4 emissions is an entirely distinct concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.

AB In producing power, humans move the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from their long-term geological and biological stocks and release or emit them in soil, water, and the atmosphere, In Finland, peat combustion is an important driver of N and P fluxes from the environment to human economy. The flows of N and P in the Finnish energy system were quantified with partial substance flow analysis, and the driving forces of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were analyzed using the ImPACT model.
   In the year 2000 in Finland, 140,000 tonnes of nitrogen entered the energy system, mainly in peat and hard coal. Combustion released an estimated 66,000 tonnes of N as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrous oxides (N2O) and another 74,000 tonnes as elemental N-2. Most of the emissions were borne in traffic. At the same time, 6,000 tonnes of P was estimated to enter the Finnish energy system, mostly in peat and wood. Ash was mainly used in earth construction and disposed in landfills; thus negligible levels of P were recycled back to nature.
   During the twentieth century, fuel-borne input of N increased 20-fold, and of P 8-fold. In 1900-1950, the increasing use of hard coal slowly boosted N input, whereas wood fuels were the main carrier of P Since 1970, the fluxes have been on the rise. NO, emissions leveled off in the 1980s, though, and then declined in conjunction with improvements in combustion technologies such as NOx removal (de-NOx) technologies in energy production and catalytic converters in cars.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate temporal and spatial patterns of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in three adjacent riparian sites (mixed vegetation, forest and grass). The highest DEA was found in the surface (0-30 cm) soil and varied between 0.7+/-0.1 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) at 5degreesC 5.9+/-0.4 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) at 15degreesC. There was no significant difference (P >0.05) between the DEA in the uppermost (0-30 cm and 60-90 cm) soil depths under different vegetation covers. In the two deepest (120-150 cm and 180-210 cm) soil depths the DEA varied between 0.0+/-0.0 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) at 5degreesC and 4.4+/-0.9 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) at 15degreesC and was clearly associated with the accumulation of buried organic carbon (OC). Two threshold values of OC were observed before DEA started to increase significantly, namely 5 and 25 g OC kg(-1) soil at 10-15degreesC and 5degreesC, respectively. In the three riparian sites N2O fluxes varied between a net N2O uptake of -0.6+/-0.4 mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1) and a net N2O emission of 2.5+/-0.3 mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1). The observed N2O emission did not lead to an important pollution swapping (from water pollution to greenhouse gas emission). Especially in the mixed vegetation and forest riparian site highest N2O fluxes were observed upslope of the riparian site. The N2O fluxes showed no clear temporal trend.

AB Wetlands are the largest and most uncertain natural sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). Several process-based models have been developed to quantify the magnitude and estimate spatial and temporal variations in CH4 emissions from global wetlands. Reliable models are required to estimate global wetland CH4 emissions. This study aimed to test two process-based models, CH4 MODwetland and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), against the CH4 flux measurements of marsh, swamp, peatland and coastal wetland sites across the world; specifically, model accuracy and generality were evaluated for different wetland types and in different continents, and then the global CH4 emissions from 2000 to 2010 were estimated. Both models showed similar high correlations with the observed seasonal/annual total CH4 emissions, and the regression of the observed versus computed total seasonal/annual CH4 emissions resulted in R-2 values of 0.81 and 0.68 for CH4 MODwetland and ILM, respectively. The CH4MOD(wetland )produced accurate predictions for marshes, peatlands, swamps and coastal wetlands, with model efficiency (EF) values of 0.22, 0.52, 0.13 and 0.72, respectively. TEM produced good predictions for peatlands and swamps, with EF values of 0.69 and 0.74, respectively, but it could not accurately simulate marshes and coastal wetlands (EF < 0). There was a good correlation between the simulated CH4 fluxes and the observed values on most continents. However, CH4MOD(wetland) showed no correlation with the observed values in South America and Africa. TEM showed no correlation with the observations in Europe. The global CH4 emissions for the period 2000-2010 were estimated to be 105.31 +/- 2.72 Tg yr(-1) by CH4 MODwetland and 134.31 +/- 0.84 Tg yr(-1) by MM. Both models simulated a similar spatial distribution of CH4 emissions globally and on different continents. Marshes contribute 36 %-39 % of global CH4 emissions. Lakes/rivers and swamps are the second and third greatest contributors, respectively. Other wetland types account for only approximately 20 % of global emissions. Based on the model applicability, if we use the more accurate model, i.e., the one that performs best as evidenced by a higher model efficiency and a lower model bias, to estimate each continent and wetland type, we obtain a new assessment of 116.99-124.74 Tg yr(-1) for the global CH4 emissions for the period 2000-2010. Our results imply that performance at a global scale may conceal model uncertainty. Efforts should be made to improve model accuracy for different wetland types and regions, particularly hotspot regions, to reduce the uncertainty in global assessments.

AB Organic soils drained for crop production or grazing land are agroecosystems with potentially high but variable emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). The present study investigated the regulation of N2O emissions in a raised bog area drained for agriculture, which is classified as potentially acid sulfate soil. We hypothesised that pyrite (FeS2) oxidation was a potential driver of N2O emissions through microbially mediated reduction of nitrate (NO3-). Two sites with rotational grass, and two sites with a potato crop, were equipped for monitoring of N2O emissions and soil N2O concentrations at the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm depth during weekly field campaigns in spring and autumn 2015. Further data acquisition included temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, water table (WT) depth, and soil NO3- and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations. At all sites, the soil was acidic, with pH ranging from 4.7 to 5.4. Spring and autumn monitoring periods together represented between 152 and 174 d, with cumulative emissions of 4-5 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with rotational grass and 20-50 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with a potato crop. Equivalent soil gas-phase concentrations of N2O at grassland sites varied between 0 and 25 mu L L-1 except for a sampling after slurry application at one of the sites in spring, with a maximum of 560 mu L L-1 at the 1 m depth. At the two potato sites the levels of below-ground N2O concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 2270 mu L L-1 and from 0.1 to 470 mu L L-1, in accordance with the higher soil mineral N availability at arable sites. Statistical analyses using graphical models showed that soil N2O concentration in the capillary fringe (i.e. the soil volume above the water table influenced by tension saturation) was the strongest predictor of N2O emissions in spring and, for grassland sites, also in the autumn. For potato sites in autumn, there was evidence that NO3- availability in the topsoil and temperature were the main controls on N2O emissions. Chemical analyses of intact soil cores from the 0 to 1m depth, collected at adjacent grassland and potato sites, showed that the total reduction capacity of the peat soil (assessed by cerium(IV) reduction) was much higher than that represented by FeS2, and the concentrations of total reactive iron (TRFe) were higher than those of FeS2. Based on the statistical graphical models and the tentative estimates of reduction capacities, FeS2 oxidation was unlikely to be important for N2O emissions. Instead, archaeal ammonia oxidation and either chemodenitrification or nitrifier denitrification were considered to be plausible pathways of N2O production in spring, whereas in the autumn heterotrophic denitrification may have been more important at arable sites.

AB The effects of site preparation practices (drainage, mounding and fertilization) on the fluxes from the soil surface of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were studied on an organic-rich peaty gley soil at Harwood Forest, north-east England. Drained plots had significantly higher CO2 fluxes but significantly lower CH4 fluxes compared with undrained plots, while N2O emissions were not affected by drainage. Mounding caused significantly higher CH4 emissions, while it significantly reduced N2O emissions. Fertilization caused significant increases in emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O. In terms of overall greenhouse warming potential, drainage and fertilization increased CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 18-29 and 7-23 per cent, respectively, while mounding reduced CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 8 per cent in year 1, but had no effect on emissions in year 2 of study. Soil temperature was the main environmental variable controlling CO2 emissions, while CH4 was controlled primarily by water table depth. Nitrous oxide emissions responded to changes in soil temperature and water table depth. In the short term, drainage and fertilization contributed to accelerating greenhouse gas emissions significantly, although their long-term effects are likely moderated by accelerating carbon accumulation in the tree biomass. Long-term studies are required to assess the cumulative impacts of site preparation practices during the whole rotation cycle.

AB Recently, a discussion has emerged around greenhouse gas emissions due to direct and indirect land use change (LUC) of expanding agricultural areas dedicated to bio-products production. Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop-based bio-products creates a carbon debt by releasing 9 to 170 times more CO2 than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these bio-products (such as the bioplastics) would provide by displacing petroleum-based products (conventional plastics).
   In this work, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for the LUC emissions in the LCA studies devoted to the analysis of the environmental impact of bio-based products and in particular of the bioplastics. To this end, an original case study has been carried out on the comparison between the LCAs of shoppers made from Mater-Bi (corn-based bioplastic) and polyethylene, including the LUC emissions. The obtained results highlight the strong influence of the LUC emissions on the GHGs saving achievable by displacing petroleum-based plastics with bioplastics and point out the importance of using waste biomass or biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands to produce bioplastics that, in this manner, can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages.

AB Although methane (CH4) fluxes from northern wetlands in Asia have been described in previous research at different temporal and spatial scales, integrated studies at the ecosystem scale were scarce. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured using eddy covariance (EC) technique and the chamber method in a cool temperate marsh in northeast China during the growing season (May-September) of 2011. CH4 emissions were highly variable, both temporally and spatially during the measurement period. According to the EC observation data, CH4 fluxes showed a significant diurnal cycle during the mid-growing season with nighttime average flux about 67% of the average daytime values. Daily cumulative CH4 fluxes varied from 54 to 250 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) with an average flux of 136.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The observations of chamber method showed that CH4 emissions differed markedly among the three main plant communities. Average flux at the Carex lasiocarpa site was about 4 times and 13.5 times of that at the Glyceria spiculosa site and Deyewcia angustifolia site, respectively. The spatial variability of CH4 flux was mainly controlled by the varying water table level as well as the spatial distribution of different vascular plants, while the seasonal dynamic of CH4 emission could be best explained by the change of surface soil temperature and air pressure. A comparison was made between EC measurements and the upscaled chamber based model. The results from the model overestimated CH4 emission by 28% compared to the EC data. Considering the large variability of methane emission, it is necessary to conduct continuous observations on CH4 emission from northern wetlands at different temporal and spatial scales to comprehend the variability and also to predict responses to climate change.

AB [1] Concentrations and fluxes of greenhouse gases methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured during open water conditions in two hydroelectric reservoirs, Lokka and Porttipahta, in the northern boreal zone in Finland. These reservoirs were located on peat and forest soils and were built in 1967 and 1970, respectively. Over 20 years after their flooding, the reservoirs were still largely supersaturated with dissolved CH4 and CO2. Measured with floating static chambers, the stations in Lokka released more CH4 (means of 5.3-119 mg m(-2) d(-1)) during the open water periods in 1994 and 1995 than the stations in Porttipahta (means of 2.5-4.8 mg m(-2) d(-1)), measured in 1995. The mean CO2 emission rates in Lokka (21-133 mg m(-2) h(-1)) and Porttipahta (36-95 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) were more similar. The chamber measurements could not detect episodic CH4 ebullition in Lokka Reservoir, indicated by generally higher CH4 fluxes (means of 2.6-660 mg m(-2) d(-1)) obtained with bubble gas collectors than with the chambers. The seasonal mean N2O fluxes were generally low, ranging from -89 to 270 mug m(-2) d(-1). There was no clear association between the CH4 emissions and the bottom type, including mineral soils and old peat deposits. The flooded vegetation, higher nutrient content, and primary production in the water column rather than old peat could account for the higher CH4 emissions from the stations in Lokka. This conclusion is supported by the high content of modern carbon (C) in methane (percent modern C of 92-104%) that was extracted from the sediment of Lokka. The results suggested that if there is a good long-term availability of phosphorus and nitrogen, the intensive internal C cycle associated with the primary production could maintain high CH4 and CO2 production for decades, similar to the situation in eutrophied natural lakes.

AB Subarctic and boreal emissions of CH4 are important contributors to the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and subsequently the global radiative forcing. Whilst N2O emissions may be lower, the much greater radiative forcing they produce justifies their inclusion in GHG studies. In addition to the quantification of flux magnitude, it is essential that we understand the drivers of emissions to be able to accurately predict climate-driven changes and potential feedback mechanisms. Hence this study aims to increase our understanding of what drives fluxes of CH4 and N2O in a subarctic forest/wetland landscape during peak summer conditions and into the shoulder season, exploring both spatial and temporal variability, and uses satellite-derived spectral data to extrapolate from chamber-scale fluxes to a 2 km x 2 km landscape area.
   From static chamber measurements made during summer and autumn campaigns in 2012 in the Sodankyl region of northern Finland, we concluded that wetlands represent a significant source of CH4 (3.35 +/- 0.44 mgCm(-2) h(-1) during the summer campaign and 0.62 +/- 0.09 mgCm(-2) h(-1) during the autumn campaign), whilst the surrounding forests represent a small sink (0.06 +/- < 0.01 mg Cm-2 h(-1) during the summer campaign and -0.03 +/- < 0.01 mg Cm-2 h(-1) during the autumn campaign). N2O fluxes were near- zero across both ecosystems.
   We found a weak negative relationship between CH4 emissions and water table depth in the wetland, with emissions decreasing as the water table approached and flooded the soil surface and a positive relationship between CH4 emissions and the presence of Sphagnum mosses. Temperature was also an important driver of CH4 with emissions increasing to a peak at approximately 12 degrees C. Little could be determined about the drivers of N2O emissions given the small magnitude of the fluxes.
   A multiple regression modelling approach was used to describe CH4 emissions based on spectral data from PLEIADES PA1 satellite imagery across a 2 km x 2 km landscape. When applied across the whole image domain we calculated a CH4 source of 2.05 +/- 0.61 mgCm(-2) h(-1). This was significantly higher than landscape estimates based on either a simple mean or weighted by forest/wetland proportion ( 0.99 +/- 0.16, 0.93 +/- 0.12 mgCm(-2) h(-1), respectively). Hence we conclude that ignoring the detailed spatial variability in CH4 emissions within a landscape leads to a potentially significant underestimation of landscape-scale fluxes. Given the small magnitude of measured N2O fluxes a similar level of detailed upscaling was not needed; we conclude that N2O fluxes do not currently comprise an important component of the landscape-scale GHG budget at this site.

AB Summertime measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were carried out over a range of high-arctic ecosystem types in the valley Zackenbergdalen since 1996 using both chamber and eddy covariance methodology. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange and CH4 flux data presented reveal a high degree of inter-annual variability within the dominant vegetation types in the valley, but also show distinct differences between them. In particular, the wet and dry parts of the valley show distinct differences. In general, the wet parts of the valley, the fens dominated by white cotton grass Eriophorum scheuchzeri, show high productivity, also in comparison with other sites, whereas CO2 uptake rates in the white arctic bell heather Cassiope tetragona and mountain avens Dryas spp.-dominated heaths are much smaller.
   Also within the different ecosystem types, a high degree of spatial variability can be documented. The spatial variability both within and between ecosystem types is especially pronounced for the CH4 flux and can, at least partly, be related to differences in vegetation composition and water table level. The importance of the CH4 emission from the various ecosystem types is evaluated both in relation to carbon and greenhouse gas budgets. In both wet and drier ecosystem components, inter-annual variability seems best explained through differences in the amount and distribution of snow in spring and the length of the growing season.
   A large number of replicate chamber measurements carried out over various vegetation types in the valley are used to produce a synthesis of 10 years of flux data available on growing season carbon dynamics and CH4 emission patterns in the individual parts of this high-arctic ecosystem and relates the differences between the ecosystems found in Zackenbergdalen to comparable sites in the circumpolar North.

AB The eddy flux of methane (CH4) was measured over 14 months above a restored wetland in western Denmark. The average annual daily CH4 flux was 30.2 mg m(-2) d(-1), but the daily emission rates varied considerably over time. Several factors were identified that explained some of this variation. (1) Grazing cattle moving through the source area of the eddy flux mast increased the measured emission rates by one order of magnitude during short time periods. (2) Friction velocity exerted a strong control on the CH4 flux whenever there were water pools on the surface. (3) An exponential response of the daily CH4 flux to soil temperature at 20 cm depth was found for most of the study period, but not for parts of the summer season that coincided with a low water level in the river flowing through the wetland. (4) Additional variations in the CH4 emission rates were related to the spatial heterogeneity of the source area. This area covered not only different plant communities but also a gravel road and a river surface, and it had a microtopography that visibly induced a large spatial variability in the wetness of the top soil. It is shown that the control mechanisms for the methane emission from restored wetlands are more complex than those reported for natural wetlands, since they include both management activities and slow adaptive processes related to changes in vegetation and hydrology. On the basis of eddy fluxes of carbon dioxide measured at the same site it is finally demonstrated that the variability in the CH4 fluxes strongly affects the greenhouse gas sink strength of the restored wetland.

AB The dynamics of nitrogen oxide emission from peat soils has been studied. The dependence between the emission of greenhouse gases and the duration of cultivation of peat soils is revealed. Low rates of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are typical of peat soils with the longest period of cultivation (more than 80 years), whereas maximum emissions of greenhouse gases are typical of peat soil at the beginning of their cultivation. The highest rates of emission and sink of greenhouse gases have been registered in the late June and early August.

AB Animal slurries and effluents are commonly applied to soil as a source of organic N fertilizer. By increasing inorganic N, applying animal effluents may also increase soil nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions. Our objectives were to (I) determine if dairy farm effluent (DFE) irrigation increased short-term N(2)O emissions from a surface-drained peat soil and a freely drained mineral soil and (ii) see if this increase could be attributed to increased N availability, increased soil water content, or a combination of both factors. We measured short-term N(2)O emissions following DFE irrigation in spring and autumn, using closed chambers. Nitrous oxide emissions from DFE-irrigated soils (50 kg N ha-1, 20-mm hydraulic loading) were compared with soils receiving inorganic nitrogen and water (50 kg N ha (-1), 20 mm), inorganic N only (50 kg N ha-1), water only (20 mm), and no treatment. Nitrous oxide emissions Increased immediately following DFE irrigation to both soils, and were generally greater than emissions following the application of inorganic fertilizer with water. Increased N(2)O emissions following DFE irrigation coincided with increased soil water contents and mineral N and CO(2) emissions. We suggest that DFE application increased N(2)O emissions more than inorganic N fertilizer by enhancing denitrification either by increasing C availability and/ or decreasing soil aeration following increased respiration. These findings suggest that the proportion of N applied to the soil and emitted as N(2)O may at times be greater for organic N fertilizers than inorganic N fertilizers, particularly if the organic N fertilizer contains sufficient available C to enhance denitrification.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from drained organic (Histosol) and mineral (Umbrisol) soils having a 60 year old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest in a catchment in southwest Sweden were measured using static closed chambers every other week over 3 years (August 2010 - July 2013). High emissions were observed during the summer months for both sites, which were significantly higher for the drained organic soils compared to the mineral soils: average emissions of 49.0 +/- 3.3 and 8.0 +/- 3.3 mu g N2O.m(-2).h(-1), respectively. As the experiment was designed to have similar forest and weather conditions for both sites, these were omitted as explanatory factors for the emission difference. Initially, the soil organic matter concentration (percent by mass) difference was thought to be the cause. However, the results found that the soil organic matter amount per square metre of top soil was similar at both sites, suggesting other possible explanations. We propose that the most plausible explanation is that higher tree growth and mycorrhizal nitrogen demand reduce nitrogen availability contributing to the lower N2O emissions from the mineral soil site.

AB Tall wetland graminoids with rapid growth, high productivity and wide tolerance of biotic and abiotic stresses are potentially valuable bioenergy crops, especially when grown in rewetted peat soils for biomass (paludiculture). Using wetland plants as renewable bioenergy crops instead of fossil fuels has the ecological benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improving water quality and conserving peat soils. As these potential crops will grow in peat that differs in nutrient availability, not only will their biomass productivity be affected, but also the biomass quality for bioenergy may be altered. We set up live different nutrient availability treatments in waterlogged peat soil to simulate different nutrient environments for wetland plant cultivation. Seven wetland plants suitable for paludiculture (Typha latifolia, Arundo plinii, Arundo donax and four distinct genotypes of Phrcigmites austratis from Denmark, The Netherlands, Romania and Italy) were selected to test responses of biomass production and tissue quality to different nutrient availability. Due to their high biomass productivity, T. latifolia, A. donax, Dutch (NL) and Romanian (RO) P. australis had the greatest potential to produce bioenergy feedstock. All taxa survived when cultivated with very low nutrient availability, especially NL and RO P. austratis and tatifolia. Moreover, biomass quality was both species-specific and element-specific, affected by increasing nutrient availability. Overall, T. latifolia had the lowest tissue concentrations of S and Si as well as high concentrations of Ca, and therefore the best tissue quality for combustion both at low and high nutrient availability. These results will provide crucial information for choosing appropriate crops and managements and promote the success of culturing wetland plants as bioenergy feedstock. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two Finnish agricultural soils (peat soil and loamy sand) were exposed to four freeze-thaw cycles (FTC), with a temperature change from -17.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C to +4.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C. Control cores from both soils were kept at constant temperature (+6.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) without FTCs. Soil N2O and CO2 emissions were monitored during soil thawing, and the effects of FTCs on soil microbes were studied. N2O emissions were extremely low in peat soil, possibly due to low soil water content. Loamy sand had high N2O emission, with the highest emission after the second FTC. Soil freeze-thaw increased anaerobic respiration in both soil types during the first 3-4 FTCs, and this increase was higher in the peat soil. The microbial community structure and biomass analysed with lipid biomarkers (phospholipid fatty acids, 3- and 2- hydroxy fatty acids) were not affected by freezing-thawing cycles, nor was soil microbial biomass carbon (MIB-C). Molecular analysis of the microbial community structure with temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) also showed no changes due the FTCs. These results show that freezing and thawing of boreal soils does not have a strong effect on microbial biomass or community structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Constructed wetlands are nowadays successfully employed :Is an alternative technology for wastewater and sewage sludge treatment. In these systems organic matter and nutrients are transformed and removed by a variety of microbial reaction and gaseous compounds such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) may be released to the atmosphere. The aim of this work is to introduce a method to determine greenhouse gas emissions from sludge treatment wetlands (STW) and use the method in a full-scale system. Sampling and analysing techniques used to determine greenhouse gas emissions from croplands and natural wetlands were successfully adapted to the quantification of CH4 and N2O emissions from an STW. Gas emissions were measured using the static chamber technique in 9 points of the STW during 13 days. The spatial variation in the emission along the wetland did not follow some specific pattern found for the temporal variation in the fluxes. Emissions ranged from 10 to 5400 mgCH(4)/m(2)d and from 20 to 950 mgN(2)O/m(2)d, depending on the feeding events. The comparison between the CH4 and N2O emissions of different sludge management options shows that STW have the lowest atmospheric impact in terms of CO2 equivalent emissions (Global warming potential with time horizon of 100 years): 17 kgCO(2)eq/PEy for STW, 36 kgCO(2)eq/PEy for centrifuge and 162 kgCO(2)eq/PEy for untreated sludge transport, PE means Population Equivalent.

AB [1] The surface-atmospheric exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) was investigated in the vegetated littoral zone of a eutrophied midboreal lake (Lake Kevaton, Finland) with a static chamber technique. During a dry summer (three to six samplings per site), the meadow site and two marsh sites in the temporarily flooded eulittoral zone and the Phragmites australis-dominated site in the continuously flooded infralittoral zone had mean daytime N2O-N emissions from 11 +/- 7 to 22 +/- 7 mug m(-2) h(-1), whereas the Nuphar lutea-dominated site in the infralittoral zone had a mean N2O flux close to zero. During a wet summer (13-14 samplings per site), the mean daytime N2O-N fluxes ranged from 4 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 5 mg m(-2) h(-1) at the three eulittoral sites and were negligible at the two infralittoral sites. The littoral zone occupied 26% of the lake area but was estimated to account for most of the N2O emissions from the lake. The studied eulittoral zone, which did not have adjacent nitrogen fertilization, exhibited higher N2O emissions during the summer than seen in northern natural ecosystems in general, including peatlands, forests, and the pelagic regions of lakes. Thus in lake-rich landscapes the littoral zone and other lake-associated wetlands must be considered as potential sources of atmospheric N2O. An assessment of their atmospheric importance requires further data on the N2O fluxes and their regulation in different littoral areas and on the total littoral coverage, neither of which is yet available.

AB Methane (CH4) oxidation in soils is the only known biological sink of CH4. The sink strength of agricultural soils is known to be affected by soil properties and agricultural practices. We studied fluxes of CH4 in southern and northern Finland in arable soils with different texture and crops. The annual fluxes ranged from uptake of -1.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) to emission of 40 kg CH4 ha(-1). The CH4 oxidation decreased in the order loamy sand > well drained peat > clay > poorly drained peat. The more there were macropores or the less there were micropores in the soil, the higher was the mean annual CH4 oxidation rate. Calculated on the basis of the soil type specific CH4 flux rates from our study and the soil type distribution of Finnish agricultural soils, the total agricultural area in Finland would form an annual CH4 sink of -19 Gg CO2 equiv., which is 0.3% of the total reported greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in 2004.

AB The ornamental plant nursery industry is the most important economic resource of Pistoia, a city situated in Tuscany in the center-north of Italy. The production of plants offers many benefits in the social and environmental spheres: it generates employment, improves the landscape and gives a contribution to carbon dioxide accumulation. On the other hand, nurseries are considered intensive agricultural systems, responsible for soil erosion, waste production, and soil, air and water pollution. The research presented in this paper aimed to quantify the environmental impact, in terms of GHG (Green House Gases) emissions of different nursery typologies (in-pot and in-field grown plants) and productions (small, medium and large size plants). For this reason, a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) approach was carried out in seven different nurseries on eleven production lines. GWP (Global Warming Potential) was the impact category chosen for this analysis, and the square meter was used as functional unit to represent the differences between nursery and plant typologies, although data for "product" unit are shown as well. Results show that in-pot systems, with an emissions range of 7.444-26.489 kg of CO2-e are much more impacting than in-field grown production processes (0.607-1.013 kg of CO2-e). Such great differences are mainly due to the peat used in substrate mixes and the plastic used for pots, indeed these are the most important sources of GHG emissions, and are widely used in in-pot production, while they are not present in infield processes. The final part of the paper is devoted to a comparison of results obtained in Pistoia and other research conducted in the U.S. in order to evaluate the differences in total CO2 emissions between different plant production processes and to offer some recommendations about how to reduce GHG emissions in ornamental plant nurseries.

AB [1] Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured in hyper-eutrophic Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu by the static chamber method for two years. The lake was an important source of atmospheric N2O. Large temporal variations were recorded for N2O fluxes, ranging from -278 to 2101 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1) in the littoral zone and from -177 to 164 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1) in the pelagic zone, with the highest N2O emissions observed during the algal bloom. Wide spatial variation in N2O fluxes occurred in the littoral zone responding to water-sediment variables, while such variation was not found in the pelagic zone. In the infralittoral zone, the redox condition, temperature and nitrogen (N) sources controlled the N2O fluxes, whereas the influences of these parameters on N2O fluxes were weak in the pelagic zone. This difference indicated that N cycling was more intensive in the littoral zone than in the pelagic zone. A multiple linear regression model against principal components indicated that water-column denitrification and the carbon (C) and N contents of the sediment affected the N2O exchange in the infralittoral zone. Water-column inorganic N content affected the consumption of atmospheric N2O significantly in both zones.

AB Soils are sources of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, but emissions from permafrost-affected soils have been considered negligible owing to nitrogen (N) limitation. Recent measurements of N2O emissions have challenged this view, showing that vegetated soils in permafrost regions are often small but evident sources of N2O during the growing season (similar to 30 mu g N2O-N m(-2) day(-1)). Moreover, barren or sparsely vegetated soils, common in harsh climates, can serve as substantial sources of N2O (similar to 455 mu g N2O-N m(-2) day(-1)), demonstrating the importance of permafrost-affected soils in Earth's N2O budget. In this Review, we discuss N2O fluxes from subarctic, Arctic, Antarctic and alpine permafrost regions, including areas that likely serve as sources (such as peatlands) and as sinks (wetlands, dry upland soils), and estimate global permafrost-affected soil N2O emissions from previously published fluxes. We outline the below-ground N cycle in permafrost regions and examine the environmental conditions influencing N2O dynamics. Climate-change-related impacts on permafrost ecosystems and how these impacts could alter N2O fluxes are reviewed, and an outlook on the major questions and research needs to better constrain the global impact of permafrost N2O emissions is provided.

AB Forest clear-cutting followed by soil preparation means disturbance for soil microorganisms and disruption of N and C cycles. We measured fluxes of N2O and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in upland soil (podzol) and adjacent peat within a clear-cut forest catchment. Both soil types behaved in a similar way, showing net uptake of N2O in the first year after the clear-cutting, and turning to net release in the second. The N2O flux dynamics were similar to those of N content in logging residues, as reported from a nearby site. As organic matter is used in the food web of the decomposers, we attempted to explain the dynamics of N2O uptake and release by measuring the concurrent dynamics of the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction and the aromaticity of DOC in a soil solution. The labile and most readily available LMW fractions of DOC were nearly absent in the year following the clear-cutting, but rose after two years. The more refractory high molecular weight (HMW) fraction of DOC decreased two years after the clear-cutting. The first year's net uptake of N2O could be accounted for by the growth of decomposer biomass in the logging residues and detritus from the degenerating ground vegetation, resulting in immobilization of nitrogen. Simultaneously, the labile, LMW fraction of DOC became almost completely exhausted. The low availability of the LMW fraction could retard the growth and cause the accumulated decomposer biomass to collapse. During the following winter and summer the fraction of LMW clearly increased, followed by increased N2O emissions. The presence of LMW DOC fractions, not the concentration of DOC, seems to be an important controller for N2O liberation after a major disturbance such as clear-cutting and site preparation. The complex connection between DOC characteristics, nitrification or denitrification merits further studies.

AB Estuarine freshwater marshes can act as an important ecosystem for carbon storage and flux because of its strategic position in a watershed. We monitored CH4 and CO2 fluxes in Old Woman Creek, an estuarine wetland of Lake Erie, Ohio. The eddy covariance (EC) technique was used to measure fluxes of CH4 and CO2 continuously during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. Simultaneously, monthly sampling of gas exchange was conducted using non-steady state chambers in four distinct land-cover types in the wetland: open water, emergent vegetation (Typha spp.), floating vegetation (Nelumbo spp.) and mud flats. Chambers and EC measurements were combined to provide estimates of the continuous contributions of each land cover to the total methane emissions of the wetland. In addition, water and meteorological measurements were used to determine the most important environmental drivers of methane flux in the wetland. We found an average rate of emission from the Typha patch, the most abundant vegetated land cover, of 219.4 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1), which was much higher than rates reported in similar emergent vegetation types in other wetlands. Mud flats had the highest rates of CH4 emission, followed by Nelumbo and Typha patches, and open water. Mud flats contributed 6.8% of the total CH4 emissions of the wetland despite occupying only 1.5% of the wetland area, whereas open water contributed 16.1% despite occupying 47% of the wetland area. Water temperature and wind speed were the strongest environmental drivers of CH4 flux to the atmosphere. Carbon fluxes were strongly correlated to methane fluxes. Fluctuating water levels above the wetland's surface had a weak effect on overall CH4 emissions in the wetland, with stronger effects during the night than during the day. Providing an empirical model that predicts the influence of different environmental drivers CH4 emissions in the wetland can aid in the design of estuarine wetlands that retain nutrients and reduce coastal eutrophication while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and are sources and sinks for the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). We provide an in situ study on variability of daytime CH4 emissions and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) from a permanently submerged, Carex rostrata dominated Swiss alpine fen over the snow-free period (June-October). Flux chamber measurements were combined with analyses of above-ground biomass and physico-chemical pore water properties. The fen was a net daytime CH4 source throughout the snow-free period, and emissions varied significantly between the sampling dates, ranging from 3.1 +/- 0.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in October to 8.0 +/- 2.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in August. The fen was generally a daytime sink for CO2, and net CO2 emission was only observed in late October. Variations in NEE were more pronounced than variations in CH4 emissions, but both fluxes correlated with changes in green C. rostrata biomass and subsurface temperatures. Methane and CO2 pore water concentrations also varied significantly over the snow-free period, decreasing and increasing, respectively. These variations were linked to the development of biomass, but CH4 emissions and NEE were not correlated with the respective pore water concentrations.

AB The non-uniform spatial integration, an inherent feature of the eddy covariance (EC) method, creates a challenge for flux data interpretation in a heterogeneous environment, where the contribution of different land cover types varies with flow conditions, potentially resulting in biased estimates in comparison to the areally averaged fluxes and land cover attributes. We modelled flux footprints and characterized the spatial scale of our EC measurements in Tiksi, a tundra site in northern Siberia. We used leaf area index (LAI) and land cover class (LCC) data, derived from very-high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery and field surveys, and quantified the sensor location bias. We found that methane (CH4) fluxes varied strongly with wind direction (-0.09 to 0.59 mu gCH(4)m(-2) s(-1) on average) during summer 2014, reflecting the distribution of different LCCs. Other environmental factors had only a minor effect on short-term flux variations but influenced the seasonal trend. Using footprint weights of grouped LCCs as explanatory variables for the measured CH4 flux, we developed a multiple regression model to estimate LCC group-specific fluxes. This model showed that wet fen and graminoid tundra patches in locations with topography-enhanced wetness acted as strong sources (1.0 mu gCH(4) m(-2) s(-1) during the peak emission period), while mineral soils were significant sinks (-0.13 mu gCH(4) m(-2) s(-1)). To assess the representativeness of measurements, we upscaled the LCC group-specific fluxes to different spatial scales. Despite the landscape heterogeneity and rather poor representativeness of EC data with respect to the areally averaged LAI and coverage of some LCCs, the mean flux was close to the CH4 balance upscaled to an area of 6.3 km(2), with a location bias of 14 %. We recommend that EC site descriptions in a heterogeneous environment should be complemented with footprint-weighted high-resolution data on vegetation and other site characteristics.

AB Thermokarst (alas) of Central Yakutia is an intrazonal dynamic landscape in the form of rounded depressions with peculiar soils and meadow vegetation, microclimate, and fauna that are very different from the surrounding typical taiga landscapes. During the formation of alas depression, complete processing of thawed ground with the formation of new soils occurs and entirely changes the biogeochemical cycle. Because this system is closed, all water-soluble substances, such as N/C and soluble salts, etc., accumulate inside the depression. Using standard methods and instruments, we measured the main properties of alas soils. Depending on the hydrothermal and physicochemical regimes, thawing depth, and greenhouse gas (GHG) flux, three main belts of soils and vegetation were distinguished within the alas: (1) steppe meadow, located on most elevated places, not sufficiently moistened, with alas steppe soils and steppe vegetation; (2) middle meadow, located lower than stepped meadow in elevation, normally moist, with alas sod-meadow soils and highest productivity vegetation; and (3) wet meadow, located around the lake, excessively moistened, with alas marshy sod-meadow soils and marsh vegetation. Therefore, the soils of wet and real meadows, due to the abundance of organic matter, are significant sources of CO2 and CH4, especially in humid years. Under the climate warming observed over recent decades in this territory, the alas ecosystem has undergone considerable change. Thus, the classification and mapping of belts within the alas can have both applied and fundamental importance.

AB Measuring and modelling the efflux of greenhouse gases from soils is crucial for gauging ecosystem responses to climate and land-use change, and potential contributions and feedbacks to gas emissions. Upland soils with high amounts of organic matter can produce large effluxes of CH4 and potentially N2O, and therefore understanding the sensitivity of such fluxes to changes in climate (e.g. temperature) is of importance. Here we consider the role of shallow podzols in the temperature response of CH4 and N2O efflux using a simple laboratory incubation. Such soils have a shallow peat layer overlain by coarse organic matter, and by splitting and incubating these layers across a 1-30 degrees C temperature ramp, we observed a significant negative temperature response for both gases, and a gas-dependent effect on the presence of a between-layer difference. Given these observations, there is a need to consider the temperature sensitivity of near surface layers as distinct, and to recognise the potential for shallow podzols to have a strong source sink transition across temperature ranges.

AB The fluxes of carbon dioxide and energy were measured by the eddy covariance method for four contrasting ecosystems within the Pallas area in northern Finland: Kenttarova spruce forest, open Lompolojanldca wetland, treeless top of Sammaltunturi fell, and Pallasjarvi which is a lake. Clear differences in carbon and energy exchange were found among these ecosystems, in both the instantaneous fluxes and the related longer-term balances. The available solar energy and its partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes differed markedly among the sites. The characteristics of the CO2 exchange at individual sites varied in terms of the maximum uptake and emission capacity and the associated responses to environmental drivers. The highest instantaneous fluxes were observed over wetland and forest. The mean annual balance showed a considerable net uptake at the wetland, while the balances of the fell top and the forest were both close to zero. The lake, on the other hand, was estimated to be a relatively large source of carbon dioxide. An upscaling exercise based on the actual land-use map of the surroundings demonstrated the importance of including all the major ecosystems in the landscape CO2 balance.

AB Boreal peatlands store an enormous pool of soil carbon that is dependent upon - and vulnerable to changes in - climate, as well as plant community composition. However, how nutrient availability affects the effects of climate and vegetation change on ecosystem processes in these nutrient-poor ecosystems remains unclear. Here we show that although warming promoted higher CH4 emissions, the concurrent addition of N counteracted most (79%) of this effect. The regulation effects of the vegetation functional group, associated with the substrate quality, suggest that CH4 emissions from peatlands under future warming will be less than expected with predicted shrub expansion. In contrast, N2O flux will be enhanced under future warming with predicted shrub expansion. Our study suggests that changes in greenhouse gas emissions in response to future warming and shifts in plant community composition depend on N availability, which reveals the complex interactions that occur when N is not a limiting nutrient.

AB An assay system was evaluated for denitrification measurement with potted ornamental plants cultivated in peat substrate (Pelargonium zonale, Euphorbia pulcherrima). Flow-through chambers only enclosing the pot of the plants were considered best for denitrification measurement. Loss of N2O from the chambers by transport through the plant shoot was negligible with both species. To determine (N2O + N-2)-N loss, C2H2 was applied to inhibit reduction of N2O. Experiments were conducted with unplanted substrate in closed incubation systems to determine optimum C2H2 concentration and pre-treatment duration. Complete inhibition of N2O reduction in peat substrate was achieved using 1 vol% C2H2. However, a concentration of 5 vol% C2H2 was chosen for further experiments because C2H2 concentrations in flow-through chambers varied. The duration of C2H2 pre-treatment (0, 2, 12, 24 h) showed no clear effect on (N2O + N-2)-N accumulation. However, a pre-treatment duration of 2 h was chosen to guarantee immediate inhibition of N2O reductase at the start of experiments. Exposure to C2H2 gas proved to affect plants of both species. During C2H2 exposition in flow-through chambers, the leaves of P. zonale became chlorotic (48 h) and necrotic (72 h). E. pulcherrima showed no chlorosis but did exhibit leaf epinasty (24 h) and wilting (96 h). Transpiration of P. zonale and C availability in the growing medium of both species were not affected by 52 h and 24 h treatments with C2H2, respectively. As N emissions usually ended within 38 h of C2H2 treatment, it was concluded that side effects of C2H2 did not affect denitrification measurements.

AB A 45-day incubation experiment in laboratory was conducted to examine the effects of the carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) additions on carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from two alpine meadow soils sampled on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: one with acid pH and high organic carbon content (HM), and the other one with alkaline pH and low organic carbon content (CM). The concentrations of DOC, NO3--N, NH4+-N and DTN in soils were measured at the end of the incubation. Addition of C significantly increased soil CO2 and N2O emissions in both alpine meadow soils. No significant effect of P addition on CO2 and N2O emission was detected in both soils. Data analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the cumulative CO2 emissions and the soil DOC concentration, and a significant negative correlation between the cumulative N2O emissions and soil NO3--N concentration. These results suggest that soil CO2 and N2O emission is directly linked to the availability of soil C, while P is not the limiting factor for soil microbial activity in alpine meadow soils.

AB Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured in wetlands in Liminganlahti (Baltic Sea) in the vicinity of the estuaries of the Lumijoki and Temmesjoki. Wetlands were significant sources of CH4, with a mean flux of 206 mg m(-2) d(-1). Methane fluxes correlated positively with temperature and were slightly higher from the wetland of the Lumijoki, where water SO42- concentrations were lower. On average, the wetland close to the Temmesjoki was a small source of N2O (mean flux of 131 mu g m(-2) d(-1)), whereas the wetland close to the Lumijoki was a small sink for N2O (mean flux of 131 mu g m(-2) d(-1)). The higher availability of nitrogen in the wetland near the Temmesjoki obviously induced the higher N2O fluxes. Estuarine wetlands seem to be important Sources of atmospheric CH4 but do not represent an important source of N2O although increased N loading.

AB 1. Diel variation in metabolism contributes to variation in oxygen (O-2) concentrations in streams. This variation in O-2 and other parameters (e.g. pH) can in turn affect the rates of microbial nitrogen (N) processing, concentrations of nitrogenous solutes and production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). We investigated diel variability in emissions of N2O and the magnitude of short-term variability in N solutes across 10 streams.
   2. Nitrous oxide fluxes varied on average 2.3-fold over diel cycles. Concentrations would be underestimated by sampling around noon, but N2O fluxes would not show a consistent bias. Time-weighted mean daily N2O flux was strongly related to nitrate concentration (r(2) = 0.58). Diel patterns in N2O and dissolved N species were often complex (rather than simple sinusoidal curves), probably reflecting complex underlying processes.
   3. Reliance on samples obtained around noon would overestimate daily mean nitrate concentrations by 5% and underestimate ammonium by 32% (average bias across all streams and dates).
   4. Dissolved organic N did not show consistent day-night variation. However, the magnitude of diel variability was similar to that observed for dissolved inorganic N. Organic and inorganic N concentrations were often similar. Both appear to be dynamic components of stream N budgets.
   5. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) relies upon an emission factor to estimate indirect agricultural N2O emissions from streams and ground water. The measured emission factor (defined as the ratio of concentrations of N2O-N to NO3--N) was typically below the recently revised IPCC default figure. Measured values varied on average 1.8-fold over approximately 24-h periods and were slightly higher at night than by day. The emission factor was actually highest in streams that were net sinks for N2O, highlighting a conceptual problem in the current IPCC method.
   6. Typical sampling programmes rely on daytime-only sampling, which might cause bias in results. In our study streams, the bias was generally small. Diel variation in nitrate concentrations was related to mean temperature; variation in ammonium and N2O concentrations was greatest at low concentrations of nitrite and ammonium.

AB Peat is used as rooting medium in greenhouse horticulture. Biochar is a sustainable alternative for the use of peat, which will reduce peat derived carbon dioxide emissions. Biochar in potting soil mixtures allegedly increases water storage, nutrient supply, microbial life and disease suppression but this depends on feedstock and the production process. The aim of this paper is to find combinations of feedstock and production circumstances which will deliver biochars with value for the horticultural end user. Low-temperature (600 degrees C-750 degrees C) gasification was used for combined energy and biochar generation. Biochars produced were screened in laboratory tests and selected biochars were used in plant experiments. Tests included dry bulk density, total pore space, specific surface area, phytotoxicity, pH, EC, moisture characteristics and microbial stability. We conclude that biochars from nutrient-rich feedstocks are too saline and too alkaline to be applied in horticultural rooting media. Biochars from less nutrient-rich feedstocks can be conveniently neutralized by mixing with acid peat. The influence of production parameters on specific surface area, pH, total pore space and toxicity is discussed. Biochar mildly improved the survival of beneficial micro-organisms in a mix with peat. Overall, wood biochar can replace at least 20% v/v of peat in potting soils without affecting plant growth.

AB Boreal rivers and streams are known as hot spots of CO2 emissions, yet their contribution to CH4 emissions has traditionally been assumed to be negligible, due to the spatially fragmented data and lack of regional studies addressing both gases simultaneously. Here we explore the regional patterns in river CO2 and CH4 concentrations (pCO(2) and pCH(4)), gas exchange coefficient (k), and the resulting emissions in a lowland boreal region of Northern Quebec. Rivers and streams were systematically supersaturated in both gases, with both pCO(2) and pCH(4) declining along the river continuum. The k was on average low and increased with stream order, consistent with the hydrology of this flat landscape. The smallest streams (order 1), which represent <20% of the total river surface, contributed over 35% of the total fluvial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The end of winter and the spring thaw periods, which are rarely included in annual emission budgets, contributed on average 21% of the annual GHG emissions. As a whole, the fluvial network acted as significant source of both CO2 and CH4, releasing on average 1.5 tons of C (CO2 eq) yr(-1)km(-2) of landscape, of which CH4 emissions contributed approximately 34%. We estimate that fluvial CH4 emissions represent 41% of the regional aquatic (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) CH4 emissions, despite the relatively small riverine surface (4.3% of the total aquatic surface). We conclude that these fluvial networks in boreal lowlands play a disproportionately large role as hot spots for CO2 and more unexpectedly for CH4 emissions.

AB Landscapes can be viewed as spatially heterogeneous areas encompassing terrestrial and aquatic domains. To date, most landscape carbon (C) fluxes have been estimated by accounting for terrestrial ecosystems, while aquatic ecosystems have been largely neglected. However, a robust assessment of C fluxes on the landscape scale requires the estimation of fluxes within and between both landscape components. Here, we compiled data from the literature on C fluxes across the air-water interface from various landscape components. We simulated C emissions and uptake for five different scenarios which represent a gradient of increasing spatial heterogeneity within a temperate young moraine landscape: (I) a homogeneous landscape with only cropland and large lakes; (II) separation of the terrestrial domain into cropland and forest; (III) further separation into cropland, forest, and grassland; (IV) additional division of the aquatic area into large lakes and peatlands; and (V) further separation of the aquatic area into large lakes, peatlands, running waters, and small water bodies These simulations suggest that C fluxes at the landscape scale might depend on spatial heterogeneity and landscape diversity, among other factors. When we consider spatial heterogeneity and diversity alone, small inland waters appear to play a pivotal and previously underestimated role in landscape greenhouse gas emissions that may be regarded as C hot spots. Approaches focusing on the landscape scale will also enable improved projections of ecosystems' responses to perturbations, e.g., due to global change and anthropogenic activities, and evaluations of the specific role individual landscape components play in regional C fluxes.

AB Soils are both a major source and sink of nitrous oxide (N2O), but the proportion of soil N2O production released to the atmosphere (termed the N2O yield) is poorly constrained due to the difficulty in measuring gross N2O production. The quantification of gross N2O fluxes would greatly improve our ability to predict N2O dynamics across the soil-atmosphere interface. We report a new approach, the (N2O)-N-15 pool dilution technique, to measure rates of gross N2O production and consumption under laboratory and field conditions. In the laboratory, gross N2O production and consumption compared well between the (N2O)-N-15 pool dilution and acetylene inhibition methods whereas the (NO3)-N-15 tracer method measured significantly higher rates. In the field, N2O emissions were not significantly affected by increasing chamber headspace concentrations up to 100 ppb (N2O)-N-15. The pool dilution model estimates of (N2O)-N-14 and (N2O)-N-15 concentrations as well as net N2O fluxes fit observed data very well, suggesting that the technique yielded robust estimates of gross N2O production. Estimated gross N2O consumption rates were underestimated relative to rates calculated as the difference between gross and net N2O production rates, possibly due to heterogeneous and/or inadequate tracer diffusion to deeper layers in the soil profile. Gross N2O production rates were high, averaging 8.4 +/- 3.2 mg N m(-2) day(-1), and were most strongly correlated to mineral nitrogen concentrations and denitrifying enzyme activity (R-2 = 0.73). Gross N2O production rates varied spatially, with the highest rates in soils with the best drainage and the highest mineral N availability. Estimated and calculated N2O consumption rates constrained the average N2O yield from 0.70 to 0.84. Our results demonstrate that the (N2O)-N-15 pool dilution technique can provide well-constrained estimates of N2O yields and field rates of gross N2O production correlated to soil characteristics, improving our understanding of terrestrial N2O dynamics.

AB Drained organic soils contribute substantial amounts of nitrous oxide to the global atmosphere, and we should be able to estimate this contribution. We have investigated when the fluxes of N2O from drained forested or cultivated organic soils could be determined by calculating the fluxes from the concentration gradients of the gas in soil or snow according to Fick's law of diffusion. A static chamber method was applied as a control technique for the gas gradient method. Concentrations of N2O in soil varied from 296 nl l(-1) to 8534 nl l(-1) during the snow-free periods and were greatest in the early summer. Our results suggest that the gas gradient method can be used to estimate N2O emissions from drained organic soils. There was some systematic difference in the N2O fluxes measured with these two methods, which we attributed to the differences in weather between years 1996 and 1997. In the wet summer of 1996 the chamber method gave greater flux rates than the gas gradient method, and the reverse was true in the dry summer of 1997. In the forest the N2O fluxes measured with the two methods agreed well. The gas gradient is convenient and fast for measuring N2O emissions from fairly dry organic unfrozen soil. In winter the diffusion calculation based on the N2O gradients in snow and the chamber method gave fairly similar flux rates and provided adequate estimates of the fluxes of N2O in winter.

AB Peatlands represent a vast store of global carbon(1). Observations of rapidly rising dissolved organic carbon concentrations in rivers draining peatlands have created concerns that those stores are beginning to destabilize(2,3). Three main factors have been put forward as potential causal mechanisms, but it appears that two alternatives-warming(2,4) and increased river discharge(3)-cannot offer satisfactory explanations(5). Here we show that the third proposed mechanism, namely shifting trends in the proportion of annual rainfall arriving in summer(6), is similarly unable to account for the trend. Instead we infer that a previously unrecognized mechanism-carbon dioxide mediated stimulation of primary productivity-is responsible. Under elevated carbon dioxide levels, the proportion of dissolved organic carbon derived from recently assimilated carbon dioxide was ten times higher than that of the control cases. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon appear far more sensitive to environmental drivers that affect net primary productivity than those affecting decomposition alone.

AB Soil denitrification activity can be highly variable due to the effects of varied land use management practices within catchments on the biogeochemical regulators of denitrification. To test this assumption in the context of mixed-use rural catchments, it was hypothesised that the relative magnitude of denitrification activity may be regulated, among others, by a gradient of soil nitrate (low to high) between organic (peat bog, heathland, and acid grassland), forest (coniferous and deciduous), and grassland (improved and semi-improved) rural land use types. The denitrification potential (DP) of organic, forest and grassland soils, in two UK catchments was measured in the laboratory. Land use type significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the DP, which ranged between 0.02 and 63.3 mg N m(-2) h(-1). The averaged DP of organic and forest soils (1.08 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) was 3 and 10 times less than the DP of semi-improved (4.06 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) and improved (12.09 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) grassland soils, respectively; and among others, nitrate correlated positively (p < 0.05) with the DP. The results indicated that the difference in soil nitrate concentration between organic (naturally low in nitrate availability) and grassland soils (nitrate enriched due to land management) partially regulated the extent of DP. In the absence of N fertilisation, except for the atmospheric N deposition, the relatively low net nitrification potential (as a source of nitrate for denitrifiers) of organic and forest soils alone seem to have resulted in lower denitrifier's activity compared to grassland soils. Moreover, the interactions between soil organic carbon, pH, bulk density, water filled pore space, and texture, as these are influenced by the relative degree of land management, exerted additional controls on the DP. The results suggest that land management can have significant effects on denitrification, and thus needs to be considered when modelling and/or predicting the response of denitrification to land use change.

AB In this study, we conducted an incubation experiment on a frozen soil core collected from a black spruce forest in Interior Alaska, in order to investigate potential changes in greenhouse gaseous (GHG) and microbial dynamics during thawing of frozen soil. The soil thawing is an important environmental process determining the annual GHG balance in the northern high-latitude ecosystem. A core spanning the ground surface to upper permafrost with a depth of 90 cm was vertically grouped into three layers (top, middle, and bottom layers). Then, 12 soil samples from 3 layers (i.e., 4 soil samples per layer) were incubated for 3 weeks, and net carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) release/uptake rates were estimated. During the incubation, temperature was changed weekly from 0 to 5, then 10 degrees C. The net amounts of CO2 released by six of the eight soil samples from the top and middle layers were 1.5-19.2-fold greater at 5 degrees C than at 0 degrees C, while the release at 10 degrees C was reduced in the cases of three of these six soil samples. Net CH4 release was the greatest in bottom-layer soil samples incubated at 0 degrees C. Then, low but apparent CH4 release was observed in top and middle-layer soil samples incubated at 0 degrees C. At 5 and 10 degrees C, net CH4 release from bottom-layer soil samples was decreased. Then, net CH4 uptake was observed in the top and the middle-layer soil samples. Both net uptake and release of CH4 were reduced upon the addition of a chemical inhibitor (i.e., 2-bromoethane sulfonate) of anaerobic methanotrophic and methanogenic activity. The bacterial and archaeal community structures based on 16S rRNA amplicon analysis were changed along the depth, while they were less changed during thawing. Thus, it was found that soil GHG dynamics responded sensitively and variously to thawing, while there was less change in 16S rRNA-based microbial community structures during the thawing progress.

AB Restoration of degraded land is recognized by the international community as an important way of enhancing both biodiversity and ecosystem services, but more information is needed about its costs and benefits. In Cambridgeshire, U.K., a long-term initiative to convert drained, intensively farmed arable land to a wetland habitat mosaic is driven by a desire both to prevent biodiversity loss from the nationally important Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve (Wicken Fen NNR) and to increase the provision of ecosystem services. We evaluated the changes in ecosystem service delivery resulting from this land conversion, using a new Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) to estimate biophysical and monetary values of ecosystem services provided by the restored wetland mosaic compared with the former arable land. Overall results suggest that restoration is associated with a net gain to society as a whole of $199ha(-1)y(-1), for a one-off investment in restoration of $2320ha(-1). Restoration has led to an estimated loss of arable production of $2040ha(-1)y(-1), but estimated gains of $671ha(-1)y(-1) in nature-based recreation, $120ha(-1)y(-1) from grazing, $48ha(-1)y(-1) from flood protection, and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worth an estimated $72ha(-1)y(-1). Management costs have also declined by an estimated $1325ha(-1)y(-1). Despite uncertainties associated with all measured values and the conservative assumptions used, we conclude that there was a substantial gain to society as a whole from this land-use conversion. The beneficiaries also changed from local arable farmers under arable production to graziers, countryside users from towns and villages, and the global community, under restoration. We emphasize that the values reported here are not necessarily transferable to other sites.

AB Cultivation of perennial crops can be an option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils. To determine the carbon budget of a perennial cropping system under the boreal climate, we studied carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange of timothy and meadow fescue mixture (TIM) on a boreal mineral soil. Based on the mean annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), TIM was a sink for both CO2 (-1000 g CO2 m(-2)) and CH4 (-140 mg CH4 m(-2)). In comparison, soil without vegetation (BARE) was a source of CO2 (1300 g CO2 m(-2)). Based on the literature review, the net CO2 uptake of TIM was similar to the perennial cropping systems in northern Finland but higher than that of the annual cropping systems in this region. Our multi-year study shows that the perennial cultivation system based on TIM is an environmentally sustainable land-use option to mitigate agricultural CO2 emissions in regions with short growing seasons.

AB To understand the seasonality of methane flux from alpine wetlands in Zoige Plateau, 30 plots were set to measure the methane emissions in the growing and nongrowing seasons in three environmental types: dry hummock (DH), Carex muliensis (CM), and Eleocharis valleculosa (EV) sites. There were clearly seasonal patterns of methane flux in different environmental types in the growing and nongrowing seasons. Mean methane emission rate was 14.45 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (0.17 to 86.78 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) in the growing season, and 0.556 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (0.002 to 6.722 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) in the nongrowing season. In the growing season, the main maximum values of methane flux were found in July and August, except for a peak value in September in CM sites. In the nongrowing season, the similar seasonal variation pattern was shared among all the three sites, in which the methane emissions increased from February to April. In the growing season, the determining factors were surface temperatures (r(2) = 0.55, P < 0.05), standing water depths (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.01) and plant community heights (r(2) = 0.61, P < 0.01), while in the nongrowing season, ice thickness (r(2) = 0.27, P < 0.05; in CM and EV sites) was found most related to flux. In our understanding, the seasonality of methane emissions in our study areas was temperature- and-plant-growth-dependent, and the water table position was also very important to shape the temperature- and-plant-growth-dependent seasonal variation of flux with its vigorous variations in alpine wetland ecosystems. Different environmental types within the wetland also influenced the seasonal pattern of methane flux. For an accurate estimate of the global methane source strength of alpine wetlands, the pronounced seasonal or even temporal variability in methane emission from alpine wetlands should be taken into consideration.

AB Suppression of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil is commonly observed after amendment with biochar. The mechanisms accounting for this suppression are not yet understood. One possible contributing mechanism is N2O sorption to biochar. The sorption of N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) to four biochars was measured in an anhydrous system with pure N2O. The biochar data were compared to those for two activated carbons and other components potentially present in soils-uncharred pine wood and peat-and five inorganic metal oxides with variable surface areas. Langmuir maximum sorption capacities (Q(max)) for N2O on the pine wood biochars (generated between 250 and 500 degrees C) and activated carbons were 17-73 cm(3) g(-1) at 20 degrees C (median 51 cm(3) g(-1)), with Langmuir affinities (b) of 2-5 atm(-1) (median 3.4 atm(-1)). Both Q(max) and b of the charred materials were substantially higher than those for peat, uncharred wood, and metal oxides [Q(max) 1-34 cm(3) g(-1) (median 7 cm(3) g(-1)); b 0.4-1.7 atm(-1) (median 0.7 atm(-1))]. This indicates that biochar can bind N2O more strongly than both mineral and organic soil materials. Q(max) and b for CO2 were comparable to those for N2O. Modeled sorption coefficients obtained with an independent polyparameterlinear free-energy relationship matched measured data within a factor 2 for mineral surfaces but underestimated by a factor of 5-24 for biochar and carbonaceous surfaces. Isosteric enthalpies of sorption of N2O were mostly between -20 and -30 kJ mol(-1), slightly more exothermic than enthalpies of condensation (-16.1 kJ mol(-1)). Q(max) of N2O on biochar (50000-130000 mu g g(-1) biochar at 20 degrees C) exceeded the N2O emission suppressions observed in the literature (range 0.5-960 mu g g(-1) biochar; median 16 mu g g(-1)) by several orders of magnitude. Thus, the hypothesis could not be falsified that sorption of N2O to biochar is a mechanism of N2O emission suppression.

AB Quantification of the environmental performance of dairy farms should allow comparisons between farms. We assess whether IPCC Tier 1 methodology for emissions from soil management is sufficiently precise to analyse and differentiate the carbon footprint of milk production between practical dairy farms and whether we can correctly identify which farms have the lowest and the highest GHG emissions per product unit, respectively.
   We used data from 20 Norwegian dairy farms which are very similar in structure, but differ in organic/non-organic management and the share of peat soil of their farmland. We assessed the uncertainty of the carbon footprint by running Monte Carlo simulations with the uncertainty ranges given in Tier 1 of the IPCC guidelines. The carbon footprint is considered different when 95% of all Monte Carlo iterations assume that one farm has higher product-related GHG emissions than the farm in comparison.
   The uncertainty of results in the single farms, expressed as two-times the standard deviation divided by the median result, ranges between 4.2% and 15.3%. This means that 95% of values in the resulting distribution of one farm are within a range of 4-16% of the median of that farm. Farms can be differentiated when the variation of the carbon footprint is higher than the uncertainty of farm-related emissions. From all 190 direct comparisons of two farms in the study, 78% are significantly different.
   For this uncertainty assessment, it must be established that background processes, especially the datasets for import feed, can be judged covariant in order to prohibit them from influencing the comparison between farms. Secondly, the uncertainty ranges used for the calculation must be appropriate for the assessed systems.
   We were able to confirm the hypothesis that a significant differentiation of the milk carbon footprint between farms is possible with an IPCC Tier 1 approach for a majority of our comparisons, and found a difference of above 8.7% sufficient to establish significance.

AB Peat mineral soil mix (PMM) and forest floor mineral soil mix (FMM) are cover soils commonly used for land reclamation, while coarse woody debris (CWD) can be added to create structural diversity and provide an additional source of organic matter. However, the effect of cover soil type and CWD on emission rates of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in reclaimed oil sands soils has not been studied. Soil respiration, CH4 uptake and N2O emission rates were studied in a factorial experiment consisting of 2 cover soils (FMM vs PMM) x 2 sampling distances from the CWD (near vs away from CWD). Greenhouse gas emission rates were measured in July, August, and September 2012 and 2013 using static chambers. Soil respiration rates were greater in FMM than in PMM regardless of the distance from CWD at each sampling time (p < 0.05). Rates ranged from 461 to 1148 and 293 to 677 mg CO2 m (2) h (1) for FMM and PMM, respectively, in 2012, and from 355 to 1318 and 235 to 700 mg CO2 m (2) h (1), respectively, in 2013. The CWD increased soil respiration by 22-33% in FMM but not in PMM. Soil respiration rates were positively related to microbial biomass carbon (p = 0.004) and nitrogen (p < 0.001). Soil respiration rates decreased from July to September in 2012 and 2013, and were positively related to soil temperature (p < 0.01) but not with soil water content measured at 5 cm depth. Methane uptake rates were greater in FMM (0.026-0.037) than in PMM (0.015-0.028 mg CH4 m (2) h (1)). The CWD increased CH4 uptake rates only in July and August 2012 in FMM, and were negatively related to soil water content (p < 0.001) but not to soil temperature. Nitrous oxide emission rates (0.0010.016 mg N2O m (2) h (1)) were not affected by either cover soil type or CWD. Global warming potential of CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes was greater in FMM than in PMM and near CWD than away from CWD, especially in FMM. Our study demonstrates that applying CWD for oil sands reclamation increases organic matter decomposition (increased CO2 evolution), driven by the effect on microbial populations. Results from this study provide support to findings in earlier studies that CWD application benefits vegetation establishment through enhancing soil processes in reclaimed oil sands lands.

AB Cold season (winter and thaw) CH4, CO2 and N2O fluxes from freshwater marshes (47 degrees 35'N, 133 degrees 31'E, Northeast China) were measured, using the static chamber method. The mean CH4 and CO2 fluxes from Carex lasiocarpa (CI) were 0.5 +/- 0.19 and 6.23 +/- 1.36 mgCm(-2) h(-1), respectively, and those from Deyeuxia angustifoli (Da) were 0.18 +/- 0.15 and 5.22 +/- 2.48 ing Cm-2 h(-1), respectively in winter. There was no significant difference between CI and Da (p > 0.05). The contributions of winter CH4 fluxes were about 5.5% and 3% in the Cl and Da, respectively. Marshes are an important potential N2O sink in winter season in northeast China. During thaw, the CH4 and CO2 emissions rapidly increased, 4.5-6 times of winter emissions. Wetland became a source of N2O. Cold season gases flux from northern wetlands play an important role in the seasonal gas exchange. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intensively managed grasslands on organic soils are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) therefore has set the default emission factor at 8 kg N-N2O ha(-1) year(-1) for cultivation and management of organic soils. Also, the Dutch national reporting methodology for greenhouse gases uses a relatively high calculated emission factor of 4.7 kg N-N2O ha(-1) year(-1). In addition to cultivation, the IPCC methodology and the Dutch national methodology account for N2O emissions from N inputs through fertilizer applications and animal urine and faeces deposition to estimate annual N2O emissions from cultivated and managed organic soils. However, neither approach accounts for other soil parameters that might control N2O emissions such as groundwater level. In this paper we report on the relations between N2O emissions, N inputs and groundwater level dynamics for a fertilized and grazed grassland on drained peat soil. We measured N2O emissions from fields with different target groundwater levels of 40 cm ('wet') and 55 cm ('dry') below soil surface in the years 1992, 1993, 2002, 2006 and 2007. Average emissions equalled 29.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) and 11.6 kg N-N2O ha(-1) year(-1) for the dry and wet conditions, respectively. Especially under dry conditions, measured N2O emissions exceeded current official estimates using the IPCC methodology and the Dutch national reporting methodology. The N2O-N emissions equalled 8.2 and 3.2% of the total N inputs through fertilizers, manure and cattle droppings for the dry and wet field, respectively and were strongly related to average groundwater level (R (2) = 0.74). We argue that this relation should be explored for other sites and could be used to derive accurate emission data for fertilized and grazed grasslands on organic soils.

AB Short-term changes in fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane were measured with an automatic opaque chamber method in boreal organic soils growing barley, grass or birch and on bare agricultural organic soil. The diurnal variation in these gas fluxes were compared with that of Co-2 production which is known to be highly temperature-dependent. Here, the mean daytime (10:00-16:00) CO2 production rates were 14-23% higher than the mean daily fluxes. The Q(10) (air temperature range 15-25 degreesC) for the CO2 production was 1.5 in the agricultural soils and 1.3 in the forest. The N2O fluxes followed the changes in the temperature of the Surface soil (depth of 3 cm) in the agricultural soils. The maximum emissions occurred in the afternoon, a few hours later than the maximum air temperature and CO2 production. There was a clear diurnal variation in the N2O fluxes in all sites. The mean daytime emissions of N2O were up to 1.3-fold higher than the daily average fluxes. At maximum, the daytime emissions were as much as 5-fold higher than those measured during night. All the sites were net sinks for CH4, and no clear diurnal fluctuation was seen. Higher net CH4 uptake during the measuring period was measured in the forest than in the agricultural soils. The results showed that the short-term variation in the N2O fluxes, especially during periods with wide variation in temperature or during periods of rainfall, can cause a 60% overestimation in the N2O emission for boreal organic soils if the daytime fluxes only are measured, a common practice with the manual chamber techniques.

AB The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology estimates that over 50% of total nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions in New Zealand derive from animal excreta-N deposited during grazing. The emission factor for excreta-N as used by this methodology has an important impact on New Zealand's total N(2)O inventory. The objectives of this study were to refine the N(2)O emission factor for urine by simultaneously measuring N(2)O emissions from 5 pastoral soils of different drainage class, in 3 different regions in New Zealand following a single application of urine; plus test various aspects of the soil cover method for determining emission factors. Cow urine and synthetic urine was applied to pastoral soils in autumn 2000 and N(2)O emissions were measured using closed flux chambers at regular intervals for 4-18 months following application. The N(2)O emission factors for cow urine estimated for the first 4 months after urine application varied greatly depending on rainfall and soil drainage class, and ranged from 0.3 to 2.5% of the urine-N applied, suggesting that adopting a single emission factor for New Zealand may be inappropriate. The largest emission factor was found in a poorly drained soil, and the lowest emission factor was found in a well-drained stony soil. Ongoing measurements on one of the soils resulted in an increase in emission factors as the N(2)O emissions had not reached background levels 4 months after urine application. To characterise urine-induced N(2)O emissions, we recommend measurements continue until N(2)O emissions from urine-amended soil return to background levels. Furthermore, we recommend using real animal urine rather than synthetic urine in studies when determining the N(2)O emission factor for urine.

AB Quantification of activity data and emission factors for carbon (C) in inland wetland mineral soils (IWMS) lack suitable low cost indicators for key soil C processes in temperate forests. In a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest near Soro, Denmark, SOC stocks and the risk of losing pre-drainage legacy SOC were studied using a digital elevation model (0.4 m resolution), redox potential and soil respiration measurements. The results were compared with a digitized legacy soil map used in the national GHG reporting to UNFCCC. In upland, flat and sloping terrain, an aerobic soil environment (Eh > 400 mV) prevailed throughout most of the year, but in a peat-filled topographic depression (TD) anaerobic conditions (Eh < 400 mV) fully or sporadically occurred in the growing season, controlled by the ditching-affected water table. The relief included SOC rich TDs making up 18.9% of the area based on the "Filled sink" algorithm (Saga GIS). In contrast, the peat cover on the legacy soil map was 8.2%. Furthermore, the mapped peat polygons were offset from the TDs defined by the DEM. The SOC stocks at 0-40 cm depth outside TDs (least squares mean 8.4 +/- sem 0.3 kg C m(-2)) were significantly lower than within TDs (11.9 +/- sem 0.5 kg C m(-2)). Average annual soil respiration increased linearly with the SOC stock by 0.06 kg C per kg SOC up to a SOC stock of 11 kg C m(-2) to 20 cm depth, and a SOC loss of 0.23 +/- se 0.10 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) was indicated inside the TD areas, close to the IPCC estimate of 0.26 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for drained organic soils under forest. Our results show that continuous sensor-based monitoring of redox potential and shallow water tables linked with high-resolution DEMs offer the possibility to estimate the spatial extent of inland wetland mineral soils and their status as aerobic or anaerobic as indicated by iron rods with higher accuracy than previously. This underpins the potential use of such data for activity data mapping in Tier 3 greenhouse gas reporting.

ID SOIL PROPERTIES; FLUXES; OXIDATION; FIELD
AB Emissions of CH(4), N(2)O, and CO(2) from soils are the result of a number of biological and physical processes, each influenced by several environmental and management factors exhibiting spatial variability. This study aimed to assess the spatial variability and spatial dependence of CH(4), N(2)O, and CO(2) emissions and their underlying soil processes and properties from grasslands on drained peat soil (Terric Histosol). Emissions and possible controlling factors were measured at a field location in Sweden. Measurements were done on two adjacent sites on peat soil on two successive days for each site. Spatial variability was analyzed with trend analysis and variograms. Both sites consumed small amounts of atmospheric CH(4), i.e., 0.03 and 0.05 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1), and emitted N(2)O and CO(2), i.e., 5 to 19 mg N(2)O m(-2) d(-1) and 4 to 6 g CO(2) m(-2) d(-1). Spatial variability of emissions was high, with coefficients of variation of 50 to 1400%. Emissions either showed a spatial trend or were spatially dependent with ranges of spatial dependence of 50 to >200 m. However, spatial dependence of emissions showed differences between sites and short-term temporal variability. Variograms of emissions and soil processes, which are partly biological in nature and have a high degree of inherent variability, should be interpreted with care.

ID FUEL COMBUSTION; COAL FLAMES; N2O; ATMOSPHERE; TRENDS
AB Growing scientific and public concern over global warming and ozone layer depletion has led researchers to study nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. N2O is reportedly increasing in the atmosphere at an estimated rate of 0.7 ppb per year and was measured in the atmosphere at 307 ppb in 1988. Since N2O is a stable compound, it is transported to the stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to nitric oxide (NO), a contributor to catalytic ozone depletion. Potential anthropogenic sources of N2O that have been investigated include biomass burning, fertilization, ground-water release through irrigation and fossil fuel combustion. Until recently, pulverized-coal combustion was implicated as the main source of N2O emissions due to errors encountered in sampling. Emissions from these units are typically less than 10 ppm N2O. Fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) has emerged as an advanced method of energy production by utilities, but under current designs these units have been shown to emit greater N2O) emissions than their pulverized-coal counterparts. This fact is related to lower combustion temperatures used to enhance SOx/NOx control, which, as a consequence, increases N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions from FBCs range from 50-200 ppm. At N2O concentrations of 10) ppm, and assuming a 2.5% growth rate in U.S. coal-derived energy production with 50% of this generated by FBCs, by the year 2000 this production would account for only 1% of the total current global N2O inventory. Nitrous oxide emissions from FBCs are strongly dependent upon fuel type, operating temperature, and excess air level. Based on current measurements at standard operating conditions (1550-degrees-F and 3.5% O2), fuels such as wood, peat and lignite generally will have N2O emissions ranging from 15-50 ppm. Subbituminous and bituminous coal combustion generate emissions ranging from 40-100 ppm and 70-200 ppm, respectively. Petroleum coke combustion is similar to bituminous coal. Actual emissions from a plant will decrease with increasing operating temperature (0.2-1.1 ppm N2O/degrees-F) or decreasing excess air levels (7-21 ppm N2O/% O2). Possible N2O abatement strategies include afterburning of a gaseous fuel in the freeboard or cyclone, increasing bed temperatures, decreasing excess air, or catalytic reduction of N2O by metal oxides.

AB According to the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), emissions must be cut by 41-72% below 2010 levels by 2050 for a likely chance of containing the global mean temperature increase to 2 degrees C. The AFOLU sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) contributes roughly a quarter (similar to 10-12 Pg CO2 e yr(-1)) of the net anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation, fire, wood harvesting, and agricultural emissions including croplands, paddy rice, and livestock. In spite of the importance of this sector, it is unclear where the regions with hotspots of AFOLU emissions are and how uncertain these emissions are. Here we present a novel, spatially comparable dataset containing annual mean estimates of gross AFOLU emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O), associated uncertainties, and leading emission sources, in a spatially disaggregated manner (0.5 degrees) for the tropics for the period 2000-2005. Our data highlight the following: (i) the existence of AFOLU emissions hotspots on all continents, with particular importance of evergreen rainforest deforestation in Central and South America, fire in dry forests in Africa, and both peatland emissions and agriculture in Asia; (ii) a predominant contribution of forests and CO2 to the total AFOLU emissions (69 %) and to their uncertainties (98 %); (iii) higher gross fluxes from forests, which coincide with higher uncertainties, making agricultural hotspots appealing for effective mitigation action; and (iv) a lower contribution of non-CO2 agricultural emissions to the total gross emissions (ca. 25 %), with livestock (15.5 %) and rice (7 %) leading the emissions. Gross AFOLU tropical emissions of 8.0 (5.5-12.2) were in the range of other databases (8.4 and 8.0 Pg CO2 e yr(-1) in FAOSTAT and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) respectively), but we offer a spatially detailed benchmark for monitoring progress in reducing emissions from the land sector in the tropics. The location of the AFOLU hotspots of emissions and data on their associated uncertainties will assist national policy makers, investors, and other decision-makers who seek to understand the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector.

AB A process-based reservoir model of Flooded Forest Denitrification Decomposition (FF-DNDC) was developed to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from flooded boreal landscapes. The reservoir model is based on Forest-DNDC, a terrestrial biogeochemistry model which supports detailed soil carbon (C) processes including redox chemistry, with modification to represent the disturbed soil and vegetation C dynamics due to the presence of an overlying water column on the ecosystems. Soil decomposition rates and temperature and oxygen profiles were changed, and sedimentation to the soil surface was added. FF-DNDC was evaluated using CO2 exchange measurements from the newly created Eastmain-1 reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada. For the first four years of the reservoir (2006 to 2009), simulated daily CO2 emissions averaged 1.42 g C m(-2) d(-1) (ranging from 0.75 to 3.24 g C m(-2) d(-1)) from the flooded forest and 0.74 g Cm-2 d(-1) (ranging from 0.51 to 1.09 gC m(-2) d(-1)) from the flooded peatland. The simulated emissions were smaller than the thin-filmed boundary layer exchanges based on measured partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) but were larger than the exchanges measured using an eddy covariance system. However, the temporal patterns of simulated and measured exchanges were similar. We simulated potential CO2 emissions over 100 years, the expected operating lifetime of the reservoir, with assuming no change in climate. Simulated CO2 emissions decreased with time since flooding especially for the first four decades. The 100-year cumulative emissions from the flooded peatland were larger than those from the flooded forest. Sensitivity analysis indicated that vegetation and soil inputs and parameters controlling the quality and/or quantity of decomposable soil C in flooded ecosystems (e.g. woody vegetation biomass, soil organic carbon in organic and mineral layers, and carbon:nitrogen ratio in woody vegetation and soil) were important to the reservoir CO2 emission.

AB Ornamental production worldwide has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. A globalized scene has shifted production to new countries from Africa, Asia, and South America. Sustainability is the major challenge for ornamental production, and the life cycle assessment (LCA) provides insights on environmental contributions from production to handling and transportation and highlights the problematic issues that need improvement. For example, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the production costs of roses in different parts of the world may vary dramatically between different production processes (e.g., heated or non-heated greenhouses, with or without air transportation, etc.). On the other hand, the production of landscape plants has the lowest environmental impact of all floricultural products. Their long production period offers carbon sequestrations that reduce the total GHG emissions. Sustainability is achieved via critical adjustments on cultivation by minimizing fuel and electricity use, adopting integrated nutrient management (INM) and integrated pest and disease management (IPDM), and using recyclable materials and peat-alternative growing compounds. In this review, two possible scenarios were proposed for ornamental production. Scenario I suggests conventional, protected cultivation under controlled environments (i.e., greenhouses), which can be sustainable after implementing appropriate adjustments to reduce environmental outputs. Scenario II suggests the cultivation of native and specialty ornamental crops, which may serve as eco-friendly alternatives. Combinations between the two scenarios are also possible in view to implement sustainable practices and meet future consumer needs.

AB Using the Otaniemi pressurized fluidized bed combustion test rig a study has been made of the emissions and control of NOx (NO + NO2) and N2O in different operating conditions for three types of solid fuel (peat, bituminous coal and brown coal). The influence of operating parameters, including bed temperature, excess air level, pressure, etc., were investigated. The results showed that NOx emissions were low and the excess air level was a dominant variable, and N2O emission was mostly dependent on the burning temperature. Ammonia injection and air staging are effective as NOx reduction techniques. Both techniques can reduce the NOx up to 60% dependent on the fuel type and the amount of ammonia or degree of air staging. The oxygen level and temperature of ammonia injecting position were significant factors in NOx reduction in ammonia injection operations. The N2O emissions, however, were always increased as a consequence of NOx reductions.

AB Turkey is ranked first globally in marble export and high volume of marble waste is produced. Reuse of industrial wastes have a positive effect on decreasing the human pressure on limited natural resources. However, the environmental friendly use of wastes is the primarily required approach. This study foresees the use of marble dust in agriculture, particularly the effect of carbon dioxide released following the use of it in soilless agriculture. The experiment was conducted on lettuce with 5 different mixtures of peat-perlite + marble dust along with a control and 5% acetic acid (acidic) treatment. Five different mixtures were consisted of 87.5% peat-perlite + 12.5% marble dust, 75% peat-perlite + 25% marble dust, 50% peat-perlite + 50% marble dust, and 25% peat-perlite + 75% marble dust. The highest dry matter production of 15.65g/pot was achieved at the 25% marble dust with 5% acetic acid treatment by 2708.3 ppm CO2 emissions. The mentioned mixture's CO2 productions was 481.59% higher than the control. The increase of CO2 emission in mixtures, where marble dust was greater than 25%, lead decreases in dry matter production. As conclusion, with the decision of the suitable amounts of use, which was 25% in this study, it can be concluded that marble dust can be used as CO2 and Ca source in greenhouses.

AB Composting is considered an appropriate approach for stabilising and sanitising pig slurry, incorporating its nutrients into the soil-plant system. However, pig slurry compost (PSC) can be highly saline with high concentrations of Cu and Zn, and can emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), when not properly stabilised. In order to produce substrates with adequate characteristics for containerised soilless plant production, PSC must be mixed with other materials. In this study two materials were chosen: coir (coconut fibre; CF), as the most popular material after peat for this purpose, and biochar (BCH), a novel material in this scenario. Substrates were prepared by mixing PSC:CF and PSC:BCH at 60:40, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100 (% v:v) ratios and their physical and chemical characteristics, their emission of GHG and VOC and seed germination and growth of two species grown for non-food purposes (milk thistle (Sylibum marianum L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)) were studied. The results showed that BCH was more adequate than CF for the preparation of substrates with PSC, enabling seed germination and plant growth by decreasing the EC and available Cu and Zn contents, hence limiting phytotoxic effects, whilst also reducing CO2, NO and VOC emissions. Toxic effects appeared in plants grown in substrates prepared with PSC at proportions greater than 20%; whilst at low rate (up to 20%) the beneficial effects might have been caused by the nutrients (N, P and K) supplied by PSC to the crops.

AB To evaluate the response of soil respiration and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission to soil moisture, temperature and nitrogen fertilization, and to estimate the contribution of soil and rhizosphere to total soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted in the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the northeast of China. The experiment included four treatments: bare soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (CK), and maize-cropped soils amended with 0 (N0), 150 (N150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha-1 yr-1. The cumulative soil CO2 emission in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments was estimated to be 698, 863, 962, and 854 g CO2 C m-2, respectively. The seasonal soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by soil temperature, with a Q10 value between 1.99 and 2.47. Analysis of the stepwise regression indicated that the CO2 flux can be quantitatively described by a linear combination of soil moisture content and soil temperature 5 cm below ground. Approximately 70, 58, 60, and 44% of the variability in CO2 flux can be explained by these two parameters, in CK, N0, N150, and N250, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased CO2 fluxes by 14.5% compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, in the soil fertilized with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1, high N fertilization suppressed soil respiration. There was an exponential relationship between soil temperature 5 cm below ground and N2O flux, with a Q10 value of 1.30-2.91. Mean cumulative soil N2O emissions during the maize-growing season in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments were estimated to be 86, 44, 200, and 484 mg N2O-N m-2, respectively. In contrast to the maize planting, soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and with 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increased N2O fluxes by 354 and 1000%, compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Soil respiration and N2O fluxes measurement using the root-exclusion technique indicated that the rhizosphere of the maize could be the dominant habitat of soil respiration and N2O formation.

AB Wetlands are among the most important natural resources on earth. They are the sources of cultural, economic and biological diversity. With their wealth of stored carbon, wetlands provide a potential sink for atmospheric carbon, but if not managed properly could become sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. Two important long-term uncertainties have initiated much debate in the scientific community. These are global wetland area and the amount of carbon stored in it. Compilation of relevant databases could be useful in setting up a long-term strategy for wetland conservation. It has been difficult to estimate the net carbon sequestration potential of a wetland, because the rate of decomposition of organic matter and the abundance of methanogenic micro-organisms and fluxes from the sediment are extremely complex, and there are often gaps in relevant scientific knowledge. The present discussion on density distribution of soil organic C in global wetlands could well be instrumental in formulating efficient strategies related to carbon sequestration and reduction of GHG emissions in wetland ecosystems. Effective assessment of wetlands will only take place when the available information becomes accessible and usable for all stakeholders.

AB In order to study the effects of intermittent aeration on greenhouse gas emissions and bacterial community succession during membrane-covered aerobic composting, a large-scale aerobic composting experiment was carried out. Two different aeration intervals designed to maintain the temperature of the compost was in 50-65 degrees C. The control group and experimental group were set to 10 min-10 min (on-off) and 10 min-30 min (on-off), respectively. The results indicated that the emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from the outside of the membrane in the control group were 9.68% and 47.10% less than those in the experimental group. And the global warming potential was 9.77% less than that in the experimental group. Wilcoxon rank-sum test result indicated that Tenericutes was a significantly different phylum between the two groups and played an important role in cellulose degradation. Redundancy analysis indicated that C/N had the greatest influence on the distribution of the bacterial community. It also found that Pseudogracilibacillus and Tepidimicrobium were significantly correlated with nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emission rates, respectively. Therefore, adjusting aeration interval time during the membrane-covered aerobic composting could be a useful strategy for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and effecting bacterial community structure.

AB To reveal the effect of irrigation salinity on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, pot experiments were designed with three irrigation salinity levels (NaCl and CaCl2 of 1, 2.5 and 4 g/L equivalence, Ec = 3.6, 8.1 and 12.7 ds/m), either for 0 kg N/ha (N0) or 120 kg N/ha (N120) nitrogen inputs. N2O emissions from soils irrigated at different salinity levels varied in a similar pattern which was triggered by soil moisture dynamics. Yet, the magnitudes of pulse N2O fluxes were significantly varied, with the peak flux at 5 g/L irrigation salinity level being much higher than at 2 and 8 g/L. Compared to fresh water irrigated soils, cumulative N2O fluxes were reduced by 22.7% and 39.6% (N0), 29.1% and 39.2% (N120) for soils irrigated with 2 and 8 g/L saline water, while they were increased by 87.7% (N0) and 58.3% (N120) for soils irrigated with 5 g/L saline water. These results suggested that the effect degree of salinity on consumption and production of N2O might vary among irrigation salinity ranges. As such, desalinating brackish water to a low salinity level (such as 2 g/L) before it is used for irrigation might be helpful for solving water resources crises and mitigating soil N2O emissions.

AB Nitrous oxide (H2O) and methane (CH4()) are greenhouse gases and active in the depletion of the ozone layer. These gases, originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources, are mainly released to the atmosphere from coastal areas, including continental shelves, estuaries and cords. Surface distribution of dissolved N2O and CH4 during the austral spring were described within the Magellanic Sub -Antarctic region (50-55 degrees S, Chile) with a coastal area that has a complex system of Cords, channels, gulf and, bays. A narrow range of N2O concentrations were observed from under-saturations (similar to 65%), as result of freshwater/glacial flow into fjord heads, to slight super-saturations (similar to 120-150%) in cord mouths and adjacent marine zones. One exception was Otway Sound, where a penguin colony is situated, with N2O levels of up to 218%. In contrast, CH4 concentrations presented a wide range of saturations between 47.9% and 483%, with a spatial distribution that mainly corresponded to the type of hydrographic/geomorphologic basin; in the southern Patagonian Andes (mostly covered by the southern Ice Fields) CH4 levels varied between 65 and 80% in the marine area, and 180% saturation in the channels and Cords; whereas in the southern Patagonian tableland (Magellan Strait) higher CH4 concentrations, up to 483% saturation, were observed apparently associated with continental inputs (peatland and tundra vegetation). N2O concentrations were positively correlated with salinity and nutrients, indicating that the majority of N2O and nutrients (except silicate) originated from the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), which mixes with N2O-de-pleated freshwater. However, CH4 concentrations did not correlate with any oceanographic variables, suggesting that they originate from local marine/terrestrial interactions, The Magellanic Sub -Antarctic region acts as a modest source of N2O and CH4, to the atmosphere with effluxes of 6.20 +/- 10.13 and 16.88 +/- 27.04 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) respectively. Due to climate change and a growth in anthropogenic activities such as salmon farming, future emissions of N2O and CH4 within this remote region remain uncertain.

AB During the past century atmospheric nitrogen deposition increased dramatically due to human activities worldwide. Currently, it exceeds the critical load for nitrogen (CLN) in over 90% of the Swiss forest area and raised bogs, in 80% of all fens and in 30% of species-rich grassland areas in Switzerland. Indirect gaseous nitrogen losses (HNO2, NO, N2O, N-2) from these soils induced by atmospheric nitrogen deposition are likely to be substantial. However, the approaches to estimate these indirect N emissions provided by the international organisations (UNFCCC, IPCC; UNECE, EMEP/EEA) are based on agricultural data only. They may not be suitable to estimate the indirect emissions from (semi-)natural ecosystems such as forests, extensively used grassland, and wetlands. The present study aims at calculating ecosystem-specific annual indirect N2O and NO emissions of (semi-)natural ecosystems in Switzerland for the years 1990, 2000, 2007 and 2010 using a simple linear model similar to the international guidelines. The approach here is based on empirical data for (semi-)natural ecosystems, derived from a literature survey, is driven by atmospheric nitrogen deposition and is ecosystem-specific with a high spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m. Our results show that such ecosystems represent a strong source of indirect N emissions induced by atmospheric nitrogen deposition and emitted 1.61 +/- 0.32 Gg N2O N and 2.51 +/- 0.53 Gg NO N into the atmosphere in Switzerland in the year 2010, corresponding to 21% of the total Swiss N2O emissions and 10% of the NOx emissions. Thanks to the reduction of N emissions and thereby reduced atmospheric N deposition, the indirect N2O and NO emissions from (semi-)natural ecosystems are estimated to have been both reduced by c. 20% from 1990 to 2010. We conclude that the source strength for N2O and NO emissions of (semi-)natural ecosystems have been underestimated by the current approaches of IPCC and EMENEEA by a factor of 4.4 and 17, respectively. In regions and countries with a high fraction of (semi-)natural ecosystems, the approach offered here has the potential to improve the estimate of indirect N emissions substantially.

AB Methane is considered to be a significant greenhouse gas. Methane is produced in soils as the end product of the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. In the absence of oxygen, methane is very stable, but under aerobic conditions it is mineralized to carbon dioxide by methanotrophic bacteria. Soil methane emissions, primarily from natural wetlands, landfills and rice paddies, are estimated to represent about half of the annual global methane production. Oxidation of atmospheric methane by well-drained soils accounts for about 10% of the global methane sink. Whether a soil is a net source or sink for methane depends on the relative rates of methanogenic and methanotrophic activity. A number of factors including pH, Eh, temperature and moisture content influence methane transforming bacterial populations and soil fluxes. Several techniques are available for measuring methane fluxes. Flux estimation is complicated by spatial and temporal variability. Soil management can impact methane transformations. For example, landfilling of organic matter can result in significant methane emissions, whereas some cultural practices such as nitrogen fertilization inhibit methane oxidation by agricultural soils.

AB Tropical wetlands have been shown to exhibit high rates of net primary productivity and may therefore play an important role in global climate change mitigation through carbon assimilation and sequestration. Many permanently flooded areas of tropical East Africa are dominated by the highly productive C4 emergent macrophyte sedge, Cyperus papyrus L. (papyrus). However, increasing population densities around wetland margins in East Africa are reducing the extent of papyrus coverage due to the planting of subsistence crops such as Colocasia esculenta (cocoyam). In this paper, we assess the impact of this land use change on the carbon cycle and in particular the impacts of land conversion on net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange. Eddy covariance techniques were used, on a campaign basis, to measure fluxes of carbon dioxide over both papyrus and cocoyam dominated wetlands located on the Ugandan shore of Lake Victoria. Peak rates of net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, derived from monthly diurnal averages of net ecosystem exchange, of 2835 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 and 1520 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 were recorded in the papyrus and cocoyam wetlands, respectively, whereas night-time respiratory losses ranged between 10 and 15 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 at the papyrus wetland and 510 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 at the cocoyam site. The integration of the flux data suggests that papyrus wetlands have the potential to act as a sink for significant amounts of carbon, in the region of 10 similar to t C similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1. The cocoyam vegetation assimilated similar to 7 similar to t C similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1 but when carbon exports from crop biomass removal were accounted for these wetlands represent a significant net loss of carbon of similar magnitude. The development of sustainable wetland management strategies are therefore required to promote the dual wetland function of crop production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions especially under future climate change scenarios.

AB Should international protocols be ratified, New Zealand will become legally committed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The three major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Agricultural soils are generally considered to be the main source of N2O emissions in New Zealand, but production estimates to date are surrounded by great uncertainty. This paper reviews our current understanding of agricultural N2O emissions, and suggests directions for future research needs by evaluating the default emission factors of the 1996 Revised Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the New Zealand situation. The emission factors calculated for New Zealand agricultural soils are generally within the range of the 1996 IPCC default values, but the limited amount of research data available hampers a full evaluation of the appropriateness of these factors for New Zealand. More long-term studies are needed to refine our emission factors, particularly those for animal urine and dung returned to pasture. Application of the IPCC methodology to New Zealand identifies herbivore excrement as the single largest potential source of anthropogenic NO emissions (about 50% of the total emission). In addition, research is also required for indirect sources of N2O, because only limited overseas data, and none from New Zealand, are available. The 1996 IPCC methodology does not account for variations in climatic and soil physical conditions, which are known to affect N2O emissions. In the longer term, development of robust process-based models, coupled with spatial and temporal data sets of the major drivers of N2O emissions, may therefore be a useful approach for obtaining national emission estimates for New Zealand. This will require long-term monitoring of N2O emissions, under various land uses and on a national network of sites.

AB Integrated buffer zones (IBZ) are novel mitigation measures designed to decrease the loading of nitrogen (N) transported by subsurface drainage systems from agricultural fields to streams. In IBZ, drainage water flows into a pond with free water surface followed by an inundated, vegetated filterbed. This design provides an environment favorable for denitrification and thus a decrease in nitrate concentration is expected as water flow through the IBZ. However, due to the establishment of anaerobic conditions, there is a risk for increasing emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). In this year-long study, we evaluated the N removal efficiency along with the risk of N2O and CH4 emissions from two pilot-scale IBZs (IBZ1 and 2). The two IBZs had very different yearly removal efficiencies, amounting to 29% and 71% of the total N load at IBZ1 and 2, respectively. This was probably due to differences in infiltration rates to the filterbed, which was 22% and 81% of the incoming water at IBZ1 and 2, respectively. The site (IBZ2) with the highest removal efficiency was a net N2O sink, while 0.9% of the removed nitrate was emitted as N2O at IBZ1. Both IBZs were net sources of CH4 but with different pathways of emission. In IBZ1 CH4 was mainly lost directly to the atmosphere, while waterborne losses dominated in IBZ2. In conclusion, the IBZs were effective in removing N three years after establishment, and although the IBZs acted as greenhouse gas sources, especially due to CH4, the emissions were comparable to those of natural wetlands and other drainage transport mitigation measures.

AB In many modelling studies on N cycling, denitrification is considered by a simplified process model. A widely used model describes denittification as potential denitrification reduced by the soil conditions nitrate N content (N), degree of water saturation (S) and temperature (7). Henault and Germon, 2000 [Henault, C. and Germon, J.C., 2000. NEMIS, a predictive model of denittification on the field scale. Eur. J. Soil Sci., 51: 257-270.] showed that this model worked satisfactorily for two data sets where parameters had been specifically derived for these data sets. This paper demonstrates that it may not always work well for other data, i.e., Dutch data sets. The model was parameterized for each of eight Dutch data sets, consisting of three sand, two heavy loam and three peat sites. After parameter optimisation the model is not able to predict individually measured actual denitrification rates. However, for sand and loam soils, but not for peat soils, the correspondence between measured and predicted average actual denitrification is good. This means that the calibrated model can predict, for those specific locations, cumulative denitrification rather well, provided that detailed information on soil conditions is available, either from measurements or from simulation models. The parameters and thus the reduction functions differed between the data sets. Parameter values within a class of soils, say sand, loam, and peat, were different. So care should be taken when using parameter values obtained from other studies. Albeit simple in its mathematical formulation, a widely used simplified denitrification process model needs to be parameterized for each location.
   The parameter optimisation is likely to be influenced by errors in the data. Therefore, an analysis on the effect of errors is presented based on an artificial data set. This data set was constructed consisting of 100 realisations of the soil conditions N, S and T, each drawn from a (log-)normal distribution based on the mineral Dutch data sets. For each realisation the relative denitrification rate (D-r) was computed based on a 'true' set of parameters. Next, measurement errors were introduced on D, N, S and T, either from a uniform or a normal distribution. For each of the 100 data sets the data were perturbed 100 times with newly drawn measurement errors. The perturbed data sets (10,000) were then optimised by the model. The coefficients of variation belonging to the estimates were large. This exercise can only be used to demonstrate possible directions of effects from errors, but it cannot be used to fully judge results obtained from real data sets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Strawberry (Fragaria xananassa Duch) crops are a key component of the UK soft fruit sector and potentially resource-intensive crops. This is the first study to undertake a detailed environmental impact assessment of all methods of UK strawberry production. A total of 14 systems with six additional sub-systems grown for between 1 and 3 years were identified. They were defined by the growing of short-day (Junebearer) or everbearer varieties, organic production, covering with polytunnels or grown in the open, soil-grown (with or without fumigation) or container-grown (with peat or coir substrate) and summer or spring planted. Preharvest, the global warming potential varied between 1.5 and 10.3 t CO2 equiv/ha/crop or 0.13 and 1.14 t CO2 equiv/t of class 1 fruit. Key factors included the use of tunnels, mulch and irrigation, sterilization of soil with fumigants and the use of peat substrate. Seasonal crops without covers grown where rotation of sufficient length reduced Verticillium (system 4) were the most efficient. System 4a (that did not use mulch) emitted 0.13 t CO2 equiv/t of class 1 fruit. A second or third cropping year in soil-grown systems prolonged the effect of mulch and soil fumigants. Greenhouse gases from system 4 (with mulch) averaged 0.30 t CO2 equiv/t of class 1 fruit after 3 years of cropping compared to 0.63 and 0.36 t CO2 equiv/t after 1 and 2 years, respectively.

AB Tropical papyrus wetlands have the ability to assimilate and sequester significant amounts of carbon. However, the spatial extent, productivity and carbon sink strength associated with papyrus wetlands remains poorly characterised. The objective of this study was to collate information from peer-reviewed publications and relevant government and NGO reports to better understand carbon dynamics within papyrus dominated wetlands, and to assess the processes that regulate the magnitude of the carbon sink. Papyrus wetlands were shown to exhibit high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation of up to 40 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) where the incident photosynthetic photon flux density was a parts per thousand yen1,000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), high rates of net primary production ranging between 14 and 52 g DM m(-2) d(-1) and represent a significant carbon sink where up to 88 t C ha(-1) is stored in the aboveground and belowground components of the papyrus vegetation. Under flooded conditions significant detrital and peat deposits accumulate in excess of 1 m in depth, representing an additional carbon store in the order of 640 t C ha(-1). This study also highlighted the lack of empirical data on emissions of other radiatively important trace gases such as methane and nitrous oxide and also the vulnerability of these carbon sinks to both future changes in climate, in particular periods of hydrological drawdown, and anthropogenic land use change where the papyrus vegetation is removed in favour of subsistence agricultural cropping systems.

AB Soils are a dominant source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. However, the complexity of the drivers of N2O production and emissions has hindered our ability to predict the magnitude and spatial dynamics of N2O fluxes. Soil moisture can be considered a key driver because it influences oxygen (O-2) supply, which feeds back on N2O sources (nitrification versus denitrification) and sinks (reduction to dinitrogen). Soil water content is directly linked to O-2 and redox potential, which regulate microbial metabolism and chemical transformations in the environment. Despite its importance, only a few laboratory studies have addressed the effects of hydrological transient dynamics on nitrogen (N) cycling in the vadose zone. To further investigate these aspects, we performed a long term experiment in a 1.5 m depth soil column supplemented by chamber experiments. With this experiment, we aimed to investigate how soil moisture dynamics influence redox sensitive N cycling in a peatland soil. As expected, increased soil moisture lowered O-2 concentrations and redox potential in the soil. The decline was more severe for prolonged saturated conditions than for short events and at deep than at the soil surface. Gaseous and dissolved N2O, dissolved nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) changed considerably along the soil column profile following trends in soil O-2 and redox potential. Hot spots of N2O concentrations corresponded to high variability in soil O-2 in the upper and lower parts of the column. Results from chamber experiments confirmed high NO3- reduction potential in soils, particularly from the bottom of the column. Under our experimental conditions, we identified a close coupling of soil O-2 and N2O dynamics, both of which lagged behind soil moisture changes. These results highlight the relationship among soil hydrologic properties, redox potential and N cycling, and suggest that models working at a daily scale need to consider soil O-2 dynamics in addition to soil moisture dynamics to accurately predict patterns in N2O fluxes.

DT Article
ID N2O PRODUCTION; DENITRIFICATION; NITRIFICATION; MOISTURE
AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from different soils under grass were measured after treatment with cow dung and urine in field trials conducted during two separate seasons and in laboratory incubation experiments. N2O emission rates were much higher during autumn-winter than during spring-summer, and in the case of well-drained soil were substantial for both excreta types (207 mg N2O-N kg(-1) of deposited dung and 197 mg N2O-N kg(-1) of urine in autumn-winter). The corresponding data for poorly-drained soil were 0.2 mg (dung) and 148 mg (urine). Emissions continued over much longer periods (similar to 60 days) from sandy and stony loams than from a silty clay loam (similar to 30 days) under both field and laboratory conditions, and were not solely dependent on soil NO3- or NH4+ status but also related to other factors including soil moisture, rate of plant growth and carbon availability. Results suggest that N2O production occurred during both nitrification and denitrification processes. Emission rates of up to similar to 1590 mu g N2O-N h(-1) m(-2) occurred in the field, while small rates of deposition to the soil were occasionally observed. Under laboratory conditions, similar treatments produced large emissions from loam soils having pH of 4.5-6.5 and zero emissions from a peat soil with pH of 3.8. The ratio of nitrogen released as N2O to the amount of N excreted by the livestock varied from similar to 0% (summer) to 0.8-2.3% (winter), consistent with loss rates observed for mineral fertilizers.

AB A field control experiment was carried out to determine the influence of water table changes on soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in Calamagrostis angustifolia freshwater marsh in Northeast of China. The results showed that the water depth of 5 cm below the ground surface increased soil CO2 emission, but there was no significant influence of deeper water table on gas emission. CH4 emission was accelerated by deep standing water and approached the peak in the plant booming time. This suggests that root activity has influence on CH4 production. The result also demonstrated that both low water table level and inundated environment would inhibit N2O emission. Comparing the total global warming potential of three gases under different conditions, it can be concluded that maintaining a comparatively steady water table near the soil surface can benefit soil carbon sequestration in the C. angustifolia marsh, and decrease of the greenhouse gases emissions to the atmosphere.

AB Drainage and cultivation of organic soils often result in large nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer on N2O emissions from a cultivated organic soil located south of Montreal, QC, Canada, drained in 1930 and used since then for vegetable production. Fluxes of N2O were measured weekly from May 2004 to November 2005 when snow cover was absent in irrigated and non-irrigated plots receiving 0, 100 or 150 kg N ha(-1) as NH4NO3. Soil mineral N content, gas concentrations, temperature, water table height and water content were also measured to help explain variations in N2O emissions. Annual emissions during the experiment were large, ranging from 3.6 to 40.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1). The N2O emissions were decreased by N fertilizer addition in the non-irrigated site but not in the irrigated site. The absence of a positive influence of soil mineral N content on N2O emissions was probably in part because up to 571 kg N ha(-1) were mineralized during the snow-free season. Emissions of N2O were positively correlated to soil CO2 emissions and to variables associated with the extent of soil aeration such as soil oxygen concentration, precipitation and soil water table height, thereby indicating that soil moisture/aeration and carbon bioavailability were the main controls of N2O emission. The large N2O emissions observed in this study indicate that drained cultivated organic soils in eastern Canada have a potential for N2O-N losses similar to, or greater than, organic soils located in northern Europe.

ID BIOMASS EQUATIONS; FOREST; MODEL
AB Forests play an important role in mitigating climate change. Forests can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and provide biomass, which can be used to substitute for fossil fuels or energy-intensive materials. International climate policies favor the use of wood to substitute for fossil fuels rather than using forests as carbon sink. We examine the trade off between sequestering carbon in forests and substituting wood for fossil fuels in Finland. For Finland to meet its EU targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, a considerable increase in the use of wood for energy is necessary. We compare scenarios in which the wood energy targets are fully or partially met to a reference case where policies favoring wood based energy production are removed. Three models are used to project fossil fuel substitution and changes in forest carbon sinks in the scenarios through 2035.
   Finnish forests are a growing carbon sink in all scenarios. However, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be higher in the medium term if Finland achieves its current wood energy targets than if the use of energy wood stagnates or decreases. The volume of GHG emissions avoided by replacing coal, peat and fossil diesel with wood is outweighed by the loss in carbon sequestered in forests due to increased biomass removals. Therefore, the current wood energy targets seem excessive and harmful to the climate. In particular, biodiesel production has a significant, negative impact on net emissions in the period considered. However, we did not consider risks such as forest fires, wind damage and diseases, which might weaken the sequestration policy. The potential albedo impacts of harvesting the forests were not considered either. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas, and as such it contributes to the global greenhouse effect. Agro ecosystems, including fertilized grasslands, represent a major source of N2O, which is emitted together with N-2. In order to reduce the loss of fertilizer-N in the form of N2O and N-2 by adjusting grassland management, it is important to understand the relationship between the emission of these gasses after fertilization and the conditions in the soil-plant system. This relationship was studied by determining the seasonal patterns of N2O and N-2 fluxes, soil temperature, and soil water content based on weekly measurements between May and November in 1993, and between April and November in 1994. Measurements were carried out in fertilized and regularly cut pasture at a site located in the foothills of the Swiss Alps with a humus rich sandy loam Gleyic Cambisol. N fluxes were measured using soil cores incubated in the field either with or without acetylene inhibition. Highest N fluxes were measured from wet soil after plant cutting, and after N fertilizer application. For individual N applications, estimates of N loss relative to the amount of N applied ranged from 0.05% to 5.2% for N2O and from 0% to 25.5% for N-2. The largest portion of the annual N loss as N2O occurred during early spring (about 66%) and coincided with soil thawing, and as N-2 during autumn (44-62%) in combination with high soil water contents and advanced plant development. The magnitude of the fluxes of N2O and N-2 were not directly correlated with soil temperature, but increased with increasing soil water content. N-2/N2O ratio was largest at soil water contents above 60% water-filled pore space, and was further enhanced in the presence of a well developed plant canopy. The data suggest that in this managed grassland system soil moisture content and the stage of canopy development are the main factors regulating the seasonal pattern of N2O and N-2 losses, and their ratio.

AB N2O fluxes in field of Calamagrostis angustifolia meadow and Carex lasiocarpa marsh were measured using the technique of closed opaque chamber and gas chromatography system during 2003 similar to 2005 growing seasons. The experiment was carried out at the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station in Northeast China. The results showed that wetland was weak N2O emission source in growing seasons. The influence of wetland plants on N2O emission of wetland ecosystem was not the same in different growing stages. N2O emission flux reached peak value at heading, flowering and fructicative stage from Calamagrostis angustifolia meadow. This was related to rise in temperature and vigorous metabolism. N2O emission flux reached maximum at seedling stages from Carex lasiocatpa marsh. Frozen soil freezing and thawing was the main reason. With the plants participation, the N2O emissions ability was enhanced greatly. N2O fluxes from soil-plant system were 1.6, 2.11 and 2.33 times as high as that from soil in Calamagrostis angustifolia meadow during three growing seasons, while 1.81, 1.5 and 1.36 times in Carex lasiocatpa marsh. The N2O fluxes of Calamagrostis angustifolia meadow was higher than that of Carex lasiocarpa marsh during three growing seasons. The differences of soil physical and chemical characteristics and hydrology situations between the two wetlands could explain this phenomenon.

AB Wetlands are one of the most important terrestrial ecosystems for land-atmosphere CH4 exchange. A new process-based, biophysical model to quantify CH4 emissions from natural wetlands was developed and integrated into a terrestrial ecosystem model (Integrated Biosphere Simulator). The new model represents a multisubstance system (CH4, O-2, CO2, and H-2) and describes CH4 production, oxidation, and three transport processes (diffusion, plant-mediated transport, and ebullition). The new model uses several critical microbial mechanisms to represent the interaction of anaerobic fermenters and homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic, and acetoclastic methanogens, and methanotrophs in CH4 production and oxidation. We applied the model to 24 different wetlands globally to compare the simulated CH4 emissions to observations and conducted a sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that (1) for most sites, the model was able to capture the magnitude and variation of observed CH4 emissions under varying environmental conditions; (2) the parameters that regulate dissolved organic carbon and acetate production, and acetoclastic methanogenesis had the significant impact on simulated CH4 emissions; (3) the representation of the process components of CH4 cycling showed that CH4 oxidation was about half or more of CH4 production, and plant-mediated transport was the dominant pathway at most sites; and (4) the seasonality of simulated CH4 emissions can be controlled by soil temperature, water table position, or combinations thereof.

AB Ecosystem-based approaches provide opportunities for climate policy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to expand the adaptive capacities and resilience of land systems to a changing climate, and to simultaneously protect biodiversity and ecosystems services (ESS). However, knowledge about the economic benefits and cost-efficiency of ecosystem-based approaches is still limited. The objective of this paper is to enhance understanding of synergies and trade-offs between climate policy related measures and nature conservation and how ecosystem-based approaches can contribute to both climate as well as biodiversity and ESS conservation goals, through overall economic analyses to inform balanced decision making. The paper builds upon the current state of knowledge as brought together by contributors to the German national TEEB-study "Natural Capital and Climate Policy - Synergies and Conflicts". We present options and lessons learned from major land-use sectors of high relevance for ecosystem-based approaches to climate change, namely agriculture, peatlands, forests, wetlands and coastal and marine ecosystems. Based on these assessments, we argue that successful implementation of an ecosystembased climate policy requires effective coordination and coherence between sectors and their respective policies, for example agriculture, forestry and energy. We identify specific targets for an ecosystem-based climate policy and options for achieving this coherent implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The wetlands play an important role in global carbon and nitrogen storage, and they are also natural sources of greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Land-use change is an important factor affecting the exchange of greenhouse gases between wetlands and the atmosphere. However, few studies have investigated the effect of land-Use change on CH4 and N2O emissions from freshwater marsh in China. Therefore, a field Study was carried out over a year to investigate the seasonal changes of the emissions of CH4 and N2O at three sites (Deyeuxia angustifolia marsh, dryland and rice field) in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Marsh was the source of CH4 Showing a distinct temporal variation. Maximum fluxes occurred in June and the highest value was 20.69 +/- 2.57 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The seasonal change of N2O fluxes from marsh was not obvious, consisted of a Series of emission Pulses. The marsh acted as a N2O sink during winter, while became a N2O source in the growing season. The results showed that gas exchange between soil/snow and the atmosphere in the winter season contributed greatly to the annual budgets. The winter season CH4 flux was about 3.24% of the annual flux and the winter uptake of N2O accounted for 13.70% of the growing-season emission. Conversion marsh to dryland resulted in a shift from a strong CH4 source to a weak sink (from 199.12 +/- 39.04 to -1.37 +/- 0.68 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), while increased N2O emissions somewhat(from 4.07 +/- 1.72 to 4.90 +/- 1.52 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). Conversion marsh to rice held significantly decreased CH4 emission from 199.12 +/- 39.04 to 94.82 +/- 9.86 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1) and N2O emission from 4.07 +/- 1.72 to 2.09 +/- 0.79 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB In 1995 a working group was assembled at the request of OECD/IPCC/IEA to revise the methodology for N(2)O from agriculture for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Methodology. The basics of the methodology developed to calculate annual country level nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from agricultural soils is presented herein. Three sources of N(2)O are distinguished in the new methodology: (i) direct emissions from agricultural soils, (ii) emissions from animal production, and (iii) N(2)O emissions indirectly induced by agricultural activities. The methodology is a simple approach which requires only input data that are available from FAO databases. The methodology attempts to relate N(2)O emissions to the agricultural nitrogen (N) cycle and to systems into which N is transported once it leaves agricultural systems. These estimates are made with the realization that increased utilization of crop nutrients, including N, will be required to meet rapidly growing needs for food and fiber production in our immediate future. Anthropogenic N input into agricultural systems include N from synthetic fertilizer, animal wastes, increased biological N-fixation, cultivation of mineral and organic soils through enhanced organic matter mineralization, and mineralization of crop residue returned to the field. Nitrous oxide may be emitted directly to the atmosphere in agricultural fields, animal confinements or pastoral systems or be transported from agricultural systems into ground and surface waters through surface runoff. Nitrate leaching and runoff and food consumption by humans and introduction into sewage systems transport the N ultimately into surface water (rivers and oceans) where additional N(2)O is produced. Ammonia and oxides of N (NO,) are also emitted from agricultural systems and may be transported off-site and serve to fertilize other systems which leads to enhanced production of N(2)O. Eventually, all N that moves through the soil system will be either terminally sequestered in buried sediments or denitrified in aquatic systems. We estimated global N(2)O-N emissions for the year 1989, using midpoint emission factors from our methodology and the FAO data for 1989. Direct emissions from agricultural soils totaled 2.1 Tg N, direct emissions from animal production totaled 2.1 Tg N and indirect emissions resulting from agricultural N input into the atmosphere and aquatic systems totaled 2.1 Tg N(2)O-N for an annual total of 6.3 Tg N(2)O-N. The N(2)O input to the atmosphere from agricultural production as a whole has apparently been previously underestimated. These new estimates suggest that the missing N(2)O sources discussed in earlier IPCC reports is likely a biogenic (agricultural) one.

AB The eddy covariance method was used to study the CO2 budget of the Liaohe Delta reed wetland in northern China during 2012-2015. The changes in environmental factors (including meteorology, vegetation, hydrology, and soil) were analyzed simultaneously. The change in the trend of the CO2 concentration in the reed wetland was similar to global changes over the four years. The average annual CO2 accumulation was 2.037 kgCO(2)m(-2), ranging from 1.472 to 2.297 kgCO(2)m(-2). The seasonal characteristics of the CO2 exchange included high CO2 absorption in June and July, and high emissions in April and from September to October, with the highest emissions in July 2015. The average temperatures from 2013 to 2015 were higher than the 50-year average, largely due to increased temperatures in winter. Precipitation was below the 50-year average, mainly because of low precipitation in summer. The average wind speed was less than the 50-year average, and sunshine duration decreased each year. The CO2 exchange and environmental factors had a degree of correlation or consistency. The contribution of meteorology, vegetation, hydrology, and soil to the CO2 budget was analyzed using the partial least squares method. Water and soil temperature had a greater effect on the CO2 exchange variability. The regression equation of the CO2 budget was calculated using the significant contributing factors, including temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, water-table level, salinity, and biomass. The model fit explained more than 70% of the CO2 exchange, and the simulation results were robust.

AB The Scots pine is one of the most important species in European and Asian forests. Due to a widespread occurrence of pine forests, their significance in the energy and mass exchange between the Earth surface and the atmosphere is also important, particularly in the context of climate change and greenhouse gases balance. The aim of this work is to present the relationship between the average annual net ecosystem productivity and growing season length, latitude and air temperature (tay) over Europe. Therefore, CO2 flux measurement data from eight European pine dominated forests were used. The observations suggest that there is a correlation between the intensity of CO2 uptake or emission by a forest stand and the above mentioned parameters. Based on the obtained results, all of the selected pine forest stands were CO2 sinks, except a site in northern Finland. The carbon dioxide uptake increased proportionally with the increase of growing season length (9.212 g C m(-2) y(-1) per day of growing season, R-2 = 0.53, p = 0.0399). This dependency showed stronger correlation and higher statistical significance than both relationships between annual net ecosystem productivity and air temperature (R-2 = 0.39, p = 0.096) and annual net ecosystem productivity and latitude (R-2 = 0.47, p = 0.058). The CO2 emission surpassed assimilation in winter, early spring and late autumn. Moreover, the appearance of late, cold spring and early winter, reduced annual net ecosystem productivity. Therefore, the growing season length can be considered as one of the main factor affecting the annual carbon budget of pine forests.

AB Static chamber measurements of N2O fluxes were taken during the 1998 and 1999 growth seasons in a Swedish constructed wetland receiving wastewater. The dominating plant species in different parts of the wetland were Lemna minor L., Typha latifolia L., Spirogyra sp. and Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) and Phalaris arundinacea (L.), respectively. There were large temporal and spatial variations in N2O fluxes, which ranged from consumption at -350 to emissions at 1791 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1). The largest positive flux occurred in October 1999 and the lowest in the middle of July 1999. The average N2O flux for the two years was 130 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) (SD = 220). No significant differences in N2O fluxes were found between the years, even though the two growing seasons differed considerably with respect to both air temperature and precipitation. 15% of the fluxes were negative, showing a consumption of N2O. Consumption occurred on a few occasions at most measurement sites and ranged from 1-350 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1). 13-43% of the variation in N2O fluxes was explained by multiple linear regression analysis including principal components. Emission factors were calculated according to IPCC methods from the N2O fluxes in the constructed wetland. The calculated emission factors were always lower (0.02-0.27%) compared to the default factor provided by the IPCC (0.75%). Thus, direct application of the IPCC default factor may lead to overestimation of N2O fluxes from constructed wastewater-treating wetlands.

AB Soil emissions of NO and N2O from typical land uses across Lowland and Highland Scotland were simulated under climate change conditions, during a short-term laboratory study. All locations investigated were significant sources of N2O (range: 157-277 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) and low-to-moderate sources of NO emissions (range: 0.4-30.5 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)), with a general tendency to decrease with altitude and increase with fertiliser and atmospheric N inputs. Simulated climate warming and extreme events (drought, intensive rainfall) increased soil NO pulses and N2O emissions from both natural and managed ecosystems in the following order: natural Highlands < natural Lowlands < grazed grasslands < natural moorland receiving high NH3 deposition rates. Largest NO emission rates were observed from natural moorlands exposed to high NH3 deposition rates. Although soil NO emissions were much smaller (6-660 times) than those of N2O, their impact on air quality is likely to increase as combustion sources of NO (x) are declining as a result of successful mitigation. This study provides evidence of high N emission rates from natural ecosystems and calls for urgent action to improve existing national and intergovernmental inventories for NO and N2O, which at present do not fully account for emissions from natural soils receiving no direct anthropogenic N inputs.

AB The vast wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau are expected to be an important natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. The magnitude, patterns and environmental controls of CH4 emissions on different timescales, especially during the nongrowing season, remain poorly understood, because of technical limitations and the harsh environments. We conducted the first study on year-round CH4 fluxes in an alpine wetland using the newly developed LI-COR LI-7700 open-path gas analyzer. We found that the total annual CH4 emissions were 26.4 and 33.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and the nongrowing season CH4 emissions accounted for 43.2-46.1% of the annual emissions, highlighting an indispensable contribution that was often overlooked by previous studies. A two-peak seasonal variation in CH4 fluxes was observed, with a small peak in the spring thawing period and a large one in the peak growing season. We detected a significant difference in the diurnal variation of CH4 fluxes between the two seasons, with two peaks in the growing season and one peak in the nongrowing season. We found that the CH4 fluxes during the growing season were well correlated with soil temperature, water table depth and gross primary production, whereas the CH4 fluxes during the nongrowing season were highly correlated with soil temperature. Our results suggested that the CH4 emission during the nongrowing season cannot be ignored and the vast wetlands on the Tibetan plateau will have the potential to exert a positive feedback on climate considering the increasing warming, particularly in the nongrowing season in this region.

AB Boreal forest soils are globally an important sink for methane (CH4), while these soils are also capable of emitting CH4 under favourable conditions. Soil wetness is a well-known driver of CH4 flux, and the wetness can be estimated with several terrain indices developed for the purpose. The aim of this study was to quantify the spatial variability of the forest floor CH4 flux with a topography-based upscaling method connecting the flux with its driving factors. We conducted spatially extensive forest floor CH4 flux and soil moisture measurements, complemented by ground vegetation classification, in a boreal pine forest. We then modelled the soil moisture with a random forest model using digital-elevation-model-derived topographic indices, based on which we upscaled the forest floor CH4 flux. The modelling was performed for two seasons: May-July and August-October. Additionally, we evaluated the number of flux measurement points needed to get an accurate estimate of the flux at the whole study site merely by averaging. Our results demonstrate high spatial heterogeneity in the forest floor CH4 flux resulting from the soil moisture variability as well as from the related ground vegetation. The mean measured CH4 flux at the sample points was -5.07 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in May-July and -8.67 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in August-October, while the modelled flux for the whole area was -7.42 and -9.91 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for the two seasons, respectively. The spatial variability in the soil moisture and consequently in the CH4 flux was higher in the early summer (modelled range from -12.3 to 6.19 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) compared to the autumn period (range from -14.6 to -2.12 mu mol m(-2)h(-1)), and overall the CH4 uptake rate was higher in autumn compared to early summer. In the early summer there were patches emitting high amounts of CH4; however, these wet patches got drier and smaller in size towards the autumn, changing their dynamics to CH4 uptake. The mean values of the measured and modelled CH4 fluxes for the sample point locations were similar, indicating that the model was able to reproduce the results. For the whole site, upscaling predicted stronger CH4 uptake compared to simply averaging over the sample points. The results highlight the small-scale spatial variability of the boreal forest floor CH4 flux and the importance of soil chamber placement in order to obtain spatially representative CH4 flux results. To predict the CH4 fluxes over large areas more reliably, the locations of the sample points should be selected based on the spatial variability of the driving parameters, in addition to linking the measured fluxes with the parameters.

AB Typical groundwater soils in a temperate-humid climate were investigated for the relationship between methane emissions and dynamic (groundwater level, redox status) as well as static soil properties over 2 years (July 1996 to July 1998, weekly probing, static chamber). High unit area emissions, like annual (5-73 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) or mean daily fluxes (15-244 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were observed at the wetter sites. Oxidation seemed to be the controlling subscale process for the emissions observed: Time with Eh above -75mV in the upper 20 cm was inversely correlated to net CH4 fluxes (nonlinear). Two factors, namely groundwater level and the quality of soil organic matter (SOM), built a factor hierarchy to control methane emission. Thereby SOM is strongly influenced by the land use practices, for example, erosional and depositional processes in a catchment. Soil morphology corresponded to static (e.g., Mn-d, Fe-d) and dynamic soil properties like groundwater level or redox potentials. Because the linkage to Eh regional or global scale methane emissions may be estimated by coupling unit area emissions to soil maps based on soil morphology (e.g., soil taxonomy). Calculations of our own results exemplified (1) the significance of a representative set of unit areas for each climatic zone and (2) the potential importance of the temperate climatic zone for global methane budget.

AB Marshes in the urban Jamaica Bay Estuary, New York, USA are disappearing at an average rate of 13 ha/yr, and multiple stressors (e.g., wastewater inputs, dredging activities, groundwater removal, and global warming) may be contributing to marsh losses. Among these stressors, wastewater nutrients are suspected to be an important contributing cause of marsh deterioration. We used census data, radiometric dating, stable nitrogen isotopes, and soil surveys to examine the temporal relationships between human population growth and soil nitrogen; and we evaluated soil structure with computer-aided tomography, surface elevation and sediment accretion trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and soil shear strength to examine differences among disappearing (Black Bank and Big Egg) and stable marshes (JoCo). Radiometric dating and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested a rapid increase in human wastewater nutrients beginning in the late 1840s, and a tapering off beginning in the 1930s when wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were first installed. Current WWTPs nutrient loads to Jamaica Bay are approximately 13 995 kg N/d and 2767 kg P/d. At Black Bank, the biomass and abundance of roots and rhizomes and percentage of organic matter on soil were significantly lower, rhizomes larger in diameter, carbon dioxide emission rates and peat particle density significantly greater, and soil strength significantly lower compared to the stable JoCo Marsh, suggesting Black Bank has elevated decomposition rates, more decomposed peat, and highly waterlogged peat. Despite these differences, the rates of accretion and surface elevation change were similar for both marshes, and the rates of elevation change approximated the long term relative rate of sea level rise estimated from tide gauge data at nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey. We hypothesize that Black Bank marsh kept pace with sea level rise by the accretion of material on the marsh surface, and the maintenance of soil volume through production of larger diameter rhizomes and swelling (dilation) of waterlogged peat. JoCo Marsh kept pace with sea-level rise through surface accretion and soil organic matter accumulation. Understanding the effects of multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment, on soil structure, organic matter accumulation, and elevation change will better inform management decisions aimed at maintaining and restoring coastal marshes.

AB The construction of consistent time series of land use presents a key challenge when accounting for elective land use-based activities under the Kyoto Protocol (wetland drainage and rewetting (WDR), cropland management (CM) and grazing land management (GM)), in which current land use-driven greenhouse gas emissions are compared to a reference situation in 1990.
   This case study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of using high-resolution land-use proxies from different datasets for Kyoto accounting in a data-rich case study region in Germany. The study region is characterised by organic soils and has been subject to significant nature conservation measures, including land-use changes, reductions in land-use intensity and changes in groundwater table depth.
   A consistent time series of 20 years of land use with a spatial resolution of 0.01 ha was created from various fine-grained spatial datasets for organic soils in the Dromling nature park by applying a newly developed 'translation key'. The translation key accounted for systematic differences in legends and thematic resolution. We also tested whether the land-use datasets served as trustworthy proxies for groundwater table depth.
   Land use in the Dromling nature park became less intensive during the study period of 1992-2012. The greatest land-use change (142 ha year(-1), 1.14% year(-1)) occurred between 2000 and 2008. This was in line with management measures undertaken in the nature park. The centre of the nature park became wetter and there was an increase in the share of grassland and more natural vegetation types.
   The groundwater table correlated with land use and land-use intensity on organic soils in the study area throughout the entire period. Land-use changes were accompanied by altered groundwater tables, except for the conversion from cropland to grassland.
   Our study indicates that detailed land-use time series can serve as a semi-quantitative proxy for groundwater depth, but that any robust quantitative assessment of water table changes requires in situ data, e.g. from a network of dipwells. Therefore, the combination of land-use and dipwell data provided an accurate basis for estimating GHG emission reductions from drained organic soils since 1990, which is the centre of the Kyoto activity WDR, but also part of afforestation/reforestation (AR) and deforestation (D), forest management (FM), CM and GM. Even the detailed land-use time series on its own would fulfil the requirements for WDR accounting, although with considerable uncertainty about the drainage status of the organic soils. We present the study area of organic soils as a showcase for combining the difficult issues of monitoring changes in land-use intensity as well as in soil wetness, the latter being most relevant for organic soils. The methodology is equally applicable to and relevant for mineral soils. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In many freshwater ecosystems, the contents of NO3- and SO42- have increased, whereas O-2 has been depleted due to the increased acid and nutrient loads. These changes may. affect carbon turnover and the dynamics of the major greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O. We studied the effects of O-2, NO3-, and SO42- availability on carbon mineralization, and fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the sediments of hypermeutrophic Lake Kevaton, Finland. Undisturbed sediment cores from the deep (9 m) and shallow (4 m) profundal were incubated in a laboratory microcosm with oxic and anoxic water flows with NO3- or SO42- concentrations of 0, 30, 100, 300, and 2000 muM. The carbon mineralization rate (i.e., the sum of released CO2-C and CH4-C) was not affected by the oxidants. However, the oxidants did change the pathways of carbon degradation and the release of CH4. All of the oxidants depressed CH4. fluxes in the shallow profundal sediments, which had low organic matter content. In the deep profundal sediments rich in organic matter, the CH4 release was reduced by O-2 but was not affected by SO42- (the effect of NO3- was not studied). There was an increase in N2O release as the overlying water NO3- concentration increased. Anoxia and highly elevated NO3- concentrations, associated with eutrophication, increased drastically the global warming potential (GWP) of the sedimentary gases in contrast to the SO42- load, which had only minor effects on the GWP.

AB Background: The important greenhouse gas (GHG) methane is produced naturally in anaerobic wetland soils. By affecting the production, oxidation and transport of methane to the atmosphere, plants have a major influence upon the quantities emitted by wetlands. Different species and functional plant groups have been shown to affect these processes differently, but our knowledge about how these effects are influenced by abiotic factors such as water regime and temperature remains limited. Here we present a mesocosm experiment comparing eight plant species for their effects on internal transport and overall emissions of methane under contrasting hydrological conditions. To quantify how much methane was transported internally through plants (the chimney effect), we blocked diffusion from the soil surface with an agar seal.
   Results: We found that graminoids caused higher methane emissions than forbs, although the emissions from mesocosms with different species were either lower than or comparable to those from control mesocosms with no plant (i.e. bare soil). Species with a relatively greater root volume and a larger biomass exhibited a larger chimney effect, though overall methane emissions were negatively related to plant biomass. Emissions were also reduced by lowering the water table.
   Conclusions: We conclude that plant species (and functional groups) vary in the degree to which they transport methane to the atmosphere. However, a plant with a high capacity to transport methane does not necessarily emit more methane, as it may also cause more rhizosphere oxidation of methane. A shift in plant species composition from graminoids to forbs and/or from low to high productive species may lead to reduction of methane emissions.

AB We examined net greenhouse gas exchange at the soil surface in deciduous forests on soils with high organic contents. Fluxes Of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured using dark static chambers for two consecutive years in three different forest types; (i) a drained and medium productivity site dominated by birch, (ii) a drained and highly productive site dominated by alder and (iii) an undrained and highly productive site dominated by alder. Although the drained sites had shallow mean groundwater tables (15 and 18 cm, respectively) their average annual rates of forest floor CO2 release were almost twice as high compared to the undrained site (1.9 +/- 0.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3, compared to 1.0 +/- 0.2 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). The average annual CH4 emission was almost 10 times larger at the undrained site (7.6 +/- 3.1 compared to 0.9 +/- 0.5 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) for the two drained sites). The average annual N2O emissions at the undrained site (0.1 +/- 0.05 g N2O m(-2) yr(-1)) were lower than at the drained sites, and the emissions were almost five times higher at the drained alder site than at the drained birch site (0.9 +/- 0.35 compared to 0.2 +/- 0.11 g N2O m(-2)yr(-1)). The temporal variation in forest floor CO2 release could be explained to a large extent by differences in groundwater table and air temperature, but little of the variation in the CH4 and N2O fluxes could be explained by these variables. The measured soil variables were only significant to explain for the within-site spatial variation in CH4 and N2O fluxes at the undrained swamp, and dark forest floor CO2 release was not explained by these variables at any site. The between-site spatial variation was attributed to variations in drainage, groundwater level position, productivity and tree species for all three gases. The results indicate that N2O emissions are of greater importance for the net greenhouse gas exchange at deciduous drained forest sites than at coniferous drained forest sites. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Estimating future fluxes of CH4 between land and atmosphere requires well-conceived process-based biogeochemical models. Current models do not represent the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in land surface soils, in spite of increasing evidence that this process is widespread. Our objective was to determine whether AOM, or potential AOM, commonly occurs in 20 hydromorphic soils spanning a wide range of chemical properties. Bulk soil samples were collected under shallow water near the shoreline of 15 recently drained fish ponds in southern Bohemia (Czech Republic), as well as from below the water table at 3 peatland locations in northeast Scotland and 2 acid sulfate soils on the southern coast of Finland. Each soil slurry was incubated under both oxic and anoxic conditions, with or without the addition of alternative electron acceptors (SO42- and NO) or H2PO4-. Here, "oxic" and "anoxic" conditions refer to anoxic soil respectively incubated in a headspace containing air or argon. Using the isotope dilution method, we determined the gross production and oxidation rates of CH4 after 2 days incubation under oxic headspace conditions, and after 2, 21 and 60 days incubation under anoxic conditions. Large differences in net CH4 fluxes were observed between soil types and between incubation conditions. AOM was detected in each of the 20 bulk soil samples, which spanned >6 pH units and 2 orders of magnitude in organic C content. Significant positive relationships were found between AOM and gross CH4 production rates under anoxic conditions, resulting in AOM rates that were sometimes higher than CH4 oxidation rates under oxic headspace conditions. There was no relationship between net and gross CH4 production rates, such that 2 soil types could display similar low net rates, yet conceal very large differences in gross rates. The effects of alternative electron acceptors on AOM were idiosyncratic and resulted in no net trend. We did find, however, a negative effect of SO42- and H2FO4- on gross CH4 production rates under anoxic and oxic conditions respectively. Under oxic headspace conditions, CH4 oxidation was related to soil organic C content. Taken collectively, our results suggest that AOM, or potential AOM, is prevalent over a wide range of soil types, that AOM may contribute substantially to CH4 oxidation in soils, and that AOM in soils should be integrated to current process-based CH4 cycling models.

AB Flooding boreal forest ecosystems for hydroelectric power generation may release substantial amounts of carbon (C) to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. The objectives of this study were to evaluate CO2 and CH4 production rates using spring/fall (14 degrees C) and summer (21 degrees C) temperatures under non-flooded and flooded conditions. Incubation temperatures represented the mean annual air temperature in May and September (14 degrees C), and in July (21 degrees C). Greenhouse gas production rates were quantified using laboratory incubations of 2 contrasting soil types (Humo-Ferric Podzol [very dry, mineral] and a Histic Folisol [moist, organic]) collected at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. The mean production rate of CO2 and CH4 in the headspace of the incubation jars was significantly influenced by temperature, flooding and soil type. Results showed that the mean CO2 (65 [Podzol]; 43 [Folisol]) and CH4 (0.06 [Podzol]; 0.06 [Folisol]) production rates (mu g.g(-1).d(-1)) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) at 21 degrees C and in flooded treatments from both soil types. The greatest CO2 and CH4 production rates (mu g.g(-1).d(-1)) occurred from the Folisol (110 [CO2]; 0.03 [CH4]) and the L and FH horizons of the Podzol (250 [CO2]; 0.05 [CH4]). Q(10) values showed that decomposition of soil organic matter was more temperature dependent in non-flooded treatments, with values ranging from 1.57 to 5.03, than in flooded treatments (1.31 to 3.58). The greatest loss of soil organic carbon relative to the original C content (g.m(-2)) occurred in the Ah horizon of the Podzol in non-flooded (0.01% [14 degrees C]; 0.02% [21 degrees C]) and flooded (0.02% [14 degrees C]; 0.03% [21 degrees C]) treatments and at both temperatures. Information presented in this paper helps to evaluate how 2 contrasting soil types (Podzol and Folisol) responded to flooding and provided further insight into the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) production rates as a result of hydroelectric reservoir creation. This will aid in future planning, construction, and management of hydroelectric reservoirs to help minimize GHG emissions and boreal forest disturbance.

AB Humans utilise about 40% of the earth's net primary production (NPP) but the products of this NPP are often managed by different sectors, with timber and forest products managed by the forestry sector and food and fibre products from croplands and grasslands managed by the agricultural sector. Other significant anthropogenic impacts on the global carbon cycle include human utilization of fossil fuels and impacts on less intensively managed systems such as peatlands, wetlands and permafrost. A great deal of knowledge, expertise and data is available within each sector. We describe the contribution of sectoral carbon budgets to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Whilst many sectors exhibit similarities for carbon budgeting, some key differences arise due to differences in goods and services provided, ecology, management practices used, land-management personnel responsible, policies affecting land management, data types and availability, and the drivers of change. We review the methods and data sources available for assessing sectoral carbon budgets, and describe some of key data limitations and uncertainties for each sector in different regions of the world. We identify the main gaps in our knowledge/data, show that coverage is better for the developed world for most sectors, and suggest how sectoral carbon budgets could be improved in the future. Research priorities include the development of shared protocols through site networks, a move to full carbon accounting within sectors, and the assessment of full greenhouse gas budgets.

AB The implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategies and Actions Plans (NBSAP), as required by Article 6 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), would improve the base for political decisions by quantifying the costs and benefits of biodiversity conservation in monetary terms and by illustrating the benefits of related ecosystem services (ESS). However, so far the costs and benefits of the NBSAP have not been routinely estimated. This paper presents results from research quantifying the financial costs and benefits of implementing a set of measures based on the National Strategy on Biological Diversity in Germany (NBS). Based on the NBS and the Quality Status Reports of the EU Habitat Directive, a conservation program was developed consisting of land use changes for six ecosystems/land use types: forests, arable land, grassland, peatlands, wetlands and dry habitats. In addition to the benefits of maintaining biodiversity, two potential ESS benefits of the NBS, water purification and climate mitigation, are estimated as well as the financial costs of implementation. A nationwide contingent valuation study was undertaken to determine the benefits of maintaining biodiversity as a result of the conservation program. The benefits of the conservation program with regard to the ESS water purification are calculated for N-reduction in the leachate and based on abatement costs. The contribution of nature conservation to climate mitigation is calculated for the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and based on damage costs. The results of the study indicate that the implementation of the NBS would lead to significant financial costs, but the benefits would exceed the financial costs of measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a crucial resource to reduce the environmental impact of fossil-fueled vehicles, especially with regards to maritime transport, where LNG is increasingly used for ship bunkering. The present paper gives insights on how the installation of LNG tanks inside harbors can be capitalized to increase the energy efficiency of port cities and reduce GHG emissions. To this purpose, a novel integrated energy system is introduced. The Boil Off Gas (BOG) from LNG tanks is exploited in a combined plant, where heat and power are produced by a regenerated gas turbine cycle; at the same time, cold exergy from LNG regasification contributes to an increase in the efficiency of a vapor compression refrigeration cycle. In the paper, the integrated energy system is simulated by means of dynamic modeling under daily variable working conditions. Results confirm that the model is stable and able to determine the time behavior of the integrated plant. Energy saving is evaluated, and daily trends of key thermophysical parameters are reported and discussed. The analysis of thermal recovering from the flue gases shows that it is possible to recover a large energy share from the turbine exhausts. Hence, the system can generate electricity for port cold ironing and, through a secondary brine loop, cold exergy for a refrigeration plant. Overall, the proposed solution allows primary energy savings up to 22% when compared with equivalent standard technologies with the same final user needs. The exploitation of an LNG regasification process through smart integration of energy systems and implementation of efficient energy grids can contribute to greener energy management in harbors.

AB Alpine wetlands play a sensitive function in global carbon cycle during the ongoing climate warming, yet the temporal patterns of carbon dynamics from in situ ground-based long-term observations remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured with the eddy covariance technique over an alpine peatland on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2007 to 2016. The wetland acted as a net CO2 source with a positive NEE (120.4 +/- 34.8 gC m(-2) year(-1), Mean +/- SD), with the mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP) of 500.3 +/- 59.4 gC m(-2) year(-1) and annual ecosystem respiration (RES) of 620.7 +/- 74.2 gC m(-2) year(-1). At the seasonal scale, the classification and regression trees (CART) analysis showed that aggregated growing season degree days (GDDs) were the predominant determinant on variations in monthly NEE and monthly GPP. Variations in monthly RES were determined by soil temperature (Ts). Furthermore, nongrowing season Ts had a significant positive correlation with the following year annual GPP (p < 0.05). Nongrowing season RES only accounted for about 25% of annual RES but had significant correlation with annual RES and annual NEE (p < 0.05). The further partial correlation analysis showed that nongrowing season air temperature (Ta, p = 0.05), rather than precipitation (PPT, p = 0.25) was a predominant determinant on variations in annual NEE. Our results highlighted the importance in carbon dynamics of climate fluctuations and CO2 emission from the nongrowing season in alpine wetlands. We speculated that the vast peadlands would positively feedback to climate change on the Tibetan plateau where the nongrowing season warming was significant.

TI Climate protection through rewetting of fen foils: welfare effects shown
   on the example of the Eider-Treene region in Schleswig-Holstein
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
ID ORGANIC SOILS; EMISSIONS; GERMANY
AB By raising the groundwater level of fen soils large amounts of greenhouse gases can be saved at low cost. The Eider-Treene lowland in Schleswig-Holstein served as an example for two scenarios of raising groundwater levels (by 10 and 20 cm). The cost for raising the groundwater level by 10 cm amounted to (sic)12/t co2-eq/year on average, and for raising levels by 20 cm it amounted to (sic)17/t co2eq/year on average. For agricultural undertakings this means costs in the order of (sic)112 and (sic)359 respectively per hectare and year, and in terms of capitalization this corresponds to a reduced present value (losses in land value) amounting to (sic)2240 and (sic)7018 per hectare. In the areas considered for rewetting; dairy farming would be particularly affected by any such measure.
   In this study the calculated costs correspond to the losses in the contribution margin, therefore a wide variability in individual costs shows, depending on the milk price paid. From possible compensation payments by the State to farmers it would be mainly larger dairy farms and beef farmers who benefit. Here, this leads to contribution margin gains amounting to up to (sic)300/hectare and year, i.e. increases in land present value amounting to up to (sic)6000/ha. Smaller farms would be under increased cost pressure due to this type of climate protection measure (losses in the contribution margin of up to (sic)220/hectare and year, i.e. losses in land present value amounting to up to (sic)4440/ha); structural change in this region would thus accelerate further. In the long-term considerable investments in the maintenance and expansion of drainage pumping stations could be saved. In comparison with other climate protection measures, raising the groundwater level of fen areas is an inexpensive way to save considerable amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of a dynamic management of groundwater, i.e. high groundwater levels in winter, and water levels of approx. 30 cm under groundwater level during the growing season, would moreover allow for the continuation of moderate dairy farming activities in lowland regions.

AB The growth pattern (phenology), resource allocation (morphology) and biomass accumulation of plant above-ground components is expected to have a feedback on root-associated processes in soil like water uptake, nutrient cycling and gas production. The aim was to see how above-ground plant characteristics (phenology, morphology and biomass) would impact water depletion, mineral nitrogen (N) concentration and carbon dioxide (CO2-C) and nitrous oxide (N2O-N) production from root-associated soil of Arabidopsis thaliana lines (wild ecotypes and down regulated mutants of MYB75, KNAT7 and CCR1 having altered lignin concentration in secondary cell walls) at various plant developmental stages. Phenology and morphology were determined on A. thaliana lines grown to maturity in peat moss-based substrate under controlled conditions. Plant biomass, water use, soil mineral N concentration and root-associated soil respiration were measured at various growth stages of A. thaliana lines grown in un-drained plastic pots containing clay-loam soil. The CCR1 mutant line had delayed maturation. While MYB75 and KNAT7 had similar morphology as the wild ecotype, the CCR1 line had fewer and smaller viable fruits, less crown cover of rosette leaves and lower biomass than the wild ecotype. The CCR1 mutant line had lower evapo-transpiration than the wild ecotype. Respiration of root-associated soil planted with MYB75 and KNAT7 was similar to the wild ecotype. Higher N2O production from soil planted with CCR1 was attributed to higher soil moisture content and mineral N concentration of bulk and rhizosphere soil than the wild ecotype. Morphology and biomass exerts strong influence on water content, mineral N concentration and soil respiration. Due to prolonged vegetative growth phase, reduced fecundity and biomass, the CCR1 mutant lowered evapotranspiration and left more mineral N in root-associated soils, which explained the higher N2O emission from soil during its growth and development.

AB NO and N2O formation and destruction was studied in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed combustor for a set of coals ranging from lignite to anthracite. For a given coal, the sum of fuel-N conversions to N2O and NO was found to be remarkably constant over a range of temperatures, although emission levels of individual species were strongly temperature-dependent (NO increases and N2O decreases with increasing temperature). A similar behavior was observed for the formation of NO and N2O during combustion of chars. This trade-off between N2O and NO emissions can be regarded as a constant conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen to N-2. The influence of NO addition on the formation of N2O and N-2 was investigated in packed-bed gasification experiments using char prepared from a bituminous coal. The inlet concentration of NO was at a level typical for fluidized-bed combustion. It was found that NO reduction on char surface was strongly enhanced in the presence of oxygen. The majority of the added NO was converted to N-2, but some N2O was also formed. The temperature-governed trade-off between emissions of NO and N2O, and the formation of N2O and N-2 from NO reduction, are qualitatively explained on the basis of known heterogeneous and homogeneous NO/N2O chemistry.

AB Herbivory is an important part of most ecosystems and affects the ecosystems' carbon balance both directly and indirectly. Little is known about herbivory and its impact on the carbon balance in high arctic mire ecosystems. We hypothesized that trampling and grazing by large herbivores influences the vegetation density and composition and thereby also the carbon balance. In 2010, we established fenced exclosures in high arctic Greenland to prevent muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) from grazing. During the growing seasons of 2011 to 2013 we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes in these ungrazed blocks and compared them to blocks subjected to natural grazing. Additionally, we measured depth of the water table and active layer, soil temperature, and in 2011 and 2013 an inventory of the vegetation density and composition were made. In 2013 a significant decrease in total number of vascular plant (33-44%) and Eriophorum scheuchzeri (51-53%) tillers were found in ungrazed plots, the moss-layer and amount of litter had also increased substantially in these plots. This resulted in a significant decrease in net ecosystem uptake of CO2 (47%) and likewise a decrease in CH4 emission (44%) in ungrazed plots in 2013. While the future of the muskoxen in a changing arctic is unknown, this experiment points to a potentially large effect of large herbivores on the carbon balance in natural Arctic ecosystems. It thus sheds light on the importance of grazing mammals, and hence adds to our understanding of natural ecosystem greenhouse gas balance in the past and in the future.

AB Water depth (WD) influences wetland methane (CH4) emissions by affecting plant growth and the physical and chemical properties of soil. We studied the factors influencing CH4 emission dynamics at different WD in reclaimed reed wetland in Hangzhou Bay, China. The annual average WD was set as WD0 (0 cm), WD1 (10 cm), WD2 (20 cm), and WD3 (35 cm). The transparent chamber-gas chromatography method was used to determine CH4 fluxes during the growing season. Results showed that the average CH4 flux was 7.03 mg m(-2) h(-1), and that CH4 fluxes under all 4 WDs presented as a CH4 source. CH4 emissions of the reed wetland showed obvious seasonal changes; summer was the peak period for CH4 emissions. In a vigorous growth period of reeds, the CH4 flux gradually increased as WD increased. However, in early and late growth periods of reed, CH4 flux first increased (WD0 < WD1 < WD2) then decreased (WD2 > WD3) as WD increased. Correlation analysis showed that at the 4 WDs, CH4 flux was significantly, positively correlated with air temperature, soil temperature, and aboveground biomass of reeds, and were highly significantly positively correlated with water temperature. In addition, at WD0, CH4 flux also showed a significant, positive correlation with soil organic carbon content in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers, and was significantly negatively correlated with soil water content. Hence, WD significantly influenced wetland CH4 emissions. Temperature and biomass were major influencing factors of CH4 emission in reed wetland at different WDs.

AB We investigated the effects of drying-wetting and freezing-thawing cycles on the emission of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane from intact soil cores from farmed organic soils at sites in Germany, Sweden and Finland. During the first week following wetting or thawing, cores from the German and Swedish sites produced an up to 1000-fold increase in N2O emission rates. The total surplus N2O emission due to the first wetting event ranged between 3 and 140 mg N-N2O m(-2), and between 13 and 340 mg N-N2O m(-2) due to the first thawing event but declined following two successive freeze-thaw events. Wetting and thawing produced a greater surplus emission of N2O from grassland sites compared to arable sites. Following wetting, denitrification was responsible for the majority of N2O emission from the German grassland soil while in the German ploughed soil and the Swedish soils denitrification was responsible for less than 60% of the N2O emission. In contrast, following thawing, denitrification was responsible for < 40% of N2O emission from the German grassland soil while in the remaining German and Swedish soils denitrification was responsible for most of the emission. Wetting or thawing of soil cores from the Finnish sites did not result in any significant increase in N2O emission rates perhaps because a prolonged drought at the time of soil core collection had changed soil properties considerably. The CO2 emission rates increased up to 5-fold following wetting or thawing, The total surplus CO2 emission ranged from 0.0 to 13 9 C-CO2 m(-2), differed between locations and land use, and decreased during successive cycles of freezing and thawing. The total surplus CO2 emission from grassland sites following thawing was generally higher than from arable and forest sites probably due to decomposition of carbon sources liberated from stressed grass roots. Methane emission rates were very small and often below our detection limit (< 1 mug C-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)); no effects of wetting or thawing on CH4 emission rates were observed at any of the sites, A comparison with annual emission rates of N2O and CO2 showed that even a single wetting or thawing event may account for a large proportion of the N2O emission from farmed organic soils.

AB Many ecological functions of wetlands are influenced by wet-periods, i.e., the time interval when groundwater table (GWT) is continuously near the land surface. Hence, there is a crucial need to understand the controls on interannual variations of wet-periods. Given the scarcity of long-term measurements of GWT in wetlands, understanding variations in wet-periods using a measurement approach alone is challenging. Here we used a physically based, fully distributed hydrologic model, in synergy with publicly available hydrologic data, to simulate long-term wet-period variations in 10 inland forested wetlands in a southeastern US watershed. A Bayesian regression and variable selection framework was then implemented to (a) evaluate the extent to which the simulated wet-periods can be estimated and predicted by precipitation (Ppt) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and (b) infer the relative roles of seasonal Ppt and PET. Our results indicate that wet-period start date and duration could vary by more than 6 months during the 32 year simulation period. Remarkably, 60-90% of these variations could be captured using regressions based on seasonal Ppt and PET in most wetlands. Effects of seasonal meteorological conditions on wet-period variations were found to be nonuniform, which indicate that the annual variables may not explain interannual variations in wet-periods. The Bayesian framework was able to predict wet-period variations with errors smaller than 1 month at a 90% confidence level. The presented framework provides a minimalistic approach for estimating and predicting wet-period variations in wetlands and may be used to understand the future responses of associated ecological functions in wetlands.

AB 'Alases' are mature thermokarst depressions covered by grassland distributed in taiga forests in central Yakutia, eastern Siberia, following thermokarst formation initiated in early Holocene. Alases are important land-cover class in the central Yakutia lowland occupying 17% of the total land area. CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured temporally in a typical alas which have a pond at the center during the growing season of two years. Seven monitoring plots represented various vegetation types: a larch forest (F), a dry grassland (DG), four wet grasslands (WG) flooded temporarily or continuously, and a pond surface (P) flooded continuously without vegetation. The pond flooding area reached its maximum just after snow-melting and decreased during the summer. The F and DG plots were small CH4 sinks. The wet plots (including WG and P) were large CH4 sources (cumulative value of growing season: 17 to 864 kg CH4-C ha(-1)), and emission rates vary drastically depending on flooding conditions. All plots were slight sources or sinks of N2O except for the WG plots (0.16 to 1.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) where peak emissions were observed after the flooding ended. The global warming potentials (time horizon of 100 years) of the cumulative N2O emissions from the plots were lower than those of each CH4 emissions. Estimated total CH4 emission from the whole WG area (7.93 ha) accounted for 88% of the emission from the whole alas (28.9 ha). The current permafrost-taiga region in central Yakutia could be a net CH4 source owing to the presence of alases.

AB Growing evidence suggests that tropospheric ozone has widespread effects on vegetation, which can contribute to alter ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics and belowground processes. In this study, we used intact soil mesocosms from a semi-improved grassland and investigated the effects of elevated ozone, alone and in combination with nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil-borne greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem C fluxes. Ozone exposure under fully open-air field conditions was occurred during the growing season. Across a one-year period, soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions did not differ between treatments, but elevated ozone significantly depressed soil CH4 uptake by 14% during the growing season irrespective of N fertilization. Elevated ozone resulted in a 15% reduction of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, while N fertilization significantly increased ecosystem respiration during the growing season. Aboveground biomass was unaffected by elevated ozone during the growing season but significantly decreased by 17% during the non-growing season. At the end of the experiment, soil mineral N content, net N mineralization and extracellular enzyme activities (Le., cellobiohydrolase and leucine aminopeptidase) were higher under elevated ozone than ambient ozone. The short-term effect of single application of N fertilizer was primarily responsible for the lack of the interaction between elevated ozone and N fertilization. Therefore, results of our short-term study suggest that ozone exposure may have negative impacts on soil CH4 uptake and C sequestration and contribute to accelerated rates of soil N cycling.

AB Temperate forest soils are usually efficient sinks for the greenhouse gas methane, at least in the absence of significant amounts of methanogens. We demonstrate here that trafficking with heavy harvesting machines caused a large reduction in CH(4) consumption and even turned well-aerated forest soils into net methane sources. In addition to studying methane fluxes, we investigated the responses of methanogens after trafficking in two different forest sites. Trafficking generated wheel tracks with different impact (low, moderate, severe, and unaffected). We found that machine passes decreased the soils' macropore space and lowered hydraulic conductivities in wheel tracks. Severely compacted soils yielded high methanogenic abundance, as demonstrated by quantitative PCR analyses of methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) genes, whereas these sequences were undetectable in unaffected soils. Even after a year after traffic compression, methanogen abundance in compacted soils did not decline, indicating a stability of methanogens here over time. Compacted wheel tracks exhibited a relatively constant community structure, since we found several persisting mcrA sequence types continuously present at all sampling times. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a rather large methanogen diversity in the compacted soil, and most mcrA gene sequences were mostly similar to known sequences from wetlands. The majority of mcrA gene sequences belonged either to the order Methanosarcinales or Methanomicrobiales, whereas both sites were dominated by members of the families Methanomicrobiaceae Fencluster, with similar sequences obtained from peatland environments. The results show that compacting wet forest soils by heavy machinery causes increases in methane production and release.

AB Soil respiration is one of the largest terrestrial fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, small changes in soil respiration rates could have large effects on atmospheric CO2. In order to assess CO2 emissions from diverse European soils with different land-use types and climate (soil moisture and temperature), we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment.
   Emission measurements of CO2 under controlled conditions were conducted using soil monoliths of nine sites from a European flux network (ECLAIRE). The sites are located all over Europe - from the United Kingdom in the west to Ukraine in the east, and from Italy in the south to Finland in the north - and can be separated according to four land-use types (forests, grasslands, arable lands and one peatland). Intact soil cores were incubated in the laboratory in a two-way factorial design, with temperature (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and water-filled pore space (WFPS; 5, 20, 40, 60 and 80 %) as the independent variables, while CO2 flux was the response variable. The latter was measured with an automated laboratory incubation measurement system.
   Land use generally had a substantial influence on carbon dioxide fluxes, with the order of CO2 emission rates of the different land-use types being grassland > peatland > forest/arable land (P < 0.001). CO2 efflux responded strongly to varying temperature and moisture content with optimum moisture contents for CO2 emissions between 40 and 70% WFPS and a positive relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature. The relationship between temperature and CO2 emissions could be well described by a Gaussian model. Q(10) values ranged between 0.86 and 10.85 and were negatively related to temperature for most of the moisture contents and sites investigated. At higher temperatures the effect of water and temperature on Q(10) was very low. In addition, under cold temperatures Q(10) varied with moisture contents, indicating a stronger prospective effect of rain events in cold areas on temperature sensitivity. At both coniferous forest sites we found a strong increase in the temperature sensitivity at a moisture range between 20 and 40% WFPS.
   We developed a new approach to calculate moisture sensitivity (MS) of CO2 efflux. MS was calculated as the slope of a polynomial function of second degree. Moisture sensitivities were highest under dry and wet conditions. In addition we found a positive relationship between MS of CO2 efflux and temperature for both arable lands.

AB The methane emitted from freshwater marsh is the difference between the production and oxidation of CH4 which reaches the atmosphere via diffusion, ebullition, or by passage through aerenchymous tissues of higher plants. To evaluate the variation of CH4 emission and the effects of increased exogenous N on CH4 emission, we have raised in situ the exogenous N with the rates of 0 g N m(-2) (control), 6 g N m(-2) (low nitrogen level), 12 g N m(-2) (medial nitrogen level) and 24 g N m(-2) (high nitrogen level), respectively, in Sanjiang Plain marsh ecosystem Northeast China. CH4 emissions were measured using the static chamber and gas chromatogram techniques. The daily average CH4 emission during the different growing stages from the marsh varies from -0.06 to 13.54mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with the daily observation. The exogenous N significantly increased the mean seasonal CH4 emission rate by 181% (low nitrogen level, P<0.01), 254% (medial nitrogen level, P<0.01) and 155% (high nitrogen level, P<0.01), respectively. The effects of exogenous N strongly interacted with the plant aboveground biomass, which was a variable explaining most variation in CH4 emission. We also find the net effect of exogenous N on CH4 emission from freshwater marshes most likely depends on the counterbalance between the N-induced increases in CH4 production and oxidation, as a N excess may result in the inhibition of CH4 emission, and in the stimulation of CH4 emission.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) is a forested peatland that provides a number of ecosystem services including carbon (C) sequestration. We modeled and analyzed the potential capacity of the GDS to sequester C under four management scenarios: no management, no management with catastrophic fire, current management, and increased management. The analysis uses the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator developed for the GDS to estimate net ecosystem C balance. The model simulates net C gains and losses on an annual time-step from 2013 through 2062 which is converted to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) and monetized using the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon. Our analysis incorporates compounded uncertainty including variation in ecological processes, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, and uncertainty in the discount rate. The no management scenario results in 2.4 million tons of CO2 emissions with a Net Present Value (NPV) under a 3% discount rate of -$67 million. No management with catastrophic fires emits 6.5 million tons of CO2 with an NPV of - $232 million. Current management avoids 9.9 million tons of emissions (via sequestration) with an NPV of $326 million. Increased management avoids 16.5 million tons of emissions with an NPV of $524 million.

AB Negative carbon-isotope excursions have been comprehensively studied in the stratigraphic record but the discussion of causal mechanisms has largely overlooked the potential role of biomass burning. The carbon-isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of vegetation, soil organic matter and peat are significantly lower than atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and thereby provide a source of low C-13 CO2 when combusted. In this study, the potential role of biomass burning to generate negative carbon isotope excursions associated with greenhouse climates is modeled. Results indicate that major peat combustion sustained for 1000 yr increases atmospheric CO2 from 2.5x present atmospheric levels (PAL) to 4.6x PAL, and yields a pronounced negative delta C-13 excursion in the atmosphere (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand), vegetation (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand) and the surface ocean (similar to 1.2 parts per thousand), but not for the deep ocean (similar to 0.9 parts per thousand). Release Of CO2 initiates a short-term warming of the atmosphere (up to 14.4 degrees C, with a duration of 1628 yr), which is consistent with the magnitude and length of an observed Toarcian excursion event. These results indicate that peat combustion is a plausible mechanism for driving negative delta C-13 excursions in the rock record, even during times of elevated rho CO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The wetlands play an important role in carbon storage, especially at high latitudes, at which they store nearly one-third of global soil carbons. However, few studies have investigated the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the long-term, especially effects of freeze-thaw cycles on these gases emissions in freshwater marsh ecosystems. In this paper, we collected greenhouse gas emission data from a freshwater marsh area in China for 4 years, evaluated their release variables and speculated on their potential atmospheric impact. For this paper, we report on the CO2, CH4 and NO emission rates recorded from June 2002 to November 2005 in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. We measured their interannual variations and fluctuations, as well as factors affecting their emissions, and estimated their regulation and freeze-thaw cycle impacts. Our results revealed obvious CO2 and CH4 emission fluctuations during the winter months, and during the freeze-thaw cycle, and a strong interannual variation during the growing season. Overall, we documented a close relationship between the CO2 and CH4 emissions, implicating some regulatory commonality. We determined that the marsh was a N2O sink during the winter, but a significant source of NO during the freeze-thaw cycle as the temperature increased, especially in early summer. During the thaw-freeze period, the N2O levels were positively correlated with the water depth. Additionally, water depth greatly governed the interannual variation of the N2O emissions from the marshes during the thaw-freeze period. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It was the aim of this study to investigate denitrification N loss and plant effects on its variability in cultures of potted ornamental plants. Experiments were conducted in flow-through chambers with plants of P. zonale 'Grand Prix' and E. pulcherrima 'Sonora Red' grown in peat substrate. Acetylene was applied at 5 vol.% to inhibit reduction of N(2)O. N emissions from planted pots started to evolve 2 to 4 hours after each irrigation event and followed a peak shaped curve. Variability in height and width of peaks was high among replications. N emissions strongly depended on high substrate water content; they ceased when water content dropped below a threshold value. Permanent flooding as well as reduction of plant transpiration retarded the decrease in water content and increased the duration of N emissions. Plant transpiration showed a close relationship to vapour pressure deficit (vpd) of air and mean N losses showed good correlation to vpds. It was concluded that plant transpiration determined the duration of denitrifying activity. With increasing plant age and size the duration of N emissions shortened but plants also seemed to increasingly stimulate N emissions. Emissions from potted eight-week old P. zonale evolved sooner and reached a maximum that was more than twice as high as those of four-week old plants. Possible reasons for stimulating and reducing plant effects on denitrification are discussed.

AB Soils are large sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases, and both the magnitude and composition of soil gas emissions are strongly controlled by redox conditions. Though the effect of redox dynamics on greenhouse gas emissions has been well studied in flooded soils, less research has focused on redox dynamics without total soil inundation. For the latter, all that is required are soil conditions where the rate of oxygen (O-2) consumption exceeds the rate of atmospheric replenishment. We investigated the effects of soil anaerobiosis, generated with and without flooding, on greenhouse gas emissions and redox-sensitive biogeochemistry. We collected a Histosol from a regularly flooded peatland pasture and an Ultisol from a humid tropical forest where soil experiences frequent low redox events. We used a factorial design of flooding and anaerobic dinitrogen (N-2) headspace treatments applied to replicate soil microcosms. An N-2 headspace suppressed carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 50% in both soils. Flooding, however, led to greater anaerobic CO2 emissions from the Ultisol. Methane emissions under N-2 were also significantly greater with flooding in the Ultisol. Flooding led to very low N2O emissions after an initial pulse in the Histosol, while higher emission rates were maintained in control and N-2 treatments. We conclude that soil greenhouse gas emissions are sensitive to the redox effects of O-2 depletion as a driver of anaerobiosis and that flooding can have additional effects independent of O-2 depletion. We emphasize that changes to the soil diffusive environment under flooding impacts transport of all gases, not only O-2, and changes in dissolved solute availability under flooding may lead to increased mineralization of C.

AB Wetlands at the interface of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are intensive sites for mineralization of organic matter, but the contribution of winter season fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O from wetland ecosystems to annual budgets is poorly known. By using the static opaque chamber and GC techniques, fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O at two freshwater marshes in the Sanjiang Plain were measured during the winter seasons of 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 with contrasting snow conditions and flooding regimes. The results showed that there were significant interannual and spatial differences in CH4, CO2 and N2O fluxes. The Carex lasiocarpa marsh emitted more CH4 and CO2 while absorbed less N2O than the Deyeuxia angustifolia marsh during the winter seasons. Over the winter season, emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O ranged from 0.42 to 2.41 gC/m(2), from 24.13 to 50.16 gC/m(2), and from -25.20-to -148.96 mgN/m(2), respectively. The contributions of winter season CH4 and CO2 emission to the annual budgets were 2.32%-4.62% and 22.17%-27.97%, respectively. Marshes uptake N2O during the freezing period, while release N2O during the thawing period. The winter uptake equaled to 13.70%-86.69% of the growing-season loss. We conclude that gas exchange between soil/snow and the atmosphere in the winter season contributed greatly to the annual budgets and cannot be ignored in a cool temperate freshwater marsh in Northeast China.

AB In less populated rural areas constructed wetlands with a groundfilter made out of the local soil mixed with peat and planted with common reed (Phragmites australis) are increasingly used to purify waste water. Particularly in the rhizosphere of the reed, nitrification and denitrification processes take place varying locally and temporally, and the question arises to what extent this type of waste-water treatment plant may contribute to the release of N2O. In situ N2O measurements were carried out in the two reed beds of the Friedelhausen dairy farm, Hesse, Germany, irrigated with the waste water from a cheese dairy and 70 local inhabitants (12 m(3) waste water or 6 kg BOD5 or 11 kg chemical O-2 demand (CODMn) day(-1)). During November 1995 to March 1996, the release of N2O was measured weekly at Im distances using eight open chambers and molecular-sieve traps to collect and absorb the emitted N2O. Simultanously, the N2O trapped in the soil, the soil temperature, as well as the concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N, water-soluble C and the pH were determined at depths of 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm. In the waste water from the in- and outflow the concentrations of CODMn, BOD5, NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N, as well as the pH, were determined weekly. Highly varying amounts of N2O were emitted at all measuring dates during the winter. Even at soil temperatures of -1.5 degrees C in 10 cm depth of soil or 2 degrees C at a depth of 50 cm, N2O was released. The highest organic matter and N transformation rates were recorded in the upper 20 cm of soil and in the region closest to the outflow of the constructed wetland. Not until a freezing period of several weeks did the N2O emissions drop drastically. During the period of decreasing temperatures less NO3--N was formed in the soil, but the NH4+-N concentrations increased. On average the constructed wetlands of Friedelhausen emitted about 15 mg N2O-N inhabitant equivalent(-1) day(-1) during the winter period. Nitrification-denitrification processes rather than heterotrophic denitrification are assumed to be responsible for the N2O production.

AB Reed has a long tradition as locally available thatching material, but nowadays thatch is a globally traded commodity. Germany and other major importing countries such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Denmark rely on high import rates to meet the national consumption. This study aimed at providing a detailed picture of the thatching reed market in Northern Germany and at assessing the market potential for reed of regional origin. A written survey among all thatchers in Northern Germany was carried out in 2019, arriving at an effective sample of 47 out of 141 companies. The results revealed that for the responding companies the majority of the reed (59%) was used for rethatching roofs completely, 24% for newly constructed roofs, and 17% for roof repairs. Reed from Germany held a low share of 17% of the total consumption in 2018. Own reed harvesting was conducted by less than 9% of the responding companies and given up during the last decades by another 26%. The total market volume of reed for thatching in Northern Germany was estimated for 2018 with a 95% confidence interval at 3 +/- 0.8 million bundles of reed with a monetary value at sales prices of euro11.6 +/- 2.8 million. Based on the end consumer demand, the supply gap for reed of regional or German origin was estimated at 523,000 +/- 392,000 bundles of reed equaling a market value of euro1.9 +/- 1.4 million, indicating high uncertainties. Most of the responding thatchers (70%) did not promote reed of regional origin, mainly due to insufficient availability but also a lack in quality was reported. The cultivation of reed in paludiculture, i.e., as climate-smart land use alternative to drainage-based agriculture on peatlands, can increase the availability of thatching reed in Germany and simultaneously reduce GHG emissions.

AB Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are a great improvement over waste-to-energy incineration plants supplying only heat, and power plants supplying only electricity. The primary purpose of a functioning CHP plant however, may be to provide district heating services, and thereby its main output will be heat energy. This paper is a case study commissioned by Karlskoga Energi och Miljo AB (KEMAB in short; Karlskoga Energy and Environment) in the Varmland State of south-central Sweden, and focuses on the functioning of the CHP plant owned and operated by the company. The life-cycles of the fuels used by the CHP - household/industrial waste, bio-oil, light fuel oil, wood waste, wood chips, a slaughterhouse-waste-derived product and peat to generate 202,222 MWh of heat, 119,234 MWh of steam and 28,220 MWh of electricity have been studied, and the carbon footprint calculated for year-2016. Using two sets of emissions factors for the combustion stage of the life-cycle, as part of a data uncertainty analysis, the total emissions were 44,000 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) and 58,000 tonnes CO2-eq respectively. A quasi-realistic scenario analysis in which plastics are not available for incineration and have to be substituted with alternatives has also been carried out, and while wood waste has been suggested as the best alternative with regard to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, availability permitting, a combination of alternatives has been mooted as the practical option.

AB We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes for 6 years following permanent flooding of an agriculturally managed organic soil at two water depths (similar to 25 and similar to 55 cm standing water) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, as part of research studying C dynamics in re-established wetlands. Flooding rapidly reduced gaseous C losses, and radiocarbon data showed that this, in part, was due to reduced oxidation of "old" C preserved in the organic soils. Both CO2 and CH4 emissions from the water surface increased during the first few growing seasons, concomitant with emergent marsh establishment, and thereafter appeared to stabilize according to plant communities. Areas of emergent marsh vegetation in the shallower wetland had greater net CO2 influx (-485 mg C m(-1) h(-1)), and lower CH4 emissions (11.5 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), than in the deeper wetland (-381 and 14.1 mg C m(-2) h(-1), respectively). Areas with submerged and floating vegetation in the deeper wetland had CH4 emissions similar to emergent vegetation (11.9 and 12.6 mg C m(-2) h(-1), respectively), despite lower net CO2 influx (-102 g C m(-2) h(-1)). Measurements of plant moderated net CO2 influx and CH4 efflux indicated greatest potential reduction of greenhouse gases in the more shallowly flooded wetland.

AB Measurements of the net methane exchange over a range of forest, moorland, and agricultural soils in Scotland were made during the period April to June 1994 and 1995. Fluxes of CH4 ranged from oxidation -12.3 to an emission of 6.8 ng m(-2) s(-1). The balance between CH4 oxidation and emission depended on the physical conditions of the soil, primarily soil moisture. The largest oxidation rates were found in the mineral forest soils, and CH4 emission was observed in several peat soils. The smallest oxidation rate was observed in an agricultural soil. The relationship between CH4 flux and soil moisture observed in pears (Flux(CH4) = 0.023 x %H2O (dry weight) - 7.44, p < 0.05) was such that CH4 oxidation was observed at soil moistures less than 325%(+/- 80%). CH4 emission was found at soil moistures exceeding this value. A large range of CH4 oxidation rates were observed over a small soil moisture range in the mineral soils. CH4 oxidation in mineral soils was negatively correlated with soil bulk density (Flux(CH4) = -37.35 x bulk density (g cm(-3)) +48.83, p < 0.05). Increased nitrogen loading of the soil due to N fixation, atmospheric deposition of N, and fertilisation, were consistently associated with decreases in the soil sink for CH4, typically in the range 50 to 80%, on a range of soil types and land uses.

AB The rapid expansion of Phragmites australis in brackish marshes of the East Coast of the USA has drawn much attention, because it may change vegetation diversity and ecosystem functions. In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.

AB Among the global coordinated patterns in soil temperature and methane emission from wetlands, a declining trend of optimal soil temperature for methane emissions from low to high latitudes has been witnessed, while the corresponding trend along the altitudinal gradient has not yet been investigated. We therefore selected two natural wetlands located at contrasting climatic zones from foothill and mountainside of Nepal Himalayas, to test: (1) whether the optimal temperature for methane emissions decreases from low to high altitude, and (2) whether there is a difference in temperature sensitivity of methane emissions from those wetlands. We found significant spatial and temporal variation of methane emissions between the two wetlands and seasons. Soil temperature was the dominant driver for seasonal variation in methane emissions from both wetlands, though its effect was perplexed by the level of standing water, aquatic plants, and dissolved organic carbon, particularly in the deep water area. When integrative comparison was conducted by adding the existing data from wetlands of diverse altitudes, and the latitude-for-altitude effect was taken into account, we found the baseline soil temperatures decrease whilst the altitude rises with respect to a rapid increase in methane emission from all wetlands, however, remarkably higher sensitivity of methane emissions to soil temperature (apparent Q(10)) was found in mid-altitude wetland. We provide the first evidence of an apparent decline in optimal temperature for methane emissions with increasing elevation. These findings suggest a convergent pattern of methane emissions with respect to seasonal temperature shifts from wetlands along altitudinal gradient, while a divergent pattern in temperature sensitivities exhibits a single peak in mid-altitude.

AB Trace pas emission measurements are frequently based on static chamber methods, where the trace gas accumulation within an enclosed headspace is followed over time. This study addressed the statistical part of trace gas measurements by comparing the typical approach, linear regression analysis, with a new method proposed by A.R, Pedersen, which is based oil a stochastic extension of the di fusion model described by G,L, Hutchinson and A.R. Mosier. The new method provides an estimate of the emission rate, the standard error, P values, confidence intervals, estimates of model parameters, and a set of methods fur validation of the assumed model. It was applied to data of N2O emissions from a peat meadow with the groundwater level at 20- and 40-cm depths, respectively; Furthermore, the three models mentioned above were compared in a simulation study using parameter values representative fur the observed data. The simulations demonstrated that the assumptions underlying linear regression were violated, that the standard t test for significance did not have the expected properties, and that R-2 was a poor diagnostic for detecting deviations from these assumptions. The Hutchinson and Mosier estimator was not as biased as the linear regression estimator, but the method often failed because ii necessary condition was not satisfied by the data, a large standard error was indicated, and the method did not provide a test of significance for the estimated emission rate. The new method provided a good description of the data and useful diagnostics for testing it, and due to its ability to use more observations (longer time series), it had a negligible failure rate and bias.

AB The potential atmospheric impact of constructed wetlands (CWs) should be examined as there is a worldwide increase in the development of these systems. Fluxes of N2O, CH4, and CO2 have been measured from CWs in Estonia, Finland, Norway, and Poland during winter and summer in horizontal and vertical subsurface flow (HSSF and VSSF), free surface water (FSW), and overland and groundwater flow (OGF) wetlands. The fluxes of N2O-N, CH4-C, and CO2-C ranged from -2.1 to 1000, -32 to 38000, and -840 to 93000 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Emissions of N2O and CH4 were significantly higher during summer than during winter. The VSSF wetlands had the highest fluxes of N2O during both summer and winter. Methane emissions were highest from the FSW wetlands during wintertime. In the HSSF wetlands, the emissions of N2O and CH4 were in general highest in the inlet section. The vegetated ponds in the FSW wetlands released more N2O than the nonvegetated ponds. The global warming potential (GWP), summarizing the mean N2O and CH4 emissions, ranged from 5700 to 26000 and 830 to 5100 mg CO2 equivalents m(-2) d(-1) for the four CW types in summer and winter, respectively. The wintertime GWP was 8.5 to 89.5% of the corresponding summertime GWP, which highlights the importance of the cold season in the annual greenhouse gas release from north temperate and boreal CWs. However, due to their generally small area North European CWs were suggested to represent only a minor source for atmospheric N2O and CH4.

AB Boreal/arctic wetlands are dominated by diverse plant species, which vary in their contribution to CH4 production, oxidation and transport processes. Earlier studies have often lumped the processes all together, which may induce large uncertainties into the results. We present a novel model, which includes three vegetation classes and can be used to simulate CH4 emissions from boreal and arctic treeless wetlands. The model is based on an earlier biogeophysical model, CH4MOD(wetland). We grouped the vegetation as graminoids, shrubs and Sphagnum and recalibrated the vegetation parameters according to their different CH4 production, oxidation and transport capacities. Then, we used eddy-covariance-based CH4 flux observations from a boreal (Siikaneva) and a subarctic fen (Lompolojaka) in Finland to validate the model. The results showed that the recalibrated model could generally simulate the seasonal patterns of the Finnish wetlands with different plant communities. The comparison between the simulated andmeasured daily CH4 fluxes resulted in a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.82 with a slope of 1.0 and an intercept of -0.1 mg m(-2) h(-1) for the Siikaneva site (n = 2249, p < 0.001) and an R-2 of 0.82 with a slope of 1.0 and an intercept of 0.0 mg m(-2) h(-1) for the Lompolojankka site (n = 1826, p < 0.001). Compared with the original model, the recalibrated model in this study significantly improved the model efficiency (EF), from - 5.5 to 0.8 at the Siikaneva site and from -0.4 to 0.8 at the Lompolojankka site. The simulated annual CH4 emissions ranged from 7 to 24 gm(-2) yr(-1), which was consistent with the observations (7-22 gm(-2) yr(-1)). However, there are some discrepancies between the simulated and observed daily CH4 fluxes for the Siikaneva site (RMSE = 50.0%) and the Lompolojankka site (RMSE = 47.9%). Model sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the proportion of the graminoids would significantly increase the CH4 emission levels. Our study demonstrated that the parameterization of the different vegetation processes was important in estimating long-term wetland CH4 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture plays a vital role in regulating the direction and magnitude of methane (CH4) fluxes. However, it remains unclear whether the responses of CH4 fluxes to climate warming exhibit difference between dry and moist ecosystems. Based on standardized manipulative experiments (i.e., consistent experimental design and measurement protocols), here we explored warming effects on growing season CH4 fluxes in two alpine grasslands with contrasting water status on the Tibetan Plateau. We observed that experimental warming enhanced CH4 uptake in the relatively arid alpine steppe, but had no significant effects on CH4 emission in the moist swamp meadow. The distinct responses of CH4 fluxes were associated with the different warming effects on biotic and abiotic factors related to CH4 oxidation and production processes. Warming decreased soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and increased the pmoA gene abundance and CH4 oxidation potential in the alpine steppe, which together led to a significant increase in CH4 uptake at this alpine steppe site. However, warming-induced enhancement in CH4 oxidation potential might be counteracted by the simultaneously increased CH4 production potential in the swamp meadow, which could then result in insignificant warming effects on CH4 emission at this swamp meadow site. Based on a meta-analysis of warming effects on CH4 fluxes across the entire Tibetan Plateau, we found that the entire alpine grasslands could absorb an extra 0.042 Tg CH4 (1 Tg = 10(12) g) per growing season if soil temperature increased by 1 degrees C. These findings demonstrate that warming effects on CH4 fluxes differ between two alpine grasslands with contrasting moisture conditions and the entire alpine grasslands may not trigger a positive CH4 feedback to climate system with moderate warming.

AB The use of organic soils by agriculture involves drainage and tillage, and the resulting increase in C and N turnover can significantly affect their greenhouse gas balance. This study estimated annual fluxes of CH4 and N2O, and ecosystem respiration (R-eco), from eight organic soils managed by agriculture. The sites were located in three regions representing different landscape types and climatic conditions, and three land use categories were covered (arable crops, AR, grass in rotation, RG, and permanent grass, PG). The normal management at each site was followed, except that no N inputs occurred during the monitoring period from August 2008 to October 2009. The stratified sampling strategy further included six sampling points in three blocks at each site. Environmental variables (precipitation, PAR, air and soil temperature, soil moisture, groundwater level) were monitored continuously and during sampling campaigns, where also groundwater samples were taken for analysis. Gaseous fluxes were monitored on a three-weekly basis, giving 51, 49 and 38 field campaigns for land use categories AR, PG and RG, respectively. Climatic conditions in each region during monitoring were representative as compared to 20-yr averages. Peat layers were shallow, typically 0.5 to 1 m, and with a pH of 4 to 5. At six sites annual emissions of N2O were in the range 3 to 24 kg N2O-N ha(-1), but at two arable sites (spring barley, potato) net emissions of 38 and 61 kg N2O-N ha(-1) were recorded. The two high-emitting sites were characterized by fluctuating groundwater, low soil pH and elevated groundwater SO42- concentrations. Annual fluxes of CH4 were generally small, as expected, ranging from 2 to 4 kg CH4 ha(-1). However, two permanent grasslands had tussocks of Juncus effusus L. (soft rush) in sampling points that were consistent sources of CH4 throughout the year. Emission factors for organic soils in rotation and with permanent grass, respectively, were estimated to be 0.011 and 0.47 gm(-2) for CH4, and 2.5 and 0.5 gm(-2) for N2O. This first documentation of CH4 and N2O emissions from managed organic soils in Denmark confirms the levels and wide ranges of emissions previously reported for the Nordic countries. However, the stratified experimental design also identified links between gaseous emissions and site-specific conditions with respect to soil, groundwater and vegetation which point to areas of future research that may account for part of the variability and hence lead to improved emission factors or models.

AB Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) was measured with eddy covariance method for two adjacent forests located at the southern boundary of European taiga in Russia in 1999-2004. The two spruce forests shared similar vegetation composition but differed in soil conditions. The wet spruce forest (WSF) possessed a thick peat layer (60 cm) with a high water table seasonally close to or above the soil surface. The dry spruce forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a deep water table (> 60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE fluxes (2000 and 1440 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF, respectively) indicated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during the experimental years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year average NEE fluxes were 1800 and -2200 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with observations. The modeled data also showed high soil heterotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO2; while along with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded period reduced and more organic matter in the soil profile suffered from rapid decomposition that gradually converted the ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO2. The general effect of water table variation on wetland carbon balance observed from this modeling study could be applicable for a wide range of wetland ecosystems that have accumulated soil organic carbon while face hydrological changes under certain climatic or land-use change scenarios.

AB This chapter addresses the power and possibilities provided by an appropriate combination of advanced characterization techniques in understanding the environment of metal ions in different metal-zeolites, as well as in the role played by them in different catalytic reactions. Three different classes of materials are considered as case studies: (1) Cu-zeolites, where Cu' and Cull ions are mainly present as counterions; (2) Fe-zeolites, often containing a wide variety of isolated, oligonuclear, and aggregated (oxide/hydroxide) Fen/Fein species; and (3) TS-1, which is the closest to a "single-site" catalyst, mainly containing framework Tin' sites. TS-1 is studied in relation to its activity in the propene epoxidation reaction in the presence of aqueous H2O2, while Cu-and Fe-zeolites are here considered in relation to the direct conversion of methane to methanol (MTM) (a so-called dream reaction) with O-2, N2O, or H2O2 as oxidizing agents. Main focus is into the nature of the active site precursors (i.e., mono or di-/trinuclear ions, oxidation state, and local environment) and into the electronic and geometric structure of the oxo species formed upon interaction with the oxidizing agents. Moreover, examples about in situ or operando experiments following changes during the reaction are reviewed. The main considered techniques are X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonance Raman (rR) and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopies, often coupled to density functional theory (DFT) modeling. Depending on the studied system, results obtained with infrared, Mossbauer, X-ray emission (XES) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies are also described. The discussion includes the open debates, the main drawbacks and potentialities of the techniques, and the related characterization challenges.

AB Riparian areas, the interface between land and freshwater ecosystems, arc considered to play a pivotal role in the supply of regulating, provisioning, cultural and supporting services. Most previous studies, however, have tended to focus on intensive agricultural systems and only on a single ecosystem function. Here, we present the first study which attempts to assess a wide range of ecological processes involved in the provision of the ecosystem service of water quality regulation across a diverse range of riparian typologies. Specifically, we focus on 1) evaluating the spatial variation in riparian soils properties with respect to distance with the river and soil depth in contrasting habitat types; 2) gaining further insights into the underlying mechanisms of pollutant removal (i.e. pesticide sorption/degradation, denitrification, etc.) by riparian soils; and 3) quantify and evaluate how riparian vegetation across different habitat types contribute to the provision of watercourse shading. All the habitats were present within a single large catchment and included: (i) improved grassland, (ii) unimproved (semi-natural) grassland, (iii) broadleaf woodland, (iv) coniferous woodland, and (iv) mountain, heath and bog. Taking all the data together, the riparian soils could be statistically separated by habitat type, providing evidence that they deliver ecosystem services to differing extents. Overall, however, our findings seem to contradict the general assumption that soils in riparian area are different from neighbouring (non-riparian) areas and that they possess extra functionality in terms of ecosystem service provision. Watercourse shading was highly habitat specific and was maximal in forests (ca. 52% shade cover) in comparison to the other habitat types (7-17%). Our data suggest that the functioning of riparian areas in less intensive agricultural areas, such as those studied here, may be broadly predicted from the surrounding land use, however, further research is required to critically test this across a wider range of ecosystems.

AB Flux estimates Of CO2, CH4, N2O and CHCl3 over Ireland are inferred frorn continuous atmospheric records of these species. We use radon-222 (Rn-222) as a reference compound to estimate unknown sources of other species. The correlation between each species and 222Rn is calculated for a suite of diurnal events that have been selected in the Mace Head record over the period 1995 1997 to represent air masses exposed to sources over Ireland. We established data selection criteria based on Rn-222 and Pb-212 concentrations, We estimated flux densities of 12 x 10(3) kg CH4 km(-2) yr(-1), 680 kg N2O km(-2) yr(-1) and 20 kg CHCl3 km(-2) yr(-1) for CH4, N2O and CHCl3, respectively. We also inferred flux densities of 250 x 10(3) kg C km(-2) yr(-1) for CO2 during wintertime, and of 760 x 10(3) kg C km(-2) yr(-1) for CO2 during summer night-time. Our CH4 inferred flux compare well with the CORINAIR90 and CORNAIR94 inventories for Ireland. The N2O emission flux we inferred is close to the inventory value by CORINAIR90, but twice the inventory value by CORINAIR94 and EDGAR 2.0. This discrepancy may have been caused by the use of the revised 1996 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories in 1994, which include a new methodology for N2O emissions from agriculture. We carried out the first estimation of CHCl3 emission fluxes over Ireland. This estimation is 4 times larger than the CHCl3 emission fluxes measured close to the Mace Head station over peatlands. Our CHCl3 emission fluxes estimate is consistent with the interpretation of the same data by Ryall (personal communication, 2000), who obtained, using a Lagrangian atmospheric transport model, CHCl3 fluxes of 24 +/- 7 kg CHCl3 km(-2) yr(-1). Our estimates of CO2 emission fluxes during summer night-time and wintertime are close to those estimated from inventories and to one biogeochemical model of heterotrophic respiration.

AB Sources of methane (CH4) become highly variable for countries undergoing a heightened period of development due to both human activity and climate change. An urgent need therefore exists to budget key sources of CH4, such as wetlands (rice paddies and natural wetlands) and lakes (including reservoirs and ponds), which are sensitive to these changes. For this study, references in relation to CH4 emissions from rice paddies, natural wetlands, and lakes in China were first reviewed and then reestimated based on the review itself. Total emissions from the three CH4 sources were 11.25 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (ranging from 7.98 to 15.16 Tg CH4 yr(-1)). Among the emissions, 8.11 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (ranging from 5.20 to 11.36 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) derived from rice paddies, 2.69 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (ranging from 2.46 to 3.20 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) from natural wetlands, and 0.46 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (ranging from 0.33 to 0.59 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) from lakes (including reservoirs and ponds). Plentiful water and warm conditions, as well as its large rice paddy area make rice paddies in southeastern China the greatest overall source of CH4, accounting for approximately 55% of total paddy emissions. Natural wetland estimates were slightly higher than the other estimates owing to the higher CH4 emissions recorded within Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau peatlands. Total CH4 emissions from lakes were estimated for the first time by this study, with three quarters from the littoral zone and one quarter from lake surfaces. Rice paddies, natural wetlands, and lakes are not constant sources of CH4, but decreasing ones influenced by anthropogenic activity and climate change. A new progress-based model used in conjunction with more observations through model-data fusion approach could help obtain better estimates and insights with regard to CH4 emissions deriving from wetlands and lakes in China.

AB Global warming is associated with the continued increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide. Wetlands constitute the largest single natural source of atmospheric CH4 in the world contributing between 100 and 231 Tg year(-1) to the total budget of 503-610 Tg year(-1), approximately 60 % of which is emitted from tropical wetlands. We conducted diffusive CH4 emission measurements using static chambers in river channels, floodplains and lagoons in permanent and seasonal swamps in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Diffusive CH4 emission rates varied between 0.24 and 293 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), with a mean (+/- SE) emission of 23.2 +/- A 2.2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) or 558 +/- A 53 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). These emission rates lie within the range reported for other tropical wetlands. The emission rates were significantly higher (P < 0.007) in permanent than in seasonal swamps. River channels exhibited the highest average fluxes at 31.3 +/- A 5.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) than in floodplains (20.4 +/- A 2.5 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and lagoons (16.9 +/- A 2.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Diffusive CH4 emissions in the Delta were probably regulated by temperature since emissions were highest (20-300 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and lowest (0.2-3.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)) during the warmer-rainy and cooler winter seasons, respectively. Surface water temperatures between December 2010 and January 2012 varied from 15.3 A degrees C in winter to 33 A degrees C in summer. Assuming mean inundation of 9,000 km(2), the Delta's annual diffusive emission was estimated at 1.8 +/- A 0.2 Tg, accounting for 2.8 +/- A 0.3 % of the total CH4 emission from global tropical wetlands.

AB Boreal wetlands are significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, and are vulnerable to freezing-thawing cycles (FTC). Nonetheless, the underlying factors that induce CH4 emission in boreal wetlands during FTC are still unclear. Our goal was to characterize soil CH4 emission potential from a freshwater marsh as impacted by FTC and to determine the corresponding mechanisms. We collected soil samples from two soil layers (0-20 and 2040 cm) of an undisturbed freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, and subjected them to various freezing (6 to -6 degrees C) and thawing (-6 to 6 degrees C) cycles. Soil CH4 emission, DOC, and the aromaticity and complexity of DOC indexes were monitored. The results showed that FTC significantly increased CH4 emission potential in the 0-20 cm surface soil layer. The maximum hourly CH4 emission rate was 55.0 mg C m(-2) h(-1), approximately 19 times as high as that of the unfrozen control sample (2.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). However, the peak intensity of CH4 emission decreased when the numbers of FTC increased. Meanwhile, FTC not only increased the quantity of DOC released, but also enhanced its instability via increasing the contribution of relatively small, readily degradable organic molecules. Additionally, the CH4 emission potential was significantly correlated with the aromaticity and complexity of DOC, indicating that the release of labile substrates under FTC was one important factor controlling the microbial production of CH4 and the high emissions upon thawing. Our study suggested that global warming-induced increases in seasonal FTC in boreal wetlands may increase CH4 emissions beyond what would occur from long-term temperature increases alone.

AB Most studies determining the contribution of nitrification and denitrification to NO and N2O emissions from soils have been performed in agricultural systems, often with homogenized soil samples. More information about the nitrifier and denitrifier contribution in non-agricultural systems may increase the accuracy of global NO and N2O emission estimates. We assessed the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to NO and N2O emissions from three different ecosystems: an acid forest soil; a river sediment in the intertidal zone; and a fertilized peat grassland, using intact soil cores. Samples were taken in the spring of 1993 and the autumn of 1994. Intact soil cores (5 cm deep) were incubated at field temperature in the laboratory and the accumulation of NO and N2O during 24 h was measured. The nitrification and denitrification contribution was determined by specific inhibition of nitrification. The highest mean N2O production was in the same range for all sites. Nitrification dominated N2O production in spring at all sites. In contrast, denitrification was the main source of N2O in the acid forest soil and grassland soil in the autumn. However, the tight coupling of nitrification and denitrification in the river sediment could have resulted in an over-estimation of the contribution of nitrification to N2O and NO production. A large part of denitrified N in the acid forest soil was emitted as N2O, whereas in the river sediment, except for the autumn, the denitrification N2O-to-N-2 ratio was low, which coincided with a low nitrate content. Nitrification was the dominant NO source in spring at all sites. In autumn, high contributions of both nitrification and denitrification were observed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Forested wetlands dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. Global climate change and in particular sea level rise will alter the frequency and magnitude of wet/dry periods and salinity levels in these ecosystems. Soil microcosm experiments were set up to identify the effects of water level variations (0.4-3.0 g-water g-soil(-1)) and salinity changes (0, 1 and 5 ppt of NaCl) on greenhouse gas emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characteristics from forested wetland soils. Our results indicate that, the effect of water level was much greater than salt intrusion on C and N cycling. Wet dry treatments significantly decreased DOC production and total CH4-C loss, aromatic and humic-like substance compounds in DOC were increased in both flooding and wet dry treatments after 60-d incubation. The molecular weight (MW) of DOC, as indicated by E2/E3 ratio and spectral slope, after flooding treatments was higher than that in wet dry treatments. A first order kinetic model showed there was a positive linear correlation (r(2) = 0.73) between CO2 emission rate and DOC concentration which indicated that CO2 was mainly generated from DOC. An exponential kinetic model was applied to describe the correlation between CH4 emission rate and DOC concentration (r(2) = 0.41). This study demonstrates that an increase in salinity, and in particular variations in wet dry cycles, will lead to changes in the formation of climate -relevant greenhouse gases, such as CH4, CO2, and N2O.

AB A field trial was carried out on a 15year old Miscanthus stand, subject to nitrogen fertilizer treatments of 0, 63 and 125kg-Nha(-1), measuring N2O emissions, as well as annual crop yield over a full year. N2O emission intensity (N2O emissions calculated as a function of above-ground biomass) was significantly affected by fertilizer application, with values of 52.2 and 59.4g N2O-Nt(-1) observed at 63 and 125kg-Nha(-1), respectively, compared to 31.3g N2O-Nt(-1) in the zero fertilizer control. A life cycle analyses approach was applied to calculate the increase in yield required to offset N2O emissions from Miscanthus through fossil fuel substitution in the fuel chain. For the conditions observed during the field trial yield increases of 0.33 and 0.39tha(-1) were found to be required to offset N2O emissions from the 63kg-Nha(-1) treatment, when replacing peat and coal, respectively, while increases of 0.71 and 0.83tha(-1) were required for the 125kg-Nha(-1) treatment, for each fuel. These values are considerably less than the mean above-ground biomass yield increases observed here of 1.57 and 2.79tha(-1) at fertilization rates 63 and 125kg-Nha(-1) respectively. Extending this analysis to include a range of fertilizer application rates and N2O emission factors found increases in yield necessary to offset soil N2O emissions ranging from 0.26 to 2.54tha(-1). These relatively low yield increase requirements indicate that where nitrogen fertilizer application improves yield, the benefits of such a response will not be offset by soil N2O emissions.

AB Methane exchange between the atmosphere and subalpine wetland and unsaturated soils was evaluated over a 15-month period during 1995-1996. Four vegetation community types along a moisture gradient (wetland, moist-grassy, moist-messy, and dry) were included in a 100 m sampling transect situated at 3200 m elevation in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Methane fluxes and soil temperature were measured during snow-free and snow-covered periods, and soil moisture content was measured during snow-free periods. The range of mean measured fluxes through all seasons (a positive value represents CH4 efflux to the atmosphere) were: 0.3 to 29.2, mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) wetland area; 0.1 to 1.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) moist-grassy area; -0.04 to 0.7 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1), moist-messy area; and -0.6 to 0 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1), dry area. Methane efflux was significantly correlated with soil temperature (5 cm) at the continuously saturated wetland area during snow-free periods. Consumption of atmospheric methane was significantly correlated with moisture content in the upper 5 cm of soil at the dry area. A model based on the wetland flux-temperature relationship estimated an annual methane emission of 2.53 mol CH4 m(-2) from the wetland. Estimates of annual methane flux based on field measurements at the other sites were 0.12 mol CH4 m(-2), moist-grassy area; 0.03 mol CH4 m(-2), moist-messy area; and -0.04 mol CH4 m(-2), dry area. Methane fluxes during snow-covered periods were responsible for 25, 73, 23, and 43% of the annual fluxes at the wetland, moist-grassy, moist-mossy, and dry sites, respectively.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes were investigated in a subarctic Russian tundra site in a multi-approach study combining plot-scale data, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements, and a fine-resolution land cover classification scheme for regional upscaling. The flux data as measured by the two independent techniques resulted in a seasonal (May-October 2008) cumulative CH4 emission of 2.4 (EC) and 3.7 gCH(4) m(-2) (manual chambers) for the source area representative of the footprint of the EC instruments. Upon upscaling for the entire study region of 98.6 km(2), the chamber measured flux data yielded a regional flux estimate of 6.7 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1). Our upscaling efforts accounted for the large spatial variability in the distribution of the various land cover types (LCTs) predominant at our study site. Wetlands with emissions ranging from 34 to 53 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) were the most dominant CH4-emitting surfaces. Emissions from thermokarst lakes were an order of magnitude lower, while the rest of the landscape (mineral tundra) was a weak sink for atmospheric methane. Vascular plant cover was a key factor in explaining the spatial variability of CH4 emissions among wetland types, as indicated by the positive correlation of emissions with the leaf area index (LAI). As elucidated through a stable isotope analysis, the dominant CH4 release pathway from wetlands to the atmosphere was plant-mediated diffusion through aerenchyma, a process that discriminates against C-13-CH4. The CH4 released to the atmosphere was lighter than that in the surface porewater, and delta C-13 in the emitted CH4 correlated negatively with the vascular plant cover (LAI). The mean value of delta C-13 obtained here for the emitted CH4, 68.2 +/- 2.0 %, is within the range of values from other wetlands, thus reinforcing the use of inverse modelling tools to better constrain the CH4 budget. Based on the IPCC A1B emission scenario, a temperature increase of 6.1 degrees C relative to the present day has been predicted for the European Russian tundra by the end of the 21st Century. A regional warming of this magnitude will have profound effects on the permafrost distribution leading to considerable changes in the regional landscape with a potential for an increase in the areal extent of CH4-emitting wet surfaces.

AB Soil freeze-thaw cycles in the winter-cold zone can substantially affect soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, and deserve special consideration in wetlands of cold climates. Semi-disturbed soil columns from three natural wetlands (Carex marsh, Carex marshy meadow and Calamagrostis wet grassland) and a soybean field that has been reclaimed from a wetland were exposed to seven freeze thaw cycles. The freeze-thaw treatments were performed by incubating the soil columns at -10 degrees C for 1 d and at 5 degrees C for 7 d. The control columns were incubated at 5 degrees C for 8 d. After each freeze-thaw cycle, the soil solution was extracted by a solution extractor installed in each soil layer of the soil column, and was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The results showed that freeze thaw cycles could increase DOC, NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations in soil solutions, and decrease TDP concentrations. Moreover, the changes of DOC, NH4+-N, NO3--N and TDP concentrations in soil solutions caused by freeze thaw cycles were different in various sampling sites and soil layers. The increments of DOC concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles were greater in the wetland soil columns than in the soybean field soil columns. The increments of NH4+-N concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles decreased with the increase of soil depth. The depth variation in the increments of NO3--N concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles in the wetland soil columns was different from that in the soybean field soil columns. The decrements of TDP concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles were greater in columns of Carex marsh and Carex marshy meadow than in columns of Calamagrostis wet grassland and the soybean field. The study results provide information on the timing of nutrient release related to freezing and thawing in natural versus agronomic soils, and have implications for the timing of nutrient application in farm fields in relation to water quality protection.

AB Linkages between land management activities and stream water quality are reported for a 2480 ha catchment used for dairy farming, sheep-beef farming and forestry in Southland, New Zealand. Our approach was to reconcile measured loads of nutrients exported from the catchment with those estimated based on characterisation of farming practices within the catchment. The latter was based upon detailed surveys of farm practices and soil quality. Monthly stream monitoring showed that median nutrient (N and P), sediment and faecal bacteria concentrations exceeded guidelines recommended for surface waters. Measured specific yields for suspended sediment (SS), total N (TN) and phosphorus (P) discharged from the catchment were 58, 8.2 and 0.43 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, for the 2001-2005 monitoring period. In comparison, model estimates of N and P losses in drainage and overland flow from farms in the catchment were 10.1 and 0.59 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Field measurements, farm management surveys and farm systems modeling have identified some land management practices that appear to be key sources of many of these pollutants. These sources include subsurface drainage systems (including the preferential flow of irrigated effluent through these soils), overland flow from the heavy soils used for dairy farming in the catchment and the practice of intensively wintering cows on forage crops. Modeling suggests that a significant improvement in catchment water quality could be achieved through the implementation of targeted best management practices (BMPs) on dairy farms in the catchment. These include (i) covered feedpad wintering systems for controlling N losses, (ii) nitrification inhibitor use on milking platforms, (iii) deferred irrigation and low rate application of farm dairy effluent and (iv) limiting soil Olsen P to economically optimum levels. The adoption of these BMPs will, in part, depend on their economic viability. This paper therefore presents a double-bottom-line analysis (i.e. environmental and economic) of some of these BMPs and discusses their potential to cost-effectively deliver improved water quality in the Bog Burn catchment.

AB Oral administration of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) to grazing ruminants for excretion in urine represents a targeted mitigation strategy to reduce nitrogen (N) losses from grazed pastures. A field trial and allied laboratory incubation study were conducted to examine the effects of oral administration of DCD to non-lactating Friesian dairy heifers on excretion of DCD in urine and efficacy in soil. Dairy heifers were orally administered DCD daily at three treatment levels (low, medium and high; 12,24 and 36 g DCD heifer(-1) day(-1), respectively) and compared to a nil-DCD control group over a 90-day continuous dosing period. There were no adverse effects of DCD administration on heifer health or growth, as inferred by live-weight gain and measured blood metabolite levels. Prolonged administration of DCD to dairy heifers resulted in the sustained excretion of DCD in the urine over 90 days and inhibition of nitrification of urinary-N in the silty peat soil for up to 56 days (incubated at 20 degrees C; P < 0.001). Field soil sampling (0-75 mm depth) of individual urine patches for DCD analysis revealed that a 3-fold increase in the rate of DCD administered resulted in a similar increase in the concentration of DCD voided in the urine and subsequently deposited in urine patches (median equivalent DCD application rates of 22, 36 and 59 kg ha(-1) for the low, medium and high DCD treatment levels, respectively; P < 0.001). However, large differences (up to 40-fold) existed between individual urine patches in the rate of DCD deposited at each treatment level, which showed a positively skewed distribution. This study highlights the viability of prolonged daily administration of DCD to ruminants for sustained excretion in urine and effective inhibition of nitrification in soil as a practical targeted mitigation technology to reduce urinary-N losses from grazed pastures.

AB In situ field measurements as well as targeted laboratory studies have shown that freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) affect soil trace gas fluxes. However, most of past laboratory studies adjusted soil moisture before soil freezing, thereby neglecting that snow cover or water from melting snow may modify effects of FTCs on soil trace gas fluxes. In the present laboratory study with a typical semi-arid grassland soil, three different soil moisture levels (32 %, 41 %, and 50 % WFPS) were established (a) prior to soil freezing or (b) by adding fresh snow to the soil surface after freezing to simulate field conditions and the effect of the melting snow on CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes during FTCs more realistically. Our results showed that adjusting soil moisture by watering before soil freezing resulted in significantly different cumulative fluxes of CH4, CO2, and N2O throughout three FTCs as compared to the snow cover treatment, especially at a relatively high soil moisture level of 50 % WFPS. An increase of N2O emissions was observed during thawing for both treatments. However, in the watering treatment, this increase was highest in the first thawing cycle and decreased in successive cycles, while in the snow cover treatment, a repetition of the FTCs resulted in a further increase of N2O emissions. These differences might be partly due to the different soil water dynamics during FTCs in the two treatments. CO2 emissions were a function of soil moisture, with emissions being largest at 50 % WFPS and smallest at 32 % WFPS. The largest N2O emissions were observed at WFPS values around 50 %, whereas there were only small or negligible N2O emissions from soil with relatively low soil water content, which indicates that a threshold value of soil moisture might exist that triggers N2O peaks during thawing.

AB Closed (non-steady state) chambers are widely used for quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between soils or low-stature canopies and the atmosphere. It is well recognised that covering a soil or vegetation by a closed chamber inherently disturbs the natural CO2 fluxes by altering the concentration gradients between the soil, the vegetation and the overlying air. Thus, the driving factors of CO2 fluxes are not constant during the closed chamber experiment, and no linear increase or decrease of CO2 concentration over time within the chamber headspace can be expected. Nevertheless, linear regression has been applied for calculating CO2 fluxes in many recent, partly influential, studies. This approach has been justified by keeping the closure time short and assuming the concentration change over time to be in the linear range. Here, we test if the application of linear regression is really appropriate for estimating CO2 fluxes using closed chambers over short closure times and if the application of nonlinear regression is necessary. We developed a nonlinear exponential regression model from diffusion and photosynthesis theory. This exponential model was tested with four different datasets of CO2 flux measurements (total number: 1764) conducted at three peatlands sites in Finland and a tundra site in Siberia. Thorough analyses of residuals demonstrated that linear regression was frequently not appropriate for the determination of CO2 fluxes by closed-chamber methods, even if closure times were kept short. The developed exponential model was well suited for nonlinear regression of the concentration over time c(t) evolution in the chamber headspace and estimation of the initial CO2 fluxes at closure time for the majority of experiments. However, a rather large percentage of the exponential regression functions showed curvatures not consistent with the theoretical model which is considered to be caused by violations of the underlying model assumptions. Especially the effects of turbulence and pressure disturbances by the chamber deployment are suspected to have caused unexplainable curvatures. CO2 flux estimates by linear regression can be as low as 40% of the flux estimates of exponential regression for closure times of only two minutes. The degree of underestimation increased with increasing CO2 flux strength and was dependent on soil and vegetation conditions which can disturb not only the quantitative but also the qualitative evaluation of CO2 flux dynamics. The underestimation effect by linear regression was observed to be different for CO2 uptake and release situations which can lead to stronger bias in the daily, seasonal and annual CO2 balances than in the individual fluxes. To avoid serious bias of CO2 flux estimates based on closed chamber experiments, we suggest further tests using published datasets and recommend the use of nonlinear regression models for future closed chamber studies.

AB Intensive urbanization leads to the use of ecologically unfavorable areas for construction. Expensive remediation may not produce the desired results. Risks of boundary ecosystems include pollution, reducing biodiversity, and human health deterioration remains. This applies to the reclaimed sewage filtration fields. The main factor of their environmental hazard before remediation is the sludge rich in organic matter whose decomposition under reducing conditions leads to methane and carbon dioxide accumulation in soils and emission to the atmosphere.
   Large areas of non-operational filtration fields were reclaimed and focused on the creation of residential areas in Moscow, outside the Garden Ring road and the Ring Highway. Conservative properties of technogenic surface-like soil formations (TSF) in parallel with their function were studied. Static soil properties were determined by the standard methods. Activity of bacterial methane formation and oxidation (biological indicators of function) were established using the kinetic methods by soil incubating in sealed vials and escaping or absorption of methane, respectively. Methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in soils and their emission to the atmosphere (gas characteristics of function) were determined by hole shooting method and closed chambers, respectively, with quantitative analysis at the gas chromatograph.
   The ground with sewage silt fragments (GS), Gleyic Technosol (GT), Urbic Technosol (Arenic, Transportic) (UT (AT)), and sandy Urbic Technosol (Humic, Transportic) (UT (HT)) are consistently formed during the reclamation of filtration fields. At the final stage in the greening of built area, Urbic Folic Technosols (UFT) are formed. In summer, CH4 generation decreases 10 times from GS and peat-compost horizons of new UFT to UT (HT), UT (AT), and UFT. Bacterial CH4 oxidation also decreases in the same row, after reducing CH4 content from 1,100-2,600 to 3-4 ppm. There is not enough oxidation intensity in GS and GT where high CH4 emission is observed; in other soils, it is absent. CO2 formation and emission, for an exception of UT (HT), decreases in the same row of soils.
   Greenhouse gases generation, sink and emission, environmental functions of young subaerial soils 0-10 years old, are estimated. Seasonal monitoring revealed the risks of atmosphere pollution by CH4 during the cold period and by CO2-all year. Formed soils don't emit CH4 in summer. Reclamation reduces atmospheric CH4 concentration from 60 to 2-4 ppm. The CO2 content is decreasing in the first years from 0.20 to 0.13-0.18 %, through 10 years-up to 0.08 %.

TI Application of the N-15 gas-flux method for measuring in situ N-2 and

AB Soil denitrification is considered the most unconstrained process in the global N cycle due to uncertain in situ N-2 flux measurements, particularly in natural and semi-natural terrestrial ecosystems. N-15 tracer approaches can provide in situ measurements of both N-2 and N2O simultaneously, but their use has been limited to fertilized agroecosystems due to the need for large N-15 additions in order to detect N-15(2) production against the high atmospheric N-2. For N-15-N-2 analyses, we have used an "in-house" laboratory designed and manufactured N-2 preparation instrument which can be interfaced to any commercial continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS). The N-2 prep unit has gas purification steps and a copper-based reduction furnace, and allows the analysis of small gas injection volumes (4 mu L) for N-15-N-2 analysis. For the analysis of N2O, an automated Tracegas Preconcentrator (Isoprime Ltd) coupled to an IRMS was used to measure the N-15-N2O (4 mL gas injection volume). Consequently, the coefficient of variation for the determination of isotope ratios for N-2 in air and in standard N2O (0.5 ppm) was better than 0.5 %. The N-15 gas-flux method was adapted for application in natural and semi-natural land use types (peatlands, forests, and grasslands) by lowering the N-15 tracer application rate to 0.04-0.5 kg N-15 ha(-1). The minimum detectable flux rates were 4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and 0.2 ng N m(-2) h(-1) for the N-2 and N2O fluxes respectively. Total denitrification rates measured by the acetylene inhibition technique in the same land use types correlated (r = 0.58) with the denitrification rates measured under the N-15 gas-flux method, but were underestimated by a factor of 4, and this was partially attributed to the incomplete inhibition of N2O reduction to N-2, under a relatively high soil moisture content, and/or the catalytic NO decomposition in the presence of acetylene. Even though relatively robust for in situ denitrification measurements, methodological uncertainties still exist in the estimation of N-2 and N2O fluxes with the N-15 gas-flux method due to issues related to non-homogenous distribution of the added tracer and subsoil gas diffusion using open-bottom chambers, particularly during longer incubation duration. Despite these uncertainties, the N-15 gas-flux method constitutes a more reliable field technique for large-scale quantification of N-2 and N2O fluxes in natural terrestrial ecosystems, thus significantly improving our ability to constrain ecosystem N budgets.

AB Most inverse atmospheric models report considerable uptake of carbon dioxide in Europe's terrestrial biosphere. In contrast, carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems increase at a much smaller rate, with carbon gains in forests and grassland soils almost being offset by carbon losses from cropland and peat soils. Accounting for non-carbon dioxide carbon transfers that are not detected by the atmospheric models and for carbon dioxide fluxes bypassing the ecosystem carbon stocks considerably reduces the gap between the small carbon-stock changes and the larger carbon dioxide uptake estimated by atmospheric models. The remaining difference could be because of missing components in the stock-change approach, as well as the large uncertainty in both methods. With the use of the corrected atmosphere- and land-based estimates as a dual constraint, we estimate a net carbon sink between 135 and 205 teragrams per year in Europe's terrestrial biosphere, the equivalent of 7 to 12% of the 1995 anthropogenic carbon emissions.

AB Purpose The purpose of this research was to study the generation, sink, and emission of greenhouse gases by soils on technogenic parent materials, created at different stages of the Moskva River floodplain development (1-construction and 2-landscaping of residential areas).
   Materials and methods Field surveys revealed the spatial trends of concentration and emission of the greenhouse gases in following groups of soils: Retisols (RT-ab-ct) and Fluvisols (FL-hu, FL-hi.gl) before land engineering preparation for the construction, Urbic Technosols Transportic (TC-ub-ar.tn and TC-ub-hu.tn) at stage 1 and Urbic Technosols Folic (TC-ub-fo) at stage 2. CO2 and CH4 concentration in soils and their emission were determined using subsurface soil air equilibration tubes and the closed chamber method, respectively. Bacterial methane generation rate (MGR) and methane oxidation rate (MOR) were measured by kinetic methods.
   Results and discussion In natural soils MOR is caused only by intra-aggregate methanogenesis. The imbalance of methane generation and oxidation was observed in FL-hi.gl. It caused CH4 accumulation in the profile (7.5 ppm) and its emission to the atmosphere (0.11 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). RT-ab-ct acted as the sink of atmospheric methane. CO2 emission was 265.1 +/- 24.0 and 151.9 +/- 37.2 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) from RT-ab-ct and FL-hi.gl, respectively. In Technosols CH4 concentration was predominantly low (median was 2.7, 2.9, and 3.0 ppm, in TC-ub-ar.tn, TC-ub-hu.tn, and TC-ub-fo, respectively), but due to the occurrence of peat sediments under technogenic material, it increased to 1-2%. Methane emission was not observed due to functioning of biogeochemical barriers with high MOR. In TC-ub-ar.tn and TC-ub-hu.tn, the barriers were formed at 60-cm depth. In TC-ub-fo, the system of barriers was formed in Folic and Technic horizons (at 10- and 60-cm depth). CO2 emission was 2 times lower from TC-ub-ar.tn and TC-ub-hu.tn and 1.5 times higher from TC-ub-fo than from natural soils.
   Conclusions Greenhouse gas generation, sink, and emission by natural soils and Technosols in floodplain were estimated. CO2 and CH4 content in Technosols varied depending on the properties of parent materials. Technosols at stage 1 did not emit CH4 due to formation of biogeochemical barriers-soil layers of high CH4 utilization rates. Urbic Technosols (Folic) at stage 2 performed as a source of significant CO2 emission.

AB An intercomparison is made of the Net Ecosystem Exchange of CO2, NEE, for eight Dutch grassland sites: four natural grasslands, two production grasslands and two meteorological stations within a rotational grassland region. At all sites the NEE was determined during at least 10 months per site, using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique, but in different years. The NEE does not include any import or export other than CO2. The photosynthesis-light response analysis technique is used along with the respiration-temperature response technique to partition NEE into Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (R-e) and to obtain the eco-physiological characteristics of the sites at the field scale. Annual sums of NEE, GPPand R-e are then estimated using the fitted response curves with observed radiation and air temperature from a meteorological site in the centre of The Netherlands as drivers. These calculations are carried out for four years (2002-2005). Land use and management histories are not considered. The estimated annual R-e for all individual sites is more or less constant per site and the average for all sites amounts to 1390 +/- 30 gC m(-2) a(-1). The narrow uncertainty band (+/- 2%) reflects the small differences in the mean annual air temperature. The mean annual GPP was estimated to be 1325 g C m(-2) a(-1), and displays a much higher standard deviation, of +/- 110 gC m(-2) a(-1) (8%), which reflects the relatively large variation in annual solar radiation. The mean annual NEE amounts to -65 +/- 85 gC m(-2) a(-1). From two sites, four-year records of CO2 flux were available and analyzed (2002-2005). Using the weather record of 2005 with optimizations from the other years, the standard deviation of annual GPP was estimated to be 171-206 gC m(-2) a(-1) (8-14%), of annual R-e 227-247 gC m(-2) a(-1)(14-16%) and of annual NEE 176-276 gC m(-2) a(-1). The inter-site standard deviation was higher for GPP and R-e, 534 gC m(-2) a(-1) (37.3%) and 486 gC m(-2) a(-1) (34.8%), respectively. However, the inter-site standard deviation of NEE was similar to the interannual one, amounting to 207 gC m-2a-1. Large differences occur due to soil type. The grasslands on organic (peat) soils show a mean net release of CO2 of 220 +/- 90 g C m(-2) a(-1) while the grasslands on mineral (clay and sand) soils show a mean net uptake of CO2 of 90 +/- 90 g C m(-2) a(-1). If a weighing with the fraction of grassland on organic (20%) and mineral soils (80%) is applied, an average NEE of 28 +/- 90 g C m(-2) a(-1) is found. The results from the analysis illustrate the need for regionally specific and spatially explicit CO2 emission estimates from grassland.

The major sources for atmospheric NH3 are agricultural activities and animal feedlot operations, followed by biomass burning (including forest fires) and to a lesser extent fossil fuel combustion. Close to its sources, acute exposures to NH3 can result in visible foliar injury on vegetation. NH3 is deposited rapidly within the first 4-5 km from its source. However, NH3 is also converted in the atmosphere to fine particle NH4+ (ammonium) aerosols that are a regional scale problem. Much of our current knowledge of the effects of NH3 on higher plants is predominantly derived from studies conducted in Europe. Adverse effects on vegetation occur when the rate of foliar uptake of NH3 is greater than the rate and capacity for in vivo detoxification by the plants. Most to least sensitive plant species to NH3 are native vegetation > forests > agricultural crops. There are also a number of studies on N deposition and lichens, mosses and green algae. Direct cause and effect relationships in most of those cases (exceptions being those locations very close to point sources) are confounded by other environmental factors, particularly changes in the ambient SO2 (Sulfur dioxide) concentrations. In addition to direct foliar injury, adverse effects of NH3 on higher plants include alterations in: growth and productivity, tissue content of nutrients and toxic elements, drought and frost tolerance, responses to insect pests and disease causing microorganisms (pathogens), development of beneficial root symbiotic or mycorrhizal associations and inter species competition or biodiversity. In all these cases, the joint effects of NH3 with other air pollutants such as all-pervasive O-3 or increasing CO2 concentrations are poorly understood. While NH3 uptake in higher plants occurs through the shoots, NH4+ uptake occurs through the shoots, roots and through both pathways. However, NH4+ is immobile in the soil and is converted to NO3- (nitrate). In agricultural systems, additions of NO3- to the soil (initially as NH3 or NH4+) and the consequent increases in the emissions of N2O (nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas) and leaching of NO3- into the ground and surface waters are of major environmental concern. At the ecosystem level NH3 deposition cannot be viewed alone, but in the context of total N deposition. There are a number of forest ecosystems in North America that have been subjected to N saturation and the consequent negative effects. There are also heathlands and other plant communities in Europe that have been subjected to N-induced alterations. Regulatory mitigative approaches to these problems include the use of N saturation data or the concept of critical loads. Current information suggests that a critical load of 5-10 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of total N deposition (both dry and wet deposition combined of all atmospheric N species) would protect the most vulnerable terrestrial ecosystems (heaths, bogs, cryptogams) and values of 10-20 kg ha(-1) year(-1) would protect forests, depending on soil conditions. However, to derive the best analysis, the critical loa

AB Enhanced levels of nitrogen in the environment may have several adverse effects, including decreased plant species diversity in ( semi) natural terrestrial ecosystems, eutrophication of surface waters, pollution of ground-water due to nitrate leaching and global warming due to nitrous and nitrogen oxide (N2O and NOx) emissions. To determine the effectiveness of policies aimed at the reduction of emission of ammonia (NH3), N2O and NOx, nitrate (NO3) leaching and nitrogen (N) runoff, it is essential to have information on the fate of nitrogen in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils on a regional and national scale and its inherent uncertainties. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainties in the emission, uptake, accumulation, denitrification, leaching and runoff of nitrogen at a national scale and for specific land use-soil type combinations. Furthermore, we identified which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty in the emission of ammonia to the atmosphere and the leaching/runoff to groundwater and surface water. To gain quantitative insight into the propagation of the uncertainty, a model was developed representing all crucial processes in the N chain by simple process descriptions. Uncertainties were quantified for the Netherlands as a whole, including terrestrial systems, both agricultural and non-agricultural land, and aquatic systems. For agricultural and non-agricultural land, plots were distinguished, consisting of a multiple of 500 3 500 m and of 250 3 250 m grid cells, respectively, with unique combinations of soil use, soil type and groundwater table class that were derived from existing digital maps. Model parameters were assigned by using relationships with soil type, groundwater level class and land use. The uncertainty was quantified by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, whereas statistical approaches were used to identify which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the fate of nitrogen. The 90% confidence interval for the fluxes of N compounds to air, groundwater and surface water (in Gg N.yr(-1)) ranged between 102 and 194 for ammonia emission, between 18 and 51 for N2O emissions, between 32 and 108 for NO3 inflow to groundwater and between 2 and 38 for N inflow to surface water. The uncertainty in NH3 emission was mainly caused by the uncertainty in the NH3 emission fractions for animal manure, whereas the uncertainty in N2O emission was mainly due to the uncertainty in the fractions relating total nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions. The uncertainty in inflow to groundwater and runoff to surface water was mainly caused by the uncertainty in denitrification in the soil and in upper groundwater and in non-agricultural soils also by the N accumulation in the soil. In view of the need to monitor and evaluate the impact of N reduction policies and measures, it is essential to put more effort in activities yielding a reduction of these large uncertainties, such as additional data gathering and process research under field circumstances.

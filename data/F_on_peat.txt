AB Half of the Finnish peatland area is drained for forestry. The remaining undrained peatlands are not all pristine, because surrounding drainage may disturb their hydrology. This concerns especially aapa mires, which are dependent on hydrological connections to their upper catchments. We investigated the amount and sizes of Finnish undrained peatlands, the drainage state of their margins, and the naturalness of aapa mires in large (> 50 ha) undrained peatland areas, using a GIS analysis based on digital map data, aerial images and an elevation model. The results show that a majority (66.7 % of count, 84.7 % of area) of undrained peatland areas have at least partly drained margins. Drainage activities commonly disturb minerotrophic water discharge to aapa mires. In the middle boreal zone, on average 41.6 % (median 42.8 %) of the catchment area of aapa mires is such that hydrological connection with the mire is disturbed by intervening drainage. In the southern boreal zone, the figure is 25.1 % (median 16.1 %), and in the southern part of the northern boreal zone 24.2 % (median 9.9 %). Possible implications of the disturbances include tree encroachment, hummock formation and fen-bog transition, which is likely to cause a loss of biodiversity but could potentially increase peat growth and carbon sequestration.

AB The investigations were carried out in six small mid-forest peat bogs with active peat-forming processes, all situated in the Lublin region (Eastern Poland). The bogs represented two floristically different types of peatland: raised bogs and transitional mires species composition analysis and specific chemistry analysis (pH, Eh, carbon content, N, P, Mg, Na, Ca, Mn, Fe, dehydrogenase activity and water level) were performed. The plant assotiations/communities of the peat bogs represented three phytosociological classes: Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae, Oxycocco-Sphagnetea, and Vaccinio-Piceetea. The analysis of redox potential measured in the different communities revealed differences in the Eh values between these phytocoenoses (p < 0.001). Assotiations representing Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetwn were found in areas characterised by the highest redox potential. Redox potential values in these communities were significantly higher than the values recorded in bog communities and mosaic associations. Seasonal variability of the redox potential was noted as well. The current research indicates that soil chemical parameters: pH, Eh are closely related with water table level and plant distributions.

AB We studied natural and forestry-drained peatlands to examine the effect of over 34 years lowered water table on the delta C-13 values of vegetation, bulk peat and subsoil. In the seven studied sites, delta C-13 in the basal peat layer was 1.1 and 1.2 parts per thousand lower than that of the middle-layer and surface layer, respectively. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the delta C-13 values of the basal and surface peat layers, possibly due to carbon (C) recycling within the peat column. In the same mire complex, natural fen peat delta C-13 values were lower than those of the nearby bog, possibly due to the dominance of vascular plants on fen and the generally larger share of recycled C in the fens than in the bogs. Furthermore, natural and 51 years previously drained fen and bog, on the opposite sides of a ditch on the same mire complex, showed no significant differences in delta C-13 values. Plant delta C-13 values were lower, while delta C-13 values of subsoil were higher in the drained than in the natural site of the fen.

AB Data on past peatland growth patterns, vegetation development, and carbon (C) dynamics during the various Holocene climate phases may help us to understand possible future climate-peatland feedback mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed and radiocarbon dated several peat cores from Kalevansuo, a drained bog in southern Finland. We investigated peatland succession and C dynamics throughout the Holocene. These data were used to reconstruct the long-term atmospheric radiative forcing, i.e., climate impact of the peatland since initiation. Kalevansuo peat records revealed a general development from fen to bog, typical for the southern boreal zone, but the timing of ombrotrophication varied in different parts of the peatland. Peat accumulation patterns and lateral expansion through paludification were influenced by fires and climate conditions. Long-term C accumulation rates were overall lower than the average values found from literature. We suggest the low accumulation rates are due to repeated burning of the peat surface. Drainage for forestry resulted in a nearly complete replacement of typical bog mosses by forest species within 40 years after drainage. The radiative forcing reconstruction suggested positive values ( warming) for the first similar to 7000 years following initiation. The change from positive to negative forcing was triggered by an expansion of bog vegetation cover and later by drainage. The strong relationship between peatland area and peat type with radiative forcing suggests a possible feedback for future changing climate, as high-latitude peatlands may experience prominent regime shifts, such as fen to bog transitions.

AB The objective of this study was to examine plant community development and peat stratigraphy in the context of ground-water flow systems for five forested peatlands in central New York State for which extensive vegetation, surface hydrology, and water chemistry analyses has been performed. Peatland development trends, from the initial period of peat accumulation to the present, were explored using pear stratigraphy, analysis of ground-water flow systems and evidence fi om existing vegetation. Detailed analyses, including the construction of numerical ground-water models were performed for one of the five sites to examine the process of bog development within what was once a highly calcareous fen and to examine the impacts of agricultural drainage on peatland ground-water flow. Feat stratigraphy analysis indicated two pathways of peatland development: infilling of shallow lakes and peat accumulation on ground-water seeps. Lake-infill peatlands were characterized by a sequence of Limnic peat--> bryophyte-sedge peat-->hemic-fibric sedge peat-->sapric wood peat (or Sphagnum peat). Analysis of ground-water flow systems indicated that four of the peatlands were characterized by mineral-rich ground-water discharge along peatland margins, with lateral flow through the peatlands towards drainage features. The fifth peatland was characterized by a more complex ground-water flow system with a weakly minerotrophic water-table mound driving shallow ground-water recharge flow. The water-table mound has been reduced in extent by agricultural drainage and demonstrates seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head and areal extent.

AB Drainage for forestry has been amongst the most extensive of land management practices applied to northern latitude peatlands, particularly in northern Europe. Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the carbon cycle of soils. This study investigated the effects of long-term (45 years) drainage for forestry upon surface peat extracellular phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic concentrations and pH at ombrotrophic bog, oligotrophic fen and mesotrophic fen sites at a Finnish mire complex. Phenol oxidase activity was reduced by drainage at all three sites. Phenol oxidase activity was positively correlated with peat pH across all sites irrespective of drainage treatment, suggesting that pH is a major factor influencing peat phenol oxidase activity at the mire complex. Peat pH became more acidic with drainage at the fen sites, and it is likely that this contributed to the suppression of peat phenol oxidase activity. The reduction of peat phenol oxidase activity with drainage was accompanied by increased concentrations of water-soluble phenolics at all three sites, and the potential contribution of this to changes in peat carbon stocks following drainage is discussed.

AB We studied the effects of restoration on water-table depth (WTD), element concentrations of peat and vegetation composition of peatlands drained for forestry in southern Finland. The restoration aimed to return the trajectory of vegetation succession toward that of undisturbed systems through the blockage of ditches and the removal of trees. Permanent plots established on a bog and a fen were sampled 1 year before, and 1, 2, 3, and 10 years after the restoration. The restoration resulted in a long-term rise of the water-table in both peatlands. Ten years after restoration, the mineral element concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and P) of peat corresponded to those reported from comparable pristine peatlands. In particular, the increase of K and Mn concentrations at both sites suggests the recovery of ecosystem functionality in terms of nutrient cycling between peat and plants. The restoration resulted in the succession of plant communities toward the targeted peatland vegetation of wetter condition at both sites. This was evident from the decreased abundance of species benefiting from drainage and the corresponding increase of peatland species. However, many species typical of pristine peatlands were missing 10 years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration led to a reversal of the effects of drainage in vegetation and studied habitat conditions. However, due to the slow recovery of peatland ecosystems and the possibility that certain failures in the restoration measures may become apparent only after extended time periods, long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the goals of restoration will be met.

AB A before-after-control approach was used to analyze the impact of peatland restoration on hydrology, based on high temporal resolution water-table (WT) data from 43 boreal peatlands representative of a south-boreal to north-boreal climate gradient. During the study, 24 forestry drained sites were restored and 19 pristine peatlands used as control sites. Different approaches were developed and used to analyze WT changes (mean WT position, WT fluctuation, WT hydrograph, recession, and storage characteristics). Restoration increased WT in most cases but particularly in spruce mires, followed by pine mires and fens. Before restoration, the WT fluctuation (WTF) was large, indicating peat temporary storage gain (SG). After restoration, the WT hydrograph recession limb slopes and SG coefficients (Rc) declined significantly. Drainage or restoration did not significantly affect mean diurnal WT fluctuations, used here as a proxy for evapotranspiration. Overall, the changes in WT characteristics following restoration indicated creation of favorable hydrological conditions for recovery of functional peatland ecosystems in previously degraded peatland sites. This was supported by calculation of bryophyte species abundance thresholds for WT. These results can be used to optimize restoration efforts in different peatland systems and as a qualitative conceptual basis for future restoration operations.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry starts a succession of ground vegetation in which mire species are gradually replaced by forest species. Some mire plant communities vanish quickly following the water-level drawdown; some may prevail longer in the moister patches of peatland. Drainage ditches, as a new kind of surface, introduce another component of spatial variation in drained peatlands. These variations were hypothesized to affect methane (CH(4)) fluxes from drained peatlands. Methane fluxes from different plant communities and unvegetated surfaces, including ditches, were measured at the drained part of Lakkasuo mire, Central Finland. The fluxes were found to be related to peatland site type, plant community, water-table position and soil temperature. At nutrient-rich fen sites fluxes between plant communities differed only a little: almost all plots acted as CH(4) sinks (-0.9 to -0.4 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)), with the exception of Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. communities, which emitted 0.9 g CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1). At nutrient-poor bog site the differences between plant communities were clearer. The highest emissions were measured from Eriophorum vaginatum L. communities (29.7 mg CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1)), with a decreasing trend to Sphagna (10.0 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)supercript stop) and forest moss communities (2.6 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)). CH(4) emissions from different kinds of ditches were highly variable, and extremely high emissions (summertime averages 182-600 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1) stop) were measured from continuously water-covered ditches at the drained fen. Variability in the emissions was caused by differences in the origin and movement of water in the ditches, as well as differences in vegetation communities in the ditches. While drainage on average greatly decreases CH(4) emissions from peatlands, a great spatial variability in fluxes is emerged. Emissions from ditches constantly covered with water, may in some cases have a great impact on the overall CH(4) emissions from drained peatlands.

AB Peatlands are a globally significant store of carbon. During the second half of the 20th century new planting techniques combined with tax incentives encouraged commercial forestry across large areas of peat bog in the UK, particularly in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. Such planting was controversial and was ultimately halted by removal of the tax incentives, and policies to prevent new planting. Here we review the literature on UK peatland afforestation in relation to carbon and climate implications, and identify key issues for future research. The effects of conifer planting on peat bog carbon storage in the UK are poorly understood. A large body of research on peatland forestry exists, particularly from naturally forested fen peatlands in Fennoscandia and Russia, but the different conditions in the UK mean that results are not directly transferable. Data on the responses of UK peat bogs to afforestation are required to address this shortfall. Studies are required that quantify the loss of carbon from the peat and evaluate it against the accumulation of carbon above and below ground in trees, considering the likely residence time of carbon in wood products.

AB This study presents a new data synthesis of Finnish peatland area and carbon (C) store in peat from 1950 to 2015. We present updated results from the most comprehensive compilation of Finnish peat soil properties with associated C accumulation rates from undrained mires and C sources from different forms of anthropogenic land use. Since 1950, different forms of land use of Finnish peatlands have reduced the total peat C store by 3-10%, approximately 172-510 Tg. The most significant C losses have occurred from forestry-drained peatlands, but significant losses have also occurred from agricultural peat soils, peat extraction, and other forms of peatland exploitation such as building water reservoirs. However, the C accumulation of undrained mires and especially the increased biomass production of drained peatlands have partly compensated for the anthropogenic C losses. The total C store of peatland vegetation biomass (trees, seedlings, ground vegetation, detritus and below-ground roots) was estimated to have increased by 92 Tg due to intensive peatland drainage. The present total C store of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5618 Tg, which includes 5079 Tg as peat. The total C store estimate is approximately 1-7 % lower compared to the 1950s. Today, the undrained mires still represent a significant national C sink, with the rate of C sequestration estimated at 0.82 Tg yr(-1). However, across all land uses the present peat soil is a C source by 3.7-10.0 Tg yr(-1). Significant anthropogenic C losses from peat soil underline the urgent need for sustainable C management of all peatlands, including the preservation of the C store in existing natural mires, stopping land clearing on undisturbed organic soils, and improving the peatland hydrology by restoration to create long-term C sinks especially within the large unproductive drainage area and northern aapa mire area.

AB CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the winter were measured at natural and drained bog and fen sites in eastern Finland using both the dosed chamber method and calculations of gets diffusion along a concentration gradient through the snowpack. The snow diffusion results were compared with those obtained by chamber, but the winter flux estimates were derived from chamber data only. CH4 emissions from a poor bog were lower than those from an oligotrophic fen, while both CO2 and CH4 fluxes were higher in the Carer rostrata-occupied marginal (lagg) area of the fen than in the slightly less fertile centre. Average estimated winter CO2-C losses from virgin and drained forested peatlands were 41 and 68 g CO2-C m(-2) respectively, accounting for 23 and 21% of the annual total CO2 release from the peat. The mean release of CH4-C was 1.0 g in natural bogs and 3.4 g m-2 in fens, giving rise to winter emissions averaging to 22% of the annual emission from the bogs and 10% of that from the fens. These wintertime carbon gas losses in Finnish natural peatlands were even greater than reported average long-term annual C accumulation values (less than 25 g C m(-2)) The narrow range of 10-30% of the proportion of winter CO2 and CH4 emissions from annual emissions found in Finnish peatlands suggest that a wider generalization in the boreal zone is possible. Drained forested bogs emitted 0.3 g CH2-C m(-2) on the average, while the effectively drained fens consumed an average of 0.01 g CH4-C m(-2). Reason for the low CH4 efflux or net oxidation in drained peatlands probably lies in low substrate supply and thus low CH4 production in the anoxic deep peat layers. N2O release from a fertilized grassland site in November-May was 0.7 g N2O m(-2), accounting for 38% of the total annual emission, while a forested bog released none and two efficiently drained forested fens 0.09 (28% of annual release) and 0.04 g N2O m(-2) (27%) during the winter, respectively.

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate the link between environmental conditions and the vegetation pattern of mountain peatlands drained for forestry. We assumed that (a) water chemistry and soil properties differ between the investigated peatlands types-from fen to bog, (b) the vegetation pattern is dependent on water chemistry and soil properties, and (c) water chemistry and soil properties play different roles in determining peatland patterning. For our study, five ecologically and topographically diverse forestry-drained shallow peatlands in Central Sudetes, Poland, were selected. A comparison between the studied peatlands and environmental variables was done by discriminant analysis, whereas vegetation-environmental relationship was analysed by canonical correspondence analysis. Results demonstrated that pH, HCO3-, NO3-, and Ca2+ best explained the variation in water chemistry (approximately 74%), whereas base saturation, pH(water), and plant-available phosphorus best explained the variation in soil properties. Plant assemblages within the peatlands exhibited three vegetation clusters that did not always correspond to peatland ecological type. The vegetation was mostly affected by water chemistry (explained up to 54% of variation), rather than by soil properties. Vegetation within such ecosystems seems to be a good indicator of differences in water chemistry, caused by differences in bedrock (soligenic fen peatlands) or atmospheric inputs (ombrogenic bogs). Our results will help improve our understanding of vegetation-environment relationships in degraded mountain peatland ecosystems in the temperate climate zone. They might also be useful for proper planning of restoration and monitoring of these ecosystems.

AB Major regime shifts in mires such as the fen-bog transition and the transition from non-forested to forested peatland are driven by ecohydrological changes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes and/or durations of hydrological shifts relate to these regime shifts. Here we analyse long-term water table data in conjunction with plant community data collected from primary mires on the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. These ecosystems represent various stages of drainage: undrained, drained sites with developing tree stands, and unsuccessfully drained sites not supporting tree encroachment. The varying success of drainage provides an ideal field laboratory for investigation of thresholds of water table control on the successional trajectories of primary mire. Our data indicate a likely mechanism for the control of vegetation regime shifts in northern peatlands by water table, with time of year being as important a factor as the magnitude of change. Spring flooding rather than summer water table level appeared to be crucial for controlling state shifts in primary mire vegetation. As the effects of climate change on peatlands are most likely to be mediated by changes in hydrology and water table level, our study indicates a need for more thorough investigation of seasonal variability in the controlling factors.

This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of peat (carbon) accumulation and its patterns at the southern climatic range of Sphagnum peatlands in western Siberia. Visible and physical features of peat and detailed reconstructions of successional change (or sediment stratigraphies) were analysed at two types of forest -peatland ecotones, which are situated close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. Our results suggest that Siberian peatlands exhibit a general trend towards being a carbon sink rather than a source even at or near the southern limit of their distribution. Furthermore, two types of peat accumulation were detected in the study area, namely persistent and intermittent. As opposed to persistent peat accumulation, the intermittent one is characterized by the recurrent degradation of the upper peat layers at the marginal parts of raised bogs. Persistent peat accumulation is the case for the majority of Sphagnum peatlands under current climatic conditions. It might be assumed that more peat will accumulate under the ' increased precipitation' scenarios of global warming, although intermittent peat accumulation could result in the eventual drying that may change peatlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

AB Sediment-stratigraphical techniques, together with radiocarbon dating, are applied in this paper to basal peat sequences of Lammansmossen, a sloping mire-complex in southwestern Finland, to reconstruct patterns of peat initiation within the pearland, and by inference, changes in environmental conditions. Peat accumulation commenced simultaneously over the whole lower-lying area of the drainage path about 4500 cal BP, and progressed rapidly by paludification in an upslope direction. By ca 3000 cal BP. about 70% of the present mire area was buried by peat, and the mire received its current configuration 2000 years ago. It is concluded that the rapid replacement of the forest by peatland vegetation occurred mainly in response to a climate change towards humid conditions at 4500 cal BP, although other complex driving mechanisms were operating as well. This interpretation is consistent with findings from other peatlands in southern Finland, as well as a growing body of evidence from other sources.

AB This study summarizes the present knowledge of Finnish peatland areas and carbon (C) storage in peat from 1950 to 2000. In 1950, approximately 8.8 million ha of the Finnish peatland area was still undisturbed and 1.4 million ha drained. In 2000, almost 55% (5.7 million ha) of the peatland area in Finland was drained for forestry, 38.4% (4.0 million ha) was undrained, 0.8% (85 000 ha) was in agriculture, 0.6% (60 000 ha) was under water reservoirs, 0.3% (35 000 ha) was under roads and 0.6% was in peat harvesting or had been removed from the harvesting business (63 000 ha). The change in mire area is considered relatively reliable, whereas the net changes in the actual C sequestration and the actual C storage change from 1950 to 2000 involves much more uncertainty. In 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5960 Tg, which includes 5304 Tg as peat. Since 1950, the C sequestration of undrained and drained peatlands (peat, plant biomass) basically compensated for the anthropogenic losses. The most important forms of anthropogenic C losses have occurred from agricultural peat soils, water reservoirs, harvested peat and DOC output from forestry drained peatlands. From 1950 to 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatlands, which includes peat and living plant biomass, was estimated to increased by 52 Tg because the intensive peatland drainage significantly increased the total C storage of vegetation. However, the actual C storage in peat decreased by about 73 Tg. The well-defined changes include the decrease of mire diversity because of forestry drainage.

AB Measurements of CH4 flux from drained and undrained sites in three northern Ontario peatlands (a treed fen, a forested bog, and a treed bog) were made from the beginning of May to the end of October 1991. In the drained portions, the water table had been lowered between 0.1 and 0.5 m, compared to the water table of the undrained portion of the peatlands. The mean seasonal CH4 flux from the undrained portions of three peatlands was small, ranging from 0 to 8 mg m-2 d-1 , but similar to the CH4 flux from other treed and forested northern peatlands. The mean seasonal CH4 flux from the drained portion of the peatlands was either near zero or slightly negative (i.e  uptake): fluxes ranged from 0.1 to -0.4 mg m-2 d-1. Profiles of CH4 in the air-filled pores in the unsaturated zone, and the water-filled pores of the saturated zone of the peat at the undrained sites, showed that all the CH4 produced at depth was consumed within 0.2 m of the water table and that atmospheric CH4 was consumed in the upper 0.15 m of the peatland. On the basis of laboratory incubations of peat slurries to determine CH4 production and consumption potentials, the lowering of the water table eliminated the near-surface zone of CH4 production that existed in the undrained peatland. However, drainage did not alter significantly the potential for CH4 oxidation between the water table and peatland surface but increased the thickness of the layer over which CH4 oxidation could take place. These changes occurred with a drop in the mean summer water table of only 0.1 m (from -0.2 to -0.3 m) suggesting that only a small negative change in soil moisture would be required to significantly reduce CH4 flux from northern peatlands.

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB One important need in the context of peatland restoration is to gain knowledge of soil organic matter quality and current soil-forming process in degraded peatlands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long-term drainage on soil transformation processes. In autumn 2012, soil survey and sampling was carried out on five shallow peatlands in the Central Sudeten Mountains (Poland) which had been drained for forestry use in the late 1800s or early 1900s. Four organic soils (Histosols) and one organo-mineral soil (Histic Gleysol) were studied. The surface soil horizons were mainly transformed due to long-term forestry drainage. Increased aeration of these layers had enhanced their content of labile forms of carbon and they were undergoing secondary transformation. Soil transformation was more advanced in fen peatlands than in transitional mire or raised bogs. Only the fens exhibited characteristic evidence of the moorsh-forming process. Further drying of these soils will negatively affect their rewetting potential and significantly reduce the effective application of restoration treatments. In order to reduce organic matter transformation and loss from the investigated peatland areas, their drainage ditches should be blocked. Additionally, some trees should be removed from their central areas to reduce evapotranspiration.

AB Northern peatlands accumulate atmospheric CO2 thus counteracting climate warming. However, CH4 which is more efficient as a greenhouse gas than CO2, is produced in the anaerobic decomposition processes in pear. When peatlands are taken for forestry their water table is lowered by ditching. We studied long-term effects of lowered water table on the development of vegetation and the annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in an ombrotrophic bog and in a minerotrophic fen in Finland. Reclamation of the pear sites for forestry had changed the composition and coverage of the field and ground layer species, and increased highly the growth of tree stand at the drained fen. In general, drainage increased the annual CO2 emissions but the emissions were also affected by the natural fluctuations of water table. In contrast to CO2, drainage had decreased the emissions of CH4, the drained fen even consumed atmospheric CH4. CO2 and CH4 emissions were higher in the virgin fen than in the virgin bog. There were no N2O emissions from neither type of virgin sites. Drainage had, however, highly increased the N2O emissions from the fen. The results suggest that post-drainage changes in gas fluxes depend on the trophy of the original mires.

AB 1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.
   2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.
   3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.
   4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

AB The objective of this paper is to assess the accuracy of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets in mapping peat-land types over a region of Canada's subarctic boreal zone. This paper assessed contributions of quad-polarization linear backscatter intensities (sigma degrees HH, sigma degrees HV, sigma degrees VV), image textures, and two polarimetric scattering decompositions: 1) Cloude-Pottier, and 2) Freeman-Durden. Four quad-polarimetric RADADSAT-2 images were studied at incidence angles of 19.4 degrees, 23.1 degrees, 45.8 degrees, and 48.1 degrees. The influence of combining dual-angular information acquired within a short temporal span was also assessed. These C-band SAR data were used to classify peatlands according to isolated flat bogs (bogs), channel fens (fens), raised peat plateaus (plateaus), and forested uplands (uplands) using a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Numerous classifications were examined to compare the unique contributions of these variables to classification accuracy. Results suggest linear backscatter variables in isolation produce comparable classification results with those of the Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier decompositions. Combining polarimetric decomposition and texture data into classifications with linear backscatter data resulted in only minor (similar to 1-3%) improvement. Combining classifications from small and large incidence angles (dual-angular) significantly improved classification results over those of a single image. Classification accuracy was the highest for isolated bogs and open water surfaces, whereas fens, uplands, and plateaus had lower accuracies. The highest accuracy classification (84% and kappa coefficient of 0.80) used a dual-angular approach, with additional decomposition and texture information. However, it is noted that texture information rarely improved classification results across all tests. This approach identified isolated flat bogs, channel fens, and raised peat plateaus with >76% producer's accuracies.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry causes the water level to draw down, which results in subsidence of peat surface and increased peat bulk density (D-b) Later on, an accelerated rate of organic matter decomposition and the pressure of the growing tree stand further compacts the peat. We measured the peat D-b (0-80 cm) in 180 undrained and 209 drained (ca. 60-year-old) peatland sites representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland. D-b was affected by climatic conditions, nutrient status, and the tree stand volume of the site. D-b was significantly higher in drained than in undrained sites in all regions and site types: the mean (+/-SD) D-b in the whole material was 82 +/- 23 kg.m(-3) for the undrained sites and 133 +/- 22 kg.m(-3) for the drained sites. The increase in D-b was significant in all regions down to a depth of 60 cm and in southern Finland, even deeper than 80 cm. When the increase in carbon concentration was taken into consideration, the average postdrainage increase in the Db Of the 0-80 cm layer equalled the amount of carbon in the 54-cm layer in average undrained peat. As the reported subsidences of pear surface in forest drainage areas in Finland are usually below this limit, the carbon storage of peat is likely to increase after drainage.

AB Background: Peatlands are an important component of Canada's landscape, however there is little information on their national-scale net emissions of carbon dioxide [Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)] and methane (CH4). This study compiled results for peatland NEE and CH4 emissions from chamber and eddy covariance studies across Canada. The data were summarized by bog, poor fen and rich-intermediate fen categories for the seven major peatland containing terrestrial ecozones (Atlantic Maritime, Mixedwood Plains, Boreal Shield, Boreal Plains, Hudson Plains, Taiga Shield, Taiga Plains) that comprise > 96% of all peatlands nationally. Reports of multiple years of data from a single site were averaged and different microforms (e.g., hummock or hollow) within these peatland types were kept separate. A new peatlands map was created from forest composition and structure information that distinguishes bog from rich and poor fen. National Forest Inventory k-NN forest structure maps, bioclimatic variables (mean diurnal range and seasonality of temperatures) and ground surface slope were used to construct the new map. The Earth Observation for Sustainable Development map of wetlands was used to identify open peatlands with minor tree cover.
   Results: The new map was combined with averages of observed NEE and CH4 emissions to estimate a growing season integrated NEE (+/- SE) at - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) Mt CO2 season(-1) and CH4 emission at 4.1 (+/- 1.5) Mt CH4 season(-1) for the seven ecozones. Converting CH4 to CO2 equivalent (CO2 e; Global Warming Potential of 25 over 100 years) resulted in a total net sink of - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) Mt CO2 e season(-1) for Canada. Boreal Plains peatlands contributed most to the NEE sink due to high CO2 uptake rates and large peatland areas, while Boreal Shield peatlands contributed most to CH4 emissions due to moderate emission rates and large peatland areas. Assuming a winter CO2 emission of 0.9 g CO2 M-2 day(-1) creates an annual CO2 source (24.2 Mt CO2 year(-1) ) and assuming a winter CH4 emission of 7 mg CH4 M-2 day(-1) inflates the total net source to 151.8 Mt CO2 e year(-1).
   Conclusions: This analysis improves upon previous basic, aspatial estimates and discusses the potential sources of the high uncertainty in spatially integrated fluxes, indicating a need for continued monitoring and refined maps of peatland distribution for national carbon and greenhouse gas flux estimation.

AB The annual net CO2 exchange over undisturbed deep peatland in Scotland was measured continuously for 22 months using eddy covariance. Annual CO2 exchanges over peatlands that had been drained, ploughed and afforested with conifers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 26 years previously were estimated by extrapolating two to four weekly measurements, using relationships between daytime fluxes and solar radiation and night-time fluxes and air temperature. The contribution of the trees to the overall net CO2 flux was estimated using a carbon accounting model, calibrated to fit conifer volume yield data. The carbon exchange of the peat and ground vegetation was then the difference between the overall carbon flux and the amount accumulated in trees and tree litter. The undisturbed peat accumulated similar to0.25 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Newly drained peatland (2-4 years after ploughing) emitted between 2 and 4 t C ha(-1) a(-1), but when ground vegetation recolonized, the peatland became a sink again, absorbing similar to3 t C ha(-1) a(-1) 4-8 years after tree planting. Thereafter, the trees dominated the budget and afforested peatlands absorbed up to 5 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Assuming that the trees accumulated carbon at rates commensurate with yield class 10 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), the peat beneath the trees after canopy closure was estimated to be decomposing at only similar to1 t C ha(-1) a(-1) or less. This is slower than previously thought and suggested that afforested peatlands in Scotland accumulate more carbon in trees, litter, forest soil and products than is lost from the peat for 90-190 years.

AB Long-term impacts of drier conditions on the hydrology of northern peatlands are poorly understood. We used long-term drainage near a historic drainage ditch, separating an area from the main peatland, as an analogue for long-term drying in a northern temperate bog. The objective was to identify the impact of drier conditions on ecohydrological processes and groundwater flow patterns in an area now forested and an area that maintained a bog-like character. Groundwater flow patterns alternated between mostly downward flow and occasionally upward flow in the bog area and were mostly upward-orientated in the forested area, which suggested that there the flow pattern had shifted from bog-to fen-like conditions. Flow patterns were in agreement with changes in post-drainage hydraulic conductivities, storage capacity of the peat and water table levels. Compared to the bog, hydraulic conductivities in the forested area were one to three orders of magnitude lower in the uppermost 0.75m of peat (paired t test, p < 0.05). Bulk density had increased and the water table level was lower and more strongly fluctuating in the forested area. Our findings suggest hydraulic gradients and flow patterns have changed due to increased evapotranspiration and interception with the emergence of a tree cover. The smaller size of the now-forested area relative to the remaining bog area appeared to be important for the hydrological change. With the main Mer Bleue bog as hinterland, enhanced runoff to the drainage channel had little effect on hydrologic and vegetation patterns. In the cut-off, smaller, now forested area pervasive changes in vegetation and hydrologic processes occurred. The difference in response to local drainage raises questions about tipping points with respect to the impact of drying on peatland ecosystems that need to be addressed in future research.

AB Questions Peatland ecosystems are a globally important carbon storage that is predicted to turn into a carbon source due to water level drawdown (WLD) associated with climate change. The predictions assume stable plant communities but how realistic is this assumption? If the vegetation is not stable, what are the nature and rate of changes? Location Peatland complex in Southern Finland. Methods We conducted a water level drawdown (WLD of 10 cm) experiment over 17 years in three peatland types differing in their fertility. On each peatland type, we included an adjacent forestry drained (FD, with water table ca. 40 cm lower than in control) area for comparison. Results Peatland type had a clear impact on the response to WLD: at the ecosystem level, the two minerotrophic fens underwent rapid species turnover, while the vegetation in nutrient-poor bog was more resilient to change. In nutrient-rich sites, WLD initiated tree canopy development and created understorey conditions that strengthened impact of WLD. In nutrient-poor site, tree establishment was seen only in the FD area. In addition to high nutrient level, high wetness accelerated change at the plant community level, where we found three types of responses: accelerating change, decelerating change, and stability. Succession resulted in an overall loss of community heterogeneity. Conclusions Interaction between hydrology, nutrient availability, and biological factors in boreal peatlands is important: the drop in water table required to achieve the shift from open peatland to forested system is inversely proportional to the nutrient level of the system. The results suggest that predictive models of peatland functions under climate change should consider compositional change for fens and their diverse plant communities but are more realistic for bogs. The response of bog vegetation to climate change may, however, be more dependent on changes in rainfall regime and therefore needs to be further addressed.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry often leads to carbon dioxide (CO2) net emission from soil due to loss of peat. This emission can be compensated for by the increased tree growth. Hovewer, many drained peatlands have low tree growth due to nutrient limitations. Tree growth at these peatlands can be effectively increased by fertilization, but fertilization has been also found to increase decomposition rates.
   We studied the long-term effect of fertilization of low-productive forestry-drained peatlands on the complete ecosystem greenhouse gas exchange, including both soil and tree component, and accounting for CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Five N-rich study sites (flark fens and a rich fen) and one N-poor ombrotrophic site were established. Fertilization had started at the study sites 16-67 years before our measurements.
   Fertilization considerably increased tree stand CO2 sink ( + 248-1013 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Decomposition increased on average by 45% ( + 431 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)) and litter production by 38% ( + 360 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Thus, on average 84% of the increased decomposition could be attributed to increased litter production and 16% to increased soil CO 2 net emission due to increased loss of peat. Soil CO2 net emission correlated positively with water table depth and top soil N concentration.
   Fertilization increased soil CO2 net emission at the drained flark fens on average by 187 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). At the rich fen, net emission decreased. The N-poor bog exhibited soil CO2 sink both with and without fertilization. Effects on methane and nitrous oxide emissions were small at most sites.
   The increase in tree stand CO2 sink was higher than the increase in soil CO2 net emission, indicating that fertilization has a climate cooling effect in the decadal time scale. Yet, as the fertilized plots at N-rich sites exhibited soil CO2 source or zero balance, continuation of fertilization-based forestry over several rotations would lead to progressive loss of ecosystem C. At the N-poor bog, fertilization-based forestry may have a climate-cooling effect also in the centennial time scale.

AB We investigated the impacts of resource access roads on soil enzyme activities in contrasting forested boreal peatlands (bog and fen). In August 2016, a total of 72 peat samples were collected from twelve 20 m long transects perpendicular to access roads, with a further six samples collected fromundisturbed reference areas. Sampling locations represent a range in three variables associated with roads: 1) side of the road (upstream/downstream), 2) distance to a culvert (longitudinal; <2 and >20 m), and 3) distance from the road (lateral; 2, 6, and 20 m). Phenol oxidase and hydrolase (glucosidase, sulfatase, xylosidase, glucosaminidase, and phosphatase) enzyme activities were determined for each sample, in addition to water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH, and peat temperature. The average hydrolase activities in the fen were similar to four times higher than in the bog. At the bog, the water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH and the activities of phenol oxidase, sulfatase, glucosidase, xylosidase and glucosaminidase were all significantly influenced by one or more road associated factors. The highest enzyme activities in the bog occurred on the downstream side of the road at plots located far from the culvert. In contrast, the flow of water in the fen was not perpendicular to the road. Consequently, no significant variations in water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH or enzyme activity were found with respect to road associated factors. Results indicate that road crossings in boreal peatlands can indirectly alter enzyme activities, likely as part of a causal chain following changes to hydrology and redox conditions. Two of six investigated enzymes had significantly higher activities in the road disturbed areas compared to undisturbed areas, suggesting ultimately that roads may enhance organic matter decomposition rates. However, adequate hydrologic connections through culverts and road construction parallel to the water flow can minimize the road-induced impacts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microtopography is a common attribute of wetlands, particularly boreal bog and fen peatlands. This self-organized patterning is primarily an autogenic process; however, the role of allogenic forces such as disturbance in the maintenance of microtopography is poorly understood. In this study, we quantify the effect of fire on the distribution of the microtopographic gradient in boreal bogs using a before-after wildfire natural experiment. We also quantify the change in spatial abundance of microforms in boreal treed peatlands over a 100-year successional chronosequence. Wildfire nearly doubled the range of the microtopographic gradient, increasing the relative abundance of low-elevation microforms (hollows), although the distribution of elevations was influenced by peatland ontogeny at the time of wildfire. Through succession, raised microforms (hummocks) became more abundant, presumably due to autogenic surface drying facilitating hummock species expansion into adjacent hollows. Although autogenic processes may be responsible for the development of self-organized spatial patterning in wetlands, disturbances such as wildfire are necessary for maintaining boreal peatland microtopography over extended time scales. Because of the tight linkage between microtopography, species diversity, and ecosystem function, these feedbacks between wildfire and microtopography are critical for understanding peatland dynamics and the potential impact of a changing environment.

AB Spatial information on biotopes would be an asset for boreal peatland inventories. It may be helpful for protection and monitoring changes in species diversity caused by artificial regulation of hydrology, atmospheric deposition, and global change. We took a data-driven approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in Finland (65 degrees 57'N, 24 degrees 29'E). The objective was to produce an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon), electrical conductivity (sigma), and pH. Constrained canonical correspondence ordination revealed that epsilon, sigma (p<0.01), and pH (p<0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum-Emperum nigrum-Rubus chamaemorus-S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum-S. lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa-Trichophorum cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre-S. majus-Carex rostrata-swamp. The highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8%, kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10% of the original training data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or national scales.

AB Recent warming at high-latitudes has accelerated permafrost thaw in northern peatlands, and thaw can have profound effects on local hydrology and ecosystem carbon balance. To assess the impact of permafrost thaw on soil organic carbon (OC) dynamics, we measured soil hydrologic and thermal dynamics and soil OC stocks across a collapse-scar bog chronosequence in interior Alaska. We observed dramatic changes in the distribution of soil water associated with thawing of ice-rich frozen peat. The impoundment of warm water in collapse-scar bogs initiated talik formation and the lateral expansion of bogs over time. On average, Permafrost Plateaus stored 137 +/- 37 kg C m(-2), whereas OC storage in Young Bogs and Old Bogs averaged 84 +/- 13 kg C m(-2). Based on our reconstructions, the accumulation of OC in near-surface bog peat continued for nearly 1,000 years following permafrost thaw, at which point accumulation rates slowed. Rapid decomposition of thawed forest peat reduced deep OC stocks by nearly half during the first 100 years following thaw. Using a simple mass-balance model, we show that accumulation rates at the bog surface were not sufficient to balance deep OC losses, resulting inanet loss of OC from the entire peat column. An uncertainty analysis also revealed that the magnitude and timing of soil OC loss from thawed forest peat depends substantially on variation in OC input rates to bog peat and variation in decay constants for shallow and deep OC stocks. These findings suggest that permafrost thaw and the subsequent release of OC from thawed peat will likely reduce the strength of northern permafrost-affected peatlands as a carbon dioxide sink, and consequently, will likely accelerate rates of atmospheric warming.

AB The drawdown of the water level has been hypothesized to change peatlands from carbon (C) sinks to C sources to the atmosphere as a result of increased oxidation of organic matter. We measured the change in peat thickness (subsidence of peat surface) ca. 60 years after drainage in 273 peatland sites (875 points) representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland, and we calculated the changes in peat C densities and peat C stores using direct measurements and estimates drawn from regression models for C density derived in this study. On average, the peat surface had subsided ca. 22 +/- 17 cm (mean +/- SD), the C density had increased by 26 +/- 15 kg.m(-)3, and the C stores had increased by 5.9 +/- 14.4 kg.m(-2) after drainage. Therefore, the hypothesis that drainage of peatland always makes them sources of C to the atmosphere is incorrect. We concluded that the post-drainage subsidence of peat surface was mainly caused by changes in the physical structure of peat after the removal of water while the oxidation of peat was of less importance. The changes in C density and C stores seemed to be dependent on the input of new C into the system through net primary production, especially through the fine roots of trees. Our results suggest that tree stand development plays an important role in the post-drainage C balance of peat soils.

AB The relationships between the distribution of plant communities and environmental factors were studied in an open peatland - forest complex of the hypermaritime north coast of British Columbia. The entire vegetation gradient, from open through forested peatlands to upland forest, was primarily explained by slope and minimum level of groundwater table. Environmental conditions in the upland Tsuga-Rhytidiadelphus forest were considerably different from those of the other communities; differences were small among the Sphagnum open peatland, the Pinus-Sphagnum woodland, the Chamaecyparis-Fauria forest, and the Thuja-Gaultheria forest. Highest level of groundwater table, conductivity minimum, pH, and dissolved oxygen merely helped distinguish the upland Tsuga-Rhytidiadelphus forest from all other communities. The wet Thuja-Gaultheria forest could be more vulnerable than the upland Tsuga-Rhytidiadelphus forest to local hydrological changes caused by harvesting. Consecutive intraannual measurements of environmental variables are important in clarifying the relationships between distribution of plant communities and environmental variables, especially for communities with peat accumulation.

AB Peatlands are effective carbon sinks as more biomass is produced than decomposed under the prevalent anoxic conditions. Draining peatlands coupled with warming releases stored carbon, and subsequent rewetting may or may not restore the original carbon sink. Yet, patterns of plant production and decomposition in rewetted peatlands and how they compare to drained conditions remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured annual above- and belowground biomass production and decomposition in three different drained and rewetted peatland types: alder forest, percolation fen and coastal fen during an exceptionally dry year. We also used standard plant material to compare decomposition between the sites, regardless of the decomposability of the local plant material. Rewetted sites showed higher root and shoot production in the percolation fen and higher root production in the coastal fen, but similar root and leaf production in the alder forest. Decomposition rates were generally similar in drained and rewetted sites, only in the percolation fen and alder forest did aboveground litter decompose faster in the drained sites. The rewetted percolation fen and the two coastal sites had the highest projected potential for organic matter accumulation. Roots accounted for 23-66% of total biomass production, and belowground biomass, rather than aboveground biomass, was particularly important for organic matter accumulation in the coastal fens. This highlights the significance of roots as main peat-forming element in these graminoid-dominated fen peatlands and their crucial role in carbon cycling, and shows that high biomass production supported the peatlands' function as carbon sink even during a dry year.

AB Yamulki and co-authors address in their recent publication the important issue of net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from peatlands where land use conversion has taken place. In their case, they studied conversion to forestry versus peatland restoration after a first rotation of plantation forestry. They monitored soil-derived fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) using opaque chamber measurements on planted and unplanted control treatments (with or without drainage), and an unplanted plot within a restored (felled) block on former lowland raised bog. They propose that their measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at these sites suggest that the total net GHG emissions, in 100 yr carbon dioxide equivalents, of the restored peat bog would be higher than that of the peat bog with trees. We believe there are a number of issues with the measurement, calculation and comparison of these greenhouse budgets that may invalidate this conclusion.

AB Methane emission feedbacks in wetlands are predicted to influence global climate under climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Herein, we review the taxonomy and physiological ecology of the microorganisms responsible for methane production in peatlands. Common in peat soils are five of the eight described orders of methanogens spanning three phyla (Euryarchaeota, Halobacterota and Thermoplasmatota). The phylogenetic affiliation of sequences found in peat suggest that members of the thus-far-uncultivated group Candidatus Bathyarchaeota (representing a fourth phylum) may be involved in methane cycling, either anaerobic oxidation of methane and/or methanogenesis, as at least a few organisms within this group contain the essential gene, mcrA, according to metagenomic data. Methanogens in peatlands are notoriously challenging to enrich and isolate; thus, much remains unknown about their physiology and how methanogen communities will respond to environmental changes. Consistent patterns of changes in methanogen communities have been reported across studies in permafrost peatland thaw where the resulting degraded feature is thermokarst. However much remains to be understood regarding methanogen community feedbacks to altered hydrology and warming in other contexts, enhanced atmospheric pollution (N, S and metals) loading and direct anthropogenic disturbances to peatlands like drainage, horticultural peat extraction, forestry and agriculture, as well as post-disturbance reclamation.

AB Bulk density, total contents of N, P, K, Ca and Fe and field- and laboratory-incubated mineral-N were determined for a bog and fen site 3 years after drainage treatments (3 m and 15 m ditch spacings), tilling treatments (untilled, tilled) and fertilization treatments (unfertilized, PK-fertilized), as well as for adjacent untreated (undisturbed) areas of the bog and fen, Tilling of the surface or fertilization did not significantly affect total nutrient contents in either bog or fen, although nutrient contents were generally higher in fertilization or drainage treatments that included tilling, As a result of decreased ditch spacing (from 15 m to 3 m), bulk density was significantly increased in the bog site (from 44.9 to 63.5 mg cm(-3)) and decreased (non-significant) in the fen site (from 105 to 89 mg cm(-3)). Total P and K were increased where PK was applied as fertilizer. In bog peats, bulk density (mg cm(-3)), total N concentrations (mg g(-1)) and total contents (kg ha(-1)) of N, P, K, Ca and Fe were significantly higher in the 3 m ditch spacing than in the 15 m ditch spacing. Thus, increases in total nutrient contents in bog peats can be attributed mainly to increased bulk density as a result of drainage treatment. in contrast, bulk densities and most nutrient contents of fen peats were not significantly affected by treatments. However, total N concentrations and total N contents were significantly reduced by more intensive ditching (3 m ditch spacing). Contents of mineral N in fresh pear and field-incubated and laboratory anaerobically incubated (30 degrees C) peat consisted entirely of NH4-N. Laboratory incubations over a 20-week period demonstrated a high potential for release of NH4-N in peat from treated sites of bog and fen. During four 28-day field incubation periods, production of mineral-N varied from 0.1 to 1.2 kg ha(-1) (net mineralization) to -0.1 to -0.3 kg ha(-1) (net immobilization) for bog peat. Similarly, on the fen site production ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 kg ha(-1) (net mineralization) and -0.1 to -1.7 kg ha(-1) (net immobilization). In the unfertilized and PK-fertilized treatments of the fen, as well as the PK-fertilized treatment of the bog, net immobilization predominated during the first incubation period, followed by net mineralization during the next three incubation periods. In the unfertilized treatment of the bog, net mineralization predominated early in the growing season, followed by net immobilization thereafter.

AB Boreal mires encompass high diversity in species and habitats, many of which are endangered. In Finland, extensive use of peatlands has resulted in habitat fragmentation. A need for accurate and cost-efficient vegetation mapping and monitoring of habitat changes exists in mire conservation, restoration and peatland forestry. LiDAR is an emerging and excellent tool for probing the geometry of vegetation and terrain. Modern systems measure the backscattered signal accurately and also provide radiometric information. Experiments were carried out in a complex minerotrophic-ombrotrophic eccentric raised bog in southern Finland (61 degrees 47'N, 24.18'E). First, we tested discrete-return LiDAR for the modeling of mire surface patterns and the detection of hummocks and hollows, as well as the effect of mire plants on the Z accuracy of the surface echoes. Secondly, the response of different mire vegetation samples in LiDAR intensity was examined. Thirdly, we tested area-based geometric and radiometric features in supervised classification of mire habitats to discover the meaningful variables. The vertical accuracy of LiDAR in mire surface modeling was high: 0.05-0.10 m. A binary hummock-hollow model that was estimated from a LiDAR-based elevation model matched flawlessly in aerial images and had moderate explanatory power in habitat classification trials. The intensity of LiDAR in open-mire vegetation was mainly influenced by the surface moisture, and separation of vegetation classes spanning from ombrotrophic to mesotrophic vegetation proved to be difficult. Area-based features that characterize the height distribution of LiDAR points in the canopy were the strongest explanatory variables in the classification of 21 diverse mire site types. Actual qualifying differences in the ground flora were unattainable in the LiDAR data, which resulted in inferior accuracy in the characterization of ecohydrological conditions and nutrient level of open mires and sparsely forested wet sites. Mire habitat classification accuracy with LiDAR surpassed earlier results with optical data. The results suggested that LiDAR constitutes an efficient aid for monitoring applications. We propose the co-use of images and LiDAR for enhanced mapping of open mires and tree species. In situ calibration and validation procedures are required until invariant geometric and radiometric features are discovered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding soil organic matter concentration (SOM) and chemistry in different peatlands can help design appropriate management practices for sustainable use of peatland agroecosystems. However, detailed information on characteristics of SOM concentration and chemistry is not available for most peatland agroecosystems in general and in northern Germany in particular. In this study, we investigated the SOM concentration and chemistry of drained and rewetted percolation mires, forest and coastal peatlands. We used simple chemical analysis, pyrolysis field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and carbon and nitrogen X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The total organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N), and total sulfur (S) contents were significantly (P < 0.05) different among the peatlands. The C-org at the surface horizons ranged from 164 to 373 g kg(-1), and these values were lower than that of the subsurface horizons of the studied peat lands except for the drained alder carr forest and coastal peatlands. The Py-FIMS indicated that the labile SOM compound classes (carbohydrates, phenols, and lignin monomers, and amino acids, peptides, and amino-sugars) and stable SOM compounds classes (lignin dimers, heterocyclic nitrogen compounds, and nitriles) were abundant at the surface horizons. However, the stable compound classes such as lipids, alkanes, alkenes, fatty acids, n-alkyl esters, and suberin were more abundant at the subsurface horizons than the surface horizons. The carbon K-edge spectra revealed that aromatic C, carboxylic C, O-alkyl, and aliphatic C were the predominant C functional groups, whereas N K edge spectra indicated that the amide group was the predominated N functional group. The SOM concentrations and some compound classes were higher in the rewetted sites of alder carr forest peatland (more carbohydrates, suberin and fatty acids) and of percolation mires (more lignin dimers, lipids and alkylaromatics). The results indicate that the effects of rewetting peatlands on SOM concentration and chemistry depend on peatland type.

AB This study analysed the drainage influence on vegetation and peat deposit and assessed the self-restoration of ecological functions of Western Siberia bogs. As a case study, we selected four raised bogs - two are the east-northern spurs of the Great Vasyugan Mire and two are small, raised bogs on the terrace of the Bakchar River and the Ob River. The consequences of drainage and the ability to self-restore are influenced by the moisture conditions before drainage, bog size, distance between ditches and microtopography characteristics. The dominant species under wet conditions, such as Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum balticum, changed with drainage to Sphagnum fuscum, and the peat accumulation rate increased. The sites with more dry conditions and dominated by Sphagnum fuscum were characterised by the intense degradation of Sphagnum, Bryidae and lichen growth and a low peat accumulation rate. Large raised bogs are relatively stable and capable of self-restoration. The drainage effect was more significant within some parts of the small bogs. Drainage consequences were less dramatic for large bogs, even in the marginal parts and near the ditches. A distance between ditches of 40 m and less is critical for self-restoration. Our study demonstrates that modern peat accumulation occurred in most parts of the plots; the mean peat accumulation rate over the last 35 years was 0.43 cm per year. Drainage influence in the south-eastern part of Western Siberia is less significant than in European bogs, not only because of the high stability of raised bogs but also because of the lower drainage intensity as well as the absence of forest planting, fertilisation and peat mining.

AB Background and aims Estimation of root-mediated carbon fluxes in forested peatlands is needed for understanding ecosystem functioning and supporting greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we aim to determine the optimal methodology for utilizing ingrowth cores in estimating annual fine-root production (FRP) and its vertical distribution in trees, shrubs and herbs.
   Methods We used 3-year data obtained with modified ingrowth core method and tested two calculation methods: 'ingrowth-dividing' and `ingrowth-subtracting'.
   Results The ingrowth-dividing method combined with a 2-year incubation of ingrowth cores can be used for the 'best estimate' of FRP. The FRP in the nutrient-rich fen forest (561 g m(-2)) was more than twice that in the nutrient-poor bog forest (244 g m(-2)). Most FRP occurred in the top 20-cm layer (76-82 %). Tree FRP accounted for 71 % of total FRP in the bog and 94 % in the fen forests, respectively, following the aboveground vegetation patterns; however, in fen forest the proportions of spruce and birch in FRP were higher than their proportions in stand basal area.
   Conclusions Our methodology may be used to study peatland FRP patterns more widely and will reduce the volume of labour-intensive work, but will benefit from verification with other methods, as is the case in all in situ FRP studies.

AB In this study, a reconstruction of the long-term development and lateral expansion of a south Swedish peat bog was performed using a multi-proxy approach, including dendrochronology, peat stratigraphy and macrofossil and pollen analyses. By combining mapping of cross-dated subfossil trees with radiocarbon-dated peat sequences, an improved approach to reconstruction of lateral peat expansion was applied. Apart from providing approximate ages of tree burial episodes, the ring-width records offer information on hydrological variations prior to the bog expansion. New bog oak, pine and alder chronologies are presented and their potential as a dating tool for peatland expansion as well as for local to regional environmental interpretations is examined. Our tree-replication records show that increased amounts of bog trees in the central parts can be linked to drier bog-surface conditions, whereas an increase in wood remains in the marginal zone is related to enhanced preservation due to lateral bog expansion. Our reconstructions of the development of the peat deposit and associated changes in the distribution of vegetation communities provide new insight into peatland responses to climate change at the end of the 'Holocene Thermal Maximum' (5000-4000 cal. yr BP).

AB Treed peatlands exhibit both crown and smouldering fire potential; however, neither are included in Canadian wildfire management models and, as such, they are not formally represented in management decision-making. The lack of smouldering fire risk assessment is a critical research gap as these fires can represent heavy resource draws and are predominant sources of smoke, air pollutants and atmospheric carbon. Here, for the first time, we combine existing knowledge of the controls on smouldering peat fire with expert opinion-based weightings through a multi-criteria decision analysis, to map the smouldering fire potential (i.e. hazard) of treed peatlands in the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada. We find that smouldering potential varies considerably between treed peatlands and that areas of sparser peatland coverage may contain high smouldering-potential peatlands. Further, we find that treed peatlands are a common feature in the wildland-human interface and that proportionally, the area of high smouldering potential is greater closer to roads compared with farther away. Our approach enables a quantitative measure of smouldering fire potential and evidences the need to incorporate peatland-wildfire interactions into wildfire management operations. We suggest that similar frameworks could be used in other peatland dominated regions as part of smouldering fire risk assessments.

AB Drainage for forestry purposes increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and leads to increased growth of shrubs and trees. Concurrently, the production and uptake of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) change: due to the accelerated decomposition of peat in the presence of oxygen, drained peatlands are generally considered to lose peat carbon (C). We measured CO2 exchange with the eddy co-variance (EC) method above a drained nutrient-poor peatland forest in southern Finland for 16 months in 2004-2005. The site, classified as a dwarf-shrub pine bog, had been ditched about 35 years earlier. CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured at 2-5-week intervals with the chamber technique. Drainage had resulted in a relatively little change in the water table level, being on average 40 cm below the ground in 2005. The annual net ecosystem exchange was -870 +/- 100 gCO(2) m-(2) yr(-1) in the calendar year 2005, indicating net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. The site was a small sink of CH4 (-0.12 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1)) and a small source of N2O (0.10 gN(2)Om(-2) yr(-1)). Photosynthesis was detected throughout the year when the air temperature exceeded -3 degrees C. As the annual accumulation of C in the above and below ground tree biomass (175 +/- 35 gCm(-2)) was significantly lower than the accumulation observed by the flux measurement (240 +/- 30 gCm(-2)), about 65 g Cm-2 yr(-1) was likely to have accumulated as organic matter into the peat soil. This is a higher average accumulation rate than previously reported for natural northern peatlands, and the first time C accumulation has been shown by EC measurements to occur in a forestry-drained peatland. Our results suggest that forestry-drainage may significantly increase the CO2 uptake rate of nutrient-poor peatland ecosystems.

AB Peatlands play a major role in the global carbon cycle but are largely overlooked in current large-scale vegetation mapping efforts. In this study, we investigated the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to capture the extent and distribution of peatlands in the St. Petersburg region of Russia by analyzing the relationships between peatland cover fractions derived from reference maps and similar to 1-km resolution MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data from year 2002. First, we characterized and mapped 50 peatlands from forest inventory and peat deposit inventory data. The peatlands represent three major nutritional types (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic) and different sizes (0.6-7800 ha). In addition, parts of 6 peatlands were mined for peat and these were mapped separately. The reference maps provided information on peatland cover for 1105 MODIS pixels. We performed regression analysis on 50% of the pixels and reserved the remainder for model validation. Canonical correlation analysis on the MODIS reflectance bands and the peatland cover fractions produced a multi-spectral peatland cover index (PCI), which served as the predictor in a reduced major axis (RMA) regression model. The results suggest a high potential for mapping peatlands with MODIS. The RMA regression models explained much of the variance in the PCI (r(2)=0.74 for mined and r(2)=0.81 for unmined peatlands). Model validation showed high correlation between observed versus predicted peatland cover (mined: r=0.87; unmined: r=0.92). We used the models to derive peatland cover estimates for the St. Petersburg region and compared the results to current MODIS land cover maps. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fossil insects contained within a monolith of peat taken from Thorne Moors, to the northeast of Doncaster, UK, were studied. The changing entomofauna demonstrates clearly the development of raised mire from fen woodland. Many of the trees emerging from the peat have been severely burnt and the role of fire in the destruction of the woodland is considered. A number of species recovered from the lower peats are now extinct in Britain; others have extremely limited distributions in Europe today.

DT Article
AB We tested Brown's (1984) explanation of the generally observed positive relationship between distribution and abundance of species. The hypothesis states that generalized species are widely distributed and locally common, and that specialized species are narrowly distributed and locally rare. The analysis is based on 327 censuses covering almost the whole north-south range of Finland, i.e., ca. 1100 km. The censused habitats cover 19 peatland habitat types, ranging from open flark fens to forested peatlands. The relationship between distribution and abundance was positive for the total avifauna, and also for wader and for passerine species. Since the number of observations may affect the number of peatland types where the species is observed, we used two indices to measure habitat amplitude (a rarefaction estimate and Hurlbert's (1978) B'). The species that were able to inhabit several mire types had large geographical ranges, but were not locally abundant. Thus, in general, the species with a wide habitat amplitude are regionally widespread, but not locally abundant. The results do not fully support Brown's explanation of the distribution-abundance relationship.

AB Background and aims In forestry-drained peatlands, drying leads to changes in C cycling which could affect peat delta C-13. Furthermore, the delta C-13 profile of the entire peat column may reveal effects of earlier climatic periods. Methods We measured peat delta C-13 and C inventories in adjacent peat profiles, two collected from undrained and two from the drained side of a bog that was partially ditch-drained 37 years earlier. The cores were sliced into 10-cm subsamples for analyses; matching of the profiles based on surface levelling, peat stratigraphic correlation and a horizontal ash layer found in both profiles. Results Surface subsidence of 30 cm was observed in the dried site and the uppermost 160 cm in the undrained site contained an excess of 5.9 kg m(-2) of C compared with the corresponding strata of the ditch-drained site. The delta C-13 values increased but markedly only in the thin surface layer of the drained site, indicating low delta C-13 of the missing C (ca. -30 parts per thousand). In the deeper strata, dating to Mid-Holocene, high dry bulk density, C%, N%, humification index and low C/N ratio were connected to low delta C-13 of peat. Conclusions Drainage of 37 years increased delta C-13 values in the upper peat profile of the drained bog and led to the selective loss of C-13 depleted C. Results indicate that C balance studies can be aided by C isotope analyses. Low delta C-13 values in the peat profile indicate the existence of a wet fen stage during the moist and warm period during Mid-Holocene.

AB The total area of boreal peatlands is about 3.5 million km(2) and they are estimated to contain 15-30% of the global soil carbon (C) storage. In Finland, about 60 000 km(2), or 60% of the original peatland area, has been drained, mainly for forestry improvement. We have studied C inventory changes on forestry-drained peatlands by re-sampling the peat stratum in 2009 at the precise locations of quantitative peat mass analyses conducted as part of peatland transect surveys during the 1980s. The old and new profiles were correlated mainly by their ignition residue stratigraphies; at each site we determined a reference level, identifiable in both profiles, and calculated the cumulative dry mass and C inventories above it. Comparison of a total of 37 locations revealed broad variation, from slight increase to marked decrease; on average the 2009 results indicate a loss of 7.4 (SE +/- 2.5) kg m(-2) dry peat mass when compared with the 1980s values. Expressed on an annual basis, the results indicate an average net loss of 150 g C m(-2) year(-1) from the soil of drained forestry peatlands in the central parts of Finland. The C balance appeared not to correlate with site fertility (fertility classes according to original vegetation type), nor with post-drainage timber growth.

AB Pristine peat soils are characterized by large porosity, low density and large water and organic matter contents. Drainage and management practices change peat properties by oxidation, compaction and mineral matter additions. This study examined differences in physical properties (hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, bulk density, porosity, von Post degree of decomposition) in soil profiles of two peatland forests, a cultivated peatland, a peat extraction area and two pristine mires originally within the same peatland area. Soil hydraulic conductivity of the drained sites (median hydraulic conductivities: 3.3 x 10(-5) m/s, 2.9 x 10(-8) m/s and 8.5 x 10(-8) m/s for the forests, the cultivated site and the peat extraction area, respectively) was predicted better by land use option than by soil physical parameters. Detailed physical measurements were accompanied by monitoring of the water levels between drains. The model 'DRAINMOD' was used to assess the hydrology and the rapid fluctuations seen in groundwater depths. Hydraulic conductivity values needed to match the simulation of observed depth to groundwater data were an order of magnitude greater than those determined in field measurements, suggesting that macropore flow was an important pathway at the study sites. The rapid response of depth to groundwater during rainfall events indicated a small effective porosity and this was supported by the small measured values of drainable porosity. This study highlighted the potential role of land use and macropore flow in controlling water table fluctuation and related processes in peat soils.

AB 1. Cut-over peatlands cover large surfaces of high potential value for enhancing biodiversity and carbon sequestration if successfully restored. Unfortunately, evaluation of restoration success is not straightforward. We assessed the bioindicator value of organic matter (OM), testate amoebae (protozoa) and bacteria in peat from two regeneration stages and a reference site of a cut-over bog.
   2. Contrasting biochemical signatures of peat OM were observed along the regenerating profiles, allowing clear differentiation between the newly regenerated peat and the old peat. Where peat macrofossils were absent sugar biomarkers were used to infer peat botanical origin and OM alteration.
   3. Over the succession, the OM composition of the new peat differed. Peat from the more recent stage was dominated by Sphagnum-derived tissues and characterized by lower carbohydrate preservation and higher bacterial biomass than the advanced regeneration stage.
   4. Surface testate amoeba communities also changed from the recent to the advanced stages of regeneration, indicating a shift from wet and moderately acidic conditions to drier and more acidic conditions. Over this regeneration sequence (i) the biomass and average size of species declined but were higher at the unexploited site and (ii) species richness and diversity increased but density declined.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Although secondary succession in the cut-over bog led to an ecosystem similar to that of the reference site in terms of surface vegetation, OM and testate amoebae continued to reflect disturbances associated with peat harvesting. Nevertheless, the described dynamics of both microbial and biochemical variables over the succession showed similarities between the advanced stage and the reference site: a higher testate amoeba diversity was associated with better carbohydrate preservation and a more heterogeneous botanical composition of the peat. The inferred water table depth and pH based on testate amoebae indicators proved to be an alternative approach for assessing restoration processes, in contrast to labour-intensive repeated measurements in the field. The botanical and biochemical composition of peat OM provided additional information on past anthropogenic perturbations of the bog and could be used for restoration monitoring. The combination of several indicators therefore provides a more complete assessment of ecological conditions that could be valuable for the management of cut-over peatlands.

AB Natural mires and forested peatlands are known to be very significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems. Peatland management operations (e.g., forestry operations, restoration of drained mires and peat mining) and extreme hydrological events may increase the DOC runoff. We hypothesized that an increase in phosphorus (P) leaching, together with near-neutral conditions in recipient lakes will accelerate decomposition of DOC that originates from acidic, nutrient-poor mire waters. The efficiency of DOC utilization was evaluated by measuring microbial respiration and bacterial production (BP) in short-term laboratory experiments with runoff waters from six boreal mire sites. Mere inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) addition did not affect the rate of respiration or the proportion of decayed DOC. However, in the nutrient-poor bog waters, P addition slightly promoted BP and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). In contrast, the elevation of pH alone, and the elevation of pH and PO4-P level together, caused a significant increase in respiration and in the proportion of decayed DOC, but did not affect net BP. Elevated pH alone, however, depressed BGE when compared to that under the combined elevation of pH and PO4-P. These results suggest that the increased P availability, e.g., after mire restoration, would slightly benefit bacterial net growth in P-limited waters. However, in near-neutral recipient lakes, the increased microbial decomposition of mire-originated DOC contributes more to carbon dioxide (CO2) supersaturation than potentially supporting detritus-based food chains.

AB Water table depth (WTD) is one of the key variables controlling many processes in peatlands. Reliable WTD estimates based on remote sensing data would advance peatland research from global-scale climate monitoring to field-scale ecosystem management. Here, we evaluate the relationship between ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) C-band backscatter (sigma degrees) and in situ observed WTD dynamics over 17 peatlands in Germany covering deeply-drained to natural conditions, excluding peatlands dominated by forest or inundation periods. The results show increasing sigma degrees with shallower WTD (= wetter conditions), with average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.38 and 0.54 (-) for natural (also including disturbed and rewetted/restored states) and agriculturally-used drained peatlands, respectively. The anomaly correlation further highlights the potential of ASAR backscatter to capture interannual variations with values of 0.33 and 0.43 (-), for natural and drained peatlands. The skill metrics, which are similar to those for evaluations of top soil moisture from C-band over mineral soils, indicate a strong capillary connection between WTD and the ' C-band-sensitive' top 1-2 cm of peat soils, even during dry periods with WTD at around -1 m. Various backscatter processing algorithms were tested without significant differences. The cross-over angle concept for correcting dynamical vegetation effects was tested, but not superior, to constant incidence angle correction.

AB Peatlands encode information about past vegetation dynamics, climate, and microbial processes. Here, we used delta N-15 and delta C-13 patterns from 16 peat profiles to deduce how the biogeochemistry of the Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota responded to environmental and vegetation change over the past similar to 10 000 years. In multiple regression analyses, delta N-15 and delta C-13 correlated strongly with depth, plot location, C/N, %N, and each other. Correlations with %N, %C, C/N, and the other isotope accounted for 80% of variance for delta N-15 and 38% of variance for delta C-13, reflecting N and C losses. In contrast, correlations with depth and topography (hummock or hollow) reflected peatland successional history and climate. Higher delta N-15 in plots closer to uplands may reflect upland-derived DON inputs and accompanying shifts in N dynamics in the lagg drainage area surrounding the bog. The Suess effect (declining delta(CO2)-C-13 since the Industrial Revolution) lowered delta C-13 in recent surficial samples. High delta N-15 from -35 to -55 cm probably indicated the depth of ectomycorrhizal activity after tree colonization of the peatland over the last 400 years, as confirmed by the occasional presence of wood down to -35 cm depth. High delta C-13 at similar to 4000 years BP (-65 to -105 cm) could reflect a transition at that time to slower rates of peat accumulation, when C-13 discrimination during peat decomposition may increase in importance. Low delta C-13 and high delta N-15 at -213 and -225 cm (similar to 8500 years BP) corresponded to a warm period during a sedge-dominated rich fen stage. The above processes appear to be the primary drivers of the observed isotopic patterns, whereas there was no clear evidence for methane dynamics influencing delta C-13 patterns.

AB 1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites.
   3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading.
   4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carer spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pristine peatlands and peatlands drained for agriculture, forestry or peat extraction have been studied intensively. However, few studies have compared GHG emissions from peatlands under different land-use type within the same peatland area. This study examined methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and respiration (CO2) from a peatland complex in northern Finland, including a peatland used for grass cultivation, a Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens dominated forested peatland, a peat-extraction site and a pristine mire. Gas fluxes were measured in 2011 and 2012 with chambers during the snow-free period, and using the snow-gradient method in winter 2012/2013. Soil respiration was highest in the cultivated site (median during growing season 350 mg CO, m(-2) h(-1)), and lower in the forest site and in the peat-extraction site (median for growing season 49 and 130 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The peat-extraction site and the cultivated site were large sources of N2O during the growing season (median 89 and 28 pig m(-2) h(-1), respectively) and during the winter (median 56 and 460 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The pristine site was a large source of CH4 during the growing season (median 0.98 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas CH4 emissions from the drained sites during the growing season were minor. However, during winter, the peat-extraction site and the cultivated site emitted CH4 (median 0.58 and 0.029 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The cultivated site had the highest estimated CO2 equivalent emissions, due to the high CO2 and N2O fluxes, but the peat-extraction site also had large annual emissions, mainly as N2O. The study suggests that rising ground-water level from 60 to 40 cm could potentially mitigate the emissions from the cultivated site.

AB We investigated the within-site distribution of Enchytraeidae, Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata relative to varying water level and substrate quality on pine mire sites forming a drainage succession continuum. Collembolans were most intolerant of wetness, favoring drier locations at all stages of the drainage succession. In general, the effect of water level variation on the within-site distribution of the soil fauna was strongest when the site was at an early stage of either progressive or regressive water level change. When the average water level was below 20 cm, it no longer had a significant effect on the distribution of mites, but still affected that of Enchytraeidae and Collembola. Boron was positively correlated with faunal density in several cases, and thus may be the growth limiting nutrient affecting substrate quality for decomposers in these sites. The overall changes in the soil mesofauna in drained peatlands depicted here show that these peatland forests are converging ecologically on upland forests where decomposition in general is much faster than in pristine peatlands. The change caused by restoration shows how labile these ecosystems are also with respect to the mesofaunal community. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On the basis of the geoinformational system "Peatland ecosystems of Russia", developed at the Institute of Forest Science (Russian Academy of Sciences), and the Map of Forests of Russia (2004), the areas of forest cover on peatlands (139 mln ha) and on paludified shallow-peat lands (230 mln ha) were estimated. Trees are present on 38% of the peatland area, of which more than half (21%) is sparsely treed. Forests (peatland forests) cover only 17% (24 mln ha). The majority of peatlands (over 62%) are open. More than half of the paludified shallow-peat habitats are also open, and the remainder (23 and 24%) are almost equally divided between forested and sparsely forested types.

AB A laboratory column study with peats from four sites from south-central Finland and two sites from blanket peats in the west of Ireland was established to assess the factors contributing to P, N, Fe, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transfer to receiving water courses from restored forestry-drained peatlands. The study indicated that the DOC and Fe release from re-wetted peats are likely governed by the amount of Fe in peat and the degree of Fe reduction upon re-wetting. In contrast to our other hypothesis concerning DOC, high degradability of organic matter was not related to high DOC release. Nitrate release was found to largely cease along with oxygen depletion, but ammonium release was considerable from a site with high nitrification potential before wetting. The release of P from anoxic peat was complicated in the sense that it appeared to be controlled by many factors simultaneously. In the nutrient-poor sites, the P release increased following re-wetting, probably because of their high easily soluble peat P content and low Al and Fe content, resulting in high anoxic P mobilization, but limited re-sorption of the mobilized P. Among the three nutrient-rich sites, there was either no P release upon re-wetting or higher P release than from the nutrient-poor sites. Low risk for P release following re-wetting in nutrient-rich sites was associated with low content in peat of easily soluble P and a high molar Fe/P ratio.

AB In the zone of discontinuous permafrost, the cycling and storage of water within and between wetlands is poorly understood. The presence of intermittent permafrost bodies tends to impede and re-direct the flow of water. In this region, the landscape is characterized by forested peat plateaus that are underlain by permafrost and are interspersed by permafrost-free wetlands. These include channel fens which convey water to the basin outlet through wide, hydraulically rough channels and flat bogs which are typically thought to retain moisture inputs as storage. Field studies conducted at a peatland-dominated landscape near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada, indicate the presence of ephemeral drainage channels that form a cascade of connected bogs that ultimately discharges into a channel fen. Consequently, understanding bogs as dynamic transmitters of surface and subsurface flows, rather than simple storage regions, calls for further examination. Whether bogs act as either storage features or flow through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Here, two adjacent series of bog cascades were gauged over two consecutive years to determine spatial and temporal changes in effective runoff contributing areas. It was found that runoff varies significantly between two adjacent bog cascades with one cascade producing 125mm of runoff over the 2-year period, while the other yielded only 25mm. The bog cascades are primarily active during the snowmelt season when moisture conditions are high; however flows can also be generated in response to large rain events. It is proposed that bog cascades operate under an element threshold concept' whereby in order for water to be transmitted through a bog, the depression storage capacity of that bog must first be satisfied. Our work indicates that whether bogs act as storage features or flow-through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Neglecting to represent connected bogs as dynamic transmission features in the landscape is shown to underestimate water available for streamflow by between 5 and 15%, and these systems are therefore a key component of the water balance in discontinuous permafrost regions.

AB Mapping peatland extent in Canada would contribute important information concerning carbon balance and hydrology. While such mapping, based on air photo interpretation and remote sensing data, has recently improved, maps have been limited to 1:1 million scale. We hypothesized that forest structure information from forest inventory plots could be used to predict the presence of forested and treed peat lands in boreal Canada at the ground plot-level, and that a resulting model could be used to predict the distribution of forested and treed peatlands across Canada. Inventory ground plots from the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) with organic soil depth measurements were used to create a model of the presence of treed to forested (canopy cover ranging from sparse to closed) peatlands (greater than 40 cm organic soil depth) in boreal Canada. The presence of black spruce (Picea mariana) or larch (Larix laricina), in combination with low stand height and stand age greater than 75 years, were the strongest predictors of the presence of peatlands. Bioclimatic variables related to high diurnal and annual temperature variation, consistent with a continental climate, also contributed to the increased predicted presence of treed peatlands. Both logistic and boosted regression tree models showed similar results, with similar to 87% accuracy in the discrimination of treed peatlands when validated against an independent set of ground plots. The boosted regression tree model was propagated across Canada using forest attribute raster data layers at 250 m resolution from the NFI along with bioclimatic layers. Estimates of treed peatland extent agreed with data points from peat cores with 85-95% accuracy in the Boreal Shield ecozone, although prediction was less accurate in the more southern boreal and Great Lakes forest areas. The resulting map can be used as an input to forest carbon modelling, and the improved knowledge of treed peatland extent will be useful in modelling wildfire or peatland drainage.

AB The physical and hydrological properties of peat from seven peatlands in northern Maputaland (South Africa) were investigated and related to the degradation processes of peatlands in different hydrogeomorphic settings. The selected peatlands are representative of typical hydrogeomorphic settings and different stages of human modification from natural to severely degraded. Nineteen transects (141 soil corings in total) were examined in order to describe peat properties typical of the distinct hydrogeomorphic settings. We studied degree of decomposition, organic matter content, bulk density, water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydrophobicity of the peats. From these properties we derived pore size distribution, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum capillary rise. We found that, after drainage, degradation advances faster in peatlands containing wood peat than in peatlands containing radicell peat. Eucalyptus plantations in catchment areas are especially threatening to peatlands in seeps, interdune depressions and unchannelled valley bottoms. All peatlands and their recharge areas require wise management, especially valley-bottom peatlands with swamp forest vegetation. Blocking drainage ditches is indispensable as a first step towards achieving the restoration of drained peatland areas, and further measures may be necessary to enhance the distribution of water. The sensitive swamp forest ecosystems should be given conservation priority.

AB To study the impact of forestry drainage on peat carbon storage, we cored paired quantitative peat samples from undrained and drained sides of an eccentric bog. Five pairs of 0 to <= 100-cm-deep surface-peat cores, and a pair of profiles representing the full peat deposit provided stratigraphic evidence of marked loss of surface peat due to drainage. For the drained side cores, we found a relative subsidence of 25-37 cm of the surface, and a loss of about 10 kg(DW) m(-2), corresponding to 131 +/- 28 g C m(-2) a(-1) (mean +/- SE) for the post-drainage period Similar peat loss was also found in the full deposit profiles, thus lending credibility to the whole-column inventory approach, even though the decrease (9 kg(DW) m(-2)) was relatively small in comparison with the total carbon storage (233 and 224 kg(DW) m(-2) for the undrained and drained sides, respectively).

AB Peatlands form a large carbon (C) pool but their C sink is labile and susceptible to changes in climate and land-use. Some pristine peatlands are forested, and others have the potential: the amount of arboreal vegetation is likely to increase if soil water levels are lowered as a consequence of climate change. On those sites tree litter dynamics may be crucial for the C balance. We studied the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and root litter in boreal peatland sites representing gradients in drainage succession (succession following water level drawdown caused by forest drainage) and soil nutrient level during several years of varying weather conditions. Neither gradient had an unambiguous effect on litter mass loss. Mass loss over 2 years was faster in undrained versus drained sites for both needle litter, incubated in the moss layer, and fine root litter, incubated in 0-10 cm peat layer, suggesting moisture stress in the surface layers of the drained sites limited decomposition. Differences among the drained sites were not consistent. Among years, mass loss correlated positively with precipitation variables, and mostly negatively or not at all with temperature sum. We concluded that a long-term water level drawdown in peatlands does not necessarily enhance decay of fresh organic matter. Instead, the drained site may turn into a 'large hummock-system' where several factors, including litter quality, relative moisture deficiency, higher acidity, lower substrate temperature, and in deeper layers also oxygen deficiency, may interact to constrain organic matter decomposition. Further, the decomposition rates may not vary systematically among sites of different soil nutrient levels following water level drawdown. Our results emphasize the importance of annual weather variations on decomposition rates, and demonstrate that single-period incubation studies incorporate an indeterminable amount of temporal variation.

AB The post-drainage changes in vegetation composition and carbon balance were studied on four site types (from minero- to ombrotrophic conditions) in Lakkasuo mire, central Finland, by directly comparing undrained and drained parts (30 years ago) of the mire. Drainage had drastically changed the species composition of the sites, especially at the minerotrophic sites, where almost all Sphagna had been replaced by forest mosses. On the ombrotrophic sites much of the mire vegetation still remained 30 years after drainage. Drainage had decreased the C stores in ground vegetation on the minerotrophic sites but increased them on the ombrotrophic sites. The changes were, however, very small compared to the changes in the tree stand, where the C stores had increased at all sites (increasing with nutrient level). The change in peat C balance over the 30-year post-drainage period was negative on the most nutrient-rich site, and positive on the others, increasing with lower nutrient levels. The decrease in the peat C balance on the most nutrient-rich site was compensated by the greater increase in the tree stand C stores and the changes in the total C balance (peat+tree stand+ground vegetation) remained positive on all sites.

AB The phosphorus adsorption capacity of 20 peat soils and those soil properties likely to influence it (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, pH, ash content) were studied. Phosphorus adsorption was correlated only weakly to the site type classification of peatlands. However, the P adsorption was strongly correlated with the concentration of Fe in the peat. Thus, soil chemical analysis should be used to support site type classification in order to assess the effectiveness of peatlands to adsorb P. When expressed on a volume basis, the P adsorption capacity varied from 7 kg ha(-1) to 673 kg ha(-1) in the 0-30 cm layer. Compared with the amounts of P used in practical peatland forest fertilization in Finland (40-45 kg ha(-1)), the P adsorption capacity of several peat soils studied was substantially lower. It was thus concluded that slowly soluble P fertilizers or applications <40-45 kg ha(-1) should be used where the P adsorption capacity is low.

AB Succession of woody species on bogs is a process limited by high groundwater table. In the case of drainage, this limiting factor becomes suppressed and succession may accelerate. The aim of the study was to assess the development of tree stands on a raised bog influenced by drainage and wild fire and to assess the dynamics of woody species encroachment. The study was conducted in the 'Brzozowe Bagno kolo Czaplinka' nature reserve in NW Poland, where the originally unforested peat bog was influenced by peat harvesting, drainage and fire over 100 years. The diameter at breast height of tree species and natural regeneration were assessed. Six types of tree stands were distinguished: open bog, bog forest with Pinus sylvestris, early-, mid- and late-successional bog forest with Betula pubescens and pioneer forest with Populus tremula, which occurred in the post-fire sites. After ca 100 years of human activity on an unforested peat bog, dense forest emerged on almost all of the study area. Drainage and wildfire influenced tree stand structure. The course of succession most probably goes from open bog to pine bog forest and early-, mid- and late-successional birch forests. Regeneration of B. pubescens is a crucial phase of woody species succession, because this species creates suitable conditions for growth of late-successional species.

AB A long-term challenge in managing the climate effects of land use is the development of an efficient, comprehensive approach to the identification of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances. The approach would help in establishing robust methods for the cost-effective and climate-friendly targeting of land use options, for example, in peatlands, which are globally important sinks and sources of GHGs. The aims of this study were to create spatial models with the maximum entropy method Maxent so as to 1) identify the environmental variables that control the distribution of GHG sinks and sources in forestry-drained peatlands in Finland and 2) predict the landscape level distribution of GHG balances in two regional mire complex zones (the aapa mire and the raised bog zone). Several environmental datasets were used as sources of explanatory variables. Even though the significance of the explanatory variables were different between mire complex zones, the variables describing habitat conditions, such as drainage intensity and site fertility, contributed most to the models. Drainage intensity describes indirectly the moisture conditions and can thereby be used as a proxy for the water table. The results showed that relatively coarse-scale environmental data (25 ha grid cells) combined with spatial modelling have potential in explaining and predicting GHG balances at the landscape level: To our knowledge, this is the first time that spatial Maxent models have been used to model the distribution of GHG balances.

AB 1 Blanket mire in Northern Ireland is an ecologically threatened habitat in which land use for hand peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture has had a major influence. A recent land use change is the introduction of tractor-powered peat-harvesting. In this paper, the effect of machine peat-cutting on ombrotrophic blanket mire vegetation is assessed from a regional sample of cut and uncut plots.
   2 Principal components analysis identified watertable depth and grazing intensity as major factors influencing the species composition of uncut mire. A key variable affecting the composition of machine-cut mire across the drainage gradient was the number of times cut, with multiple annual cutting causing progressive decreases in acrotelm depth, catotelm bulk density and plant cover. Ericaceous species and Sphagnum spp. were particularly sensitive to cutting, with Eriophorum angustifolium and Campylopus introflexus characteristic of multiple-cut sites.
   3 Redundancy analysis, with number of times cut partialled out, showed that recovery time accounted for a significant amount of variance in vegetation composition. Species that significantly increased in abundance with recovery time were Sphagnum spp., Odontoschisma sphagni, Erica tetralix and Drosera rotundifolia.
   4 Sites cut frequently, or which were grazed, recovered more slowly. Recovery from cutting was partly dependent on the post-cutting structure of the mire surface and the species that survive cutting. The rate of recovery on sites cut once, then abandoned, is relatively rapid compared with multiple-cut sites where species colonization is constrained by bare compacted peat.

AB On a global scale, over the past 200 years peatlands have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Drainage for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction have resulted in a 16-37 per cent loss in the carbon sink capacity. The current scenarios for climate change in Britain will exacerbate this loss. A shift in the carbon balance of peatlands is not necessarily the only outcome of climate change. Indirect hydrological changes-especially alteration of the position of the peat water table-will affect the stability of peatland ecosystems. This raises a number of questions concerning the future of British peatlands: the most important of which is how will the water balance change on a regional scale? In Britain the potential response of peatlands to climate change varies spatially. In upland areas, where rainfall is the main source of water, the key question is will erosion increase and if so, how fast? It will also be important to establish the drainage network response in terms of run-off, sediment loading and stream water quality. Increased precipitation may increase the rate of sedimentation in reservoirs thus affecting their water-holding capacity and water quality. Enhanced decomposition at elevated temperatures may also increase the microbial release of humic acids and increase the incidence of colour in upland waters which will in turn increase the cost of water quality treatment. In lowland Britain, the increased flood risk and more or less permanently elevated water table (as a result of both a rising sea level and sinking land surface) may enable peat regeneration through paludification. Key areas that are likely to be affected have spring or floodwater as their main source of water. They include the Norfolk Broads, Suffolk valley peats, Cambridgeshire Fens, Humberhead Levels, Derwent Ings and possibly the Somerset and Gwent Levels. In order to minimize the effects of climate change on peatlands and to preserve their existing carbon sink capacity (however small) they must remain hydrologically intact, and as high a water table as possible must be maintained. This may be possible in low-lying areas if flooding reinstates paludification but the process of peat regeneration is a slow one. In upland areas the effect of climate change is less clear; increased precipitation may encourage peat formation but it may also result in greater erosion.

AB Information on the variation in soil element concentrations at different spatial scales is needed for, e.g., designing efficient sampling strategies, upscaling the processes related to carbon cycling, and planning land use and management. In spite of intensive land use, such information concerning peat soils is still scarce. We analyzed the variation in peat mineral element concentrations in boreal peatland forests drained 50-60 years earlier. We wanted to quantify the proportions of variation deriving from differences between regions and peatland basins and from within-peatland heterogeneity, and to model the variation using relatively easily measurable site and soil characteristics. We utilized 878 peat samples representing the 0-20 cm layer and collected from 289 sites in 79 peatland basins. The sites represented three different drained peatland forest site types. The two strongest gradients in the element composition captured by principal component analysis were correlated with both the North-South gradient and the site type variation, and the East-West gradient. In general, most of the variation in the element concentrations was contributed by differences among peatland basins, and variation within the floristically determined sites. Most of the element concentrations were best modeled when either the bulk density or the ash content of the peat, or both, were used in addition to site type and geographical location. The explanatory power remained modest for most element concentrations. As for the P concentrations in soil, however, our models provide means for estimating a large part of the variation among drained pine mire sites.

AB Over the past century an ongoing establishment of Scots pine (Pinta sylvestris I.), sometimes at accelerating rates, is noted at three studied Lithuanian peat bogs, namely Kereplis, Rekyva and Aukstumala, all representing different degrees of tree coverage and geographic settings. Present establishment rates seem to depend on tree density on the bog surface and are most significant at sparsely covered sites where about three-fourth of the trees have established since the mid-1990s, whereas the initial establishment in general was during the early to mid-19th century. Three methods were used to detect, compare and describe tree establishment: (1) tree counts in small plots, (2) dendrochronological dating of bog pine trees, and (3) interpretation of aerial photographs and historical maps of the study areas. In combination, the different approaches provide complimentary information but also weigh up each other's drawbacks. Tree counts in plots provided a reasonable overview of age class distributions and enabled capturing of the most recently established trees with ages less than 50 years. The dendrochronological analysis yielded accurate tree ages and a good temporal resolution of long-term changes. Tree establishment and spread interpreted from aerial photographs and historical maps provided a good overview of tree spread and total affected area. It also helped to verify the results obtained with the other methods and an upscaling of findings to the entire peat bogs. The ongoing spread of trees in predominantly undisturbed peat bogs is related to warmer and/or drier climatic conditions, and to a minor degree to land-use changes. Our results therefore provide valuable insights into vegetation changes in peat bogs, also with respect to bog response to ongoing and future climatic changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Greenhouse impact due to different peat fuel utilisation chains in
   Finland - a life-cycle approach
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EMISSIONS; CO2
AB Greenhouse impacts of different peat fuel utilisation chains were studied. A life cycle approach was used in order to cover all important emissions and sinks due to activities linked to the peat fuel production and utilisation. Radiative forcing was used to describe the greenhouse impact, and the results are given per one petajoule of energy produced. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and sinks were considered. Investigated peat production reserves were pristine peatland (fen), forestry-drained peatland, and cultivated (cropland) peatland. The considered phases of the peat utilisation chain included peat fuel production, storage, transport, combustion and the after-treatment of the cut-away peatland. After-treatment alternatives were afforestation and restoration. The greenhouse impact of a considered peat fuel chain was calculated by subtracting the emissions/sinks of a production reserve in a state of non-utilisation from the emissions/sinks of peat utilisation chain. According to the results, the most climate-friendly peat production chain is cultivated peatland-afforestation. Cultivated peatland has large greenhouse gas emissions and these emissions from the land area are ceased by the removal of the peat layer, when the area is utilised for peat fuel production. If forestry-drained peatland or pristine fen is used for peat fuel production, the greenhouse impacts of these chains are of the order of the greenhouse impact of the utilisation chain for coal. Improvement of peat production and combustion methods can be applied to decrease to some extent the greenhouse effect of peat energy.

AB Large peatland areas have been drained for forestry and agricultural purposes, resulting in the decline of characteristic biodiversity. Two measures commonly suggested for restoring drained fens is ditch blocking and tree removal to raise the groundwater table and increase light availability, respectively. In 2002, we initiated factorial restoration experiments, including ditch blocking and tree removal, in three former rich fens that had been drained for forestry purposes. Species cover of vascular plants and bryophytes were monitored during 8 years in permanent plots along transects perpendicular to the ditch for all four treatment combinations. Both methods had positive and independent effects on the cover of wetland vegetation. Specifically, Sphagnum species and wetland bryophytes showed a persistent positive response to both clear cutting and rewetting. Wetland vascular plants and grasses showed a persistent positive response to clear cutting. Sedges and species number responded positively to both clear cutting and ditch blocking, but the response was partly transient, and for species richness the response was limited when restoration methods were applied separately. Rich fen indicators of vascular plants and bryophytes did not respond to any of the restoration treatments. This indicates that species introduction in combination with further habitat restorations may be necessary to re-establish the original rich fen flora. Nevertheless, we conclude that the combination of ditch blocking and clear cutting are effective measures to partly restore wetland vegetation on previously drained and forested fens, while peat subsidence along the ditch may restrict the success further away from ditches.

AB The calcareous substrate of spring-fed fens makes them unique islands of biodiversity, hosting endangered, vulnerable, and protected vascular plants. Hence, spring-fed fens ecosystems require special conservation attention because many of them are destroyed (e.g. drained, forested) and it is extremely difficult or even impossible to restore the unique hydrogeological and geochemical conditions enabling their function. The longterm perspective of paleoecological studies allows indication of former wetland ecosystem states and provides understanding of their development over millennia. To examine the late Holocene dynamics of a calcareous spring-fed fen (Raganu Mire) ecosystem on the Baltic Sea coast (Latvia) in relation to environmental changes, substrate and human activity, we have undertaken high-resolution analyses of plant macrofossils, pollen, mollusc, stable carbon (813C) and oxygen (818O) isotopes combined with radiocarbon dating (AMS) in three coring locations. Our study revealed that peat deposits began accumulating ca. 7000 cal. yr BP and calcareous deposits (tufa) from 1450 cal. yr BP, coinciding with regional hydrological changes. Several fire events occurred between 4000 and 1600 cal. yr BP, which appeared to have had a limited effect on local vegetation. The most significant changes in the forest and peatland ecosystems were at 3200 cal. yr BP associated with a dry climate stage and high fire activity, and then between 1400 and 500 cal. yr BP potentially associated with temperature changes during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age. Hydrological disturbances in the peatland catchment from 1400 cal. yr BP were most likely strengthened by human activity (deforestation) in this region. The relationship between the development of this peatland and changes in its catchment area, such as land cover changes or fluctuations in groundwater levels, suggest that protection and restoration of spring-fed fen ecosystems should also include the surrounding catchment. The presence of calcareous sediments, as well as appropriate temperature and local hydrological conditions appear to be the most crucial factors controlling Cladium marisus populations in our site - currently at the eastern limit of its distribution in Europe.

AB In arctic and sub-arctic environments, mercury (Hg), more specifically toxic methylmercury (MeHg), is of growing concern to local communities because of its accumulation in fish. In these regions, there is particular interest in the potential mobilization of atmospherically deposited Hg sequestered in permafrost that is thawing at unprecedented rates. Permafrost thaw and the resulting ground surface subsidence transforms forested peat plateaus into treeless and permafrost-free thermokarst wetlands where inorganic Hg released from the thawed permafrost and draining from the surrounding peat plateaus may be transformed to MeHg. This study begins to characterize the spatial distribution of MeHg in a peat plateau-thermokarst wetland complex, a feature that prevails throughout the wetland-dominated southern margin of thawing discontinuous permafrost in Canada's Northwest Territories. We measured pore water total Hg, MeHg, dissolved organic matter characteristics and general water chemistry parameters to evaluate the role of permafrost thaw on the pattern of water chemistry. A gradient in vegetation composition, water chemistry and dissolved organic matter characteristics followed a toposequence from the ombrotrophic bogs near the crest of the complex to poor fens at its downslope margins. We found that pore waters in poor fens contained elevated levels of MeHg, and the water draining from these features had dissolved MeHg concentrations 4.5 to 14.5 times higher than the water draining from the bogs. It was determined through analysis of historical aerial images that the poor fens in the toposequence had formed relatively recently (early 1970s) as a result of permafrost thaw. Differences between the fens and bogs are likely to be a result of their differences in groundwater function, and this suggests that permafrost thaw in this landscape can result in hotspots for Hg methylation that are hydrologically connected to downstream ecosystems.

AB Boreal peatlands are an important carbon (C) sink. The effect of drainage for forestry on the soil C balance in those peatlands is a controversial debate. The Lakkasuo peatland, central Finland, comprise a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic part, both partially drained for forestry. A pair-wise comparison was conducted and four different profile-based methods were applied to calculate the soil C balance. The first two methods used differences in ash content (I) between the upper and lower part of the profile and (II) between the drained and natural site of the peatland, respectively. The third method (III) used radiocarbon dated samples to calculate C accumulation rates at the natural site and compared these to the current C-stocks at the drained sites. The fourth method (IV) used radiocarbon dated samples to define a 1000-year layer in the profiles for comparing the C-stocks above this layer. Stable carbon isotope depth profiles, used for a qualitative assessment of the peatland status, identify both undrained site as undisturbed. All four methods indicate a C loss at the minerotrophic drained site but of different magnitude (0.057-0.272 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). At the ombrotrophic drained site both radiocarbon methods (III and IV) indicate a C gain (0.139-0.179 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) whereas methods I and II suggest a C loss (0.084-0.270 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Method IV is considered the most stringent and robust one. Yet, the comparison of profile-based methods for C balance assessment suggests them to be applicable depending on site specific conditions of nutrient status and presence of a natural reference site.

AB Peatlands and forested wetlands can cover a large fraction of the land area and contain a majority of the regional carbon pool in wet northern temperate landscapes. We used the LANDIS-II forest landscape succession model coupled with a model of plant community and soil carbon responses to water table changes to explore the impacts of declining water table on regional carbon pools in a peatland- and wetland-rich landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. Simulations indicated that both biomass accumulation and soil decomposition would increase as a consequence of drying. In peatlands, simulated water table declines of 100 cm led to large increases in biomass as well as short-term increases in soil carbon, whereas declines of 40 cm led to continuous declines in soil carbon and smaller increases in biomass, with the net result being a loss of total carbon. In non-peat wetlands, biomass accumulation outweighed soil carbon loss for both scenarios. Long-term carbon cycle responses were not significantly affected by the time scale of water table decline. In general, peatland carbon storage over the first 50-150 years following drainage was neutral or increasing due to increased plant growth, whereas carbon storage over longer time scales decreased due to soil carbon loss. Although the simplicity of the model limits quantitative interpretation, the results show that plant community responses are essential to understanding the full impact of hydrological change on carbon storage in peatland-rich landscapes, and that measurements over long time scales are necessary to adequately constrain landscape carbon pool responses to declining water table.

AB We describe an ombrotrophic bog profile from Tinovul Mohos, Eastern Carpathians, Romania to quantitatively reconstruct the hydroclimate and the palaeoecological evolution over the past 1000 years. Findings are based on high-resolution analyses of testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, pollen, micro- and macrocharcoal, delta C-13 stable carbon isotopes, organic matter content and bulk density, supported by AMS radiocarbon dating. We identify five major hydroclimatic intervals. Between AD 1050 and 1300, a wet period occurred associated with a time of reduced human population. Between AD 1300 and 1600, wet conditions continued to prevail, but with tendency towards drier mire settings. The third period from AD 1600-1680 revealed two abrupt disturbances in the local hydrology (strong dry-wet shifts). The fourth period, from AD 1680-1950, showed intermediate moist conditions with an increased humidity. After AD 1950, mire conditions became dry and there was an intensification in disturbances activity (forest clearance, fire and peatland drainage). Our multi-proxy reconstruction represents one of the few studies of the hydroclimate and palaeoecological evolution of the last millennium in the central-eastern Europe. Findings show good agreement with other hydroclimate reconstructions from this region, but not with records from north-western Europe. More high-resolution multi-proxy studies are needed to improve our understanding of the feedback mechanisms in peatlands and the factors behind these changes.

AB Four distinct vegetation types are found in close proximity along an exposed section of the southern central coast of British Columbia. A coastal fringe of coniferous forest a few hundred metres wide is separated by a steep ecotone from an inland peatland-forest complex. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the plant communities along the transition from forest to peatland, and (2) to identify some of the major environmental factors associated with those communities using indicator plant analysis. The coastal forest is dominated by Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Picea sitchensis, and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis. Characteristic understory species include Gaultheria shallon and Blechnum spicant. Inland from the coastal forest are transitional forest stands with a species-rich understory including Cornus canadensis, Hylocomium splendens, and Vaccinium parvifolium. The peatlands are poor fens characterized by thickets of Pinus contorta and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis among open areas dominated by species such as Sphagnum sp., Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, and bogs characterized by Myrica gale, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Sanguisorba officinalis. Indicator plant analysis identified differences in the ground surface materials, soil moisture and nutrient regime between the vegetation types. The general trend is for an increase in soil moisture from the forest vegetation to the peatlands and a concurrent change from the Mor humus forms that dominate the coastal forest floor to the surface groundwater table of the peatlands. These environmental differences between forest and peatland are likely related to the steeper slopes typically found in the fringe forest vegetation.

AB There is a limited understanding of the distribution and transport of solutes in the coastal forest-peatland systems of northern British Columbia, Canada. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the sources, concentration and flux of major ions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil-groundwater system of a forest-peatland complex in the coastal western hemlock (CWH) forest zone. DOC dominated the groundwater flux, with most of it exported during high flow conditions. Inorganic ion concentration increased and DOC decreased with ground surface slope and community type from open peatland to bog woodland, bog forest, swamp forest and upland forest. Base cations, HCO3- and DOC in the peatland forest communities differed significantly (P < 0.05) from concentrations in the upland forest. The greatest concentrations of ions derived from mineral weathering were found in the upland forest where the absence of peat, deep mineral soil (85-465 cm) and steep surface slope (26%) combined to increase dissolution by recharging groundwater. NO3-, SO42- and PO43- were at or below detection limits. Concentrations of DOC, metals and HCO3- decreased from summer to spring with dilution by rainfall and decreasing decomposition. In addition to providing novel data in a data-sparse region, this study provides an analysis of the processes controlling runoff production and the transport and transformation of biogeochemical elements impacting stream water quality.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the intensity of nitrogen mineralization in forestry drained ombrotrophic peatland soils in the Stolowe Mountains National Park, SW Poland. Additionally discussion about the shallow organic soils classification according to Polish Soil Classification (2011) is presented. For the study three research transects were established on forestry drained ombrotrophic peatlands in the Stolowe Mountains. Each of the transect consisted of four (site A and B) or five (site C) sampling plots. Sampling was conducted in the year 2012. The soil samples for the basic soil properties analysis were sampled in April, whereas undisturbed soil samples were collected in stainless steel rings (100 cm(3)) every 10 cm in April (spring), July (summer) and October (autumn) to show the seasonal dynamics of nitrogen mineralization. Statistical analysis showed that the content of N-NH4 was mainly determined by actual soil moisture and precipitation rate, whereas the content of N-NO3 was positively correlated with air temperature. Among investigated peatlands the highest concentrations of mineral nitrogen forms was observed in the Dlugie Mokradlo bog, situated on the Skalniak Plateau-summit. Additionally, the results obtained showed that implementation of new subtype: shallow fibric peat soils (in Polish: gleby torfowe fibrowe plytkie) within the type of peat soils (in polish: gleby torfowe) should be considered during developing of the next update of Polish Soil Classification.

AB Drainage and rewetting of peatlands changes their carbon (C) dynamics. We measured C stocks in the soil and biomass of drained and rewetted peatland forests in the region of the National Park Hunsruck-Hochwald, Germany. A detailed soil map was produced, showing the important soil properties for soil C stocks. Based on the horizon-substrate combination as well as LiDAR data, the spatial distribution of soil and forest C stocks was analysed. Our results show that our peatland sites have shallow soils with a heterogeneous spatial distribution. Mean (+/- SE) soil C stocks in the monitoring sites are 121(+/- 8) t ha(-1) whereas the forest stores on average 71(+/- 0.2) t ha(-1) of C in the biomass. Tree removal in the drained peatlands reduced the total C stocks by 4,430 t. The quality and longevity of the wood products that arise from tree removal will determine whether or not the harvested portion of the C captured by the trees is sequestered over long timescales. Additionally, the success of rewetting activities and the potential soil carbon sequestration or (non-) soil carbon loss will determine whether these ecosystems are carbon sinks or sources. An extrapolation of our data resulted in estimated C stocks of 171,530 t and 544,282 t for peatland soils and for the spruce forest, respectively, for the whole area of the National Park (about 10,000 ha).

AB Peatlands offer a series of ecosystem services including carbon storage, biomass production, and climate regulation. Climate change and rapid land use change are degrading peatlands, liberating their stored carbon (C) into the atmosphere. To conserve peatlands and help in realising the Paris Agreement, we need to understand their extent, status, and C stocks. However, current peatland knowledge is vague estimates of global peatland extent ranges from 1 to 4.6 million km(2), and C stock estimates vary between 113 and 612 Pg (or billion tonne C). This uncertainty mostly stems from the coarse spatial scale of global soil maps. In addition, most global peatland estimates are based on rough country inventories and reports that use outdated data. This review shows that digital mapping using field observations combined with remotely-sensed images and statistical models is an avenue to more accurately map peatlands and decrease this knowledge gap. We describe peat mapping experiences from 12 countries or regions and review 90 recent studies on peatland mapping. We found that interest in mapping peat information derived from satellite imageries and other digital mapping technologies is growing. Many studies have delineated peat extent using land cover from remote sensing, ecology, and environmental field studies, but rarely perform validation, and calculating the uncertainty of prediction is rare. This paper then reviews various proximal and remote sensing techniques that can be used to map peatlands. These include geophysical measurements (electromagnetic induction, resistivity measurement, and gamma radiometrics), radar sensing (SRTM, SAR), and optical images (Visible and Infrared). Peatland is better mapped when using more than one covariate, such as optical and radar products using nonlinear machine learning algorithms. The proliferation of satellite data available in an open-access format, availability of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment, and high-performance computing facilities could enhance the way peatlands are mapped. Digital soil mapping allows us to map peat in a cost-effective, objective, and accurate manner. Securing peatlands for the future, and abating their contribution to atmospheric C levels, means digitally mapping them now.

AB Forest expansion (afforestation) is one of the main vegetation changes currently observed in peatlands worldwide in response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. We examined the relationships between plant and bird richness and frequency and extent of the forest cover in bogs of southeastern Quebec to evaluate the impact of forest expansion on typical bog species. A total of 154 plant species and 36 bird species were recorded in the 16 peatlands studied (2-189 ha). Richness and frequency of ombrotrophic plant species were negatively associated with an increase in forest cover. Yet, minerotrophic and minerotrophic-ombrotrophic species did not appear to take advantage of this decline. Afforestation influenced bird species composition by altering the vegetation structure in all strata of the bogs (fewer mosses and shrubs, more trees) and by homogenizing the spatial distribution of plant communities (open patches progressively replaced by forested patches). Peatlands of southeastern Quebec remain islands of boreal vegetation in a matrix of deciduous forests and agricultural fields, but afforestation appears to progressively reduce the diversity of peatland habitats. Afforestation does not imperil plant or bird species across their entire range, but it contributes to impoverishing regional biodiversity.

AB Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) during August 2003 was measured by using eddy covariance above 17 forest and 3 peatland sites along an east-west continental-scale transect in Canada. Measured sites included recently disturbed stands, young forest stands, intermediate-aged conifer stands, mature deciduous stands, mature conifer stands, fens, and an open shrub bog. Diurnal courses of NEP showed strong coherence within the different ecosystem categories. Recently disturbed sites showed the weakest diurnal cycle; and intermediate-aged conifers, the strongest. The western treed fen had a more pronounced diurnal pattern than the eastern shrub bog or the Saskatchewan patterned fen. All but three sites were clearly afternoon C sinks. Ecosystem respiration was highest for the young fire sites. The intermediate-aged conifer sites had the highest maximum NEP (NEPmax) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP(max)), attaining rates that would be consistent with the presence of a strong terrestrial C sink in regions where these types of forest are common. These results support the idea that large-scale C cycle modeling activities would benefit from information on the age-class distribution and disturbance types within larger grid cells. Light use efficiency followed a pattern similar to that of NEPmax and GEP(max). Four of the five recently disturbed sites and all three of the peatland sites had low water use efficiencies.

AB In the UK, the majority of peatlands have been damaged by drainage, agriculture, forestry plantations or erosion, compromising the ecosystem services they deliver including carbon sequestration. On the other hand, since the 1990s many projects have carried out a range of interventions to restore peatlands. In forest-to-bog restoration, tree removal and drain blocking lead to immediately visible changes. However, while some key plant species return within years, they may continue to exhibit differences in how they perform and interact with their environment. To investigate this, plant functional traits were measured and compared for Calluna vulgaris, Erica tetralix, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum papillosum collected in an open blanket bog, a forestry plantation and two forest-to-bog restoration sites in northern Scotland. Significantly lower specific leaf area and chlorophyll content, and higher leaf dry matter content, were found in the open bog site compared with plantation and forest-to-bog sites. This could be related to nutrient enrichment derived from brash and needle decomposition in the latter sites, suggesting a lasting effect of coniferous plantations even after decades of restoration management. Altered plant functional traits may have feedbacks on ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and peat formation.

TI CONIFER PLANTATIONS ON DRAINED PEATLANDS IN BRITAIN - A NET GAIN OR LOSS
   OF CARBON
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTS; TREES; SOILS
AB It is estimated that British peatlands, excluding lowland fens, contain about 3000 million tonnes of carbon, 76 per cent of which is in deep peats (> 45 cm deep) and 9 per cent of which has been drained and planted with trees.
   Undisturbed peatlands emit CH4 but accumulate CO2-derived carbon. The net greenhouse effect may be near zero. Peatland drainage virtually stops methane emission and increases CO2-carbon loss through aerobic decomposition, but can also increase CO2-carbon fixation by the peatland vegetation partly through microbial mineralization of nitrogen, resulting in either a net loss or gain in CO2-carbon.
   Planting conifer forests leads to an accumulation of CO2-derived carbon in the trees, wood products, litter and forest soil up to equilibrium values, totalling about 16.7 kg C m-2 for Picea sitchensis, Yield Class 12. Deep and shallow peats in the British uplands contain about 0.47 and 0.80 kg cm-2 per centimetre depth, respectively. Thus, the 16.7 kg C m-2 that is stored by P. sitchensis (Yield Class 12) is equivalent to the carbon stored in about 35.5 cm of deep peat or 20.9 cm of shallow peat. If forests are planted on peats substantially deeper than this, there could be a net loss of CO2-carbon in the long term.
   Scenarios are presented for the time course of CO2-carbon gain and loss when peatlands are drained and planted with conifers. If CO2 loss rates from drained peats are 50-100 g C m-2 a-1 there is likely to be increased carbon storage in the whole system for at least three rotations; but if CO2 loss rates are 200-300 g C m-2 a-1, increased storage may be restricted to the first rotation, after which there is a net loss of carbon.

AB Forest drainage has been used rather widely to improve tree growth in peatlands in northern and northeastern Europe and some parts of North America. The consequent fundamental change in the vegetation presumably gives rise to a concomitant change in the distribution of nutrients within the ecosystem. We investigated the post-drainage dynamics of soil properties ( top 30-cm) and tree stand biomass on a series of peatlands drained for forestry in Finland to evaluate the sufficiency of soil nutrient pools for production forestry, and the ability of a floristic-ecological peatland site type classification for estimating soil nutrient status. The nutrient dynamics were assessed by comparing the nutrient pools in a large number of peatland sites differing in drainage age. Drainage unambiguously influenced stand biomass and structure and, consequently, the nutrient pool bound in trees. Nevertheless, with the exception of Mg, ditching did not decrease soil nutrient pools over the 75-year observation period. Thus, the soil pools seem sufficient for forest production on these sites. The decreasing trend in the soil Mg pool points on a potential risk in the long run, however. Peat depth and temperature sum were identified as significant sources of variation for the soil nutrient pools. Using soil Ca, K, Fe and N pools, on average 49% of our sites were grouped correctly according to the floristic-ecological site type classification. This classification most successfully described soil nutrient status among the most nutrient-poor sites. We concluded that the floristic-ecological classification of drained peatlands successfully describes their production potential, but not their total nutrient pools in varying thermoclimatic conditions.

AB Forestry drainage is a method used extensively to grow timber in peat soils in Finland. Following drainage, the developing tree stand influences methane (CH,) emissions by altering plant and microbial communities through water-level drawdown, competition for nutrients and shading. Therefore there should be a close correlation between tree stand volume and CH4 fluxes in drained peatlands. We used previously published material along with data collected in this research programme to assess the potential of tree stand volume as a tool for estimating CH4 fluxes for drained peatland forests, and to quantify this relationship under conditions prevailing in Finland. There was a clear negative exponential relationship between tree stand volumes and CH 4 emissions. Sites with small stand volume emitted CH4 after drainage (up to 4 9 CH4 m(-2) a(-1)), while larger stands consumed it (up to 1 g CH4 m (-2) a(-1)); the turning point from source to sink was about 140 m(3) ha(-1). Similar relationships were also found for undrained mires, although not as clearly as for the drained sites. Since drained peatland forests in Finland are generally rather young in drainage age and small in stand volumes, they are still estimated to emit CH 4 to the atmosphere, although the rate has substantially decreased after drainage.

AB This study aims to reconstruct the recent dynamics of two bogs located in an agricultural landscape and to determine which factors favour tree expansion, the most salient change recently reported in treeless peatlands. The vegetation and hydrological dynamics of the bogs as well as land use changes in the vicinity were reconstructed using a combination of paleoecological, paleohydrological, and historical approaches. It was hypothesized that upland deforestation indirectly induced atmospheric mineral dust deposition on sites, thus increasing nutrient availability and triggering forest expansion. Results indicated that a widespread, but asynchronous tree expansion occurred in both bogs during the 20th century. However, no evidence suggesting that nutrient enrichment favoured the phenomenon was found. Forest expansion seems rather to have been favoured by drying of the peat surface, as a decrease of the water table depth coincided with the beginning of the forest encroachment on both sites. This drying correlated with the establishment of an in situ artificial drainage ditch on one site and with agricultural development in the catchment of the other. Local historical factors of each site apparently override regional factors such as climate anomalies or upland deforestation in explaining rapid, abrupt changes in bogs.

AB Peat mining has a serious impact on the Pinus rotundata Link habitat. The possibility of sustaining a vital Pinus rotundata bog forest on undisturbed edges of mined peat bog was assessed. 28.7 ha of undisturbed edge of Borkovicka blata peat bog were sampled by regular grid of circular sample plots. Data about tree layer, natural regeneration of woody species as well as herb layer were collected. The impact of mined area drainage on vegetation communities in the undisturbed edge of peat bogs was discovered. The original Pinus rotundata bog forest is getting older and it is gradually being replaced by forest stands dominated by Picea abies (L.) Karsten, Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh. The character of vegetation changes more rapidly with the increasing vertical distance of the remaining fragment and the mined part. This secondary elevation represents a serious problem in the water regime restoration and consequent revitalisation of the Pinus rotundata bog forest on the undisturbed edge of the mined peat bog.

AB Feat soil from 12 northern peatlands, spanning broad gradients in mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and plant species composition, was incubated in vitro at differing temperature (2, 12, 22 degrees C), aeration (anoxic, oxic), and with or without added glucose to evaluate controls on potential production of CH4 and CO2 (and CH4 consumption). Methane production and CH4 consumption (at 12 degrees C) were significantly higher in open (nonforested) than forested peatlands, and varied as a function of MAT at each site, with maximum CH4 production (>450 nmol g(-1) d(-1)) and minimum CH4 consumption (-0.03 h(-1) g(-1)) at intermediate MAT(i.e., CH4 production <200 nmol g(-1) d(-1) and CH4 consumption -0.06 h(-1) g(-1) at lower and higher MAT). Differences in lignin chemistry of the peat helped explain the variation in CH,cycling: Added glucose stimulated CH4 production bur only in lignin-rich peat. Carbon dioxide production (10-60 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) at 12 degrees C) showed a strong negative relationship with MAT and with the amount and type of lignin in the peat, which increased with decreasing MAT of the site. The results demonstrated complex ways ill which temperature affected production of CH4 and CO2 (and CH4 consumption), attributed to differences in organic chemical composition of peat.

AB Previous studies, conducted at the inception of rewetting degraded peatlands, reported that rewetting increased phosphorus (P) mobilization but long-term effects of rewetting on the soil P status are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize P in the surface and subsurface horizons of long-term drained and rewetted percolation mires, forest, and coastal peatlands and (ii) examine the influence of drainage and rewetting on P speciation and distributions using wet-chemical and advanced spectroscopic analyses. The total P was significantly (p < 0.05) different at the surface horizons. The total concentration of P ranged from 1022 to 2320 mg kg-1 in the surface horizons and decreased by a factor of two to five to the deepest horizons. Results of the chemical, solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) indicated that the major proportions of total P were organic P (Po). In the same peatland types, the relative proportions of Po and stable P fractions were lower in the drained than in the rewetted peatland. The results indicate that long-term rewetting not only locks P in organic matter but also transforms labile P to stable P fractions at the surface horizons of the different peatland types.

AB Impacts of long-term drying and associated vegetation change on anaerobic decomposition, methane production, and pore water composition in peat bogs are poorly documented. To identify some of these impacts, we analyzed peat humification, pore water solutes, in situ and in vitro respiration rates, and Gibbs free energies of methanogenesis in a bog near a drainage ditch established in 1923. We compared drained peat under open bog vegetation and forest with a bog reference site. Drainage and tree growth induced an enrichment in carboxylic, aromatic, and phenolic moieties in the peat. Short-term in vitro respiration rates significantly decreased with humification (R (2) > 0.6, p < 0.01). Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations also attained lower maxima in drained areas. However, near the water table in situ respiration intensified as indicated by steeper increases in DIC and CH4 concentrations than at the reference site, especially under forest. Maximum in situ CO2 production derived from inverse pore water modeling was 10.3 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) (forest) and 6.3 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) (bog) and was one to two orders of magnitude slower than in vitro anaerobic respiration. In the highly decomposed shallow peats under forest, methane production was suppressed and DOC concentration elevated. Raised H-2 concentrations (up to 200 nmol l(-1)) and in situ Gibbs free energies of down to -60 kJ mol(-1) (CH4) suggested an inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by an unidentified factor at these sites. The study documents that several changes in biogeochemical process patterns do occur post-drainage, especially when tree growth is triggered. Most importantly, the establishment of forest on intensely humified peats can lower in situ methane production.

AB In Finland, recycling of wood-ash as a fertilizer has been widely studied in recent decades in peatlands drained for forestry. Wood-ash is reported to promote tree growth without any significant negative impacts on the environment and could, therefore, be a suitable option on cut-away peatlands, which are estimated to increase by 30,000 ha over the next ten years. However, the environmental effects of ash-fertilization on cut-away peatlands or on ground vegetation are not well known. We studied the effects of wood- and peat-ash application on the nutrient content in soil and plants and on the heavy metal content in the vegetation of a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite, or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Both wood- and peat-ash fertilization ensured an adequate level of nutrients for the early establishment and growth of ground vegetation and birch seedlings in a cut-away peatland. Dense pioneer moss cover was important in trapping the heavy metals, such as cadmium, which are present in the ash. Ground vegetation of mosses and herbaceous plants also had a major role in the retention of the nutrients that could otherwise have leached from the open cut-away peatland area during the early stages of afforestation. Both wood- and peat-ash proved to be suitable for the initial fertilization of afforested cut-away peatlands, but in order to guarantee a sufficient long-term potassium supply for tree growth, an application of biotite with the peat-ash is recommended.

AB Northern forests and peatlands are globally significant elements in carbon (C) cycling. Recent research has also highlighted the role of aquatic ecosystems in landscape C budgets. We measured contemporary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange, lateral C transfer (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4), and long-term C accumulation in a peatland-stream-lake-continuum in north boreal Finland. On an annual scale the peatland, a rich fen, was a relatively strong C sink (27 g Cm-2 a(-1)). The stream that traversed through the fen had high CO2 and CH4 effluxes (on average 480 and 12 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively) to the atmosphere, while the small oligotrophic lake was a small C gas source per unit area (15 g C m(-2) a(-1)). A catchment C budget was compiled by supplementing these measured values with literature values for the forests. The aquatic C fluxes equaled similar to 13% of the net C input by the forest and peatlands in the catchment, and the largest component was the downstream transfer of DOC. This study supports the proposition that ignoring the aquatic component would result in an overestimated regional C uptake. The contemporary net C input estimate for the fen, after accounting for the C transfer, was larger than the long-term C accumulation rate based on peat cores (22 versus 6.3-16.0 g C m(-2) a(-1)). This study provides reference values for both the contemporary C exchange and long-term C accumulation history, and the terrestrial-aquatic linkage from the boreal-subarctic ecotone, which is vulnerable to ongoing climatic change.

AB The pollen diagram from the Kobyle Jezioro raised bog, situated in the source area of the Tanew River in the Roztocze region, covers the whole Neoholocene. The deposit thickness ( about 3.5 m) has permitted high resolution pollen, peat (including macrofossils) and lithology analyses. Vegetational and palaeoenvironmental changes in this part of the Roztocze were recorded in pollen spectra and organic deposits. Palynological evidence shows the typical Neoholocene succession, which corresponds with the phenomena described from central Europe: from mixed deciduous forests at the decline of the climatic optimum, through hornbeam- and beech-dominated forests to pine forests. Peat accumulation in the Kobyle Jezioro peat-bog started during increased climatic humidity at the beginning of the Subboreal, and originally a fen peat was formed. Raised bog peat layers make up the uppermost 80 cm of the deposit. Within the fen deposits can be found layers of transitional peat, indicating short-term episodes of water deficiency in the early Subboreal phase (short-term climatic dryness) and towards its end (drainage of the bog resulting from the lowering of the groundwater table in the source area of the Tanew River). The growth of the raised bog started at the beginning of the climate deterioration in the Little Ice Age, and the unstable climatic conditions are reflected in the numerous periodical mineral (aeolian) material supplies in the developing ombrogenic bog. The accumulation of the younger section of transitional and raised peats during the Little Ice Age reflects the local hydrological changes in the source area of the Tanew River.

AB Large areas of northern peatlands have been drained and afforested with conifers in the 20th century. This has led to changes in the hydrology of the peatlands, the quality and quantity of organic matter inputs and soil microbial communities, which are all likely to impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Considerable areas of these forest plantations are undergoing restoration, and our aim was to assess whether contrasting compositions of peat, in conjunction with hydrological changes in a controlled lab experiment, impact on GHG fluxes. We incubated vegetation free cores (at 8 degrees C) from a near-natural bog, restoration sites felled in 1998, 2006, 2012 and a current forest plantation at (a) low water tables, (b) high tables or (c) water tables that were changed from low to high. Results show that peat quality and nutrient availability in the pore water have been altered by the forest plantations, which resulted in dissimilar carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the sites under the same temperature and water table conditions. Higher CO2 fluxes were found in the peat cores from the forest plantations than from sites that have undergone restoration and from the near-natural bog. However, there were few differences in methane (CH4) fluxes from the different sites, indicating that on its own (i.e., in the absence of biotic interactions under field conditions) the effects of forestry on CH4 flux are limited.

AB Postdepositional diagenetic processes and behavior of biogenic and other elements in Holocene peatlands have been studied in Ubinskoe and Sherstobitovo bogs of the Baraba forest-steppe zone. Peat contains relatively high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Pb, Hg, Sb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in the upper part of the two sections and S, N, Ca, and Sr in the middle. Microbially mediated processes in peat affect the behavior of pH and Eh and cycles of biogenic elements. Depth-dependent distribution patterns of microorganisms in the two bogs record active cycles of carbon and nitrogen but limited sulfur exchange. Bog waters have Ca-group bicarbonate major-ion chemistry and high concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu, and Zn, due to low pH. High contents of NH4(+), NO3-, and C-org and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the bog waters are implicit indicators of rapid biochemical decomposition and oxidation of organic matter. The low pH of the water and an oxic environment in peat were favorable for the formation of goethite and hydrogoethite in upper peat layers. The formation of hematite and andhydride may be related with past wild fires. Early diagenetic processes lead to precipitation of authigenic minerals, especially, pyrite or less often siderite, calcite, and kaolinite. Reduced conditions maintained the formation of metallic Ni and intermetallic Ni-Cr nanometer particles, as well as precipitation of amorphous silica upon dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals in upper peat intervals.Y

AB Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were determined for surface peat samples for 78 sites on both undrained and drained pine mires. The oldest areas had been drained 55 years earlier. Generally, the N and P stores in a 0 - 50 cm peat layer increased with increasing drainage age in oligo-ombrotrophic sites, and remained unchanged in meso-oligotrophic sites, even if large quantities were bound up in the increasing tree stand biomasses. This was mainly caused by post-drainage subsidence of the mire surface and the consequent compaction, which increased the peat bulk densities and brought new stores from deeper peat layers into the layer under observation. Measured stand volumes and published values for N and P concentrations of tree stand compartments were used to estimate the amounts of N and P bound up in the tree stands. The estimates of N and P in the tree stands of the oldest drainage areas were considerable (ca. 400 kg N and 40 kg P ha-1 in the meso-oligotrophic and ca. 300 kg N and 30 kg P ha-1 in the oligo-ombrotrophic sites), but were small when compared to the stores in the peat (ca. 10 000 kg N and 400 kg P ha-1 in the meso-oligotrophic and ca. 7000 kg N and 300 kg P ha-1 in the oligo-ombrotrophic sites in the 0-50 cm layer).

ID MOVEMENTS
AB Woodland caribou in northeastern Alberta are relatively sedentary, occur at low densities, and are classed as endangered in Alberta. Increasing encroachment of the forest and petroleum industries into the southern regions of the boreal woodland caribou range has highlighted the need for detailed habitat analysis for this species. We obtained approximately 1000 locations of 47 woodland caribou fitted with very high frequency telemetry collars, providing data on winter habitat use from 1991 to 1994. Telemetry data were combined with digital peatland coverages that best represented lowland habitat diversity. Woodland caribon selected forested fen peatland complexes at both the population and individual spatial scales. Woodland caribou concentrated feeding activity in forested, raised bog islands. The raised bogs provide more xeric substrate for increased lichen biomass, possibly a key factor in their selection during winter. The hypothesized connection between discontinuous permafrost and the maintenance of raised bog islands in terms of caribou forage distribution and availability is discussed.

AB Peatlands accumulate organic matter (OM) under anaerobic conditions. After drainage for forestry or agriculture, microbial respiration and peat oxidation induce OM losses and change the stoichiometry of the remaining organic material. Here, we (i) evaluate whether land use (cropland CL, grassland GL, forest FL, natural peatland NL) is associated with different peat stoichiometry, (ii) study how peat stoichiometry changes with OM content and (iii) infer the fate of nitrogen upon soil degradation. Organic C and soil N were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland degradation. OM contents (CL<GL<FL<NL), H/C, O/C, C/N ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce a progressed state of soil degradation.

AB For the first time, plant macrofossil analysis supported by detailed stratigraphic studies was used to reconstruct peatland development in South Africa. Two peat cores (4.69 and 1.5 m) from two coastal peatlands in KwaZulu-Natal were analysed for carpological macrofossils, wood and macrocharcoal. The first one, Matitimani, is an unchannelled valley bottom peatland (site VB), and the second one, KwaMazambane, an interdune depression peatland (site ID) further up in the same catchment. Radiocarbon dating reveals the peatland initiation at site VB at about 6260 cal. yr BP. Rising sea level and humid climatic conditions during that time coincide with the formation of organic gyttja (dominantly aquatic seeds like Nymphaea sp.). In ca. 4950 cal. yr BP, a change to drier condition took place, revealed by the formation of radicell peat from Cyperaceae, and an increase of fire frequency (macrocharcoal). After ca. 1200 cal. yr BP, peat swamp forest emerged, with Ficus trichopoda, Syzygium cordatum and Voacanga thouarsii forming wood peat. Site ID dates back to ca. 920 cal. yr BP. Its initiation is assumingly related to reduced drainage capacities of the catchment subsequently to the peat formation in Matitimani valley. A steady change from gyttja forming communities (Nymphaea sp.-Eleocharis dulcis) to radicell peat-forming Cyperaceae communities took place. The longterm apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) is higher for site ID (89 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) than for site VB (55 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). Except for the peat swamp forest period, fire occurred frequently at both sites, however less in environments with frequent inundations.

AB Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.

AB Increasing use of wood fuels for energy production in Finland since the 1990s implies that large quantities of the generated ashes will be available for forest fertilization. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of wood ash application on Cs-137 activity concentrations in Scots pine (Anus sylvestris L) needles and certain berries and mushrooms on drained peatlands. The study was based on field experiments carried out on two mires in Finland in 1997-1998. Two different types of wood ash were applied at dosages of 3500, 3700, 10 500 and 11 100 kg ha(-1). Wood ash did not increase Cs-137 activity concentration in plants in the second growing season following application. On the contrary, a decrease in Cs-137 activity concentration was seen in the plants of the ecosystem on drained peatlands. This result is of importance, for instance, when recycling of ash is being planned. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Carbon balance and radiative forcing of Finnish peatlands 1900-2100 -

AB Natural peatlands accumulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). They affect the global climate by binding carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing methane (CH4) to the atmosphere; in contrast fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in natural peatlands are insignificant. Changes in drainage associated with forestry alter these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus the radiative forcing (RF) of peatlands. In this paper, changes in peat and tree stand C stores, GHG fluxes and the consequent RF of Finnish undisturbed and forestry-drained peatlands are estimated for 1900-2100. The C store in peat is estimated at 5.5 Pg in 1950. The rate of C sequestration into peat has increased from 2.2 Tg a(-1) in 1900, when all peatlands were undrained, to 3.6 Tg a(--1) at present, when c . 60% of peatlands have been drained for forestry. The C store in tree stands has increased from 60 to 170 Tg during the 20th century. Methane emissions have decreased from an estimated 1.0-0.5 Tg CH4-C a(-1) , while those of N2O have increased from 0.0003 to 0.005 Tg N-2 O-N a(-1). The altered exchange rates of GHG gases since 1900 have decreased the RF of peatlands in Finland by about 3 mW m(--2) from the predrainage situation. This result contradicts the common hypothesis that drainage results in increased C emissions and therefore increased RF of peatlands. The negative radiative forcing due to drainage is caused by increases in CO2 sequestration in peat (-0.5 mW m(-2)), tree stands and wood products (-0.8 mW m(2) ), decreases in CH4 emissions from peat to the atmosphere (-1.6 mW m(-2)), and only a small increase in N2O emissions (+0.1 mW m(-2) ). Although the calculations presented include many uncertainties, the above results are considered qualitatively reliable and may be expected to be valid also for Scandinavian countries and Russia, where most forestry-drained peatlands occur outside Finland.

AB Northern forested peatlands contain a large pool of terrestrial carbon (C). When drained for forestry, these peatlands may become sources of Cot remain C sinks, depending on site nutrient level, climate, and average water level depth. However, previous studies do not consider the impact of other silvicultural practices on the C dynamics in drained peatlands. Clearfellings cause disturbance in ecosystem C dynamics and might lead to losses of C to the atmosphere. The initial development of C dynamics following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest in Finland was investigated in a 4-year study which included monitoring of ground vegetation development and chamber based measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and heterotrophic peat soil respiration (R-PEAT). NEE measurements showed that the site was mainly a net CO2 source (May-October mean efflux of 1990 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) to the atmosphere during the three measurement seasons after clearfelling. This was caused by decrease in photosynthesizing biomass and by high R-ECO (May-October mean efflux of 2540 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). The recovery of ground vegetation biomass was rather fast. However, during the 3 years after clearfelling its capability to fix carbon could not compensate the high R-ECO, which was mainly caused by excessive amounts of easily decomposable fresh organic matter (dying tree roots, logging residue and dying ground vegetation). Clearfelling slightly decreased the decomposition rates of peat (R-PEAT) (May-October mean efflux of 1130 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) i.e., the oldest and largest C storage of the site, through two mechanisms: R-PEAT in deeper layers was restricted by higher water table level and in surface layers by excessive dryness, which lowered the temperature response of R-PEAT. We conclude that clearfelling strongly affects ecosystem C dynamics but does not affect the peat C storage. The appearance of new tree stand is needed before the ecosystem could act as a C sink again. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low water tables typically found in peatlands during dry summer periods or in the vicinity of drainage ditches may lead to moisture deficiency in porous surface peats. Episodes of drought stress might compromise the growth benefits brought about by lower ground-water levels. We examined the water relations of black spruce (Picea mariana) trees on a natural peatland during relatively wet (1990) and relatively dry (1991) summers. Seasonal patterns of pre-dawn and mid-day shoot water potentials and stomatal conductance were not related to peat water content or to water-table depth. There was no evidence of water stress or osmotic adjustment in sampled trees during wet and dry growing seasons. Our soil moisture data showed that although water-table levels were as low as -66 cm in 1991, water availability in the root zone remained high. Even with the absence of mid-day water stress during the summer of 1991, a 50% reduction in stomatal conductance as compared with the previous year was found. We suggest that signals from the bulk of the roots located in dry peat top layer contributed to the regulation of stomatal conductance.

AB In north-west Europe, large areas of open peatland have been drained and planted with spatially homogenous stands of non-native conifers. The detrimental impact of afforestation on peatland carbon and biodiversity have led to large-scale attempts to restore these landscapes back to their open, tree-less form. The responses of dominant microbial consumers testate amoebae to peatland forest-to-bog restoration are largely unexplored. We studied changes in testate amoebae with forest-to-bog restoration in the largest expanse of blanket bog in the UK and compared testate amoeba communities in relatively undisturbed open bog with forested and forest-to-bog restoration sites. Forested areas contained testate amoeba communities which were functionally different from open bog, characterised by a lack of mixotrophic taxa known to contribute to primary production. Seventeen years after restoration management, the microbial communities in the forest-to-bog sites remained more similar to forested areas than to the open bog community. Our results suggest that afforestation has reduced the trophic level of testate amoeba communities, which are only beginning to recover post-restoration in the wettest areas where Sphagnum has re-colonized. This study also highlights the need to consider a wide-range of reference sites to encompass the natural variability within ombrotrophic blanket bog. We conclude that testate amoebae have the potential to act as functionally-significant bio-indicators in peatlands undergoing forest-to bog restoration.

AB The effect of the water table on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from pear profiles representing boreal peatlands of differing nutrient status was studied in the laboratory. Lowering of the water table in peat monoliths taken from two natural waterlogged peatlands for 14 weeks in a greenhouse at 20 degrees C increased the fluxes of N2O, an effect that was enhanced further by incubation in the dark. Raising of the water table in monoliths from two drained and forested peatlands caused cessation of the N2O fluxes from the drained peats, which had previously been sources of N2O. It is known that N2O fluxes have increased in peatlands drained several decades ago. The results suggest that it is not necessary for the water table to be lowered for several years to change a boreal peatland from a N2O sink to a source of the gas. In addition to the draining of peatlands, climate change can be expected to lower ground water levels during the summertime in the boreal zone, and this could cause marked changes in N2O fluxes from boreal peatlands by enhancing the microbial processes involved in nitrogen transformations.

ID HABITAT; AREA
AB Aim The state of peatlands in eastern Canada is of growing concern. This habitat is in decline due tu urban sprawl, agriculture, forestry, and peat mining. Moreover reduction and fragmentation have led to increasing isolation of remaining peatlands. We determined how bird species distribution in peatlands conforms to expectations drawn from island dynamics. We also determined the factors influencing the occurrence of 10 common peatland bird species, two of which rely mainly on peatlands for nesting in the study region.
   Location We sampled sixty-three peatlands in southern Quebec, Canada, within a landscape characterized by a mosaic of forest stands and farmland.
   Methods We sampled nesting bird populations within peatlands from 4 June to 14 July 1995, using both transect lines and fixed-radius point counts. Each sampled peatland was characterized by area, vegetation structure (microhabitats), and isolation. We used multiple regression to test the relationship between bird species richness, peatland area, heterogeneity, microhabitat richness, and relative isolation, after correction for sampling effort. Relationships between bird species abundances and the variables the environmental variables were investigated with Canonical Correspondence Analyses. We calculated probabilities of occurrence of individual species in peatlands by logistic regression, with the same explanatory variables as mentioned previously.
   Results Bird species richness was mainly explained by microhabitat richness, and to a lesser extent, by sampling effort. By contrast, the occurrence of more than half of the species was mainly explained by peatland microhabitat heterogeneity. Palm warbler Dendroica palmarum (Gmelin) and upland sandpipers Bartramia longicauda (Bechstein) were the only species less frequent in small and isolated peatlands than in other peatlands.
   Main conclusions The results for species richness support both the habitat diversity, and passive sampling hypotheses for patchy distribution of birds. By contrast, results from individual species emphasized the difference between factors affecting total species richness and individual species distribution. The distribution of palm warbler, the only species restricted to peatlands regionally, was consistent with expectations from island dynamics.

AB The organic carbon (C) stocks contained in peat were estimated for a wetland-rich boreal region of the Mackenzie River Basin, Canada, using high-resolution wetland map data, available peat C characteristic and peat depth datasets, and geostatistics. Peatlands cover 32% of the 25 119 km(2) study area, and consist mainly of surface- and/or groundwater-fed treed peatlands. The thickness of peat deposits measured at 203 sites was 2.5 m on average but as deep as 6 m, and highly variable between sites. Peat depths showed little relationship with terrain data within 1 and 5 km, but were spatially autocorrelated, and were generalized using ordinary kriging. Polygon-scale calculations and Monte Carlo simulations yielded a total peat C stock of 982-1025 x 10(12) g C that varied in C mass per unit area between 53 and 165 kg m(-2). This geostatistical approach showed as much as 10% more peat C than calculations using mean depths. We compared this estimate with an overlapping 7868 km(2) portion of an independent peat C stock estimate for western Canada, which revealed similar values for total peatland area, total C stock, and total peat C mass per unit area. However, agreement was poor within similar to 875 km(2) grids owing to inconsistencies in peatland cover and little relationship in peat depth between estimates. The greatest disagreement in mean peat C mass per unit area occurred in grids with the largest peatland cover, owing to the spatial coincidence of large cover and deep peat in our high-resolution assessment. We conclude that total peat C stock estimates in the southern Mackenzie Basin and perhaps in boreal western Canada are likely of reasonable accuracy. However, owing to uncertainties particularly in peat depth, the quality of information regarding the location of these large stocks at scales as wide as several hundreds of square kilometers is presently much more limited.

AB Drainage is known to affect peatland natural hydrology and water quality, but peatland restoration is considered to ameliorate peatland degradation. Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydro climate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (N-tot), total phosphorus(P-tot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher P-tot, N-tot, and DOC than well restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry. Rich fens (median pH 6.2-6.6) showed lower pore water P-tot, Ntot, and DOC than intermediate and poor peats (pH 4.0-4.6) both before and after restoration. Nutrients and DOC in pore water increased in the first year postrestoration but decreased thereafter. The most important variables related to pore water quality were trophic level, peatland class, water table level, and soil and air temperature.

AB Permafrost degradation in the peat-rich southern fringe of the discontinuous permafrost zone is catalysing substantial changes to land cover with expansion of permafrost-free wetlands (bogs and fens) and shrinkage of forest-dominated permafrost peat plateaux. Predicting discharge from headwater basins in this region depends upon understanding and numerically representing the interactions between storage and discharge within and between the major land cover types and how these interactions are changing. To better understand the implications of advanced permafrost thaw-induced land cover change on wetland discharge, with all landscape features capable of contributing to drainage networks, the hydrological behaviour of a channel fen sub-basin in the headwaters of Scotty Creek, Northwest Territories, Canada, dominated by peat plateau-bog complexes, was modelled using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform for the period of 2009 to 2015. The model construction was based on field water balance observations, and performance was deemed adequate when evaluated against measured water balance components. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of progressive permafrost loss on discharge from the sub-basin, in which all units of the sub-basin have the potential to contribute to the drainage network, by incrementally reducing the ratio of wetland to plateau in the modelled sub-basin. Simulated reductions in permafrost extent decreased total annual discharge from the channel fen by 2.5% for every 10% decrease in permafrost area due to increased surface storage capacity, reduced run-off efficiency, and increased landscape evapotranspiration. Runoff ratios for the fen hydrological response unit dropped from 0.54 to 0.48 after the simulated 50% permafrost area loss with a substantial reduction of 0.47 to 0.31 during the snowmelt season. The reduction in peat plateau area resulted in decreased seasonal variability in discharge due to changes in the flow path routing, with amplified low flows associated with small increases in subsurface discharge, and decreased peak discharge with large reductions in surface run-off.

AB Diatoms and other siliceous microfossils were examined from a 386-cm-long pear core, covering the last ca. 7200 yr, from north-central Siberia to gain insights into peatland developmental history, and to explore the potential of diatoms as proxy indicators in arctic pears. Diatom analyses of arctic peatlands are rare, and so one aspect of this study was to examine the sensitivity of diatom taxa in relation to independent paleoindicators already described from this core. Changes in the relative abundances of diatom taxa divided the core into four zones that closely tracked the ontogeny of the peatland from an open water environment (Zone I: benthic, alkaliphilic taxa), followed by fen environments (Zones EI and In; epiphytic, acidophilic taxa), and finally to a better-drained, high-centered bog (Zone IV; aerophilic taxa). In addition to the diatom tars, observations were made on the relative abundances of siliceous protozoan plates, chrysophyte cysts, and phytoliths. Both the diatoms and these other siliceous microfossils appeared to respond to changes in hydrology and moisture, as well as to fire episodes likely triggered by climatic change. This study demonstrates that diatoms and other siliceous microfossils from arctic peat deposits provide an important source of paleoenvironmental information that can strengthen interpretations derived from other commonly used indicators.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands in the boreal region are currently undergoing restoration in order to bring these ecosystems closer to their natural (undrained) state. Drainage affects the methane (CH4) dynamics of a peatland, often changing sites from CH4 sources to sinks. Successful restoration of a peatland would include restoration of not only the surface vegetation and hydrology, but also the microbial populations and thus CH4 dynamics. As a pilot study, CH4 emissions were measured on two pristine, two drained and three restored boreal spruce swamps in southern Finland for one growing season. Restoration was successful in the sense that the water table level in the restored sites was significantly higher than in the drained sites, but it was also slightly higher than in the pristine sites. The restored sites were surprisingly large sources of CH4 (mean emissions of 52.84 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), contrasting with both the pristine (1.51 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) and the drained sites (2.09 mg CH4 m-(2) d(-1)). More research is needed to assess whether the high CH4 emissions observed in this study are representative of restored spruce mires in general.

AB Vertical distributions of total N, P, K, Ca and Mg in a 0-60 cm surface peat layer were studied at 80 pine mire sites in southern Finland. The sites fell into two categories according to the soil nutrient regime: Meso-oligotrophic and oligo-ombrotrophic, and formed a chronosequence from undrained sites to sites drained 55 years ago. A statistically significant drainage age effect on the gravimetric (mg g(-1)) concentration profile forms was detected for all nutrients except K. In oligo-ombrotrophic sites the concentration of N increased following drainage in the topmost layer (0-10 cm) and that of P in all layers. In meso-oligotrophic sites the changes in N and P profiles were obscure. The concentration profiles of K remained clearly surface-enriched in both site type groups, but there was a general drop in the concentration values immediately after drainage. Ca and Mg decreased, especially in the 10-20 and 25-35 cm layers in both site type groups. The volumetric (kg m(-3)) nutrient concentrations clearly reflected the increase in the bulk density of the surface peat occurring after drainage. The compaction of peat had compensated for the effect of the processes removing nutrients from the soil (increased tree stand uptake, leaching); for Ca and Mg to a lesser degree than for the other nutrients. It was concluded that the N, P and K profiles did not show changes that would be likely to affect site productivity, whereas the net loss of Ca and Mg may cause problems in the longer term. As the total K capital of the sites was in general rather small, a disturbance in the biological cycle, such as cutting of the tree stand, may be critical.

AB Managed northern peatlands are an important source of the strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, N2O emissions from these managed peatlands display a high spatial variability, and processes governing N2O production and emissions from these ecosystems are still not well understood. To constrain the factors regulating N2O emissions from managed northern peat soils, we determined a wide set of soil physical and chemical properties of peatlands with different management histories spread across Finland, Sweden and Iceland. We included eleven peatland sites with available in situ N2O flux data, and complemented our analyses with detailed measurements of soil nitrogen (N) cycling processes such as N2O production, gross N mineralization and gross nitrification and, in addition, soil microbial biomass. This study included drained peatlands with different land-use types and management intensities, comprising forested, cultivated or only drained peatlands and afforested or abandoned agricultural peatlands. All selected peatland sites displayed a low soil carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 15-27, traditionally used to predict high N2O emissions. Despite the narrow C/N range, the N2O emissions at our sites varied greatly within and between land-use groups, ranging from 0.03 to 2.38 g N m(-2) y(-1). Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory factors underlying the variability in N2O emissions and show that a low C/N ratio in managed peatlands cannot be used to predict high N2O emissions. Instead, our results demonstrate that higher N2O emissions are linked to higher peat phosphorus (P) and copper (Cu) content, suggesting that low P and Cu concentrations can limit N2O production in peat even with sufficient N availability. While known factors such as soil moisture, oxygen content and the degree of peat humification partially explained the variability in N2O emissions, this study directly links soil P and Cu availability to N2O production processes. The availability of P and especially Cu seemed to promote nitrification activities, thereby increasing N2O production. Our study highlights the link between N2O emissions and soil P and Cu availability and the strong coupling of the soil N and P cycles in peatlands, which is to date severely understudied.

AB A trait-based approach was used to evaluate the restoration success of a moss layer transfer technique on the herbaceous community of a cut-over bog. In order to understand the herbaceous dynamics following restoration, the bog was monitored prior to restoration and biannually over ten subsequent years, in two initial drainage conditions (dry peat fields and wet ditches), and compared to seven undisturbed bogs. Herbaceous community found prior to and in the early stage after restoration were characterized by species associated to mesic soil conditions with a fen-like pH, ruderal or wetland species, species with mycorrhiza or exotic species. These species did not persist in the latter stage after restoration and were replaced by species that are carnivorous, are associated to variable water availability and show mostly sexual reproduction. The extent of changes in traits composition of the herbaceous community between the early and latter stages after restoration showed the importance of multiple-year monitoring to evaluate restoration projects. The trait composition found in the latter stage after restoration appeared to converge toward the reference ecosystem where the community was characterized by species with large seeds, associated to humid soil conditions and a forest or peatland habitat. Lower trait diversity was found in the latter stage after restoration than in the reference ecosystem, especially in peat fields. In addition, species and functional diversity pattern varied with the initial drainage conditions, decreasing in peat fields while remaining stable in ditches. This suggests that different initial topography for restoration might help increase species and functional diversity of a managed ecosystem. Finally, our results outline measures to improve the moss layer transfer technique: sowing herbaceous species with large seeds in the latter stage after restoration, applying the restoration technique as soon as exploitation has terminated or removing all vegetation (including seeds and rhizomes) from the site to be restored.

AB Calibration period and control area method were used to study the impact of forest tree harvesting on the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from drained peatland forests using data from 17 harvested and five control catchments. The results indicated highly increased DOC exports; during the first 3 years following harvesting, the average extra export ranged from over 200 kg ha(-1) in nutrient-poor ombrotrophic to over 400 kg ha(-1) in fertile minerotrophic peatland forest sites. The results indicated that a high iron (Fe) content in peat, as well as a high nitrogen (N) content and a low carbon (C) N ratio, are the site characteristics that contribute to large harvest-induced DOC exports. The effect of Fe is probably caused by the reduction of Fe in previously aerobic peat layers that have undergone harvest-induced water level rise and thus enhanced the DOC export, and the effects of the peat N and CN ratio indicate that the impacts of harvesting on DOC are the greatest from the sites with a high overall microbial activity. The calibration period/control area analysis revealed a high uncertainty in our data, the 95 % confidence intervals for average DOC exports overlapping between the groups with differing site characteristics. Given the uncertainties involved in our data, we conclude that significant changes in water colour and other water characteristics associated with large DOC inputs may be expected, where harvested forests on peatlands cover large proportions of catchments of small lakes and rivers.

AB Sites (n = 119) on drained mires located in the southern aapa mire zone in Finland were analysed by multivariate techniques. The compositional trends of the understorey vegetation were analysed by means of hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS). In addition to field classification, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and flexible unweighted paired group arithmetic average (FUPGMA) classifications were used.
   The 1st HMDS dimension primarily reflected variation along a gradient from spruce mire influence to hummock-level bog influence. Variation in nutrient status was also connected to this gradient. Factors underlying the 2nd dimension were variation in nutrient status and drainage succession (moisture). Some sample plots representing herb-rich or Molinia-rich types were separated along the 3rd dimension. The variation in understorey vegetation (i.e. the ordination space) showed high maximum correlation with stand volume r = 0.81, mean annual stand volume increment r = 0.76, and post-drainage dominant height r = 0.75. The covariation between the vegetation and peat bulk density in both the 0-10 and 10-20 cm peat layers was also strong: r = 0.55 and r = 0.80. The correlations for H-vpost were 0.64 and 0.81, respectively. Of the total macronutrient concentrations, phosphorus (r = 0.73, r = 0.75) and nitrogen (r = 0.59, r = 0.64) were the most strongly correlated with species composition. The environmental sample variables were also presented by the vegetation units of numerical classification. Most of the recorded variables, including nutrient amounts (kg ha(-1)), were examined in site quality (fertility) classes by succession phases as well. Border variants or transitional forms of the site types were common. Additional vegetation criteria (e.g. surface-water influence) more closely defined the ecology of the site. In addition to the site quality classes, a considerable amount of information about the tree stands, vegetation diversity and peat properties was associated with the separation of the succession phases, i.e. in this study transforming (phase II) vs. transformed (final phase III) sites. In conclusion, the actual vegetation appeared to well reflect various aspects of the ecological conditions, even in labile communities of commercial forests on drained peatlands.

AB An imbalanced nutrient status in Scots pine stands on drained mires is primarily a consequence of excess nitrogen (N) in relation to mineral nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). In this study, the variation of foliar N, P, and K concentrations relative to some site and environmental characteristics was examined. Foliar nutrient concentrations were determined on needle samples collected from mires representing different drainage ages, site types, geographical locations and annual weather conditions. In the overall data (n = 971 samples in 333 stands) the foliar N concentration varied between 6.7 and 24.2 mg g(-1), the P concentration between 0.83 and 2.32 mg g(-1), and the K concentration between 2.22 and 6.23 mg g(-1). The original (pre-drainage) mire site type proved to be an important factor in explaining the nutrient status of the trees: on originally forested sites, the nutrient balance (N versus K; N versus P) was mostly adequate, whereas on sparsely forested and treeless sites, K deficiency was common. N deficiency was the most common in forested 'nitrogen-poor' sites, while P and K deficiencies were more common in originally treeless or sparsely forested 'nitrogen rich' sites, where the nutrient imbalance was also the greatest. Over the whole data, 29% of the cases were diagnosed to be N-deficient, 51% P-deficient, and 25% K-deficient. The foliar N concentration increased with increasing temperature sum. The foliar K concentration decreased with increasing depth of the peat layer. On former treeless or sparsely forested sites, foliar K decreased slightly with increasing drainage age. In contrast, on thin-peated sites the foliar P concentration increased with increasing drainage age. The climate conditions (location), the original site type of the mire and peat thickness should be taken into account when planning silvicultural measures on mires drained for forestry.

AB Restoration of damaged ecosystems has become an important tool to slow down biodiversity loss and to maintain ecosystem services. Peatland bird populations have shown a substantial decline during the recent decades in Northern Europe as a consequence of peatland drainage. We studied whether restoration of peatlands drained for forestry affects bird communities. We conducted bird surveys at 11 peatlands in Western Finland, where each of the restored and their pristine counterparts were surveyed before restoration and yearly after restoration during 2010-2018. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze whether restoration affected the number of species and territories of peatland specialist and non-specialist species and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the change in community composition. Drained parts of the peatlands had higher number of territories of non-specialist species before restoration, and restoration seemed to decrease these numbers towards the level of pristine parts. By contrast, restoration did not affect the number of peatland specialists and their territories, which was lower in drained than in pristine parts of the peatlands. Bird communities in restored parts remained different from pristine parts in terms of community composition after restoration. Thus, despite the effect of restoration on non-specialists, a substantially long time may be required for a recovery of the peatland bird communities. Based on our results, it seems that long-term monitoring of the restored and pristine peatlands is needed to determine whether restoration is effective in recovering the peatland specialist bird species and bird communities in general.

AB Northwestern Canada's discontinuous permafrost landscape is transitioning rapidly due to permafrost thaw, with the conversion of elevated, forested peat plateaus to low-lying, treeless wetlands. Increasing hydrological connectivity leads to partial drainage of previously-isolated bogs, which have been observed to subsequently develop hummock microtopography. However, the role of microtopographic features in the future trajectory of the transitioning landscape is unclear, including their potential controls on tree re-establishment. In order to understand the role of hummocks in landscape change, research was conducted at the Scotty Creek Research Station, Northwest Territories, to measure hummock and black spruce tree physical characteristics, and assess tree and hummock spatial coverage in peat plateaus, collapse scar bogs and the advanced transitional feature known as treed bogs. Canopy coverage in all landforms and wetland hummock areal coverage was assessed using a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) canopy gap fraction model and multispectral imagery. Hummocks, which are not underlain by permafrost but contain seasonal ice, support the establishment of black spruce trees due to favourable soil moisture conditions. Hummock flank moisture in treed bogs is intermediate between those of dry peat plateaus and inundated collapse scar bogs. Black spruce trees on peat plateaus and in treed bogs are significantly taller and of greater circumference than those in collapse scar bogs. The spatial distribution of hummocks and canopy coverage of black spruce trees in treed bogs collectively suggest that these features may play an important role in the advanced stages of permafrost thaw-driven transition of the discontinuous permafrost landscape.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes from fixed sample plots in a minerotrophic fen and an ombrotrophic bog in southern Finland were measured by using a static chamber technique 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment. Methane emissions rose with rising water table after rewetting from 0.1 to 2.1 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the fen site and from 0.8 to 4.6 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the bag site remained at a lower level than emissions from similar pristine site types. At the fen site the emissions were related to the short-term succession of cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). Emissions showed high spatial and temporal variation with high emission peaks at the bog site. Temporal fluctuation of the emissions during the measurement season (from the end of May to the end of September) was correlated with pear temperature, while the seasonal fluxes were dependent on the moisture conditions in different microsites.

AB This investigation focuses on the development and nutrient status of the first Sitka spruce and Norway spruce stands established on milled cutaway peatlands in Ireland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Phosphatic fertilization at planting is critical for the establishment of trees on cutaway peatlands but may not be sufficient to see the stands close canopy. Results from this study indicate the likely demand for P and N fertilizer during the rotation of these plantations. During the ten-year-study period (1994-2004), the nutrient status of both Norway and Sitka spruce stands deteriorated with the passage of time. Twenty-seven out of the twenty-eight examined stands became P deficient before 10 years old and half of the plots were N deficient within 13 to 15 years. Sitka spruce stands became N and P deficient earlier than Norway spruce. Regardless of species, tree stands growing on Sphagnum peat entered the critical N deficiency threshold sooner and were all severely deficient by 2004 compared to 22% of the trees growing on Phragmites peat. The effects of aerial re-fertilization were also site specific and although P deficiency was cured, the trees were likely to suffer from nutrient imbalance (N and Cu especially). These results demand a change of standard fertilization practices, which should be related more specifically to peat type and species requirements. Peat type identification and foliar analysis monitoring should become standard management tools while the long-term continuous monitoring of these new forests would be very valuable throughout their first rotation.

DE ombrotrophic; mire; conservation; hydrology; grazing
ID GREAT-BRITAIN; PEAT
AB The vegetation, physical characteristics and conservation value of mires (peatlands) within Kielder Forest, northern England, are described. A review of the options available for their conservation management examines the effects of changes in the water table, the impact of grazing livestock and changes brought about by neighbouring conifer plantations.
   These raised and blanket mires vary in size from 0.6 to 69.6 ha, and are dominated by ombrotrophic vegetation. Their main conservation value lies in their 'naturalness', which arises from the extensive nature of locally used stock grazing systems and the intrinsic difficulty of draining mires that lie in depressions and experience an upland climate. Such sites are rare and contain uncommon plants and invertebrates, whilst collectively these mires exhibit considerable topographical and hydrological variety,
   A review of the hydrological effects of conifer plantations on mire catchments concludes that the catchments probably have little, if any, influence on the mires themselves. Management of water flow on the mires has the objective of reducing the rate of discharge of precipitation from them by damming agricultural and forestry drainage channels.
   A review of the role of livestock grazing concludes that there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is required to maintain the mire plant communities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that its impact is minimal on vegetation over deep peat, and probably most influential on vegetation over shallower peat at mire margins.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% the global land area, but store about twice as much carbon as global forest biomass. If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO(2)emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 degrees C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO(2)throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protectionandrestoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.

AB A comparison of the tree-ring width of pines growing in areas adjacent to a peat bog and on a Baltic raised bog dome suggests that cambium activity in each tree group is affected by different factors. The study was aimed at pinpointing effects of meteorological factors on two pine populations growing under different hydrological conditions. The study further sought to identify periods during which anthropogenic pressure affected the two populations. The pines growing on mineral soil were characterised by ring-width growth-climate responses typical of this part of Europe, whereas the tree-ring growth of the pines growing on the peat bog showed no unequivocal relationship with meteorological conditions. The tree-ring width growth dynamics of that population responded primarily to changes in the level of the groundwater table. These changes were associated with human activities over the last two centuries. The development of the tree stands on the peat bog and in its immediate vicinity was reconstructed using this assumption and available historical evidence. A banding drainage ditch dug around 1880 resulted in the drying of the peat bog, the introduction of pines, and the forestation of the bog. Digging of central ditches (in the 1960s) resulted in periodic desiccation of the bog surface and reduction of the tree-ring widths; similar responses were observed in the 1980s as a consequence of the deepening and opening of the drainage ditches. The recent years are characterised by decreasing ring-width growth as a result of the damming of drainage ditches. Damming resulted in an increase of the groundwater table level in the bog and in a partial inundation of tree roots. This partial inundation interfered with gas exchange and adversely affected the health status of the pines studied. Our results allow conclusions to be drawn regarding peat bog palaeohydrology and facilitate absolute dating of changes associated with anthropogenic transformations. In active nature protection, such data are of key importance for understanding the functioning of a peatland and for planning active conservation measures.

AB The tree population size structure and relationship between tree diameter and age were examined in a subalpine fen and surrounding Picea-Abies forest in northern Colorado. The fen, grades from a sedge fen, through an ecotone, to a treed fen (i.e. fen colonized by trees). Tree growth rate varies across the vegetational gradient, with the sedge fen having the slowest growth, and the upland forest having the fastest growth. Differences in growth rate are related to the average size of pest hummocks, with areas containing tall hummocks exhibiting the highest tree growth rates. Size structures display the characteristic reverse-J distribution generally indicative of stable populations, but forest vegetation is expanding into the open regions of the fen, and within the treed fen an increase in Abies lasiocarpa is occurring. These changes are primarily attributed to a positive feedback situation wherein the fen's surface is built up by peat accumulation. Distinct hummocks form first on the open fen but then coalesce to form raised peat islands in the treed fen. This new substrate provides habitat with a comparatively low water table and allows the growth of mesophytic forest vegetation. A pathway for this vegetational development is proposed.

AB The concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, Al, Cu, Zn, Mo, Pb, Cr and Cd were determined for surface peat samples for 80 sites on both undrained and drained pine mires in Finland. The oldest areas had been drained 55 years earlier. Although the gravimetric concentrations of many elements tend to decrease with increasing drainage age, the stores in the 0-50 cm peat layer do not change much along the drainage age gradient. This is possible because compaction of peat takes place after drainage, and, consequently, the 0-50 cm layer in the drained plots includes peat that was below the 50 cm limit before the sites were drained. The fact that elements are removed from soil by uptake by tree stands and by leaching is thus indicated by the decreasing, or unchanging, gravimetric concentrations only.

AB Large areas of naturally open peatland in western Europe were drained and planted with non-native conifers in the twentieth century. Efforts arc currently underway to restore many of these sites. Ultimately, forest-to-bog restoration aims to bring back functional peatlands that can sequester carbon but there is a lack of empirical evidence for whether current approaches are effective. Using a chronosequence design, we compared the annual gaseous carbon balance of two forest-to-bog restoration areas with an open area not subject to afforestation. A closed chamber method was used to determine gas fluxes (Net Ecosystem Respiration, Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4)) over a twelve-month period for locations spanning the range of peatland microtopography and vegetation communities. Relationships between gas fluxes, vegetation/ cover and environmental factors were analysed and regression models used to estimate annual CO2 and CH4 budgets. During the study period, NEE estimates (total gaseous C expressed as CO2-eq) showed a net sink for the unafforested (-102 g C M-2 yr(-1)) and oldest ( -131 g C M-2 yr(-1)) restoration area (17 years post-restoration 'RES 17 YRS'), whilst the youngest restoration area (6 years post-restoration 'RES 6YRS'), was a net source (35 g C m(-2) yr (-1)). We observed significantly higher CH4 emissions from restoration areas dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium compared with other peatland vegetation types. Sampling points with higher cover of Sphagnum were found to be most effective for C sequestration. Overall, vegetation composition/cover was observed to be an important factor determining C emissions from forest-to-bog restoration areas. These results suggest that restoration is effective in returning the carbon sink function of peatlands damaged by commercial forestry and - depending on restoration techniques - timescales of >10 years may be required.

AB In the twentieth century, there have been increases in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) coverage on peatlands in southern Sweden. In order to assess possible links to contemporary climate change; aerial photograph analysis and dendrochronology were combined to study recent pine cover changes at Anebymossen, a raised peat bog in south central Sweden. Multi-temporal analyses of three sets of panchromatic images from 1950 to 1993 showed a 30% increase of the marginal pine forest of the raised bog during that time, where a significant increase had occurred in the eastern part. Dendrochronological analyses were performed in two parts: the eastern part and the western part where the increase in pine coverage was considerably lower. The tree-ring growth patterns disclosed that a major event, most likely drainage, had occurred at Anebymossen in 1927, affecting tree growth at both sites. The effect of the drainage, which lowers the local ground-water table and hence promotes tree growth, was growth surges with a doubling of the annual increment rates. The effect was short lived in the western part, but continuous drainage in the eastern part caused growth enhancement until the beginning of the 1980s. We suggest that rather than being caused by climate change, the increase in pine coverage on Anebymossen was initiated by the considerable drainage in 1927. Since most peatlands in southern Sweden have been affected by anthropogenic activities, we suggest that it is difficult to make climatological interpretations of tree cover changes on peatlands using only aerial photograph analyses.

AB The results of dendrochronological and palynological analyses of subfossil pine trees occurring in the peat deposits of the Pugcizna Wielka raised bog (Polish Carpathians, Southern Poland) - the only site with numerous subfossil pine trees in the mountainous regions of Central Europe presently known - indicate that the majority of the tree populations grew in the peat bog during the periods ca 5415-3940 cal BP and 3050-2560 cal BP. Several forestless episodes, dated to 5245-5155 cal BP, 4525-4395 cal BP and 3940-3050 cal BP, were preceded by tree dying-off phases caused by an extreme periodical increase in humidity and general climate cooling trends. These events are documented based on analyses of pollen and non-pollen palynomorph assemblages, dendrochronological analyses of the trees, as well as numerous radiocarbon datings of the sediment horizons occurring within the peat bog profile. The phases of germinations, and, in turn, of tree and shrub invasions of the peat bog areas have been closely connected to drying and occasional warming of the regional climate. The last of the forestless periods began about 2600 years ago and continued up to the very recent times. Currently, as a result of desiccation of the peat bog and the lowering of the groundwater level (due to improved water drainage system), pine trees have returned the peat bog again. These results demonstrate that studies of subfossil bog-pine trees are quite effective in documenting and reconstructing periods of humidity fluctuation that occurred within the Carpathian region over the last several millennia.

AB This paper summarises the results of several research groups participating in the research programme "Greenhouse Impacts of the use of Peat and Peatlands in Finland", and presents emission factors for peat-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, filling gaps in knowledge concerning the afforestation of organic croplands and cutaways, and improves the emission assessment of peatlands drained for forestry. Forest drainage may result in net binding of soil carbon or net release, depending on site characteristics and the tree stand. Use of peatlands for agriculture (48-4821 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)), even after the cultivation has ceased, or for milled peat harvesting (1948-2478 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)) can cause the highest overall emissions. Extremely high CO2 emissions are possible from peat harvesting areas during wet and warm summers. Afforestation of those peatlands abandoned from cultivation or peat harvesting can reduce the warming impact at least during the first tree generation. Heterotrophic soil respiration may have a systematic south-north difference in temperature response. More data must be collected before the information on peatland forest soil CO 2 emissions can be adapted for different climatic regions in Finland. A test of the model DNDC against measured data showed that DNDC has to be developed further before it can be used in estimating N2O emissions from boreal peatlands.

AB We studied the biomass production of moss species typical of pine-dominated drained peatland forests to evaluate their potential role in the carbon cycle of such sites. The study was carried out at two sites in Lakkasuo, central Finland. Prior to drainage, the sites had been mesotrophic and ombrotrophic. Shoots of Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium, S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. russowii were marked in the autumn of 2004 and 2005, incorporated back in the original patches, recovered one year later, and measured for height growth, biomass, and biomass production. Biomass production varied from 16 to 388 g dry mass m(-2) yr(-1). Both height growth and biomass production were higher at the mesotrophic site, while biomass estimates did not show distinct difference between sites. Variation in production within each dominant species was considerable. A simulation with our production values and published estimates of decomposition rates showed that these species have the potential to contribute significantly to soil carbon storage in drained peatlands.

AB Peatlands, including those transformed by economic activities (drainage for forestry and agriculture, peat extraction), belong to various land categories. There is no general system for their inventory and accounting. Remote sensing methodology based on high-resolution space imagery is proposed and applied for mapping peatlands of different types and states based on the example of Moscow oblast. The methodology can be used to solve scientific and practical tasks that require the development of a regional peatland geoin-formation system (GIS) using a common base map. The total area of peatlands and peatbogs is shown to surpass 6% of the oblast territory.

ID EMISSION; PEATLANDS; PEAT; CONSUMPTION; MINNESOTA; FIELDS
AB Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from two Scottish peat soils and two Japanese paddy soils were compared. During aerobic incubation, CH4 uptake occurred with the peat soils showing a slightly higher activity than the paddy soils. Temperature exerted a marked effect on CO2 production but had a negligible effect on CH, uptake rate except at 30 degrees C where two soils showed a slight emission of CH4. At 10 and 20 degrees C, the mean first order uptake rate constant for all soils was 0.19 d(-1). With anaerobic incubation, CO2 production decreased while CH4 emission was promoted. The highest production (ng CH4-C g(-1) fresh wt. soil over 7 d) originated from the indigenous bog peat (4,500) while that from the other peat soil (10), from an area of drained and forested bog, was less than the production from either paddy soils (290 and 140). The proportion of carbon emitted as CH4 reached 11% for the bog pear, 1% for the paddy soils but only 0.02% for the forest peat. Though organic matter levels played some role in CH4 emission, the population level of methanogens determined by previous land use was thought to be the major factor controlling this process. Hence, greater differences, particularly for CH4 emission, were found between the two peat soils as a result of previous flooding history than was found between the peat and paddy soils.

ID ACIDS
AB Peat and various peat preparations have been successfully used in balneology. When considering the biological effects of peat, humic substances have been found to be of particular importance. The content of humic, hymatomelanic and fulvic acids as well as main characteristics of peat were measured in three areas with balneological potential, selected according to previous research and mapping of Estonian peatlands. It appeared that the content of bioactive substances in the sampled peat layers was relatively high. The concentrations were highest in the Parika peatland: humic acids 39.3%, hymatomelanic acids 19.3% and fulvic acids 1.3%. The main factors influencing the levels of bioactive substances were the degree on humification (more humified peat had higher concentrations) and peat type (forest(pine)-cottongrass composition increased the concentration levels). As lipids had high correlation with hymatomelanic acids and trace elements with fulvic acids, the mentioned components could be respectively bound to these humic substances.

AB A description of bog pine stands (Pinus uncinata Ramond var. rotundata (Link) Antoine) on uncut oligotrophic mires affected by drainage and nearby peat cuttings at three sites of the Jura Mountains (Switzerland) is given. In all sites, three situations were chosen: (i) central parts of the bogs, (ii) surfaces near cutting walls and bog margins, and (iii) intermediate situations. Population structures were characteristic for each situation. In the open and wet central parts of the bogs, trees were scattered, small, and uneven aged. In the intermediate situations, tree density was higher, and the stand was multilayered with taller and uneven-aged individuals. Near the edges of the bogs or close to the peat cutting walls, the trees were tall, even-aged, and younger with a high growth rate. The nonsynchronous colonization of the bog pine trees on the three sites indicates that local factors such as drainage and peat cuttings in the vicinity of the uncut surfaces were more influential than climate factors. Radial growth patterns, very similar between the sites and the various pinewood stands, and the numerous common pointer years reflect local and regional climate fluctuations. The pinewood development on uncut bogs in the Jura Mountains thus represents a recent dynamics, which is strongly linked to human activities.

AB Northern peatlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle as they help regulate local, regional and global C budgets through high atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake and low net CO2 losses to the atmosphere. Since the 1900s (but particularly the 1950s) land-use change has affected many peatland areas, driven in part by attempts to improve their commercial value. During this period, many peatlands in the UK were drained and planted with non-native conifer plantations. Efforts are now underway to restore the ecosystem functioning of these peatlands to those characteristic of pristine peatlands, in particular C flux dynamics. A lack of ecosystem level measurements means that the timescales of restoration and the degree to which they are successful remains poorly determined. In this research, we present the first year-round study of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) from peatlands undergoing restoration from forestry. Annual NEE was measured from two sites between March 2014 and June 2015, where restoration commenced 10 years and 16 years prior to the start of this study, and the results were then compared to existing measurements from a near-pristine peatland. Existing NEE data (expressed as CO2-C) from the near-pristine peatland indicated a C sink of 114 g m(-2) yr(-1), and our estimates suggest that the older restored site (16 years) was also a NEE sink (71 g m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the younger site (10 years) was a NEE source (80 g m(-2) yr(-1)). We critically assess the confidence of these measurements and also present these data in relation to other northern hemisphere peatlands to better understand the timeframe in which a peatland site can turn from a C source to a C sink after restoration.

AB Using the characteristic of accumulated woody debris, data on vegetation, and data on previous climate fluctuations, we reconstructed the history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) encroachment and retreat in a raised bog. The available patchy information on plant cover allowed us to pinpoint events in the development of pine seedlings and the first cases of trees dying off on the time scale. The results obtained show that the process of natural bog afforestation and deforestation was very dynamic and lasted only 22 years. These short-term changes in the tree populations were clearly linked to short-term climate fluctuations. The annual precipitation and mean temperature of winter months were the most important variables and the main factors directly influencing the young woodland. We assumed that the woody remnants represent the last stage of the contemporary phase of high germination and dying-off (GDO) of pine trees. The spatial distribution of woody debris and its characteristics indicate the naturalness of vegetation during this temporary 'woodland phase'.
   The study show that the investigation of woody debris can be used to further improve our understanding of bog vegetation dynamics, especially with regard to the influence of periodical climate fluctuations on transitions between open and forested peatland.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands occupy approximately 15 million ha in boreal and temperate zones. In Finland, they represent almost one-fourth of the total forest area. They are subjected to the same harvesting operations as upland forests. Although the soil deformation caused by timber harvesting is well documented in upland forests, the knowledge on the soil disturbance induced by the harvesting machinery on peat soils is still lacking. To address this, we collected soil samples from six peatland sites that were thinned using a harvester-forwarder combination. Peat samples were taken from the trails formed by the machinery and outside the trails to a depth of 10 cm. To assess the recovery of soil properties after the disturbance, we sampled sites along a chronosequence with respect to time since harvesting. Soil deformation under the machinery appeared to increase the bulk density and field capacity of peat and decrease its total porosity; however, disturbed plots and control plots started to resemble each other in their soil properties within 15 years. The results imply that peat soil is sensitive to disturbance but has a high recovery potential.

AB Pollen records across parts of Ireland, England and northern Scotland show a dramatic collapse in Pinus pollen percentages at approximately 4000 radiocarbon years BP. This phenomenon has attracted much palaeoecological interest and several hypotheses have been put forward to account for this often synchronous and rapid reduction in pine from mid-Holocene woodland. Explanations for the 'pine decline' include prehistoric human activity, climatic change, in particular a substantial increase in precipitation resulting in increased mire wetness, and airborne pollution associated with the deposition of tephra. Hitherto, one largely untested hypothesis is that mineral deficiency could adversely affect pine growth and regeneration on mire surfaces. The discovery of pine-tree remains (wood pieces, stumps and trunks) within a peat located at Cadogan's Bog on the Mizen Peninsula, southwest Ireland, provided an opportunity to investigate the history of Pinus sylvestris and also to assess the importance of mineral nutrition in maintaining pine growth on mires. Pollen, plant macrofossils, microscopic charcoal and geochemical data are presented from a radiocarbon dated monolith extracted from this peat together with tree ring-width data and radiocarbon dated age estimates from subfossil wood. Analyses of these data suggest that peat accumulation commenced at the site around 6000 years BP when pine was the dominant local tree. Thereafter Pinus pollen percentages diminish in two stages, with the second decline taking place around 4160 +/- 50 years BP. Concomitant with this decline in Pinus pollen, there is a noticeable, short-lived increase in wet-loving mire taxa and a decrease in the concentration of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, iron and zinc. These results suggest that increased mire surface wetness, possibly the result of a change in climate, created conditions unsuitable for pine growth c. 4000 years BP. Mire surface wetness, coupled with a period of associated nutrient deficiency, appears to be a possible explanation for a lack of subsequent pine-seedling establishment for most of the later Holocene.

AB Calibration-period/control-area approach was used to study nitrogen and phosphorus export from drained and productive Norway-spruce-dominated peatland forests following conventional stem-only and whole-tree harvesting. The study indicated high nitrogen and particulate phosphorus exports and lack of significant differences between the harvest treatments during the first 3-4 years after harvesting. The high extra nitrogen exports, increasing to a maximum level of about 10 kg ha(-1) during the third year after harvesting, were partly caused by the higher nitrate export than in previous studies. The study has a practical outcome that management of harvest residues (i.e. left on site or harvested) may not be an efficient means of mitigation of nitrogen and phosphorus exports. The high exports following harvesting underline the importance of using the best available water protection methods, such as sufficiently large wetland buffer areas, to decrease nutrient exports to watercourses from productive Norway spruce dominated peatland catchments.

AB Soil samples from 15 eutrophic, 26 herb-rich, 15 tall-sedge, and 11 low-sedge drained peatland sites were analysed for easily soluble and aluminum, iron, and calcium bound phosphorus (P) using the Chang and Jackson sequential fractionation method. Compared to earlier investigations, where only total and easily soluble P contents (e.g. NH4OAc or dilute H2SO4 extractable P) in peat have been analysed, significantly higher differences between sites were observed. The cutrophic sites were characterized by four to six-fold greater Ca-bound organic P and two to three-fold greater Ca-bound inorganic P contents than on the other three site type groups, whereas the average Al-bound inorganic P content of the eutrophic sites was only one-third of that at the other site types. Substantial differences between sites were also observed for Fe-bound inorganic P, i.e. two to four-fold greater Fe-P contents were measured at the herb-rich sites compared with the other three site type groups. The stand volume growth in the 67 studied drained peatland sites correlated significantly with Al-bound organic P and Fe-bound inorganic and organic P. The study showed that a detailed fractionation and discrimination of different forms of soil P is important in increasing the understanding of the relationship between P availability and vegetation community types and stand growth on drained peatlands.

AB The paper discusses the species composition and structure of ground beetles (Col., Carabidae) assemblages inhabiting different areas in "Mszar" peat bog reserve. The discussion is followed by an evaluation of the natural condition of this habitat. The observations were carried out in 2006-2007 and comprised three different areas of "Mszar" peat bog reserve: birch forest on lowland peat bog, mixed forest on peat soils and spruce stand inside wet mixed forest. Carabid beetles were captured in modified pitfall (Barber) traps. An ecological analysis of carabids was worked out on the basis of their geographical distribution, foraging, habitat and moisture demands and type of development. It was found out that the assemblages of ground beetles living in the peat bog reserve, in terms of species diversity, were similar to those in other peat bogs in north-eastern Poland and north-western Belarus. The species composition, structure of dominance classes and lack of stenobiotic peat bog species, however, may indicate that the state of equilibrium in "Mszar" peat bog reserve has been distrubed. The reasons could involve increasing man-made pressure (roads, tourist trails and a wastewater treatment plant in close vicinity).

AB Background and Aims Forest peatlands represent 25 % of global peatlands and store large amounts of carbon (C) as peat. Traditionally they have been drained in order to increase forestry yield, which may cause large losses of C from the peat. Rewetting aims to stop these losses and to restore the initial storage function of the peatlands. As roots represent major peat-forming elements in these systems, we sampled roots with diameter <5 mm in a drained and a rewetted forest peatland in north-east Germany to evaluate differences in tree biomass investments below ground, root functional characteristics and root age.
   Methods We cored soil next to Alnus glutinosa stems and sorted root biomass into <1, 1-2 and 2-5 mm diameter classes. We measured biomass distribution and specific root area (SRA) in 10-cm depth increments down to 50 cm, and estimated root age from annual growth rings.
   Key Results Root biomass in the rewetted site was more than double that in the drained site. This difference was mostly driven by very fine roots <1 mm, which accounted for 51 % of the total root biomass and were mostly (75 %) located in the upper 20 cm. For roots <1 mm, SRA did not differ between the sites. However, SRA of the 1-2 mm and 2-5 mm diameter roots was higher in the drained than in the rewetted site. Root age did not differ between sites.
   Conclusions The size-dependent opposite patterns between root biomass and their functional characteristics under contrasting water regimes indicate differences between fine and coarse roots in their response to environmental changes. Root age distribution points to similar root turnover rates between the sites, while higher root biomass in the rewetted site clearly indicates larger tree C stocks below ground under rewetting, supporting the C sink function of the ecosystem.

AB Management of peatlands for conservation purposes is often directed at mitigation of damaging impacts of past and present human activity. Assessment of such impacts is often based on perspectives from short-term ecological data. Here we test a series of hypotheses for the causes of changes in mire hydrology and vegetation on the Border Mires in northern England using palaeoecological data for the last 200 years. Ecological data suggest peatlands surrounded by plantation forestry have become drier over the last 40 years. This could be caused by direct hydrological impacts of the growing trees and associated drainage or indirectly by the cessation of grazing and burning. A third hypothesis is that hydrological changes are the result of recent climatic change. High-resolution water-table reconstructions from testate amoebae analysis supported by plant macrofossil analysis and dated by Pb-210, spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) and pollen data demonstrate that a site outside the direct influence of forestry has also become drier during the twentieth century. This suggests that forestry is not the main cause of changes observed on other sites. Water-table declines began earlier than the main phase of forest planting and the magnitude of change appears to be similar to that on a site within the forest. Subjective comparisons of reconstructed water tables with meteorological data suggest that hydrological changes on the mires are primarily driven by summer temperature changes. If future regional climatic change predictions are correct, further water-table decline will follow and current management activities are unlikely to restore mires to their former condition.

AB Sphagnum magellanicum has been viewed as being a predominantly circumpolar species in the northern hemisphere, but it occurs in the southern hemisphere and was originally described from the southern parts of Chile. It is an ecologically important species in mire ecosystems and has been extensively used as a model to study processes of growth, carbon sequestration and peat decomposition. Molecular and experimental studies have, however, revealed genetic structure within S. magellanicum, and morphological differences associated with these genetic groups. Here we describe Sphagnum divinum in Sphagnum subgenus Sphagnum (Sphagnaceae, Bryophyta) as a new species, based on molecular and morphological evidence. Sphagnum medium is reinstated as a distinct species and is epitypified. Consequently, a new species concept of S. magellanicum is presented including an epitypification. Important morphological characters to separate these three species in the field and under the microscope are presented. Ecology and distribution differ among the species; S. divinium has a wide habitat range including mire margin, forested peatlands and moist heaths, and a circumpolar distribution around the northern hemisphere. Sphagnum medium seems to be more restricted to ombrotrophic mire expanse habitats and shows an amphi-Atlantic distribution in the northern hemisphere. Sphagnum magellanicum has a very broad ecological niche in peatlands and is found in most mire habitats in Tierra del Fuego on the southern tip of South America.

AB Drainage of peatlands causes severe environmental damage, including high greenhouse gas emissions. Peatland rewetting substantially lowers these emissions. After rewetting, paludiculture (i.e. agriculture and forestry on wet peatlands) is a promising land use option. In Northeast Germany (291,361 ha of peatland) a multi-stakeholder discussion process about the implementation of paludiculture took place in 2016/2017. Currently, 57% of the peatland area is used for agriculture (7% as arable land, 50% as permanent grassland), causing greenhouse gas emissions of 4.5 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1). By rewetting and implementing paludiculture, up to 3 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1)from peat soils could be avoided. To safeguard interests of both nature conservation and agriculture, the different types of paludiculture were grouped into 'cropping paludiculture' and 'permanent grassland paludiculture'. Based on land legislation and plans, a paludiculture land classification was developed. On 52% (85,468 ha) of the agriculturally used peatlands any type of paludiculture may be implemented. On 30% (49,929 ha), both cropping and permanent grassland paludiculture types are possible depending on administrative check. On 17% (28,827 ha), nature conservation restrictions allow only permanent grassland paludiculture.

AB Northern peatland ecosystems represent large carbon (C) stocks that are susceptible to changes such as accelerated mineralization due to water table lowering expected under a climate change scenario. During the growing seasons (1 May to 31 October) of 2011 and 2012 we monitored CO2 fluxes and plant biomass along a microtopographic gradient (hummocks- hollows) in an undisturbed dry continental boreal treed bog (control) and a nearby site that was drained (drained) in 2001. Ten years of drainage in the bog significantly increased coverage of shrubs at hummocks and lichens at hollows. Considering measured hummock coverage and including tree incremental growth, we estimate that the control site was a sink of -92 in 2011 and -70 g C m(-2) in 2012, while the drained site was a source of 27 and 23 g C m-2 over the same years. We infer that, drainage-induced changes in vegetation growth led to increased biomass to counteract a portion of soil carbon losses. These results suggest that spatial variability (microtopography) and changes in vegetation community in boreal peatlands will affect how these ecosystems respond to lowered water table potentially induced by climate change.

AB Soil mesofauna community structure was studied in a drainage-succession continuum of peatland sites supporting Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated stands in southern Finland. The numbers of Enchytraeidae, Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata in an g-cm-deep surface peat layer were compared among a pristine undrained pine mire site, comparable sites drained for forestry 12, 26 and 60 years earlier, and a 42-year-old drained site re-wetted two years earlier. Drainage and the consequent water-level draw-down clearly increased the numbers of all soil animals studied, the numbers showing highly significant correlation with the water-table level of the sites. On the older drained sites, the populations were generally about ten times higher than on the undrained site; for Collembola, almost 100 times higher. After re-wetting, the numbers dropped abruptly, falling between those of the undrained and the youngest drained site. Oribatida were the most frequently found animals on the sites studied: on the undrained site almost 60% of the total number were these mites, the relative proportion somewhat decreasing along the drainage succession. The proportion of Enchytraeidae also decreased slightly after drainage, whereas that of Collembola clearly increased. Most of the soil fauna was found close to the soil surface. In general, >80% of Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata, and >60% of Enchytraeidae were found in the topmost 4-cm layer. In the course of the drainage succession, the soil fauna community structure became more similar to that of upland sites with similar tree-stand growth potential. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in vegetation of natural hummocky peatlands in the forest-tundra subzone of the Komi Republic and its possible impact on the composition of polyarenes in peat were assessed. The content of polyarenes was estimated by the method of highly efficient liquid chromatography. The accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was the highest in Polytrichum strictum, Betula pubescens, and shoots of Picea abies and smaller in Betula nana L., Salix lapponum L., and Carex limosa L. with the domination of low-molecular-weight PAHs. We did not reveal dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[ghi]perylene in plants: they could be the products of soil-forming processes. It is shown that distribution patterns of PAHs in the permafrost-affected soils of peat mounds (Hemic Folic Cryic Histosols) and in the soils of open-water mire pools (Fibric Floatic Histosols) are similar. Small quantities of low-molecular-weight polyarenes were normally accumulated in the seasonally thawed layer. The content of heavy structures (mainly, benzo[ghi]perylene) strongly increased at the contact with permafrost and then slightly decreased in the underlying permafrost. The composition of PAHs in the active layer mainly depended on composition of polyarenes in plants. At the contact with permafrost, the active synthesis or release of high-molecular-weight compounds took place. The influence of the composition of PAHs in plants on their composition in peat greatly depended on the degree of peat decomposition. Reasoning from the natural model of peat formation in open-water mire pools, the composition of polyarenes in the upper peat horizons of such sites was affected by recombination of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons in Sphagnum riparium and Eriophorum sp. In the course of long-term soil development, the decomposition of complex organic compounds in plant tissues (particularly, in Eriophorum sp.) results in the formation of heavy PAHs with a simultaneous increase in the content of low-molecular-weight polyarenes.

AB This study combines tree-ring and charcoal data to explore possible drivers of the charcoal record and its spatial variation in a boreal Norwegian forest landscape. Peat and mineral soil samples were collected in a multiple site sampling approach and the amount of charcoal in the peat is related to fire history, Holocene climate variation, major shifts in the vegetation composition, and fuel availability. Dendrochronologic dating was used to reveal the fire history over the last 600 years with spatial and temporal accuracy, and AMS radiocarbon dating of 20 peat columns and their charcoal records from four peatlands was used to elucidate the fire history over the Holocene. The average amount of charcoal was about 2.5 times higher in the mineral soil than in the peat (270 versus 100 g/m(2), respectively), and there were considerable between-and within-site variations. There was no relationship between the age of a given peatland and its content of charcoal, nor between the amount of charcoal in a given peatland and in the neighboring mineral soil. Although most of the charcoal mass in the peatlands was found in parts of the peat columns originating from relatively warm climatic periods and from the period before the local establishment of Norway spruce (Picea abies), charcoal accumulation rates (per 1000 yr) were higher during cold climatic periods and similar before and after spruce establishment. Recent fires showed up to a low degree in the peat columns. On fine spatial scales (1-10 m), fuel quality and distribution together with fire behaviour throughout millennia are likely to be responsible for variations in the charcoal record. On the landscape scale (100-1000 m), the charcoal records were site-specifically idiosyncratic, presumably due to topography, distribution of fire breaks and fuel types, and human land use, coupled with long-term variations inherent in these factors.

AB Forested peatlands contain large pools of terrestrial carbon. As well as drainage, forest management such as fertilizer application can affect these pools. We studied the effect of wood ash (application rates 0, 5 and 15 t ha-1) on the heterotrophic soil respiration (CO2 efflux), cellulose decomposition, soil nutrients, biomass production and amount of C accumulated in a tree stand on a pine-dominated drained mire in central Finland. The ash was spread 13 years before the respiration measurements. The annual CO2 efflux was statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable. Wood ash application increased the amounts of mineral nutrients of peat substantially and increased soil pH in the uppermost 10 cm layer by 1.52 pH units. In the surface peat, the decomposition rate of cellulose in the ash plots was roughly double that in control plots. Annual CO2 efflux was least on the unfertilized site, 238 g CO2-C m-2 year-1. The use of wood ash nearly doubled CO2 efflux to 420475 g CO2-Cm-2 year-1 on plots fertilized with 515 t ha-1 of ash, respectively. Furthermore, ash treatments resulted also in increased stand growth, and during the measurement year, the growing stand on ash plots accumulated carbon 1112 times faster than the control plot. The difference between peat C emission and amount of C sequestered by trees on the ash plots was 4358 g C m-2, while on the control plot it was 204 g C m-2. Our conclusion is that adding wood ash as a fertilizer increases more C sequestration in the tree stand than C efflux from the peat.

AB The authors determined the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and electrical conductivity, as well as the colour and pH in the ground waters of 26 peat-bogs in Pomerania (NW Poland). Three kinds of peat-bogs have been taken into account - forestless - sphagnum - cover bogs, bog coniferous forests and birch swamps. The condition of bogs was classified as good, moderate or poor as regards their natural qualities. In good natural-status peat-bogs the lowest amounts of DOC (about 30 mg C dm(-3)) and conductivity (< 100 muS cm(-1)) were found in the water of the peat of sphagnum-cover bogs, higher levels were recorded in forest peat-bog water (DOC - 50 mg C dm(-3), conductivity - 100 muS cm(-1)). Drainage of all the kinds of peat-bog under study leads to an increase in the concentration of DOC (>70 mg C dm(-3)) and conductivity (up to 90 AS cm(-1) in degraded sphagnum-cover bogs and 140-150 muS cm(-1) in degraded forest bogs); there also occurs an increase in acidity (from pH 4.0-3.7 to 3.7-3.4) and coloration (from 300 to 1000 mg Pt dm(-3) in forestless peat-bogs and from 600-800 to 1400-1600 mg Pt dm(-3) in forest bogs).

AB Drainage ditches have been dug in peatlands and paludified forests to enhance forest growth in an area of 4.7 Mha in Finland. Because of peat subsidence, bank erosion, sedimentation, and the ingrowth of vegetation ditches deteriorate with time. In this study the shallowing of ditch depth over time was investigated based on a country-wide peatland inventory data measured repeatedly up to four times. Mixed linear models were developed separately for original ditches and maintained ones (cleaned once or twice). After 20 years, the ditches were 20-30 cm shallower than right after the digging. The time since digging was the most important variable explaining the shallowing for both original and maintained ditches. Other variables explaining the ditch shallowing were the digging method (excavator, plough), ditch bed slope, location, and peat layer thickness. The average development of the maintained and original excavator ditches was very similar. The results can be used in assessing decision making concerning ditch cleaning.

AB This study demonstrates the importance of the including and appropriately parameterizing peatlands and forestlands for basin-scale integrated surface-subsurface models in the northern boreal forest, with particular emphasis on the Athabasca River Basin (ARB). With a long-term water balance approach to the ARB, we investigate reasons why downstream mean annual stream flow rates are consistently higher than upstream, despite the subhumid water deficit conditions in the downstream regimes. A high-resolution 3D variably saturated subsurface and surface water flow and evapotranspiration model of the ARB is constructed based on the bedrock and surficial geology and the spatial distribution of peatlands and their corresponding eco-regions. Historical climate data were used to drive the model for calibration against 40-year long-term average surface flow and groundwater observations during the historic instrumental period. The simulation results demonstrate that at the basin-scale, peatlands and forestlands can have a strong influence on the surface-subsurface hydrologic systems. In particular, peatlands in the midstream and downstream regimes of the ARB increase the water availability to the surface-subsurface water systems by reducing water loss through evapotranspiration. Based on the comparison of forestland evapotranspiration between observation and simulation, the overall spatial average evapotranspiration in downstream forestlands is larger than that in peatlands and thus the water contribution to the stream flow in downstream areas is relatively minor. Therefore, appropriate representation of peatlands and forestlands within the basin-scale hydrologic model is critical to reproduce the water balance of the ARB.

AB The estimates ambiguity of the consequences of both mires drainage and restoration in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the rate of modern peat accumulation, potential fire hazard, and biodiversity dynamics makes it necessary to conduct research on the current state and trends of self-recovery of biosphere functions of drained raised bogs in the southern taiga subzone of West Siberia. The goal of this work is to assess the intensity of peat accumulation and the degree of transformation of peat deposits within the drained raised bogs the South-Eastern part of West Siberia based on the analysis of the physical properties and botanical composition of peat.
   The objects under study are 8 key sites in drained and similar natural pine-shrub-sphagnum raised bog. The species composition is characterized by the dominance of Pinus sylvestris, Ledum palustre, Chamaedaphne calculata and sphagnum mosses. The area under study were drained in 1980 by a network of open channels for the purpose of forest melioration and peat extraction. The lack of planting and repair of the drainage network has led to the development of self-recovery processes in drained mires.
   Field studies of the sites included the access of peat deposit depths, selecting stratigraphic layer by type and degree of decomposition of peat by visual method; sampling peat in steps of 5 cm to a depth of 90 cm using a Russian peat corer. Laboratory analysis of peat included determination of the following characteristics: Botanical composition, degree of decomposition, ash content, water content, bulk density. We take analyzed a total of 162 peat samples. The significance of differences in the physical properties of peat in drained and natural bogs was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test (U-test). Classification of sites by criteria of physical properties of peat was performed by cluster analysis.
   The consequences of drainage are manifested in a change in the species composition of mosses and an increase in the proportion of wood residues in the peat deposit upper layer. On two sites, the change of balticum and magellanicum peat to fuscum peat at a depth of 25 cm was noted. The other site is characterized by the appearance of upper layer of green mosses in the peat composition with a maximum share of their presence at a depth of 15-20 cm. Two sites are characterized by the formation of wood peat in the upper layer, with almost complete absence of sphagnum moss residues here, which can be an indicator of the almost complete absence of the process of peat deposits modern accumulation.
   As a result of the study, it is shown that the bulk density of peat characterizes the rate of accumulation of peat and is directly related to the ash content and the degree of decomposition. The increase in density in the peat layer at depths up to 25 cm corresponds to the period of peat accumulation during the maximum effect of drainage. The change in ash content with depth and a maximum value in the layer of 15-35 cm is an indicator of the transformation of the peat layer located on the surface during the first years after drainage, and is generally consistent with the laws of bulk density changes in depth.
   According to the results of the study, it was found that the peat layer formed after drainage reclamation changes from 0 to 25-30 cm in different key sites. In 6 of the 8 studied sites, the process of modern peat accumulation is observed; in two sites, the rate of peat accumulation is minimal or completely absent.

AB The testate amoeba, ciliate and rotifera communities living in interstitial waters in peatbog in eastern Poland were studied. Sampling was done on a monthly basis from April to November 2007-2008. Microbial communities were examined in a transect including three sites: (1) pine forest (site located 5 m from the lagg/forest contact zone), (2) lagg, (3) open peatbog (the centre of the peatbog). At each of the sites, interstitial water was sampled by means of piezometric wells placed to a depth of 1 m. The species richness and abundance of protozoa and rotifers significantly differed between the studied stations, with the lowest numbers in the pine forest and the highest in the lagg. These differences between macro-habitats may be due to differences in environmental conditions. The distribution of samples in ordination space led to conclude that studied habitats are distributed along the falling gradient of pH and rising gradient of total organic carbon, water table depth and nitrate nitrogen. Assemblages of all three groups showed a strong compositional gradient correlated with water-table depth, conductivity and total phosphorus. However, species composition of ciliates and rotifers was explained by nitrate nitrogen and/or phosphates concentrations. The results suggest that lagg zone of a raised bog can fulfil the function of an ecotone zone, distinguished by a significant increase in biodiversity, abundance and species specificity of micro-organisms. It can also be a place of very efficient matter and energy flow in a peat bog ecosystem.

AB Peatland was subject to heavy drainage and degradation throughout the world and thus is now the focus of large scale restoration attempts. The monitoring of both vegetation development and balance of matter after restoration has started is indispensable, since an important objective of peatlands rewetting is the rehabilitation of their sink function. Against this background, we investigated rewetted fens in NE Germany in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the vegetation development after restoration measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the vegetation composition with multispectral and very high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We investigated two sites with different rewetting dates and also took biomass and carbon content samples for the main plant species in order to estimate nutrient storage. We tested the applicability of various satellite sensors (QuickBird, WorldView I and SPOT) and an iterative classification scheme based on decision trees for mapping several wetland plant species (e. g. Phragmites australis, Typha spp. and Carex spp.) and vegetation types. We chose three different widely used decision tree classifiers for this study: AdaBoost, See5 and Random Forest. Evaluation criteria were overall accuracy and mean class accuracy. Multispectral and very high spatial resolution satellite data and the developed method allow for the identification of the most important vegetation types in rewetted fens. All applied sensors yielded good results with overall accuracies of 85% and 92%. Some classes reached lower accuracies due to different reasons (capture date, size of training set or spatial resolution of the sensor). We found remote sensing a very valuable tool not only for the observation of the restoration success in rewetted peatland but also for the analysis of the peat accumulation potential as well as biomass and nutrient storage.

AB Forested peatlands represent an important global carbon pool, storing 48.0 Pg of carbon within continental western Canada alone. Peatland hydrology regulates the carbon dynamics and future stability of this carbon store and provides a critical control on regional water dynamics. Drying associated with land-use change and climate change has the potential to increase tree growth, modifying the density, size, and spatial arrangement of trees. This can reduce peatland evaporation and offset the associated increase in transpiration. To determine the magnitude of this negative ecohydrological feedback, we simulated spatial variations in radiation, turbulent energy fluxes, and temperatures in peatlands with real and idealized tree densities and distributions. For a random tree distribution, an increase in tree density from 0 to 4 trees per m(2) reduced available energy at the peat surface, decreasing average evaporation by 25%. At higher tree densities, feather moss species covered a larger fraction of the ground because of lower light availability. In combination with the lower energy availability, this change in moss composition reduced evaporation by similar to 70%. The reduction in evaporation was greater (83%) when the effects of increased canopy cover on peatland aerodynamic properties were incorporated. Additionally, we found that evaporation was dependent on the spatial arrangement of trees, with evaporation being higher when trees were clustered. Overall, our model showed that the trade-off between reduced evaporation and increased transpiration with increasing tree densities reduced landscape variation in evapotranspiration, with simulated evapotranspiration remaining approximately constant across a broad range of peatland ecosystems despite varying canopy densities.

AB Peatlands form a large but unstable C store. Drainage of peatlands converts them into C sources, which is undesirable if increases in atmospheric CO2 levels are to be minimised. Therefore, quantification of C stocks and an understanding of which ecosystems or management regimes are capturing or emitting C is needed. Such information is scarce for temperate European forests. We studied the soil properties of sixteen peatlands in Switzerland, representing three forest types, to test whether peatlands that are more strongly affected by drainage (according to vegetation) have lost their function as C sinks or stores. Bulk density and ash enrichment, as well as H/C, O/C and C/N quotients, indicated that the soils of the two forest types that appeared to be more strongly affected by drainage were more degraded and had lost their functions as C stores. Longterm net rates of C loss estimated using the ash residue method were similar across all three forest types, for sites where this could be estimated.

AB Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10%-20% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.

Northern peatlands have accumulated, as peat, a vast amount of carbon from the atmosphere since the last glaciation. However, the past land-use and present climate have evidently changed their GHG balance. Unmanaged boreal peatlands may act as net sources or sinks for CO2 and CH4 depending on the weather conditions. Drainage for agriculture has turned peatlands to significant sources of GHGs (mainly N2O and CO2). Annual mean GHG balances including net CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 2260, 2280 and 3140 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) (calculated using 100 year time horizon) for areas drained for grass swards, cereals or those left fallow, respectively. Even after cessetion of the cultivation practices, N2O and CO2 emissions remain high. The mean net GHG emissions in abandoned and afforested agricultural peatlands have been 1580 and 500 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), respectively. Peat extraction sites are net sources of GHGs with an average emission rate of 770 gCO(2) eq. m(-2). Cultivation of a perennial grass (e. g., reed canary grass) on an abandoned peat extraction site has been shown to convert such a site into a net sink of GHGs (-330 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). In contrast, despite restoration, such sites are known to emit GHGs (mean source of 480 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), mostly from high CH4 emissions). Peatland forests, originally drained for forestry, may act as net sinks (mean -780 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, the studies where all three GHGs have been measured at an ecosystem level in the forested peatlands are lacking. The data for restored peatland forests (clear cut and rewetted) indicate that such sites are on average a net sink (190 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). The mean emissions from drained peatlands presented here do not include emissions from ditches which form a part of the drainage network and can contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Peat soils submerged under water reservoirs have acted as sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O (mean annual emission 240 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, we cannot yet predict accurately the overall greenhouse gas fluxes of organic soils based on the site characteristics and land-use practices alone because the data on many land-use options and our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling associated with the gas fluxes are limited.

AB Restoration of tertiary endemorelict Serbian spruce (Picea omorika Pancic) in forest-peat in Tara Mt., the only such finding in the world is rather poor. This could be partially ascribed to the presence of phenolics in peat soil. Content of total phenols and phenolic acids was determined in peat samples taken from: (1) knolls of forest-peat bog with dominance of trees and between the knolls and (2) peat bog knolls with dominance of Agrostis alba and between the knolls where Sphagnum mosses prevailed. In knoll samples of forest-peat bog where there are conditions for growth and development of trees, the amount of free phenolics was up to three times higher compared to that in the peat-bog knoll samples with dominance of A. alba. Amount of bound phenolics between the knolls of forest-peat bog was significantly higher than that between the knolls of the peat bog. Content of bound phenolics. exceeded that of free ones 1.77-12 times. In the forest-peat bog soil, derivatives of benzoic acid mainly originating from woody plants were dominant, while in peat bog cinnamic acid derivatives, originating from A. alba and Sphagnum mosses prevailed. Our results demonstrate that aerobic conditions in knolls enable a more extensive accumulation of free phenolics, while anaerobic conditions between the knolls result in a higher accumulation of bound phenolics. Content and composition of phenolic compounds depend on dominant plants in phytocoenotic microcomplex, as well as characteristics of the microhabitat.

AB Changes in atmospheric temperature and lowering in water-table (WT) are expected to affect peatland nutrient dynamics. To understand the response of peatland nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics to warming and drainage in a continental wooded-bog of hummock-hollow microtopography, we compared three sites: (a) control, (b) recently drained (2-3years; experimental), and (c) older drained (12-13years; drained), during 2013. The WT was lowered at experimental and drained sites to 74 and 120cm, respectively, whereas a warming of similar to 1 degrees C was created at one half of the microforms using open-top chambers. Responses of peat total inorganic nitrogen (TIN=nitrate nitrogen [NO3--N]+ammonium nitrogen [NH4+-N]) and phosphate-P (PO43--P) pools and vegetation C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15 to the experimental treatments were investigated across sites/microforms and over time. Peat TIN available and extractable pools increased with deepening of WT and over time and were greater at hummocks relative to hollows. In contrast, the PO4 pools increased with short-term drainage but reverted to very close to their original (control) nutrient values in the longer term. The WT and warming driven change in the peat TIN pool was strongly reflected in the vascular vegetation C:N ratio and shrub C-13 and N-15, whereas moss nutrient dynamics did not vary between sites. Therefore, we suggest that atmospheric warming combined with WT deepening can increase availability of mineral N and P, which then can be reflected in vascular vegetation and hence modify the productivity and ecosystem functioning of the northern midlatitude continental wooded bogs in the long term.

AB Spatiotemporal information on historical peatland drainage is needed to relate past land use to observed changes in catchment hydrology. Comprehensive knowledge of historical development of peatland management is largely unknown at the catchment scale. Aerial photos and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data enlarge the possibilities for identifying past peatland drainage patterns. Here, our objectives are (1) to develop techniques for semiautomatically mapping the location of ditch networks in peat-dominated catchments using aerial photos and LIDAR data, and (2) to generate time series of drainage networks. Our approaches provide open-access techniques to systematically map ditches in peat-dominated catchments through time. We focused on the algorithm in such a way that we can identify the ditch networks from raw aerial images and LIDAR data based on the modification of multiple filters and number of threshold values. Such data are needed to relate spatiotemporal drainage patterns to observed changes in many northern rivers. We demonstrate our approach using data from the Simojoki River catchment (3,160 km2) in northern Finland. The catchment is dominated by forests and peatlands that were almost all drained after 1960. For two representative locations in cultivated peatland (downstream) and peatland forest (upstream) areas of the catchment; we found total ditch length density (km/km2), estimated from aerial images and LIDAR data based on our proposed algorithm, to have varied from 2% to 50% compared with the monitored ditch length available from the National Land survey of Finland (NLSF) in 2018. A different pattern of source variation in ditch network density was observed for whole-catchment estimates and for the available drained-peatland database from Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE). Despite such differences, no significant differences were found using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test with a 0.05 significance level based on the samples of pixel-identified ditches between (1) aerial images and NLSF vector files and (2) LIDAR data and NLSF vector files.

LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-TABLE LEVELS; DEEP PEAT; GROWTH; SOILS
AB The spatial variability of soil aeration (aerobic limit depth and oxygen diffusion rate (ODR)) among different drainage ditch spacings and at various distances from drainage ditches was examined at two peatlands drained for forestry in north-central Alberta. Drainage lowered mean water table levels (p < 0.001) at both peatlands. Lower water table levels within drained areas were associated with greater aerobic limit depths (p < 0.001) and greater ODR (p < 0.001 at Saulteaux River; p < 0.027 at Wolf Creek) compared with undrained areas of both peatlands. Spatial patterns of aerobic limit depth and ODR indicated strong spatial variability of soil aeration in the immediate vicinity of drainage ditches. However, little sensitivity of soil aeration to different ditch spacings was evident. Potential effects of post-drainage subsidence on soil aeration was evident as increased distance of both the aerobic limit, and near-zero oxygen diffusion rates above the water table surface at both peatlands. One effect of post-drainage peatland subsidence may be to increase the thickness of the capillary zone above the water table. However, reduction of aeration within the rooting zone of peatland trees due to subsidence was not observed because of low water tables within the drained areas of both peatlands.

AB The addition of phenolic compounds to peatland soils has been proposed as a means of enhancing the suppression of enzymes, reducing the rate of organic matter decomposition and increasing below-ground carbon sequestration. This study evaluated the potential of phenolic enrichment as a peatland restoration strategy by adding wood chips from common tree species to peat substrate and determining the impacts on key components of organic matter decomposition and Sphagnum growth. All treatments tended to increase the concentration of phenolics and suppress the activities of beta-glucosidase (measured as an indicator enzyme that plays a key role in cellulose decomposition), significantly so with the Spruce (Picea mariana) and Cedar (Thuja occidentalis) wood chips mixed into the peat. All substrate additions to the peat tended to reduce fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and significantly more so with surface additions of Spruce and Larch (Larix laricina) wood chips. The addition of woodchips per se had no detrimental effect on Sphagnum growth for any of the treatments. These results indicate that through the addition of phenolic compounds to peatlands, it may be possible to inhibit extracellular enzyme activities in order to reduce the flux of CO2 from soils to the atmosphere. Thus, organic soil conditioning could reduce the carbon footprint for commercial activities such as Sphagnum culture.

AB The need to regenerate peatland forests is expected to increase in the near future in Finland due to harvest of large amounts of peatlands drained during the 1950s and 1960s. In anticipation of this, a new type of excavator-mounted rototiller for soil scarification in peatlands has been developed in Finland to improve the moisture conditions of the seedbed by mixing the ground vegetation, raw humus layer, and peat. The regeneration result of the new rototiller was compared with traditional patch scarification (i.e. scalping) in direct seeding of Scots pine in three forestry-drained peatland sites in eastern Finland. After two growing seasons, rototilling offered no advantage over scalping in terms of the number of established seedlings, probability of empty patches, or seedling height. Seedling establishment was on average higher on scalping (10%) than on rototilling (8%). The main problem in rototilling may have been the loose and porous structure of the seedbed resulting in drought and frost damages.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In the satellite image-based estimation and classification of forest variables in Finland peatlands are usually processed separately from mineral soil forests, to improve the accuracy of the results. The division into peatlands and mineral soil forests is based on a mask provided by the National Land Survey. It would be advantageous, however, to update the mask with the satellite imagery used for estimating forest variables. The aim here was to compare methods for treeless peatland detection on a Landsat ETM+satellite image. The area concerned was located within the southern aapa mire zone in Finland. The classification methods tested included sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP), supervised maximum likelihood (ML) and unsupervised ML with Iso Cluster-based signatures. The unsupervised Iso Cluster ML method performed poorly, while the overall accuracies of SMAP and supervised ML were better and quite similar (88-94% and 89-90% on forestry land, respectively). SMAP produced more usable maps, by forming compact and unspeckled treeless peatland regions. The existing peatland mask was slightly more accurate than SMAP and ML, although it performed less well in the treeless peatland class. The updating of the existing mask by combining it with the best classification result did not succeed. The main conclusion is that a peatland mask can be based on Landsat TM classification, but in areas where a good topographic mask exists the latter is more useful, and cannot easily be updated with help of satellite image data.

AB Decomposition of organic substances is one of the main processes responsible for the signatures of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in soils and peats. However, the applicability of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures at the natural abundance level as indicators of the degree of peat decomposition is still debatable. We evaluated delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth patterns of peat cores sampled at nine sites in two nearby Alpine peat bogs with varying degree of organic matter degradation. Based on water table depths and past drainage intensities, the peat cores were divided into three degradation classes. We found similar overall depths patterns of delta C-13 and delta N-15 across the nine depth profiles and distinct differences between aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. Considerable differences in stable C and N isotope signatures of same depths were detected between profiles of the three classes, whereas depth profiles of peat cores with similar degree in peatland degradation were nearly identical. In the aerobic peat layers, delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased with depths at all study sites from 2.6 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.2 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15 compared to the initial signatures of the plant biomass. Standardised delta C-13 of aerobic layers differ distinctly between slightly degraded pests at the open peat bog area, intermediately degraded peats at the tree-covered edge areas and strongly degraded pests at the former peat-cutting site. delta C-13 signatures of aerobic layers of strongly degraded pests were markedly more negative compared to the slightly degraded peats because of the selective C-12 losses by microbial respiration. delta N-15 were more positive at strongly degraded than at slightly degraded sites in both, aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. The uniform stable isotope ratios in the anaerobic layers deeper than the local maxima of the isotopic signatures support the assumption that minor C-13 fractionation occurs under anaerobic conditions. delta C-13 slightly declining with depth in the waterlogged layers of strongly degraded peat reflects the preferential utilisation and loss of labile organic compounds enriched in C-13. delta N-15 of strongly degraded pests was higher compared to well-conserved peat The close relationship between the measured delta N-15 to delta N-15 modelled based on C:N ratios and bulk densities supports the assumption that the delta N-15 signature is the result of isotopic fractionation by peat decomposition. We conclude that peat decomposition strongly affects the delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth profiles of peat bogs and most likely overrides other factors, such as differences between plant species, litter components, atmospheric delta C-13 shift during peat formation, temperature effects, or type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

AB Planting forest on cutover peatlands may be regarded as a viable restoration technique in western Canada, where natural bogs are treed with a high density of Black Spruce, Picea mariana. Fertilizer is needed to promote P. mariana establishment on cutover peatlands; however, it also encourages spontaneous colonisation by non-peatland species such as Paper Birch, Betula papyrifera. This study aimed to assess the most appropriate fertilizer dose for P. mariana establishment and growth against the trade-off of birch invasion; consequently, we monitored the effect of B. papyrifera on P. mariana growth. Four levels of fertilizer dose were applied below-ground, but flooding of the site following planting allowed fertilizer to reach the surface and favoured the colonisation of B. papyrifera. Seven years after planting, fertilizer promoted P. mariana survival and the highest fertilizer dose improved both P. mariana and B. papyrifera growth, while the lowest fertilizer dose promoted spruce growth, to a lesser degree, without promoting birch growth as much as higher doses of fertilizer. Birch removal had a significant positive effect on the growth of P. mariana, possibly by allowing greater light penetration and higher near-surface soil moisture. Avoiding B. papyrifera colonisation on site is more effective than cutting due to the ability of birch to regenerate rapidly from stumps. In practice, if planting coniferous trees is the chosen restoration option, the risk of birch colonisation can be minimised by leaving a thicker remnant peat deposit, burying fertilizer near the planted seedlings, and planning planting to avoid flooding during the growing season post-planting whenever possible.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role in the regulation of the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, functioning as a net carbon sink with low rates of organic decomposition. However, perturbations such as drainage increase peat oxidation, which may lead to enhanced gaseous release of carbon. For this reason, the number of restoration projects that aim to rewet blanket bogs has increased in the last few years, but there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of restoration on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane, particularly in sites restored from forestry. In this paper, we investigate the seasonal greenhouse gas dynamics in a forest-to-bog restoration site in Scotland. We analyse the effects of restoration on both carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, and investigate which site factors (microtopography, vegetation type, soil moisture and temperature) drive the processes of gaseous exchange between the bog surface and the atmosphere. Our results show that the original surface is near greenhouse gase equilibrium at -0.28 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and that microtopographic features act as a net greenhouse gas sink (ridges = -0.94 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and furrows = -0.86 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)), whereas the bog pool is a net source of greenhouse gases (0.98 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)). We found different vegetation species play a key role in greenhouse gas flux dynamics, especially in forestry-derived microtopographical features, and their presence and influence on greenhouse gas dynamics should be accounted for to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emissions associated with restoration management practices.
   Highlights
   GHG (CO2 and CH4) dynamics in a boreal peatland restored from forestry are mainly affected by microtopography and vegetation.
   Forestry-derived microforms (ridges and furrows) are better GHG sinks than pools (GHG emitters) and original surfaces (near GHG equilibrium).
   The presence of Trichophorum cespitosum leads to higher CH4 emissions.
   Restoration practices like terraforming may create a short-term pulse net GHG emission due to an increase of both CH4 and CO2 fluxes.

AB Fertilization of drained peatland forests with wood ash and different commercial phosphorus fertilizers (calcium phosphates) generally give similar stand growth responses. However, it has been shown that use of calcium phosphate fertilizers generally lead to highly increased P release to recipient water courses. On the other hand, no corresponding release has been reported after ash fertilization. Soil samples from the surface peats from a nutrient poor and a fertile drained peatland site were collected before and 1-4 years after application of five different types of ash products. The changes over time in the different chemical forms of P in the substrate were studied. The results indicated that the reason for the low liability to leaching of ash fertilizers was that significant amounts of P are adsorbed by At and Fe during weathering of the ash fertilizers. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether the adsorption of P occurs with the At and Fe of the ash or the native At and Fe compounds present in soil before ash fertilization.

AB The current understanding, based on previous studies, is that increased discharge nutrient concentrations from boreal peatlands drained for forestry return to similar levels as those of pristine peatlands within about 20 years after their drainage. As an implicit consequence of this finding, it has been assumed that there are no long-term increasing trends in nutrient exports from these peatlands after the establishment of forestry. We analysed discharge total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration data from 54 catchments with undrained pristine peatlands and 34 catchments with drained peatlands using data with considerably longer drainage history than in previous studies. Our results agree with previous studies in that discharge TN and TP concentrations in areas drained 20-30 years ago did not differ much from those in pristine sites. However, we also observed that the TN and TP concentrations were increasing with years since drainage of these catchments. Discharge TN and TP concentrations were over two times higher in areas drained 60 years ago when compared with more recently drained areas. Our results challenge the current perceptions by showing that forestry-drained peatlands may contribute to water eutrophication considerably more than previously estimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forestry drainage is the main management practice of peatlands in Finland. The influence of drainage and management on carbon (C) fluxes may vary, e.g., depending on the original peatland type. We have studied C fluxes in two forestry-drained peatlands with different nutrient status.
   Our hypothesis that the differences in the C balance between these two sites can be attributed to differences in soil respiration rates, and in particular to the priming effect, was tested with laboratory microcosm flux measurements and C-14 isotopic partitioning method. A two-pool mixing-model based on the natural difference in the respired (CO2)-C-14 between the peat and plants was employed.
   We found no statistically significant priming effect in either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich soil, respectively.
   As no differences in priming effect were found, we can conclude that the nutrient status of the sites does not affect the priming effect in the peat soils studied here, thus our results suggest that organic soils do not support priming to the same extent as mineral soils.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of different water management options to mitigate sediment and nutrient exports from ditch network maintenance (DNM) areas in boreal peatland forests. Available literature was reviewed, past data reanalyzed, effects of drainage intensity modeled, and major research gaps identified. The results indicate that excess downstream loads may be difficult to prevent. Water protection structures constructed to capture eroded matter are either inefficient (sedimentation ponds) or difficult to apply (wetland buffers). It may be more efficient to decrease erosion, either by limiting peak water velocity (dam structures) or by adjusting ditch depth and spacing to enable satisfactory drainage without exposing the mineral soil below peat. Future research should be directed towards the effects of ditch breaks and adjusted ditch depth and spacing in managing water quality in DNM areas.

In the Canadian System of Soil Classification, the Organic order represents those soils that have developed from materials that are comprised primarily of plant tissue remains and includes both wetland Organic soils and upland Organic soils. This review focuses on the first group; the latter group is discussed in Fox and Tarnocai (2011). Wetland Organic soils can be subdivided into three great groups: Fibrisol, Mesisol, and Humisol, reflecting the degree of decomposition of organic material and the vertical arrangement of different organic horizons and other horizons. Wetland Organic soils are present in all regions of Canada and are commonly referred to as (unfrozen) peatland soils. Unfrozen peatlands with Organic soils cover approximately 75 5568 km(2) (8.4%) of the land area of Canada. The two primary processes of formation of wetland Organic soils are paludification and terrestrialization. The major taxonomic issues identified for the wetland Organic soils concerns the lack of taxonomic protocols for limnic materials within the soil control section. This is an issue for those soil profiles in which the middle tier is dominated by, if not entirely composed of, deposited limnic materials. Further work is required to determine if these issues should be expressed at the great group or subgroup level of classification. Our understanding of the effects of management practices such as cultivation, tree removal, drainage, and peat extraction on soil properties needs to be translated into models of soil development.

AB In the UK, large areas of peatland were drained for forestry in the second half of the 20th century. Ground surface subsidence and diminishing depth (thickness) of the peat layer can indicate compaction of the peat and/or carbon loss, but there are few long-term datasets from afforested UK peatlands. Here we present an unprecedented 50-year time series of surface subsidence from Bad a'Cheo Forest (Caithness, Scotland). This site was initially surveyed for ground level and peat depth in 1966, prior to drainage and plantation, with repeat surveys roughly 20 and 30 years after drainage. We re-surveyed the site 50 years after initial drainage, producing a unique long-term time series to assess change since these historical studies. Significant subsidence has taken place since drainage, with an average reduction of 56.8 cm (or 13 %) in the depth of peat under forest stands. Subsidence of the peat surface was rapid in the initial phase after drainage and planting but has progressively slowed, with relatively little change between the surveys of 1996 and 2016. These results imply carbon loss but do not demonstrate it directly, as compaction of the peat is also probable. The subsidence data demonstrate that drainage followed by afforestation led to a considerable reduction in thickness of the peat layer and show how this evolved through time.

AB One of the most important threats to peatland ecosystems is drainage, resulting in encroachment of woody species. Our main aim was to check which features - overstorey or understorey vegetation - are more important for shaping the seedling bank of pioneer trees colonising peatlands (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens). We hypothesised that tree stand parameters will be more important predictors of natural regeneration density than understorey vegetation parameters, and the former will be negatively correlated with species diversity and richness and also with functional richness and functional dispersion, which indicate a high level of habitat filtering. The study was conducted in the Zielone Bagna' nature reserve (NW Poland). We assessed the structure of tree stands and natural regeneration (of B.pubescens and P.sylvestris) and vegetation species composition. Random forest and DCA were applied to assess relationships between variables studied. Understorey vegetation traits affected tree seedling density (up to 0.5-m height) more than tree stand traits. Density of older seedlings depended more on tree stand traits. We did not find statistically significant relationships between natural regeneration densities and functional diversity components, except for functional richness, which was positively correlated with density of the youngest tree seedlings. Seedling densities were higher in plots with lower functional dispersion and functional divergence, which indicated that habitat filtering is more important than competition. Presence of an abundant seedling bank is crucial for the process of woody species encroachment on drained peatlands, thus its dynamics should be monitored in protected areas.

AB The structure of Collembolan assemblages in a peat bog surrounded by forest in the French Pyrenees was analyzed using self-organizing map (SOM). The dataset included 68 samples (48 in the peat bog, 20 in the forest) for 63 species. Peat bog communities were shown to be always well separated from forest communities, with very few overlap in terms of species composition. From the dataset, five community groups (two in the forest, three in the peat bog) were defined by SOM, indicating an unexpected heterogeneity. No special assemblage was clearly differentiated at the interface zone of forest-peat bog. These variations were strongly correlated with a series of environmental parameters, substrate water content, Sphagnum and grass cover. An apparently homogeneous peat bog may therefore host rather different communities, the ecotone being not necessarily the most species-rich zone. Manipulating wetland habitats for biodiversity conservation should therefore not be done before having carefully established the real pattern of biodiversity in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Studies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by hydroelectric reservoirs have shown until now that the fate of carbon, following impoundment, seems to reach the fate of carbon in natural aquatic ecosystems after a decade or so. To adequately assess this assumption and then obtain the net GHG emissions from the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric reservoir, the carbon stock and GHG emissions from peatlands and different succession stages of forested areas need to be characterized prior to the reservoir impoundment. It is therefore important to characterize the carbon flow process (surface fluxes and sequestrated carbon) from these terrestrial systems prior to impoundment. The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada, Quebec region, has developed an approach for mapping wetlands using Landsat/RADARSAT-1 satellite images. The method is based on image segmentation using the Definiens Professional software. The top-down object-based classification is based on the Canadian Wetland Classification System and quickly and precisely identifies ecologically meaningful wetland polygons. The main objective of this study is to produce a wetland map of the Eastmain River watershed using a SPOT-4 image aimed at identifying five classes of wetlands (bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water) for a geographical unit of at least 1 ha, and to add to the peatland classes a description of their components, such as pool complexes and vegetation structures, to assign measured carbon values to these different peatland classes and scale up the data to obtain a regional carbon budget. The second objective of the study consists in determining whether SPOT-4 images can be used to map wetlands, using the object-based method developed with Landsat/RADARSAT-1 images, and if a finer spatial resolution would improve the wetland mapping results by adding information on wetland components. The SPOT-4 classification using the object-based method allowed the five main wetland classes to be identified in addition to pool complexes in three density classes (isolated, low density, and high density) and "bogs"/"fens" vegetation structure (treed or open) in peatland classes. Validation was done at two levels: (i) between the five classes of wetlands, and (ii) between pool complexes and vegetation structures. The overall accuracy was 81% for the first level and 75% for the second.

AB Drainage-driven changes in peatland ecosystems in Finland were studied, using aerial photographs taken in 1995 and 1946. The species composition of the vegetation cover was examined in one drained and one undrained mire in 1995. The data were correlated with tone and texture values of digitized colour infrared aerial photographs taken the same year, using canonical correspondence analysis. The results obtained were used to reconstruct the vegetation cover of the aerial photograph from 1946. The analysis clearly differentiated drained and undrained mire site types from each other, forming the moisture gradient in the first axis. The undrained mire site types were distributed along the nutrient gradient, but the correlation between site types and different tone values was relatively weak. The main difference between 1946 and 1995 was that the open and sparsely forested peatland vegetation types diminished and two drained mire site types (drained, pine-dominated Vaccinium type and drained, pine-dominated dwarf shrub type) became dominant. Digitized aerial photographs were unable to identify the vegetation at the mire site-type level, especially in natural habitats.

AB We studied phosphorous (P) export after clear-felling from eight Scots pine dominated, hydrologically isolated catchment areas located on a low-P sorptive peatland site in southern Finland, using the paired-catchments approach. Four of the catchment areas were clear-felled traditionally with stem-only harvesting, two areas were clear-felled using whole-tree harvesting, and the remaining two areas were treated with both whole-tree harvesting and stump harvesting. The effect of clear-felling on P loads varied considerably between the catchment areas from no increase to an increase of over 1.5 kg ha(-1) of P during the three-year-study period. The most significant factor explaining the variation in P loads and the variation in P concentrations in outflow water from clear-felled peatland catchments was the post-harvest water level position. At water table levels <20 cm below ground level (bgl), the P release from peat was greatly increased, and no influence was observed on P release at levels greater than 30 cm bgl. The water table depth explained about 50% of the variation in harvest induced P export, while the harvest method and the peat P sorption characteristics were not significant in explaining harvest-induced P loads or P concentrations after harvesting. The results of our study suggest that management of harvest residues may not be an efficient means of managing P export in operational forestry. In addition, forest management practices that do not lead to a rising of water table level near the soil surface in the entire harvest area, such as strip cutting and small-scale clear-cutting or harvesting small canopy openings, should be studied in order to reduce P export.

AB The amount of water in peat soil is one factor affecting its bearing capacity, which is a crucial aspect in planning peatland timber harvesting operations. We studied the influence of weather variables on the variation of drained peatland growing season water conditions, here the ground water table depth (WTD). WTD was manually monitored four times in 2014 and three times in 2015 in 10-30 sample plots located in four drained peatland forests in south-western Finland. For each peatland, precipitation and evapotranspiration were calculated from the records of the nearest Finnish Meteorological Institute field stations covering periods from one day to four weeks preceding the WTD monitoring date. A mixed linear model was constructed to investigate the impact of the weather parameters on WTD. Precipitation of the previous four-week period was the most important explanatory variable. The four-week evapotranspiration amount was interacting with the Julian day showing a greater effect in late summer. Other variables influencing WTD were stand volume within the three-metre radius sample plot and distance from nearest ditch. Our results show the potential of weather parameters, specifically that of the previous four-week precipitation and evapotranspiration, for predicting drained peatland water table depth variation and subsequently, the possibility to develop a more general empirical model to assist planning of harvesting operations on drained peatlands.

AB Drainage of peatlands is expected to turn these ecosystems into carbon sources to the atmosphere. We measured carbon dynamics of a drained forested peatland in southern Finland over 4 years, including one with severe drought during growing season. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method from a mast above the forest. Soil and forest floor CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured from the strips and from ditches with closed chambers. Biomass and litter production were sampled, and soil subsidence was measured by repeated levellings of the soil surface. The drained peatland ecosystem was a strong sink of carbon dioxide in all studied years. Soil CO2 balance was estimated by subtracting the carbon sink of the growing tree stand from NEE, and it showed that the soil itself was a carbon sink as well. A drought period in one summer significantly decreased the sink through decreased gross primary production. Drought also decreased ecosystem respiration. The site was a small sink for CH4, even when emissions from ditches were taken into account. Despite the continuous carbon sink, peat surface subsided slightly during the 10-year measurement period, which was probably mainly due to compaction of peat. It is concluded that even 50 years after drainage this peatland site acted as a soil C sink due to relatively small changes in the water table and in plant community structure compared to similar undrained sites, and the significantly increased tree stand growth and litter production. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB This study examines the influence of fire-induced deforestation in well-drained conifer sites on the development of adjacent, surviving spruce stands in peatlands at the arctic tree line (northern Quebec). Tree-ring and growth-form patterns of cross-dated black spruce (Picea mariana) remains in peat were used to analyze stand responses in two contrasting topographical settings: a moderately protected valley-bottom peatland, and an exposed hilltop peatland. Dense, old-growth spruce populations occupied the studied peatlands between the 11th and 16th centuries, with stunted and erect spruce dominating the hilltop and the valley sites, respectively. Spruce continued to colonize the peatlands as long as the adjacent well-drained sites were occupied by forest trees able to attenuate the damaging effect of winter snow-drifting conditions. The surviving conifer stands exhibited similar growth responses following deforestation of the well-drained sites by wildfire in AD 1567-1568. These responses included dieback of supranival (above snow) stems and death of trees due to drowning in permafrost-induced ponds. The postfire degradation and disappearance of the conifer stands from the peatlands were the ultimate stage of a positive feedback process triggered by a modification of the snow regime at the landscape scale. Deforestation of the well-drained sites led to reduced snow accumulation and enhanced snow-drift exposure, thus inducing permafrost aggradation and drainage impediment in the nearby peatland sites. While the hilltop conifer stand responded immediately to forest exclusion in the nearby sites, ecosystem changes in the valley peatland were delayed until AD 1580-1590, at the beginning of the Little Ice Age. Our results emphasize the sensitivity and connectedness of adjoining ecosystems to fire and frost disturbances in a changing subarctic landscape mosaic.

AB The microbial activity and bacterial community structure were investigated in two types of peat soil in a temperate marsh. The first, a drained grassland fen soil, has a neutral pH with partially degraded peat in the upper oxic soil horizons (16% soil organic carbon). The second, a bog soil, was sampled in a swampy forest and has a very high soil organic carbon content (45%), a low pH (45), and has occasional anoxic conditions in the upper soil horizons due to the high water table level. The microbial activity in the two soils was measured as the basal and substrate-induced respiration (SIR). Unexpectedly, the SIR (mu l CO2 g(-1) dry soil) was higher in the bog than in the fen soil, but lower when CO2 production was expressed per volume of soil. This may be explained by the notable difference in the bulk densities of the two soils. The bacterial communities were assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling of 16S rRNA genes and indicated differences between the two soils. The differences were determined by the soil characteristics rather than the season in which the soil was sampled. The 16S rRNA gene libraries, constructed from the two soils, revealed high proportions of sequences assigned to the Acidobacteria phylum. Each library contained a distinct set of phylogenetic subgroups of this important group of bacteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Peat deposits store more carbon than trees in forested peatlands of the
   boreal biome
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Peatlands are significant carbon (C) stores, playing a key role in nature-based climate change mitigation. While the effectiveness of non-forested peatlands as C reservoirs is increasingly recognized, the C sequestration function of forested peatlands remains poorly documented, despite their widespread distribution. Here, we evaluate the C sequestration potential of pristine boreal forested peatlands over both recent and millennial timescales. C stock estimates reveal that most of the carbon stored in these ecosystems is found in organic horizons (22.6-66.0 kg m(-2)), whereas tree C mass (2.8-5.7 kg m(-2)) decreases with thickening peat. For the first time, we compare the boreal C storage capacities of peat layers and tree biomass on the same timescale, showing that organic horizons (11.0-12.6 kg m(-2)) can store more carbon than tree aboveground and belowground biomass (2.8-5.7 kg m(-2)) even over a short time period (last 200 years). We also show that forested peatlands have similar recent rates of C accumulation to boreal non-forested peatlands but lower long-term rates, suggesting higher decay and more important peat layer combustion during fire events. Our findings highlight the significance of forested peatlands for C sequestration and suggest that greater consideration should be given to peat C stores in national greenhouse gas inventories and conservation policies.

AB Abundance and species number of the tree and shrub vegetation in different canopy layers were analysed according to site quality class and drainage succession phase on permanent sample plots on spruce mires (n=268) and pine mires (n=628) in the Finnish National Forest Inventory in 1995. The abundances based on the crown coverage were compared with the abundances based on the parallel basal area of the tree stand. The canopy coverages and species number for peatland forests were also compared with those for mineral soil forests on the permanent sample plots (n= 1725) in 1995.
   In general, effective temperature sum correlated positively, although not very strongly, with the coverages and species number in most of the canopy layers, as well as with the mean range of the diameter distribution. The effects of both site quality class and drainage phase were stronger on pine mires than on spruce mires, most probably due to the longer fertility gradient and large potential free growing space in the former group. On pine mires, drainage increased the abundances and species number in the different canopy layers, as well as the structural inequality of the tree stands. On spruce mires, the increase was principally allocated to the abundances of the dominant and intermediate tree layers. The correlations between the total crown coverage of the tree layers and stand basal area were r= 0.45 for spruce mires and r=0.70 for pine mires. Compared to mineral soil forests, in addition to having a higher abundance of Betulapubescens, the dominant layer was not as pronounced in peatland forests. On spruce mires, the coverage of the shrub layer on mesotrophic and meso-oligotrophic sites was higher than that in mineral soil forests. The average species number in different canopy layers did not differ significantly between spruce mires and mineral soil forests in corresponding site quality classes. On pine mires, the species number was generally lower (except for the mesotrophic sites) than that in corresponding mineral soil forests.

AB The demand for small-sized trees, logging residues, stumps, and lateral roots for energy production has increased during recent decades and therefore whole-tree harvesting (WTH) has become a more common harvesting method in forests. However, this may cause a more pronounced delay in the recovery of forest vegetation than conventional stem-only harvesting (SOH), especially in sensitive peatlands, and thus increase soil erosion. The effects of WTH have not been investigated on peatlands before this study. Recovery of understorey vegetation of drained peatland forests after two different tree harvesting methods, stem-only harvesting and whole-tree harvesting, was investigated in Eastern Finland at eight silviculturally managed peatland forests largely comprising Scots pine, Pima sylvesiris, and Norway spruce, Picea abies. In SOH, trunks only were removed from the sites whereas in WTH, tree trunks, branches, and stumps were removed. In each site, understorey vegetation (tree seedlings, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, herbs, and bryophytes) was inventoried on both mounded and unprepared soil (surfaces) on 220 permanent sample plots one and five years after harvesting. WTH had more pronounced effects on vegetation than SOH. Five to six years after the treatments, the occurrence of dwarf shrubs was lower in WTH than in SOH, whereas the cover of graminoids increased from both SOH and WTH. Soil preparation affected negatively on the recovery of peat and forest bryophytes, but positively on the recovery of some graminoid and herb species. Peat properties, e.g., pH and water table level, were found to regulate the recovery. WTH caused a longer delay on the recovery of understorey vegetation than SOH, especially if soil had been prepared. Thus, WTH cannot be recommended in drained peatland forests.

AB The fate of the Rare Earth Elements (REE) were investigated in different types of archives of atmospheric deposition in the Black Forest, Southern Germany: (1) a 70 cm snow pack collected on the domed part of a raised bog and representing 2 months of snow accumulation, (2) a snow sample collected close to the road about 500 m from the peat bog, (3) two species of lichens and (4) a peat profile representing 400 years of peat accumulation as well as a "preanthropogenic" sample and the living moss layer from the top of the core. REE concentrations in peat are significantly correlated to Ti which is a lithogenic conservative element suggesting that REE are immobile in peat bog environments. Snow, lichens and peat samples show similar PAAS (Post Archean Australian Shale) normalized REE distributions suggesting that the complete atmospheric REE signal is preserved in the peat profile. However, the annual flux of REE accumulated by the peat is ca. 10 times greater than that of the bulk winter flux of REE. This difference probably indicates that the REE concentrations in the snowpack are not representative of the average REE flux over the whole year. Despite the pronounced geological differences between this site (granite host-rock) and a previously studied peat bog in Switzerland (limestone host-rock) similar REE distribution patterns and accumulation rates were found at both sites. Given that both sites confirm an Upper Continental Crust signature, the data suggests both sites are influenced by regional and not local, soil-derived lithogenic aerosols. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB The distribution of primary minerals in a peat profile was investigated in a dated core (Pb-210, C-14) taken from the upper part of an ornbrotrophic bog. Using XRD, the most abundant minerals present in the peat were those of the local granite, suggesting that the dust entering the bog is mainly of local origin. Apatite and calcite are restricted to the top 8 cm of the profile, which suggests rapid dissolution. The release of P by apatite dissolution is possibly the main source of plant-available P to the oligotrophic waters. In contrast, quartz and feldspars appear to be preserved for thousands of years despite the low pH and abundance of organic acids. This study suggests that ombrotrophic peat bogs could be valuable archives of alummosilicate deposition since the Late Glacial.

AB Background: Although forest floor forms a large biomass pool in forested peatlands, little is known about its role in ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics.
   Aim: We aimed to quantify forest floor photosynthesis (P-FF) and respiration (R-FF) as a part of overall C dynamics in a drained peatland forest in southern Finland.
   Methods: We measured net forest floor CO2 exchange with closed chambers and reconstructed seasonal CO2 exchange in the prevailing plant communities.
   Results: The vegetation was a mosaic of plant communities that differed in CO2 exchange dynamics. The reconstructed growing season P-FF was highest in the Sphagnum community and lowest in the feather moss communities. On the contrary, R-FF was highest in the feather moss communities and lowest in the Sphagnum community. CO2 assimilated by the forest floor was 20-30% of the total CO2 assimilated by the forest. The forest floor was a net CO2 source to the atmosphere, because respiration from ground vegetation, tree roots and decomposition of soil organic matter exceeded the photosynthesis of ground vegetation.
   Conclusions: Tree stand dominates C fluxes in drained peatland forests. However, forest floor vegetation can have a noticeable role in the C cycle of peatlands drained for forestry. Similarly to natural mires, Sphagnum moss-dominated communities were the most efficient assimilators of C.

AB Forest harvesting on peatland sites during the frost-free season often creates water-filled ruts and transfers more humified layers of peat to the surface. Foresters have generally assumed that such disturbance has negative consequences related to proliferation of graminoid vegetation, disruption of surface drainage leading to raised water tables and, possibly, reduced site productivity. An experiment was established during 1996 near Cochrane, Ontario to examine the physical impacts of site disturbance on peatlands. Summer traffic by forest harvesting equip ment was imposed at three intensities on a Black Spruce-Speckled Alder site type. The fractional area of surface disturbance increased with the amount of traffic, but disturbance effects on the thickness of the aerated zone, depth to the water table, and microtopography were not significant. However, the consistency of the effects produced by the most intense disturbance treatment suggests that it reduced average elevations and aerobic layer thicknesses, and increased water levels, by 2 to 6 cm, The hydrological effect of site disturbance in this study was small compared with the typical effect of forest canopy removal on water levels.

AB Boreal peatlands play a major role in carbon and water cycling and other global environmental processes but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent representation of peatlands on, or omission from, many global land cover maps. The comparison of several widely used global and continental-scale databases on peatland distribution with a detailed map for the St. Petersburg region of Russia showed significant under-reporting of peatland area, or even total omission. Analysis of the spatial agreement and disagreement with the detailed regional map indicated that the error of comission (overestimation) was significantly lower than the error of omission (underestimation) which means, that overall, peatlands were correctly classified as such in coarse resolution datasets but a large proportion (74-99%) was overlooked. The coarse map resolution alone caused significant omission of peatlands in the study region. In comparison to categorical maps, continuous field mapping approach utilizing MODIS sensor data showed potential for a greatly improved representation of peatlands on coarse resolution maps. Analysis of spectral signatures of peatlands with different types of surface vegetation suggested that improved mapping of boreal peatlands on categorical maps is feasible. The lower reflectance of treeless peatlands in the near- and shortwave-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is consistent with the spectral signature of sphagnum mosses. However, when trees are present, the canopy architecture appears to be more important in defining the overall spectral reflectance of peatlands. A research focus on developing remote sensing methods for boreal peatlands is needed for adequate characterization of their global distribution.

DT Article
DE drainage; growth and yield; nutrients; peatland forestry
AB Drainage is an essential prerequisite in peatland forest management, which generally, but not always, increases stand growth. Growth response depends on weather conditions, stand and site characteristics, management and biogeochemical processes. We constructed a SUSI-simulator (SUoSImulaattori, in Finnish), which describes hydrology, stand growth and nutrient availability under different management, site types and weather conditions. In the model development and sensitivity analysis, we used water table (WT) and stand growth data from 11 Scots pine stands. The simulator was validated against a larger dataset collected from boreal drained peatlands in Finland. In validation, SUSI was shown to predict WT and stand growth well. Stand growth was mainly limited by inadequate potassium supply, and in Sphagnum peats by low oxygen availability. Model application was demonstrated for ditch network maintenance (DNM) by comparing stand growth with shallow (-0.3 m) and deep ditches (-0.9 m): The growth responses varied between 0.5 and 3.5 m(3) ha(-1) in five years, which is comparable to experimental results. SUSI can promote sustainable peatland management and help in avoiding unnecessary drainage operations and associated environmental effects, such as increased carbon emissions, peat subsidence, and nutrient leaching. The source code is publicly available, and the modular structure allows model extension to cost-benefit analyses and nutrient export to water courses.

AB We reviewed the studies on the impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from drained peatlands with the aim to identify the best practices for mitigation of detrimental water quality impacts. We concluded that so far there are no such practices that would effectively mitigate all harmful consequences of forest harvestings concurrently. Controlling water levels by executing drainage operations immediately after harvesting may decrease the exports of easily soluble and redox-sensitive elements, but the very intensive drainage necessary to lower water levels in highly decomposed peats, as those that typify peats at the clear-felling phase, would result in large exports of sediments and mineral nitrogen. Establishing a wetland buffer area between a forest harvested peatland and the receiving water course may decrease sediment and inorganic nutrient exports, but restored wetland buffers, in particular, may act as a source of DOC and dissolved organic nutrients to receiving water courses. Whole-tree harvesting might decrease nutrient exports in blanket peat areas, but its practical application is hindered by nutritional and forest harvest technology related aspects. We propose that future studies should focus on assessing the impacts of partial harvestings, which so far have received very limited attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands and forests cover large areas of the boreal biome and are critical for global climate regulation. They also regulate regional climate through heat and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere. Understanding how land-atmosphere interactions in peatlands differ from forests may therefore be crucial for modelling boreal climate system dynamics and for assessing climate benefits of peatland conservation and restoration. To assess the biophysical impacts of peatlands and forests on peak growing season air temperature and humidity, we analysed surface energy fluxes and albedo from 35 peatlands and 37 evergreen needleleaf forests-the dominant boreal forest type-and simulated air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over hypothetical homogeneous peatland and forest landscapes. We ran an evapotranspiration model using land surface parameters derived from energy flux observations and coupled an analytical solution for the surface energy balance to an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. We found that peatlands, compared to forests, are characterized by higher growing season albedo, lower aerodynamic conductance, and higher surface conductance for an equivalent VPD. This combination of peatland surface properties results in a similar to 20% decrease in afternoon ABL height, a cooling (from 1.7 to 2.5 degrees C) in afternoon air temperatures, and a decrease in afternoon VPD (from 0.4 to 0.7 kPa) for peatland landscapes compared to forest landscapes. These biophysical climate impacts of peatlands are most pronounced at lower latitudes (similar to 45 degrees N) and decrease toward the northern limit of the boreal biome (similar to 70 degrees N). Thus, boreal peatlands have the potential to mitigate the effect of regional climate warming during the growing season. The biophysical climate mitigation potential of peatlands needs to be accounted for when projecting the future climate of the boreal biome, when assessing the climate benefits of conserving pristine boreal peatlands, and when restoring peatlands that have experienced peatland drainage and mining.

AB After the lapse of 48 years, a renewed study on species composition of desmids was carried out at the Bloto peat bog in the Niepolomice Forest. During this period, the peat bog underwent far-reaching changes caused by man. Out of 41 species recorded by Wasylik (1955), the occurrence of only 11 was confirmed. However, 14 species absent at the time of the earlier study were found. In all, 25 species of desmids were found. ne present state of the desmid flora was brought about by increase of pH, draining of the area, disappearance of peat mosses and probably by eutrophication of waters in the studied area.

AB Drainage of waterlogged sites has been part of the normal forestry practice in Fennoscandia, the Baltic countries, the British Isles and in some parts of Russia since the early 20(th) century, and currently, about 15 million hectares of peatlands and other wetlands have been drained for forestry purposes. The rate of forest clear-felling on drained peatlands will undergo a rapid increase in the near future, when a large number of these forests approach their regeneration age. A small-scale pilot survey was performed at two nutrient-rich and old peatland drainage areas in southern Finland to study if forest clear-felling has significant impacts on the exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) between soil and atmosphere. The average N2O emissions from the two drainage areas during three growing seasons following clear-felling were 945 and 246 mug m(-2) d(-1). The corresponding CH4 fluxes were -0.07 and -0.52 mg m(-2) d(-1). Clear-felling had impacts on the environmental factors known to affect the N2O and CH4 fluxes of peatlands, i.e. clear-felling raised the water table level and increased the peat temperature. However, no substantial changes in the fluxes of CH4 following clear-felling were observed. The results concerning N2O indicated a potential for increased emissions following clear-felling of drained peatland forests, but further studies are needed for a critical evaluation of the impacts of clear-felling on the fluxes of CH4 and N2O.

AB Drainage is a globally common disturbance in forested peatlands that impacts peat soils, forest communities, and associated ecosystem functions, calling for informed hydrologic restoration strategies. The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in other degraded forested peatlands more broadly.

AB This study investigated the changes caused by management, including drainage and thinnings, in peatland forest stand structure. Drained peatland sites in Finnish North Karelia were compared within the same type groups and nutrient status levels of virgin peatlands in the Republic of Karelia, the Russian Federation. The Variables studied, which depict stand structure variation, included: (1) the diameter of the median tree; (2) the range of sampled diameters; (3) the basal area of the stand; (4) the estimated number of tree storeys; and (5) the number of the tree species. The number of tree storeys was determined through non-parametric Kernel estimation.
   Over a long duration, management smooths the natural multi-modal structure of virgin peatland stocking by decreasing the variation in size-distribution. Management also changes the natural tree species dynamics on peatland sites by providing a competitive advantage to the tree species, which adjust best to the changed growing conditions. These species begin to dominate the habitat and reduce the species diversity. The effect of recent thinnings and cleaning cuttings on the forest structure is dependent upon fertility of the site and the stage of the forest stock at the moment of silvicultural operation. Cleaning cuttings may have also an increasing effect on the structural diversity of peatland forest stand. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Soil preparation to expedite stand establishment after clearcutting is an extensively applied measure in peatland forest regeneration sites particularly in Fennoscandinavia. Thus far, the impact of preparing peat soil on greenhouse gas fluxes is a chapter unwritten in GHG research on forestry-drained peatlands. Not only is such information vital in order to accurately estimate the GHG balance nationally, it may dictate the very methods used to regenerate forests on peat soils in the future. Over a 22-month period, we studied the impacts of mounding and scalping relative to the control on soil CO2 (heterotrophic peat soil respiration, SRp), CH4, and N2O fluxes along a moisture gradient in a nutrient-poor, clearcut forestry-drained peatland. First, we measured instantaneous gas fluxes (g m(-2) h(-1)) of the microsite types (unprepared, mound, pit, scalp) within a given treatment plot (control, mounding, scalping) in order to estimate their annual rates (g m(-2) a(-1)). Then, we estimated annual flux rates for each treatment comprehensively by considering the surface area-based distribution of microsite types in the corresponding treatment plot, and finally, the overall climatic impact of GHG emissions expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (100-year GWP) 2-3 years after clearcutting and soil preparation. Compared to the control microsites, instantaneous CO2 emissions from scalps and pits were lower while those from mounds equivalent. However, increased CO2 emissions from the unprepared microsites within prepared plots were observed in respect to those of the control. Comprehensively, the annual CO2 emission rates differed little between treatments, ranging between 929 and 1078 g m(-2) a(-1). Hence, neither mounding nor scalping accelerated annual SRp relative to the control treatment. Annual fluxes of CH4 were dependent on the position of the water table. In our wet block, the mounding treatment led to the greatest annual CH4 emissions (3.62 g m(-2) a(-1)), followed by the control (2.14 g m(-2) a(-1)) and scalping (1.05 g m(-2) a(-1)); in the dry block, however, only the scalping treatment was a net, though minimal, source of CH4 (0.80 g m(-2) a(-1)) while the other two treatments effectively consumed CH4 (mounding -0.16 g m(-2) a(-1); control -0.05 g m(-2) a(-1)). Though annual N2O emission levels were low (0.05-0.08 g m(-2) a(-1)), both soil preparation treatments increased the flux of N2O from peat soil compared to the control. When considering the fluxes of all three greenhouse gases, the cumulative impact of soil preparation (mounding or scalping) on the global warming potential of the nutrient-poor, clearcut peatland forest was negligible in respect to the control.

AB Treatment wetlands are considered best management practice as they can remove nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended solids from peat extraction or forestry runoff. Treatment wetlands are established on intact or formerly drained peatlands after restoration of the site hydrology by ditch blocking or other methods. However, drainage changes the physical properties of peat, so the hydraulic and hydrological conditions in peatlands may change. Consequently, treatment wetlands constructed on drained areas may have short residence times, resulting in poor purification results. This study determined the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of treatment wetlands constructed on drained peatlands by studying peat hydraulic conductivity and water distribution in 20 different wetlands in Finland. Four wetlands were studied in more detail using tracer tests, water balance and continuous groundwater measurements. More than 50% of the drained treatment wetlands studied had a lower active flow depth layer (only 10 or 20 cm) with higher hydraulic conductivity (K) than normally found in pristine peatlands. At 25% of the sites, K was high at all depths investigated (down to 60-70 cm). At several sites, the water was unequally distributed across the wetland surface, indicating that only part of the wetland was being used for purification. The residence time, as determined by tracer tests, varied significantly between sites. These results indicate that past drainage still influences the hydraulics of treatment wetlands.

AB Due to the scarcity of reliable and highly resolved moisture proxies covering much of the Holocene, there has been increased interest in the study of living and subfossil peatland trees sensitive to gradual and extreme changes in hydrology, precipitation, and related environmental processes. Peatland development and the associated carbon accumulation, which are strongly influenced by hydrological fluctuations, are also of prime importance as peatlands represent long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon. Improved knowledge of peatland development and soil moisture variability during the Holocene is therefore essential to our understanding of long-term hydroclimate changes, the terrestrial carbon cycle, and to enable more robust predictions of peatland response to future climate changes.
   Here, we review the existing mid- to late Holocene peatland tree-ring chronologies that have been used to study climate variability on (sub-)annual to centennial scales with a primary focus on northern Europe. Since the 1970s, absolutely dated tree-ring chronologies covering substantial parts of the Holocene have been developed from excavated remains of oak (Quercus spp.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L). The annual tree-ring patterns of these trees are often characterized by periods of depressed growth reflecting annual to decadal hydroclimatic changes. In addition, changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of trees throughout the Holocene are often found to reflect decadal to centennial climate and hydrological changes. Moreover, synchronicity between tree-ring chronologies and tree-population dynamics over larger geographical areas show periods of coherent regional climate forcing, especially during the mid-Holocene.
   This review (i) provides an overview of pioneering and recent studies presenting tree-ring chronologies developed from subfossil peatland trees, and (ii) presents recent developments in the fields of dendroecology (i.e. the response of tree growth and changes in vitality as a result of changes in climatic variables) and dendroclimatology (i.e. the reconstruction of climate fluctuations based on tree-ring analyses) in peatland regions. Moreover, we (iii) use long-term climate reconstructions based on alternative proxies for comparison, and (iv) present different ways to analyse tree-ring records to generate novel information on annual to centennial timescales. This analysis is based on an unprecedented network of tree-ring chronologies from Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Canada, as well as a wealth of old and previously (un) published literature from Scandinavia and Germany, which has not been accessible to a wider audience in the past due to inaccessibility or linguistic barriers. Finally, a map of possible hotspots for the assessment of continuous peatlandtree studies is presented, along with suggestions for new research directions in the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the UK, large areas of blanket bogs were afforested with non-native conifers between the 1960s and the 1980s. Following recognition of the detrimental effects of such practice on biodiversity and carbon stocks, large-scale restoration trials started in the late 1990s and are further supported by recent changes in policy. The removal of forestry from peatlands is likely to be a widespread land-use change in the coming decades and could affect adjacent freshwater systems. This study aimed to investigate whether forestry removal with drain blocking affected nearby spawning sites used by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We analysed the chemistry of hyporheic (beneath and just above the streambed) and surface water, and measured sediment deposition upstream of, within and downstream of a forestry block in the north of Scotland, during and after restoration management operations. We found no immediate effect of management except on potassium and zinc concentrations, which increased after restoration. The general lack of effect is attributed to catchment properties, including the small proportion of catchment (< 5 %) affected by management, and to dilution effects related to heavy precipitation during the intervention phase. We suggest that longer-term monitoring should be implemented as the sizes of areas undergoing restoration management increases.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Trees of Pinus rotundata (bog pine) characterise many bogs in the mid-altitude mountains of central Europe (Switzerland, East and South Germany, Czech Republic). The research described here focuses on recent changes in the growth of bog pine on the Ennersbacher Moor, a mountain mire in the Black Forest (south-west Germany). An increase in the cover of bog pine is usually caused by drainage and subsequent drawdown of the water table. However, this bog has not been drained or directly disturbed in any other way. One possible explanation is that a road constructed in 1983 along one margin of the bog has diverted part of its water supply. Even though the road was designed to conduct potentially salt-contaminated drainage water away from the bog, its construction did not cause an immediate vegetation response in the 1980s and 1990s. Therefore, I hypothesise that it enhanced the sensitivity of the bog to climatic stress, predisposing it to a succession that was eventually triggered by a series of drought years in 2009-2011. Data collected near the centre of the bog over the period 1998-2014 indicate not only a distinct change in the relationship between height and trunk circumference of the trees, but also an increase of dwarf shrub cover and changes in the composition of Sphagnum communities. Although the pH of near-surface water may have increased slightly over this period, pH and EC values remain within typical ranges for raised bogs in the Black Forest. Examination of peat profiles reveals that the peat is more highly humified now than it was in 2002, and water table records from 2012-2014 show a greater amplitude of fluctuation than water table data collected in 1998-2001. Even though its mean level is only 105 mm below the ground surface, the water table is now observed to fall rapidly to depths of at least 350 mm during both wet and dry summers. Mapping surface (meso) topography and flow lines from the adjacent slope shows that the Ennersbacher Moor is not domed in this direction, so that water arriving from upslope would reach the bog centre if the road were not present. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that the observed succession is a delayed effect of construction of the road.

AB Reducing the strain on water bodies caused by sediment loads released after ditch network maintenance (DNM) is addressed in operational peatland forestry by implementing sediment control structures in ditches. This study evaluates computationally alternative sediment control scenarios in a 5.2 ha deep peat site in eastern Finland. Coupled to a distributed hydrological model, peat erosion and transport in the ditches were simulated for the first year after DNM with 15 scenarios consisting of individual structures (e.g., sedimentation ponds) and their combinations. One scenario represented the prevailing conditions with a V-notch weir at the catchment outlet. All scenarios were evaluated against a baseline scenario in which no structures affected the catchment sediment processes. The results suggested that bed erosion can be efficiently prevented with breaks in cleaning and structures ponding water. It was proven less efficient to trap already eroded material with sedimentation ponds and pits. The structures raising ditch water level had limited effects on water table levels in the strips between ditches, plausibly not impairing tree growth. The process-based modeling presented here provided a yet unexplored approach to comprehensively evaluating alternatives for sediment control, which is highly needed to address the gap between existing scientific knowledge and operational peatland forestry practices.

AB Wapusk National Park is part of the Hudson Bay Lowlands in Manitoba and covers 11 475 km(2). Lichen surveys were initiated in 2002 but none have reported all species incorporating broad habitat types or a baseline on which to make management decisions. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine species diversity, including species richness and evenness of the lichens present; 2) to explore species distributions; and 3) to compare lichen growth form and substratum relationships among physiographic regions. Fifty-six locations in four habitat types (physiographic regions: open coastal beach ridge, forested coastal beach ridge, boreal transition forest, and peat plateau bog) and three burned locations were visited over nine years and specimens were collected at each location. A total of 276 species and subspecies were collected. One species is new to Canada (Buellia uberior Anzi) and ten species are new to Manitoba. Species diversity, evenness, and richness were highest in the coastal beach ridge. The open coastal beach ridge, boreal transition forest, and peat plateau bogs formed separate clusters in the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) but the forested coastal beach ridge overlapped with the open coastal beach ridge. Unique species in each region may serve as indicators to monitor long-term changes. While the coastal beach ridge facilitates travel along the coast, it also represents the region with the highest need for intervention to conserve species diversity.

AB Wood ash contains all the essential plant nutrients except nitrogen, and thus supports tree growth especially on peatlands where mineral nutrients often are in short supply. Here we report the effects of wood ash fertilization on the soil microbial community in a boreal drained peatland, characterized by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and more specifically the fungal community, characterized with PCR-DGGE fingerprinting and sequencing methods. We investigated the microbial communities in unfertilized and ash-fertilized sample plots (loose wood ash 5000 or 15 000 kg ha(-1)) 6 years after fertilization. Microbial function measured as heterotrophic basal respiration increased over 30% in the surface peat layer after wood ash fertilization, yet the result was statistically insignificant. The higher amount of wood ash induced a shift in the microbial community in the surface peat layer (0-10 cm) along with an increase in pH. A higher relative proportion of fungal-specific PLFA 18:2 omega 6 and an increased fungal:bacterial ratio indicated that fungi benefited from the higher amount of wood ash in the topmost layer. Also, the lower amount of wood ash seemed to have stimulated actinobacteria. Our results indicated that higher pH and extra nutrients due to wood ash fertilization promoted the appearance of mycorrhizal and wood-decomposing fungi directly or via increased tree growth. We suggest that wood ash as a fertilizer would be a natural and economical choice to improve the nutrient status of drained peatlands used for forestry since it maintains the positive feedback between fungi and trees.

AB The relative abundance of species of testate amoebae (Testacea; Rhizopoda) was established from 107 surface moss samples from a forested peatland in northeastern Ontario. These were related by multivariate analysis to a number of microenvironmental conditions including soil moisture content, water table, bulk density, humification, dominant peat component, pH, peat depth, depth of living moss, dominant surface moss species, vegetation type, microtopographical position, and artificial drainage. Moisture conditions play a key role in determining the species assemblages, pH being a secondary factor. Other environmental parameters related to species assemblages do not necessarily indicate a direct ecological link but are also associated with moisture and nutrient conditions. Individual species are ranked in terms of their preferred moisture conditions and compared with data from Finland. Certain species are restricted to either dry or wet conditions while others tolerate a wide range of moisture. Calculating weighted averages of substrate moisture contents for a greater range of species sampled from a larger number of sites will allow the development of transfer functions for constructing palaeomoisture curves from peatlands.

AB About 15 million hectares of peat soils have been drained for forestry in temperate and boreal zones. Increasing interest in wood biomass as a source of bioenergy has led to more intensive harvests also in peatland forests. These harvestings remove branches, needles, and stump/root systems that would earlier have remained onsite. However, in drained peatland forests, some key growth-limiting nutrients, such as potassium (K) and boron (B), are largely stored in the living tree biomass, while the stores in peat in tree rooting layer are small. A concern has thus been raised that bioenergy harvesting may induce nutrient insufficiency and decrease second rotation forest productivity. We studied the effect of whole-tree and stump harvesting on site nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), K, and B capitals in final harvesting of a well-productive, Norway spruce-dominated peatland forest. Harvesting of stumps and above-ground harvest residues resulted in minor depletion of site N and P stores, but significant depletion of K and B. Maximizing harvest residue biomass recovery, but minimizing nutrient depletion, our results indicated that stump harvesting is a more feasible option than harvesting of above-ground residues. If above-ground harvest residues are to be harvested for bioenergy, K and B depletion may be decreased by letting the branches dry out somewhat and the needles fall down before branch harvesting. Combining our results with data on waterborne K losses suggested that K depletion may become a serious problem in second rotation forests on drained peatlands, even if harvest residues and stumps were left completely non-harvested.

AB Subfossil bog oak material is an important palaeo-climate and hydrology proxy for the Holocene. A correct interpretation of the subfossil material in terms of growth and population dynamics requires understanding of the underlying processes. The catastrophic rewetting after dyke-failure of a drained peatland forest in NE-Germany provides a unique natural laboratory to calibrate bog oak growth pattern with a known event. Growth differences among groups of currently vital, damaged and dead oaks in the years before the flooding were used to estimate the adaptation potential in dependence on age, tree-size, competition class and groundwater table. Dendrochronological analysis of growth patterns and wood-anatomical parameters revealed changes in the wood in reaction to sharp hydrological shifts (drainage and rewetting). Group specific chronologies were contrasted against instrumental data to evaluate the influence of climate and hydrology on radial growth of oak. Groundwater table proved to be the overriding factor influencing oak growth at our site, already during times of intensive drainage. Results show an influence of micro-site conditions (elevation above soil-water level) along with a higher chance for slower growing and possibly former suppressed trees to survive the catastrophic rewetting. These trees display a typical ring-pattern with four to five years of depressed growth and a subsequent recovery, characterised by a significant increase in ring-width, especially in the earlywood. Trees that died or were damaged following the rewetting typically show strongly reduced latewood-width before they gradually die-off. Our findings are discussed with regard to the interpretation of subfossil bog oak material and a modified version of release detection analysis is proposed as a tool to sharpen the identification of hydrological shifts in bog oak material. The results of the study can contribute to a better understanding of ecophysiological mechanisms underlying growth reactions (and adaptation potential) of oaks to prevailing high water levels.

AB Bacteria in peat forest soil play important role in global carbon cycling. The distribution of bacteria population in different peat soils as a whole and how forest management practices alter the bacterial populations are still poorly known. Using pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene, we quantified the diversity and community structure of bacteria in eight peat forest soils (pristine and drained) and two mineral forest soils from Lakkasuo, Finland with either spruce-dominant or pine-dominant tree species. In total, 191,229 sequences which ranged from 15,710 to 22,730 per sample were obtained and affiliated to 13 phyla, 30 classes and 155 genera, The peat forest soils showed high bacterial diversity and species richness. The tree species seems to have more strong impact on the bacterial diversity than the type of peat soil, which drives the changes in bacterial community structure. The dominant taxonomic groups across all soils (>1% of all sequences) were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. The relative abundance of bacteria phylum and genus differed between soil types and between vegetation. Significant differences in relative abundance of bacteria phyla were only found for Gemmatimonadetes and Cyanobacteria between the pristine and the drained peat forest soils. At genus level, the relative abundance of several genera differed significantly between the peat soils with same or different tree species, including Burkholderia, Caulobacter, Opitutus, Mucilanginibacter, Acidocella, Mycobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Dyella and Rhodanobacter.

AB Blocking drainage ditches and creating bunds to limit surface water losses are important for restoring abandoned peat-extraction sites in North America. However, these runoff control techniques have not been well characterized, particularly during the snowmelt period. Therefore, patterns of runoff timing and magnitude were evaluated in a peatland (Bois-des-Bel, Quebec, Canada) undergoing restoration (restored site), in comparison with an unrestored section of the same peatland (unrestored site). Snowmelt dominated runoff, representing over 79% of the April to August runoff for both sites in 2001. Low (25-35 cm) bunds constructed on the restored site detained water for much of the melt period, but some water loss occurred where bunds were breached. Overland flow and surface ponding were prevalent at the restored site, but were not evident at the unrestored site. At the restored site, the presence of bunds and frozen, saturated (thus impermeable) ground contributed to differences in snowmelt runoff patterns relative to the unrestored site. In the post-snowmelt period (May-August 2001 and 2002), restored site runoff was reduced to 25% of that lost at the unrestored site. Both hydrometric and chemical hydrograph separation analysis using electrical conductivity indicated that blocked ditches restricted water losses from much of the restored site during the summer months, when the bunds had little effect on runoff. However, discharge peaks were greater at the restored site relative to the unrestored site and generally occurred more quickly following rainfall, because of the wetter antecedent conditions.

AB High-latitude warming could cause northern peatlands to become C sources. Where peattands border boreal forests, strong differences in ecosystem C balances reflect drainage differences. Because local drainage conditions could be influenced by alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, peatland-forest ecotones represent useful locations for monitoring potential impacts of global warming. We characterized the soils, hydrology, and forest structure along transects bracketing a peatland-forest ecotone in southeastern Alaska. We expected to find soil properties and processes at the peatland-forest edge that were intermediate between those from peatland and forest. Instead, we found that above- and belowground features of the ecotone did not coincide. Conifers grew on mineral soils, but also grew on Cryofibrists and Cryohemists, soils with high soil organic C (SOC) contents to 100 cm (57 kg m(-2)) that are significantly greater than the SOC contents of adjacent forested, non-Histosol pedons. Soil ;respiration rates (SRR) at peatland-forest edges (0.08 g CO2-C m(-2) h(-1)), by contrast, were threefold lower than forest rates and did not differ significantly from peatland rates. Respiration rates were strongly influenced by water table height. Peattand and edge water tables were both significantly shallower than forest water tables. Our conceptual model suggests that if additional forest expansion and warmer summers enhance drainage of these edge soils and stimulate SRR to forest-like levels, 23 kg C m(-2) could ultimately be mineralized from these extensive peatland-forest boundaries. Afforestation of peattand margins under this scenario could represent a transient positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB Ditches are common in landscapes influenced by agricultural, forestry, and peat mining activities, and their value as corridors remains unassessed. Pond-breeding amphibians can encounter hostile environments when moving between breeding, summering, or hibernation sites, and are likely to benefit from the presence of ditches in the landscape. Within a system consisting of ditch networks in bogs mined for peat in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, I quantified the breeding, survival, and movements of green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota) in drainage ditches and also surveyed peat fields. Frogs rarely ventured on peat fields and most individuals frequented drainage ditches containing water, particularly in late summer. Though frogs did not breed in ditches, their survival rate in ditches was high (88%). Ditches did not hinder frog movements, as frogs moved independently of the current. Results indicate that drainage ditches containing water enable some movements between habitats isolated by peat mining, in contrast to peat surfaces, and suggest they function as amphibian movement corridors. Thus, such drainage ditches may mitigate the effects of peat extraction on amphibian populations. At the very least, these structures provide an alternative to hostile peat surfaces. This study highlights that small-scale corridors are potentially valuable in population dynamics.

AB The sustainability argument that more peat grows in Finland than is used does not hold. On designated peatlands, growth is about 85 times slower than peat use; growth elsewhere in Finland does not add to available resources. Claiming undisturbed peatlands as carbon sinks for sustainable peat use is also misleading as anthropogenic carbon sources require additional sinks, not natural ones. Undisturbed peatlands usually emit significant quantities of methane. About 57 000 km(2) of forestry drained peatlands now have effectively stopped emitting methane, and temporarily accumulate more carbon annually than earlier. These greenhouse reducing aspects are only modestly compensated or 'used' by emissions from peat used for energy. However, as forests mature and the peat underneath continues to oxidise, the new carbon sink will eventually turn into a carbon source. Multiple claims of this very same anthropogenic carbon sink (perhaps by the peat, paper and timber industry), i.e. double counting, may be avoided by certifying these sinks. After peat harvesting (liberating in the order of 375 kg atmospheric carbon per m(2)), wood in a production/harvest cycle may be grown (at 0.1 kgC/m(2) per a) on the now available area, as a renewable energy source. These numbers indicate the slow rate at which these cycles, that are in principle carbon neutral in themselves, help compensate for the carbon emissions from the earlier use of peat by avoiding the emissions of fossil fuels otherwise used.

AB The precursory mire of the Middle Pennsylvanian (Bolsovian) Lower Radnice Coal was buried in situ by volcanic ash, preserving the taxonomic composition, spatial distribution, vertical stratification, and synecology of this peat-forming ecosystem in extraordinary detail. Plant fossil remains represent the pre-eruption vegetation of the swamp, which resulted from accumulation of peat in a high-ash, planar (rheotrophic) mire situated in a narrow palaeovalley containing an active fluvial system. A tuff bed (the Belka) at the base of the volcaniclastic Whetstone Horizon was exposed in two contiguous excavations over an area of 50 m(2) in the Radnice Basin of western Bohemia, Czech Republic. Twenty-seven morphotaxa were identified, representing 20 whole-plant species with a wide variety of growth forms. The canopy of the peat-forming community was dominated by Cordaites borassifolius trees together with the arborescent lycopsid "Lepidodendron" (= Paralycopodites), whereas Lepidophloios cf. acerosus was subdominant. Evidence suggests that the laterally extensive "crowns" of these arborescent lycopsids; would have overlapped during the final phase of their life cycles, but differences in the height of tree species resulted in a complex and vertically variable canopy interrupted by randomly distributed gaps. The understorey was dominated by medullosan pteridosperms and marattialean tree ferns, whereas zygopterid ferns and sphenophylls; comprised the bulk of the ground cover. In comparison with the canopy, understorey and ground cover species were less abundant and patchier in distribution, with almost complete absence beneath the deep shade of C. borassifolius trees. Lianas that entwined arborescent trees were an important component of the peat-forming forest. Three lyginopterid pteridosperm species along with a sphenophyll had a lianescent habit based on their close association with upright or prone lycopsid trunks and "canopy" branches. Species richness in the swamp superficially appears low. However, considering the small area of excavation, along with the higher diversity known from the same tuff bed in the adjacent, former opencast Ovcin Mine, it appears that species richness in the forest was comparable to some of the less diverse Westphalian peat-forming swamps in the U.S.A. The Lower Radnice mire vegetation was compositionally homogeneous, but had a heterogeneous distribution with patchiness occurring at a very fine scale. The preserved plant assemblage most resembles mires dominated by medullosan pteridosperms and Paralycopodites described from upper Westphalian coal balls in the U.S.A., which were characterised by high diversity in all storeys and involved plants centred in high-ash peat-forming swamps.

AB Peatlands and peaty riparian zones are major sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but are poorly understood in terms of export dynamics and controls thereof. Thereby quality of DOM affects function and behavior of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but DOM quality can also help to track DOM sources and their export dynamics under specific hydrologic preconditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate controls on temporal variability in DOM concentration and quality in stream water draining a bog and a forested peaty riparian zone, particularly considering drought and storm flow events. DOM quality was monitored using spectrofluorometric indices for aromaticity (SUVA(254)), apparent molecular size (S-R) and precursor organic material (FI), as well as PARAFAC modeling of excitation emission matrices (EEMs).
   Indices for DOM quality exhibited major changes due to different hydrologic conditions, but patterns were also dependent on season. Stream water at the forested site with mineral, peaty soils generally exhibited higher variability in DOM concentrations and quality compared to the outflow of an ombrotrophic bog, where DOM was less susceptible to changes in hydrologic conditions. During snowmelt and spring events, near-surface protein-like DOM pools were exported. A microbial DOM fraction originating from ground-water and deep peat layers was increasing during drought, while a strongly microbially altered DOM fraction was also exported by discharge events with dry preconditions at the forested site. This might be due to accelerated microbial activity in the peaty riparian zone of the forested site under these preconditions. Our study demonstrated that DOM ex-port dynamics are not only a passive mixing of different hydrological sources, but monitoring studies have to consider that DOM quality depends on hydrologic preconditions and season. Moreover, the forested peaty riparian zone generated the most variability in headwater DOM quantity and quality, as could be tracked by the used spectrofluorometric indices.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands are annually reported to the UNFCCC For the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances on a country-wide basis, It is necessary to know how soil-atmosphere fluxes are associated with variables that are available for spatial upscaling We measured momentary soil-atmosphere CO2 (heterotrophic and total soil respiration), CH4 and N2O fluxes at 68 forestry-drained peatland sites in Finland over two growing seasons We estimated annual CO2 effluxes for the sites using site-specific temperature regressions and simulations in half-hourly time steps Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were interpolated from the measurements We then tested how well climate and site variables derived from forest inventory results and weather statistics could be used to explain between-site variation in the annual fluxes The estimated annual CO2 effluxes ranged from 1165 to 4437 g m(-2) year(-1) (total soil respiration) and from 534 to 2455 g m(-2) year(-1) (heterotrophic soil respiration) Means of 95% confidence intervals were +/- 12% of total and +/- 22% of heterotrophic soil respiration Estimated annual CO2 efflux was strongly correlated with soil respiration at the reference temperature (10 degrees C) and with summer mean air temperature. Temperature sensitivity had little effect on the estimated annual fluxes Models with tree stand stem volume, site type and summer mean air temperature as independent variables explained 56% of total and 57% of heterotrophic annual CO2 effluxes. Adding summer mean water table depth to the models raised the explanatory power to 66% and 64% respectively Most of the sites were small CH4 sinks and N2O sources The interpolated annual CH4 flux (range -0 97 to 12 50 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by summer mean water table depth (r(2) = 64%) and rather weakly by tree stand stern volume (r(2) = 22%) and mire vegetation cover (r(2) = 15%) N2O flux (range. -0 03 to 092 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by peat CN ratio (r(2) = 35%). Site type explained 13% of annual N2O flux We suggest that water table depth should be measured in national land-use inventories for improving the estimation of country-level GHG fluxes for peatlands (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Bulk densities and chemical properties of surface peat (0-60 cm) of three ombrotrophic pine bogs were measured before and three growing seasons after fertilization. One site was located in each of the countries Norway, Sweden and Finland. Bulk density of peat ranged from 56 in Norway, 78 in Sweden to 130 g dm(-3) in Finland. Bulk density seems to vary along a sub-coastal to sub-continental gradient for the bog type. When compared to the biological demands of the tree stands, the surface peat stores of extractable K, P and B were low before fertilization. Depletion from the peat on fertilized plots (uptake and/or leaching) were rather high for K, B, Mn and Zn. Especially the sodium borate (borax fertilizer) was susceptible to leaching. Only minor changes occurred in pH and cation exchange capacity after fertilization, whereas base saturation was raised, especially in the upper layer (010 cm). A high proportion of total K, Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn were on exchangeable sites (63-92%), while P, S. B and Fe were mainly fixed (72-95%). Estimated net carbon loss from the peat at drainage was 100 g C m(-2) year(-1), while at additional fertilization the loss was only 6 g.

AB Drainage and conversion of natural peatlands to forestry increases soil CO2 emissions through decomposition of peat and modifies the quantity and quality of litter inputs and therefore the soil carbon balance. In organic soils, CO2 net emissions and removals are reported using carbon emission factors (EF). The choice of specific default Tier 1 EF values from the IPCC 2013 Wetlands supplement depends on land-use categories and climate zones. However, Tier 1 EF for afforested peatlands in the temperate maritime climate zone are based on data from eight sites, mainly located in the hemiboreal zone, and the uncertainty associated with these default values is a concern. In addition, moving from Tier 1 to higher-Tier carbon reporting values is highly desirable when large areas are affected by land-use changes. In this study, we estimated site-specific soil carbon balance for the development of Tier 2 soil CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands. Soil heterotrophic respiration and aboveground tree litterfall were measured during two years at eight afforested peatland sites in Ireland. In addition, fine-root turnover rate and site-specific fine-root biomass were used to quantify belowground litter inputs. We found that drainage of peatlands and planting them with either Sitka spruce or lodgepole pine, resulted in soils being net carbon sources. The soil carbon balance at multi-year sites varied between 63 +/- 92 and 309 +/- 67 g C m(-2) year(-1). Mean CO2-C EF for afforested peatlands was 1.68 +/- 0.33 t CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1). The improved CO2-C EFs presented here for afforested peatlands are proposed as a basis to update national CO2-C emissions from this land-use class in Ireland. Furthermore, new data from these sites will significantly contribute to the development of more reliable IPCC default Tier 1 CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands in the maritime temperate climate zone.

AB Management changes such as drainage, fertilisation, afforestation and harvesting (clearfelling) of forested peatlands influence watertable (WT) position and groundwater concentrations of nutrients. This study investigated the impact of clearfelling of a peatland forest on WT and nutrient concentrations. Three areas were examined: (1) a regenerated riparian peatland buffer (RB) clearfelled four years prior to the present study (2) a recently clearfelled coniferous forest (CF) and (3) a standing, mature coniferous forest (SF), on which no harvesting took place. The WT remained consistently below 0.3 m during the pre-clearfelling period. Results showed there was an almost immediate rise in the WT after clearfelling and a rise to 0.15 m below ground level (bgl) within 10 months of clearfelling. Clearfelling of the forest increased dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations (from an average of 28-230 mu g L-1) in the shallow groundwater, likely caused by leaching from degrading brash mats.

AB Peat plateaus are important landscape features of many high-boreal, wetland-dominated drainage basins. Raised up to 2 m above the surrounding landscape and underlain by permafrost, these forested peatlands provide meltwater drainage to the surrounding wetlands, and to basin runoff. Understanding the factors that control the volume and timing of runoff from peat plateaus is the essential first step towards developing methods of accurately predicting basin runoff from wetland-dominated basins in the region of discontinuous permafrost, as well as understanding the basin response to hydrological changes brought on by the thermal degradation and thaw of permafrost peatlands. In this study, a water balance approach and the Dupuit-Forchheimer equation were used to quantify sub-surface runoff from a forested peat plateau at Scotty Creek, a small (152 km(2)), wetlanddominated discontinuous permafrost basin in Northwest Territories, Canada. These two computations yielded similar results in both years of study (2004-2005), and showed that runoff accounted for approximately half of the moisture loss from the peat plateau, most of which occurred in response to snowmelt inputs. The melt of ground ice was also a significant source of water during the study periods, which was largely detained in soil storage. Soil moisture conditions prior to soil freezing were a major factor controlling the volume of runoff from the hillslope. Sub-surface drainage rates declined dramatically after the snowmelt runoff period, when the majority of water inputs went to soil storage and evapotranspiration. The minimal lag between rain events and hydrograph response in both years suggests that much of the runoff produced from rain events is rapidly transported to the adjacent wetlands. These results give insight into how current climate warming predictions for northern latitudes could affect the hydrological response of forested peat plateaus, and the basins which they occupy.

TI FACIES DEVELOPMENT IN THE LOWER FREEPORT COAL BED, WEST-CENTRAL
   PENNSYLVANIA, USA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

ID APPALACHIAN BASIN USA; SWAMP VEGETATION; ILLINOIS
AB The Lower Freeport coal bed in west-central Pennsylvania is interpreted to have formed within a lacustrine-mire environment. Conditions of peat formation, caused by the changing chemical and physical environments, produced five coal facies and two mineral-rich parting facies within the coal bed. The coal bed facies are compositionally unique, having developed under varying conditions, and are manifested by megascopic, petrographic, palynologic and quality characteristics.
   The initial environment of the Lower Freeport peat resulted in a coal facies that is relatively high in ash yield and contains large amounts of lycopod miospores and moderate abundances of crypto-telinite, crypto-gelocollinite, inertinite and tree fem miospores. This initial Lower Freeport peat is interpreted to have been a topogenous body that was low lying, relatively nutrient rich (mesotrophic to eutrophic), and susceptible to ground water and to sediment influx from surface water. The next facies to form was a ubiquitous, clay-rich durain parting which is attributed to a general rise in the water table accompanied by widespread flooding. Following formation of the parting, peat accumulation resumed within an environment that inhibited clastic input. Development of doming in this facies restricted deposition of the upper shale parting to the margins of the mire and allowed low-ash peat to form in the interior of the mire. Because this environment was conducive to preservation of cellular tissue, this coal facies also contains large amounts of crypto-telinite. This facies development is interpreted to have been a transitional phase from topogenous, planar peat formation to slightly domed, oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) peat formation. As domed peat formation continued, fluctuations in the water table enabled oxidation of the peat surface and produced high inertinite concentrations toward the top of the coal bed. Tree ferns became an increasingly important peat contributor in these upper facies, based on the palynoflora. This floral change is interpreted to have resulted from the peat surface becoming less wet or better drained, a condition that inhibited proliferation of lycopod trees. Accumulation of the peat continued until rising water levels formed a freshwater lake within which clays and silts were deposited.
   The development of the Lower Freeport peat from a planar mire through transitional phases toward domed peat formation may be an example of the type of peat formation of other upper Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian coal beds.

AB Relationships between the distribution and specific leaf area (SLA: leaf area per unit dry mass) of six heath (Ericaceae) species were investigated along an environmental gradient between peat bogs and conifer forest in British Columbia, Canada. I asked whether patterns in SLA could help to identify the processes shaping plant distributional patterns. Specifically, I assessed whether (i) species' distributions across the environmental gradient are correlated with SLA (ii) relationships between plant distributional patterns and SLA are similar among bogs with different shrub species (iii) intraspecific patterns in SLA parallel interspecific relationships between distributions and SLA, and (iv) intraspecific patterns are environmentally determined. Results showed that distributional patterns were often correlated with SLA; species with lower SLA were more abundant towards the centre of bogs, while species with higher SLA were more abundant in forest. Intraspecific patterns in SLA paralleled distributional patterns across the gradient; individuals located towards the centre of bogs had lower SLA than those growing in forest. A transplantation experiment showed that plants typically altered their SLA according to local environmental conditions. However, one bog showed no relationship between species' distributions and SLA. This bog lacked the two species with lowest SLA, which typically occurred at the centre of other bogs. In their absence, species with higher SLA that typically occurred in forest increased in abundance towards the centre of the bog, where they obtained lower values of SLA. Therefore, while distributional patterns were often closely associated with SLA, plasticity in SLA was associated with increased breadth of species' distributions across the gradient. Overall results indicate SLA may serve as a useful proxy for a range of life history traits to help elucidate the processes structuring plant communities.

AB In boreal peatlands felling and tree harvest are commonly carried out as part of peatland restoration. Stem-only harvest is the principal harvest method and it leaves the live crown material (felling residue) containing most tree nutrients at the site. Whole-tree harvest, where felling residue is removed, is not favored due to higher transport costs, although it might better promote the recovery of nutrient-poor peatlands towards pristine conditions. We investigated whether initial differences in N mineralization and decomposition rates observed between tree harvest methods continued out to 6 years after restoration and whether the spatial variation in water table (WT) level and water nutrient concentrations parallels with the observed pattern in mineralization and decomposition rates. The study was done at 15 peatland sites in Natura 2000 protection areas in Finland during 2007-2013. Concentration of ammonium in soil water was higher in the stem-only harvest treatment compared to that of the whole-tree harvest treatment, whereas the previously observed differences in net N mineralization and decomposition rates had leveled out by the sixth year after restoration. The spatial variation created by the ditch network still affected the hydrology and peatland functions so that the nutrient concentrations were higher near ditches than in other locations, implying potential risk for nutrient leaching. Based on this study, there is no reason to prefer either harvest method over the other in nutrient-poor drained peatlands with low tree volumes, which constitute the majority of available peatland restoration area in Finland.

AB Pristine peatlands have generally low nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions but drainage and management practices enhance the microbial processes and associated N2O emissions. It is assumed that leaving peat soils from intensive management, such as agriculture, will decrease their N2O emissions. In this paper we report how the annual N2O emission rates will change when agricultural peat soil is either left abandoned or afforested and also N2O emissions from afforested peat extraction sites. In addition, we evaluated a biogeochemical model (DNDC) with a view to explaining GHG emissions from peat soils under different land uses. The abandoned agricultural peat soils had lower mean annual N2O emissions (5.5 +/- A 5.4 kg N ha(-1)) than the peat soils in active agricultural use in Finland. Surprisingly, N2O emissions from afforested organic agricultural soils (12.8 +/- A 9.4 kg N ha(-1)) were similar to those from organic agricultural soils in active use. These emissions were much higher than those from the forests on nutrient rich peat soils. Abandoned and afforested peat extraction sites emitted more N2O, (2.4 +/- A 2.1 kg N ha(-1)), than the areas under active peat extraction (0.7 +/- A 0.5 kg N ha(-1)). Emissions outside the growing season contributed significantly, 40% on an average, to the annual emissions. The DNDC model overestimated N2O emission rates during the growing season and indicated no emissions during winter. The differences in the N2O emission rates were not associated with the age of the land use change, vegetation characteristics, peat depth or peat bulk density. The highest N2O emissions occurred when the soil C:N ratio was below 20 with a significant variability within the measured C:N range (13-27). Low soil pH, high nitrate availability and water table depth (50-70 cm) were also associated with high N2O emissions. Mineral soil has been added to most of the soils studied here to improve the fertility and this may have an impact on the N2O emissions. We infer from the multi-site dataset presented in this paper that afforestation is not necessarily an efficient way to reduce N2O emissions from drained boreal organic fields.

AB Heterotrophic soil respiration (CO 2 efflux from the decomposition of peat and root litter) in three forestry-drained peatlands with different site types and with a large climatic gradient from the hemi-boreal (central Estonia) to south (southern Finland) and north boreal (northern Finland) conditions was studied. Instantaneous fluxes varied between 0 and 1.3 g CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), and annual fluxes between 248 and 515 g CO2-C m(-2) a(-1). Variation in the annual fluxes among site types was studied only in the south-boreal site where we found a clear increase from nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich site types. More than half of the within-site variation was temporal and explained by soil surface (-5 cm) temperature (T5). The response of soil respiration to T5 varied between the sites; the most northerly site had the highest response to T5 and the most southerly the lowest. This trend further resulted in increased annual fluxes towards north. This unexpected result is hypothesised to be related to differences in site factors like substrate quality, nutrient status and hydrology but also to temperature acclimation, i.e., adaptation of decomposer populations to different climates.

AB A recent study on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exports from drained peatland forests reported increasing concentrations over long time since their initial drainage. Concurrently, some other studies have suggested decreasing trends from drained peatland forests, particularly for P. To evaluate these contradictory findings, we re-analyzed past data and reviewed the literature related to temporal N and P concentration trends in runoff from drained peatland forests. Review of literature indicated that decreasing trends are found particularly in sites where initial P concentrations are high (> 50 mu g P l(-1)), plausibly because of relatively recent fertilization and drainage operations. Decreasing N trends have been found in sites where ditch cleaning temporarily decreased concentrations. Increasing N trends have occurred in sites, where initial concentrations have been low, close to the levels found in pristine peatlands. Complementing past published data with additional data from sites with no recent forestry operations indicated that N concentrations correlated positively with drainage age (years since initial drainage), percentage of drained peatlands in the catchment (drainage proportion), and southern location of the study site. P concentrations correlated most strongly with drainage age. Our study indicated that four factors, in particular, need to be considered when interpreting nutrient concentration trends in runoff from drained peatlands: 1) management history, 2) drainage age, 3) drainage proportion, and 4) site location. Our results supported earlier conclusions in that the estimates which ignore the legacy effect of drainage remarkably underestimate the true impact of forestry on water courses in intensively drained regions.

AB We restored small downstream sections of forestry-drained peatland catchments for use as wetland buffer areas and studied the effects of their restoration on the exports of nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved aluminium and iron. Even though the buffer areas were small relative to their catchment areas (0.5-3.5%), buffer restoration clearly increased pollutant exports. Thus, even though restored buffer areas proved later to be efficient in retaining pollutants from their upstream catchment area, turning from an initial restoration-induced pollutant source to their net sink may take a long time. In one restored buffer, the whole concept of restoration to improve water quality was judged questionable due to significantly deteriorated water quality. We presented a hypothesis that high iron content in peat may be a common denominator for the sites with high carbon and organic nutrient exports after restoration of forestry-drained peatlands. We conclude that it may not always be reasonable to restore drained peatlands for use as wetland buffers due to high initial pollution exports.

AB Water table level control by drainage improves forested peatland sites for tree growth, but can also result in subsidence of the peatland surface. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of changes to peat bulk density associated with postdrainage subsidence on peat hydrologic properties at a peatland drained for forestry in north-central Alberta, Canada. Feat hydrologic functions were deter mined by inverse techniques developed for multistep outflow experiments (MULSTP). Se, cn years after drainage, mean peat bulk density (0-40-cm depth) was 63% greater and mean soil water retention (-5 to -15000 cm pressure head) was 66% greater than pear from the nearby undrained control area. Subsidence after drainage was associated with loss of pores >600-mu m diam. with concurrent increases in 3- to 30-mm-diam. pore-size classes, Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity was 1.69 and 14.46 cm h(-1), while mean unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (-5 to -15 000 rm pressure head) was 0.014 and 0.001 cm h(-1) in peat from drained and undrained areas, respectively. Changes in water transport characteristics and in the pool of "plant-available" soil water will probably be beneficial to tree growth in the drained area.

AB This paper compares the effects of single and repeated fertilisation on the contents of potassium, Cs-134 and Cs-137 in different Scots pine compartments at different levels above ground and in the peat profile 9 years after the Chernobyl disaster. The material was collected from a ditch spacing and fertilisation experiment in Finland. Above a needle potassium concentration of 3.0 mg g(-1) in composed crown samples, Cs-137 and Cs-134 concentrations remained at about the same level but below that the values were higher on average. This potassium value corresponded to the potassium concentrations of 3.5-3.6 mg g(-1) in the current-year needles of two topmost whorls. The result indicates an enhanced radiocaesium uptake by pine trees under severe potassium deficiency. Fertilisation with potassium-containing fertilisers decreased the caesium uptake considerably. The inhibiting effect of fertilisation on caesium uptake by trees seemed to be fairly long lasting. Fertilisation had sped up the penetration of caesium downwards in the peat profile and its moving out of the active circulation of elements between soil and plants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The effects of peat total N on the dissolved N and C concentrations and microbial biomass and activity and their range of seasonal fluctuation were studied in a drained peatland forest in Finland. Seasonal fluctuations in the concentrations of extractable dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) compounds and extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial C and N, ergosterol, net and gross N mineralisation rates were investigated during two growing seasons along a natural peat N gradient in a drained peatland. Significant seasonal fluctuations in NH4+ and DOC concentrations, microbial C and N, but not in ergosterol or microbial C-to-N ratios in the peat, were observed during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. The peat total N concentration affected extractable DON and DOC, but not DIN concentrations in the peat. A negative correlation was found between total N concentration in peat and microbial N and C, and a positive correlation between total N and ergosterol, in peat with N concentrations of up to 2%. Gross mineralisation rates did not show any correlation, whereas net mineralisation rates showed a significant positive correlation with the total N concentration of the peat in both 1999 and 2000.

ID FINLAND; TRANSPORTATION; CARBON
AB New raw materials for transportation fuels need to be introduced, in order to fight against climate change and also to cope with increasing risks of availability and price of oil. Peat has been recognised suitable raw material option for diesel produced by gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The energy content of Finnish peat reserves is remarkable. In this study, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel production and utilisation in Finland was assessed from the life-cycle point of view. In 100 year's time horizon the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel is likely larger than the impact of fossil diesel. The impact can somewhat be lowered by producing peat from the agricultural peatland (strong greenhouse gas emissions from the decaying peatlayer are avoided) with new peat production technique, and utilising the produced biomass from the after-treatment area for diesel also. if diesel production is integrated with pulp and paper mill to achieve energy efficiency benefits and if the electricity demand can be covered by zero emission electricity, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel reduces to the level of fossil diesel when agricultural peatland is used, and is somewhat higher when forestry-drained peatland is used as raw material source.

AB We addressed how restoration of forestry-drained peatlands affects CH4-cycling microbes. Despite similar community compositions, the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs was lower in restored than in natural sites and correlated with CH4 emission. Poor establishment of methanogens may thus explain low CH4 emissions on restored peatlands even 10 to 12 years after restoration.

AB Environmental and economic performance of forestry on drained peatlands was reviewed to consider whether continuous cover forestry (CCF) could be a feasible alternative to even-aged management (EM). CCF was regarded feasible particularly because continuously maintaining a tree stand with significant transpiration and interception capacity would decrease the need for ditch network maintenance. Managing CCF forests in such a way that the ground water levels are lower than in clear-cut EM forests but higher than in mature EM forests could decrease greenhouse gas emissions and negative water quality impacts caused both by anoxic redox reactions and oxidation and mineralization of deep peat layers. Regeneration studies indicated potential for satisfactory natural regeneration under CCF on drained peatlands. An economic advantage in CCF over EM is that fewer investments are needed to establish the forest stand and sustain its growth. Thus, even if the growth of trees in CCF forests were lower than in EM forests, CCF could at least in some peatland sites turn out to be a more profitable forest management regime. An advantage of CCF from the viewpoint of socially optimal forest management is that it plausibly reduces the negative externalities of management compared to EM. We propose that future research in drained peatland forests should focus on assessing the economic and environmental feasibility of CCF.

AB The impact of land use on the content of labile soil organic carbon (SOC) has been studied well. However, limited information is known about its effect on the recalcitrant SOC pool, which is a key proxy for long-term carbon sequestration. We investigated the impact of land use change on the distribution of labile and recalcitrant SOC fractions in soil profiles (0-30 cm) in the Jinchuan peatland, Northeast China, where native peatland (with peat soil) and forest (with mineral soil) are converted to paddy and cropland, respectively. Peat and mineral soil profile samples were collected from 10 sites in native and cultivated land. Total organic carbon (TOC) and KMnO4-oxidizable carbon (KOC) defined as the labile SOC fraction were measured in both peat and mineral soils. Fibre and lignin were also determined in peat samples. The mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) and black carbon were examined as two recalcitrant SOC fractions. In peat soil profiles, the TOC and KOC contents increased with the increasing depth across all land uses. The conversion of peatland to paddy field can affect TOC content at each peat soil depth. The KOC content was lower in cultivated soils, indicating that cultivation decreased KOC. The KOC decrease was smaller than the TOC decrease, indicating that some recalcitrant SOC fractions were decomposed because of land use change. Unlike peat soil profiles, the TOC and KOC contents decreased with depth in mineral soil profiles across all land uses. The TOC and KOC contents in surface soil decreased remarkably after cultivation to cropland but were not affected in deep soil. Interestingly, recalcitrant SOC fractions, such as MOC, increased in mineral soil profile after cultivation but showed no change in peat soil profile. This study suggests that conversion of peatland to paddy can release the recalcitrant SOC fraction. In addition, conversion of cultivated forest to cropland decreased the TOC content but prolonged the long-term storage of some recalcitrant SOC fractions, such as MOC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effects of wood ash application on soil microbial processes were investigated in three drained forested peatlands, which differed in nutrient status and time since application. Measured variables included the concentrations of soil elements and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification and denitrification enzyme activity, potential methane (CH4) oxidation, CH4 production and microbial respiration kinetics. Wood ash application had a considerable influence on soil element concentrations. This mirrored a decrease in the majority of the microbial biomarkers by more than one-third in the two oligotrophic peatlands, although the microbial community composition was not altered. The decreases in PLFAs coincided with reduced net ammonification and net N mineralization. Other measured variables did not change systematically as a result of wood ash application. No significant changes in microbial biomass or processes were found in the mesotrophic peatland, possibly because too little time (1 year) had elapsed since the wood ash application. This study suggests that oligotrophic peatlands can be substantially affected by wood ash for a period of at least 4 years after application. However, within 25 years of the wood ash application, the microbial biomass seemed to have recovered or adapted to enhanced element concentrations in the soil.

AB The climate conditions of the current and previous growing seasons have been shown to influence growth of coniferous trees in mineral soils sites. These dependencies may be different in peatlands where growth is generally more dependent on variations in soil water conditions. In the Nordic and Baltic countries, millions of hectares of peatlands and wetlands have been drained in order to enhance forest production. These drainage networks do not guarantee stable soil water conditions for the whole stand rotation. It is thus likely that precipitation in particular may have a different influence on annual growth in peatland to that in mineral soil sites. We studied the effect of precipitation and temperature on the inter-annual diameter growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Finland in drained peatland forests. The diameter growth data were limited to periods when growth response to drainage had levelled out. For comparison. growth data were also collected from adjacent mineral soil trees. The climate variables were monthly mean temperature and precipitation in a given location estimated from observations at the nearest weather stations by means of spatial smoothing. We used mixed linear models in describing the annual diameter growth of individual trees as a function of tree size and stand properties and expressed the residual variation as a function of climate parameters. The peatland and mineral soil growth variations showed different dependence on climate parameters. Peatland trees within 5 m of a ditch showed different climate responses compared to those located further away. Precipitation in July was negatively correlated with the diameter growth of peatland trees but there was no correlation with temperature. Growth of trees in mineral soils was positively correlated with March and April mean temperatures and May and June mean precipitation. The residual growth indices showed largely similar patterns in peatlands and mineral soil sites. (C) 2012 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Studies were carried out to identify a method of constructing a peatland evaluation map based on forecasting data of land subsidence of arable peatland in northern Japan. Land subsidence in a district here has become a serious problem due to the increase in the area of upland fields converted from paddy fields. First, we estimated the present rate of land subsidence based on the measurement of land elevation and soil survey, and determined the degree of decomposition of peat in marshlands, windbreak forests and arable lands in the Ishikari peatland in northern Japan. Second, we evaluated the sustainability of arable peatland based on data of actual land subsidence and other parameters, and we compiled an evaluation map of Ishikari peatland using geographical information systems (GIS). Soil type, period of land development, present land use and thickness of top-dressed soil were selected as main factors for the evaluation, and scores of elements of each factor were determined. According to the total scores, sustainability of arable peatland was divided into 3 classes. A land evaluation map of Ishikari peatland in terms of land subsidence was compiled using these classes.

ID TABLE
AB Hydrologic drainage criteria that describe the position of the water table between adjacent ditches are commonly used to assess the initial effectiveness of peatland drainage projects for tree growth improvement. However, these criteria do not reflect the soil conditions that regulate tree growth and performance after drainage. The effect of three drainage ditch spacings (30, 40, and 50 m) on the spatial variability of soil water conditions at three drained boreal Alberta peatlands was studied. Soil water content (0-30 cm depth) was found to be insensitive (p = 0.686) to drainage ditch spacing several years after drainage. Greater variation was observed between different sampling locations (p = 0.024) relative to the position of the ditch edge within similar ditch spacings. Spatial distribution of soil water in the unsaturated zone was found to be inversely related to the degree of water table lowering. Spatial patterns of soil water content were strongly associated with changes to substrate bulk density resulting from postdrainage peatland subsidence.

AB Elevated suspended sediment (SS) loads released from peatlands after drainage operations and the resulting negative effect on the ecological status of the receiving water bodies have been widely recognized. Understanding the processes controlling erosion and sediment transport within the ditch network forms a prerequisite for adequate sediment control. While numerous experimental studies have been reported in this field, model based assessments are rare. This study presents a modeling approach to investigate sediment transport in a peatland ditch network. The transport model describes bed erosion, rain-induced bank erosion, floc deposition, and consolidation of the bed. Coupled to a distributed hydrological model, sediment transport was simulated in a 5.2 ha forestry-drained peatland catchment for 2 years after ditch cleaning. Comparing simulation results to measured SS concentrations suggested that the loose peat material, produced during excavation, contributed markedly to elevated SS concentrations immediately after ditch cleaning. Both snowmelt and summer rainstorms contributed critically to annual loads. Springtime peat erosion during snowmelt was driven by ditch flow whereas during summer rainfalls, bank erosion by raindrop impact was identified as an important process. Relating modeling results to observed spatial topographic changes in the ditch network was challenging and the results were difficult to verify. Nevertheless, the model has potential to identify risk areas for erosion. The results demonstrate that modeling is effective in separating the importance of different processes and complements pure experimental approaches. Modeling results can aid planning and designing efficient sediment control measures and guide the focus of experimental studies.

AB Ecological restoration is expected to reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5-10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration.

AB Anthropogenic activities on peatlands, such as drainage, can increase sediment transport and deposition downstream resulting in harmful ecological impacts. The objective of this study was to quantify changes in erosion/deposition quantities and surface roughness in peatland forest ditches by measuring changes in ditch cross-sections and surface microtopography with two alternative methods: manual pin meter and terrestrial laser scanning (TSL). The methods were applied to a peat ditch and a ditch with a thin peat layer overlaying erosion sensitive mineral soil within a period of two years following ditch cleaning. The results showed that erosion was greater in the ditch with exposed mineral soil than in the peat ditch. The two methods revealed rather similar estimates of erosion and deposition for the ditch with the thin peat layer where cross-sectional changes were large, whereas the results for smaller scale erosion and deposition at the peat ditch differed. The TLS-based erosion and deposition quantities depended on the size of the sampling window used in the estimations. Surface roughness was smaller when calculated from the pin meter data than from the TLS data. Both methods indicated that roughness increased in the banks of the ditch with a thin peat layer. TLS data showed increased roughness also in the peat ditch. The increase in surface roughness was attributed to erosion and growth of vegetation. Both methods were suitable for the measurements of surface roughness and microtopography at the ditch cross-section scale, but the applicability, rigour, and ease of acquisition of TLS data were more evident. The main disadvantage of the TLS instrument (Leica ScanStation 2) compared with pin meter was that even a shallow layer of humic (dark brown) water prevented detection of the ditch bed. The geomorphological potential of the methods was shown to be limited to detection of surface elevation changes >similar to 0.1 m. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Despite our current understanding of permafrost thaw in subarctic regions in response to rising air temperatures, little is known about the subsurface geometry and distribution of discontinuous permafrost bodies in peat-covered, wetland-dominated terrains and their responses to rising temperature. Using electrical resistivity tomography, ground-penetrating radar profiling, and thermal-conduction modeling, we show how the land cover distributions influence thawing of discontinuous permafrost at a study site in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Permafrost bodies in this region occur under forested peat plateaus and have thicknesses of 5-13m. Our geophysical data reveal different stages of thaw resulting from disturbances within the active layer: from widening and deepening of differential thaw features under small frost-table depressions to complete thaw of permafrost under an isolated bog. By using two-dimensional geometric constraints derived from our geophysics profiles and meteorological data, we model seasonal and interannual changes to permafrost distribution in response to contemporary climatic conditions and changes in land cover. Modeling results show that in this environment (1) differences in land cover have a strong influence on subsurface thermal gradients such that lateral thaw dominates over vertical thaw and (2) in accordance with field observations, thaw-induced subsidence and flooding at the lateral margins of peat plateaus represents a positive feedback that leads to enhanced warming along the margins of peat plateaus and subsequent lateral heat conduction. Based on our analysis, we suggest that subsurface energy transfer processes (and feedbacks) at scales of 1-100m have a strong influence on overall permafrost degradation rates at much larger scales.

AB We studied organic matter accumulation dynamics in peatland surface soil, using the root collar depth of tree-ring aged Scots pine seedlings for dating the base level of quantitative soil samples. The data consisted of 222 samples collected from 47 forestry-drained and four undrained locations. At the drained sites, the data indicated an average dry biomass accumulation of about 4 kg m(-2) in samples representing the past 30 years. Despite great variance in the data, the results clearly indicate decreasing per annum accumulation values with increasing sample age, thus implying rapid decomposition of the fresh litter. Derived from the age-mass relationship we can estimate that about 95% of 1 year's litter input will be decomposed during 30 years. High decomposition rate of the litter suggests that drained peatland forest soils do not act as a carbon sink. The average detritus accumulation values were somewhat higher on the undrained control sites than on the drained sites. Among the forestry-drained sites, the average accumulation was significantly lower in sites with timber volumes exceeding 200 m(3) ha(-1), as compared with sites with timber volumes <100 m(3) ha(-1), suggesting a connection between tree stock and litter decomposition rate.

AB A prerequisite for sustainable peatland forestry is sufficiently low water table (WT) level for profitable tree production. This requires better understanding on controls and feedbacks between tree stand and its evapotranspiration, drainage network condition, climate, and WT levels. This study explores the role of spatial tree stand distribution in the spatiotemporal distribution of WT levels and site water balance. A numerical experiment was conducted by a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrological model (FLUSH) applied to a 0.5 ha peatland forest assuming (1) spatially uniform interception and transpiration, (2) interception and transpiration scaled with spatial distributions of tree crown and root biomass, and (3) the combination of spatially scaled interception and uniform transpiration. Site water balance and WT levels were simulated for two meteorologically contrasting years. Spatial variations in transpiration were found to control WT levels even in a forest with relatively low stand stem volume (<100 m(3)/ha). Forest management scenarios demonstrated how stand thinning and reduced drainage efficiency raised WT levels and increased the area and duration of excessively wet conditions having potentially negative economic (reduced tree growth) and environmental (e.g., methane emissions, phosphorus mobilization) consequences. In practice, silvicultural treatment manipulating spatial stand structure should be optimized to avoid emergence of wet spots.

AB Snow distribution, ablation and snowmelt energy balance components were characterized in a vacuum harvested and an adjacent undisturbed forested section of a peatland during the 2009 snowmelt period to determine snow distribution and melt dynamics on a previously harvested peatland, since abandoned and partly revegetated. The forested peatland had the deepest snowpack at 121cm, particularly along the edge of the forested section adjacent to the more windblown previously harvested peatland. The snowpack density was greatest in the harvested peatland, which was subject to greater wind compaction and mid-winter melt-refreeze episodes; however, snow water equivalence was higher in the forested peatland. Radiative fluxes dominated the snowmelt energy balance. Increased canopy cover within the forested peatland restricted incident radiation and delayed melt, whereas melt rates were rapid across the harvested peatland, driven by higher radiant and turbulent fluxes. Ablation calculated using a simple, one-dimensional model showed good temporal agreement with the observed ablation trends except when standing melt water pooled on the surface of the harvested section, causing more rapid modelled melt rates than observed. The shallower snowpack and more rapid melt across the harvested peatland limited the amount of melt water that was available for spring recharge. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A habitat monitoring programme, the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey, carried out by the University of Ulster for the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, is described. It was based on a random sample of quarter kilometer grid squares, stratified by multivariate land classification. Estimates of change in habitat area between 1987-1992 and 1998 are presented and used to assess policy-related priorities for biodiversity conservation action in widespread habitats in Northern Ireland (NI). The basis of the assessment is Broad Habitats, a classification developed as part of the United Kingdom (UK) Biodiversity Action Plan. Improved Grassland, Neutral Grassland and Bog Broad Habitats occupy the largest area of NI, which holds a large proportion of the UK Neutral Grassland and Fen Marsh and Swamp Broad Habitat resource. The greatest net area increases with time were in Improved Grassland (33%), Coniferous Woodland (12%) and Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland (9%). The greatest net area decreases were in Neutral Grassland (-32%), Arable and Horticulture (-25%), Fen, Marsh and Swamp (-19%), Bog (-8%) and Calcareous Grassland (-7%). These changes are a function of agriculture, public and private forestry, building construction and peat cutting for fuel. The Key biodiversity issue is seminatural Broad Habitat loss, in particular, Neutral Grassland and Fen, Marsh and Swamp, highlighting the lack of effective action for protecting biodiversity in the countryside as a whole. The extent to which current land use is shown to be driving change, indicates that biodiversity conservation action through implementing landscape-scale agri-environment measures could deliver major biodiversity gains. The reliable information on recent changes, provided by the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey, has been used to guide conservation planning. Future re-survey will allow the effectiveness of the conservation strategy as it applies to the countryside as a whole, to be determined. As decisions on land use increasingly have a strong European dimension, concerted action for protecting biodiversity in the countryside as a whole is needed. This would be promoted by a structured sampling approach, based on standard habitat mapping procedures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to explore how atmospherically derived soil pollution is affected by environmental processes at two typical boreal catchment landscape type settings: wetlands and forested areas. Measurements of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in forest soil and peat from an oligotrophic mire at various depths were performed at a remote boreal catchment in northern Sweden. HOCs in peat were evenly distributed throughout the body of the mire while levels of HOCs in the forest soil increased with increased amount of organic matter. Evaluation of HOC composition by principal component analysis (PCA) showed distinct differences between surface soils and deeper soil and peat samples. This was attributed to vertical transport, degradation and/or shifting sources over time. The calculated net vertical transport differed between surface layers (0.3%) and deeper soils (8.0%), suggesting that vertical transport conditions and processes differ in the deeper layers compared to the surface layers.

AB Total and soluble nutrients in peat were studied after ash fertilization on an oligotroph peatland in southeast Norway. Plots 15 m x 15 m in size were fertilized with 0, 4, 7, and 10 tons ha(1) of wood or peat ash in 1944. Chemical analyses after 18, 35 and 48 years showed a gradual reduction of phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) from the 0 to 10 cm surface peat layer. Some of the leached Ca was recovered in the layers 10-20 and 20-40 cm, while hardly any of the lost P was recovered in this way. The amount of potassium (K) in the surface layer declined by 75% over the first 18 years, and remained stable thereafter. Nothing of the lost K was recovered in deeper layers. The pH reflected the Ca levels. Over the years, an increasing proportion of the applied P, K and Ca was retrieved in the trees. Needle analyses indicated that declining tree vigor on plots fertilized with 4 and 7 tons of ash ha(-1) was due to P limitations. After 48 years, the peat content of P and Ca was still significantly higher in fertilized than in control plots, thus demonstrating the long-lasting effect of ash fertilization.

AB Remote sensing, regional ground temperature and ground ice observations, and numerical simulation were used to investigate the size, distribution, and activity of ice wedges in fine-grained mineral and organic soils across the forest-tundra transition in uplands east of the Mackenzie Delta. In the northernmost dwarf-shrub tundra, ice wedge polygons cover up to 40% of the ground surface, with the wedges commonly exceeding 3m in width. The largest ice wedges are in peatlands where thermal contraction cracking occurs more frequently than in nearby hummocky terrain with fine-grained soils. There are fewer ice wedges, rarely exceeding 2m in width, in uplands to the south and none have been found in mineral soils of the tall-shrub tundra, although active ice wedges are found there throughout peatlands. In the spruce forest zone, small, relict ice wedges are restricted to peatlands. At tundra sites, winter temperatures at the top of permafrost are lower in organic than mineral soils because of the shallow permafrost table, occurrence of phase change at 0 degrees C, and the relatively high thermal conductivity of icy peat. Due to these factors and the high coefficient of thermal contraction of frozen saturated peat, ice wedge cracking and growth is more common in peatlands than in mineral soil. However, the high latent heat content of saturated organic active layer soils may inhibit freezeback, particularly where thick snow accumulates, making the permafrost and the ice wedges in spruce forest polygonal peatlands susceptible to degradation following alteration of drainage or climate warming.

AB The molecular composition of humic substances in permafrost peatlands of the forest-tundra zone in northeastern European Russia has been characterized for the first time on the basis of systematic studies. Changes in the molar x(H): x(C) ratio along the peat profiles have been revealed, which is due to the activation of cryogenic processes in the upper part of the seasonally thawing layer, the natural selection of condensed humic molecules, and the botanical composition and degree of degradation of peat, which reflect the climatic features of the area in the Holocene. Dry-peat soils of mounds are worse heated during the summer period because of the buffering effect of moss litter, which results in a lower degree of condensation of humic and fulvic acid molecules in the peat horizons down to the permafrost table. Transformation of quantitative and qualitative parameters of specific organic compounds occurs at the permafrost boundary of peatlands, which can serve as an indicator of recent climate changes in high latitudes.

AB Creating ditches to drain forests to improve timber production is often overlooked as an ecosystem modifier; the practice is commonplace and not easy to see, and it changes the ecosystem slowly. However, a closer look reveals a complex of feedback-regulated, largely indirect, and wide-ranging impacts of the changed hydrology on biodiversity. Our synthesis of those fragmentarily studied impacts highlights a frequent formation of unprecedented biotic assemblages with unclear long-term prospects and consequences for the ecosystem functioning. We present a context-dependent framework to support harmonizing the ditching practices with sustainable forest management a challenging but scientifically exciting task that requires novel approaches to landscape planning, silviculture, and wetland restoration.

AB Northern peatlands contain substantial reservoirs of carbon (C). Forestry activities endanger the C storages in some of these areas. While the initial impacts of forestry drainage on peatland greenhouse gas (GHG) balance have been studied, the impacts of other silvicultural practices, e.g. logging residue (LR) retention or removal, are not known. We measured the CH4, N2O and CO2 fluxes between peat soil and atmosphere with and without decomposing LR over three (2002-2004) seasons (May-Oct) following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest, along with the mass loss of LR. Seasonal average CO2 efflux from plots with LR (3070 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) was twice as high as that from plots without LR (1447 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). Less than 40% of this difference was accounted for by the decay of logging residues (530 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)), so the majority of the increased CO2 efflux was caused by increased soil organic matter decomposition under the LR. Furthermore LR increased soil N2O fluxes over 3-fold (0.70 g N2O m(-2) season(-1)), compared to plots without LR (019 g N2O m(-2) season(-1)), while no change in CH4 emissions was observed. Our results indicate that LR retention in clearfelled peatland sites may significantly increase GHG emissions and C release from the soil organic matter C storage. This would make the harvesting of LR for biofuel more beneficial, in the form of avoided emissions. Further investigations of the sources of CO2 under logging residues are, however, needed to confirm this finding. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A peatland productivity and decomposition parameter database was compiled to estimate parameters for the Canadian Model for Peatlands (CaMP); a module developed by the Canadian Forest Service to address the need for national-scale greenhouse gas emission estimates from peatlands present in the forested area of Canada. Data were compiled for 186 peatland sites from 69 sources. The SITES table contains wetland classification, tree classification, province or state, country, latitude, longitude, and an indication of coordinate accuracy. The NPP ALL table contains annual net primary productivity (NPP; gm(-2)yr(-1)) data for cases where one estimate for NPP was reported for all aboveground vegetation. The NPP SHRUB, NPP MOSS, and NPP HERB SEDGE tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their NPP (gm(-2)yr(-1)). The BIOMASS TREE, BIOMASS SHRUB, BIOMASS HERB SEDGE, and BIOMASS MOSS tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their standing aboveground biomass (g/m(2)). Shrubs in the NPP SHRUB and BIOMASS SHRUB tables were further classified into low or tall shrubs, and plants in the NPP HERB and BIOMASS HERB tables into herbs or sedges. The DECAY LITTER table contains decomposition parameters for different litter types and contains a classification of the type of decomposition study, study duration, information on experimental treatments, classification of above- or belowground plant parts, plant species, litter classification, root litter diameter, indication of hardwood or softwood, indication of evergreen or non-evergreen, litter bag depth classification, classes for bag placement relative to the water table and relative to the peat surface, water table depth, decay rate (k exponent), and mass loss values for years 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, and 23 of a decomposition study. The REFERENCES table contains complete citation information and provides links to the source reference pdf file. This data set is vital to the national Canadian peatland modeling effort and should be useful to other peatland scientists and ecosystem modelers. (c) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2018.

AB Peatlands are very problematic from the bearing capacity point of view. Therefore, logging activities on peatlands in Finland are mainly carried out during the coldest weeks in winter time. More intensive utilisation of peatland forests requires logging activities to be increasingly carried out during unfrozen conditions. Multiple passages of a harvester and a loaded forwarder used for the transportation of timber cause deep ruts on the forest floor. Wider logging trails have been presented as an interesting approach to increasing the number of forwarder passages along a single logging trail. It might be advantageous not to follow the same ruts on each pass but to choose a new parallel route, so that new ruts are formed alongside the previous ones. The study aimed at investigating whether it is beneficial to use wide trails in reducing rutting in forests growing on drained peatland. Field studies were conducted on a drained peatland in Alkkia experimental forest, located in Karvia in Western Finland. In the driving test, a forwarder was driven in the same forest site on logging trails with widths of 4.5 m, 6 m and 10 m. The results indicate that wider logging trails provide the forwarder driver with opportunities to reduce rutting in peatland forests.

AB Past land use change has converted vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, there is a need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and monitored stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i.e. net effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Our results show that over the first five to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests.

   PHOTOSYNTHESIS
AB Peatlands drained for forestry have a high potential for CO2 emissions due to peat decomposition. Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances (Delta C-soil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (R-floor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (R-het) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of Delta C-soil, has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.
   In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, Delta C-soil was calculated by subtracting R-het from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, R floor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.
   The R-het method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The R-floor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.
   In our opinion, the R-het method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the R-floor method. As the estimation of Delta C-soil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets.

AB Wood ash (3.1, 3.3 or 6.6 tonnes dry weight ha(-1)) was used to fertilize two drained and forested peatland sites in southern Sweden. The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest floor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007-1 October 2008. No significant (p>0.05) changes in forest floor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha(-1), while the CH4 fluxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha(-1). The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0-0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p<0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p<0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the first 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was significantly larger (p<0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.52 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not significantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p<0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Pristine peatlands are carbon (C)-accumulating wetland ecosystems sustained by a high water table (WT) and consequent anoxia that slows down decomposition. Persistent WT drawdown as a response to climate and/or land-use change affects decomposition either directly through environmental factors such as increased oxygenation, or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. This study attempts to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of WT drawdown by measuring the relative importance of environmental parameters (WT depth, temperature, soil chemistry) and litter type and/or litter chemical quality on the 2-year decomposition rates of above- and belowground litter (altogether 39 litter types). Consequences for organic matter accumulation were estimated based on the annual litter production. The study sites were chosen to form a three-stage chronosequence from pristine (undrained) to short-term (years) and long-term (decades) WT drawdown conditions at three nutrient regimes. The direct effects of WT drawdown were overruled by the indirect effects through changes in litter type composition and production. Short-term responses to WT drawdown were small. In long-term, dramatically increased litter inputs resulted in large accumulation of organic matter in spite of increased decomposition rates. Furthermore, the quality of the accumulated matter greatly changed from that accumulated in pristine conditions. Our results show that the shift in vegetation composition as a response to climate and/or land-use change is the main factor affecting peatland ecosystem C cycle, and thus dynamic vegetation is a necessity in any model applied for estimating responses of C fluxes to changing environment. We provide possible grouping of litter types into plant functional types that the models could utilize. Furthermore, our results clearly show a drop in soil summer temperature as a response to WT drawdown when an initially open peatland converts into a forest ecosystem, which has not yet been considered in the existing models.

AB Drainage can help restore hydrological conditions conducive to the growth of black spruce (Picea marlana) seedlings on logged forested peatlands. The impact of drainage was assessed by analysing the variation in stand density at stump height, black spruce seedling annual diameter growth and composition of plant communities on 20 of the oldest operationally drained sites in Quebec's James Bay region. These sites, each consisting of a drained, post-harvest area and a corresponding undrained, post-harvest control area, were classified into five ecosites based on soil characteristics and plant communities. The ecosites studied varied from those with rich mineral soils covered with a shallow organic layer to very poor, deep, organic soils. Results showed that the growth response of black spruce seedlings following drainage was strongly dependent on the ecosite. Ecosites RE37 and rich RE39 showed a substantial and steady growth response of black spruce to drainage over time. Therefore, drainage caused a significant increase in stand density and growth rate of black spruce seedlings in moderately rich ecosites. In the other ecosites studied, the peat layer was either too thick (poor RE39 and very poor RE39) or too shallow (RE26) for black spruce stand densities and individual stems growth to increase with drainage, compared to those of the control areas.

AB Sufficiency of potassium (K) is one of the biggest concerns for forestry in boreal peatlands, since the rooting zone stores of K in thick peat soils are generally small and significant proportion of the K in ecosystem is bound in stand biomass. Increased demand for bioenergy may lead to intensified harvesting also in such forests. There is thus an urgent need to study the significance of the nutrients in harvest residues for the next-generation forest productivity. The specific questions in peatland forests are whether the harvest residues are an important source of K to the restock or whether the K in harvest residues is lost by leaching. We quantified K losses from drained peatland forests following management by clear-felling with stem-only harvesting (SOH), whole-tree harvesting (WTH) and whole-tree harvesting plus stump harvesting (WTHS). Calibration period-control area method and mixed modelling approach were used to analyze the ditch-outflow K-concentration and water-borne K-export data from 17 harvested and 5 control catchments in southern and central Finland. K concentrations and runoff were monitored for 1-2 years before and 3-4 years after treatment. Supplementary long-term data from one pair of harvested and non-managed catchments was used to assess the duration of the harvest impact on K export. Mean annual K concentrations in ditch outflow were higher after than before harvesting. The concentrations started to increase during the second or third post-harvest year, reaching the peaks of 1.1-2.2 mg L-1 in WTHS, 0.8-1.7 mg L-1 in WTH, and 1.0-1.9 mg L-1 in SOH. The concentrations correlated positively with the amount of K in the surface peat. In nutrient-poor ombrotrophic sites, the K concentrations were higher for sites with shallower water-table level. Using the supplementary data, the impact of harvesting on K losses was estimated to last for about eight years. The overall estimated K loss was about 28 kg ha(-1) from minerotrophic sites, and about 9 kg ha-1 from ombrotrophic sites. There was no significant difference in K losses between the harvest treatments SOH, WTH and WTHS, indicating that the K in harvest residues was largely retained onsite. The role of K losses induced by harvesting in the site K stores in drained peatland forests is discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In spite of advances in greenhouse gas research, the spatiotemporal CH4 and N2O dynamics of boreal land-scapes remain challenging, e.g., we need clarification of whether forest-mire transitions are occasional hotspots of landscape CH4 and N2O emissions during exceptionally high and low ground water level events.
   In our study, we tested the differences and drivers of CH4 and N2O dynamics of forest/mire types in field conditions along the soil moisture gradient of the forest-mire ecotone. Soils changed from Podzols to Histosols and ground water rose downslope from a depth of 10m in upland sites to 0.1m in mires. Yearly meteorological conditions changed from being exceptionally wet to typical and exceptionally dry for the local climate. The median fluxes measured with a static chamber technique varied from -51 to 586 mu gm(-2) h(-1) for CH4 and from 0 to 6 mu m(-2) h(-1) for N2O between forest and mire types throughout the entire wet-dry period.
   In spite of the highly dynamic soil water fluctuations in carbon rich soils in forest-mire transitions, there were no large peak emissions in CH4 and N2O fluxes and the flux rates changed minimally between years. Methane uptake was significantly lower in poorly drained transitions than in the well-drained uplands. Water-saturated mires showed large CH4 emissions, which were reduced entirely during the exceptional summer drought period. Near-zero N2O fluxes did not differ significantly between the forest and mire types probably due to their low nitrification potential. When up-scaling boreal landscapes, pristine forest-mire transitions should be regarded as CH4 sinks and minor N2O sources instead of CH4 and N2O emission hotspots.

AB Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations in stream waters from peat-covered catchments have increased over the last 15-25 years, resulting in large-scale brownification of lakes and rivers in high latitudes. While this increase has primarily been attributed to decreased acid deposition and climatic warming in most regions, we studied whether peatland drainage in forested catchments has contributed to the increasing TOC concentrations. We analysed the spatial variability of average TOC concentrations from a total of 133 peatland dominated catchments in Sweden and Finland, of which 62 were pristine and 71 were drained during the last century. In addition, we performed a trend analysis on 37 catchments for which long-term data were available. We found about 14 mg l(-1) higher TOC concentrations in streams discharging from drained than undrained sites in southern latitudes, and about 8 mg l(-1) higher concentrations from drained sites in northern latitudes. Trend analysis did not indicate significant differences in TOC concentration trends between drained and undrained catchments but indicated that tree stand volume correlated with increasing trends. This supports earlier findings in that the general increase in forest cover and biomass that has occurred in high latitudes during the last decades is another factor that has contributed to brownification.

AB Recognition of the importance of peatlands has led to increased efforts to protect and restore these environments but there are concerns about the impact of restoration on water quality, particularly in terms of sediment delivery, nutrient transport and carbon losses. In this study we present the results of almost 10 years of water quality monitoring in 3 catchments at a lowland raised bog that was afforested with conifers in the 1960s and 1970s and cleared over the 2010s.
   Phosphate concentrations increased after clear-felling with the main peaks seen in the summer after forest clearance; the use of low ground impact harvesting methods, removal of forest residues and especially phased felling tempered phosphate losses. Annual mean phosphate concentrations returned to pre-felling levels 3-5 years after felling finished. Nitrate concentrations increased slightly from baseline levels during and after felling. DOC concentrations increased at two sites with mean annual concentrations still elevated at one site after 4 years; little increase in DOC was recorded with phased felling. Colour levels increased and remain elevated at all sites relative to pre-felling. In only one stream, pH increased improving the WFD water body status from 'poor' to 'high' in the space of 3 years.
   Our results show that forest clearance for peatland restoration can impact negatively upon water quality due to phosphate, DOC, colour and suspended sediment releases. The mechanisms by which the releases occur require further investigation but are thought to be driven by nutrient leaching from forest residues, soil disturbance by machine trafficking and indirect effects of forest clearance, such as water table rise following cessation of forest water use. Climatic effects also play a significant role, particularly drying-rewetting cycles and periods of extended drought. To prevent negative impacts, phased felling and less intensive forest harvesting techniques should be employed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB One fourth of the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry operations such as ditch network maintenance increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes an understanding of how forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of ditch cleaning on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that ditch cleaning lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to ditch cleaning. Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after ditch cleaning, which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of ditch network maintenance. The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that ditch cleaning had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when ditch cleaning does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary.

AB There are only a few studies focusing on the financial aspects of management regimes on peatland forests and even fewer studies investigating intensive management. Such studies, however, are urgently needed, particularly in Finland, where a considerable proportion of drained peatlands is reaching a phase requiring active management. An empirical data set derived from the 10th National Forest Inventory (NFI10) is applied for stand-level simulations (MOTTI stand simulator) until final cut. The data are a representative sample of the most common drained peatland site types and their current stand structures in Finland. Based on several different initial stand conditions, tree growth was projected according to four management regimes: (1) passive management (only one clearcut executed), (2) management according to prevailing silvicultural recommendations, (3) stand-level optimum without ditch network maintenance (DNM) and fertilization (FERT), and (4) stand-level optimum with DNM and FERT (intensive management). The intensive management regime financially outperformed the other management options distinctively, regardless of the climatic region, peatland site type, and initial stand structure. However, towards more harsh climatic conditions and a more barren site type, the financial difference between management options flattened out, and silvicultural recommendations even resulted in a higher mean annual increment (MAI) compared with intensive management.

AB The black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) GAERTN.) stands occupy 2.5% of the forest area in Latvia. The majority of its communities lie on peatlands; they have been studied in the whole of Latvia using the Braun-Blanquet approach.
   One hundred and fifty alder dominated releves selected from 334 forest areas have been analysed. Three associations (Carici elongatae-Alnetum, Sphagno squarrosi-Alnetum, and Circaeo-Alnetum), one with four subassociations have been recognized; these belong to the Eurosiberian alder swamps (cl. Alnetea glutinosae) and the European broad-leaved forests (cl. Querco-Fagetea). The phytosociological structure, distribution in Latvia and floristic features of these communities are reported. Results are compared with similar communities in the Baltic Sea states and neighbouring countries.

AB Acetylene, dimethyl ether (DME) and 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (nitrapyrin) were used as inhibitors to study the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to the production of N2O and nitric oxide (NO) in samples taken from the soil profile of a peatland drained for forestry. Acetylene and DME inhibited 60-100% of the nitrification activity in field-moist samples from the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm peat layers, whereas nitrapyrin had no inhibitory effect. In the 0-5 cm peat layer the N2O production could be reduced by up to 90% with inhibitors of nitrification, but in the 5-10 cm peat layer this proportion was 20-30%. All the inhibitors removed 96-100% of the nitrification potential in peat-water slurries from the 0-5 cm peat layer, but the 5-10 cm layer had a much lower nitrification activity, and here the efficiency of the inhibitors was more variable. Litter was the main net source of NO in the peat profile. NO3- production was lower in the litter layer than in the peat, whereas N2O production was much higher in the litter than in the peat. Denitrification was the most probable source of N2O and NO in the litter, which had a high availability of organic substrates.

AB The within-site variability of soil characteristics on sites with different soil types remains poorly quantified, although this information is crucial for the success of research on soil properties, and especially for monitoring soil properties over time. We used coefficients of variation and multilevel variance component models to examine the within-site variation of soil (0-30 cm) mineral nutrient concentrations (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, mg g(-1); Mn, Zn, mug g(-1)) and bulk density (kg m(-3)) on boreal deep-peat sites. We then evaluated the reliability of the site-level estimates (sample means) obtained using different sampling intensities (numbers of samples per site). Our 11 sites represented a single original site type within the oligotrophic nutrient level. Two of the sites were undrained while the rest had been drained for forestry at different points in time. Overall, P concentrations showed the smallest and Mn concentrations the largest within-site variation. The sampling depth contributed more than 50% of the total variance in all other characteristics except the concentrations of P and Fe, and bulk density. The variance proportions of peatland basin, site (within basin), and sampling location (within site) varied by sampling depth for most soil characteristics. The estimates obtained when using a certain number of samples per site were always more reliable for the 0-30 cm layer's composite samples than for any single 10-cm layer at any depth sampled. On average, it was found that between 4 (P) and some 200 (Mn) samples per site would be needed for the estimates to have a theoretical 10% maximum deviation.

AB This study investigated the abundance, distribution, and composition of microbial communities at the watershed scale in a boreal peatland within the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA. Through a close coupling of next-generation sequencing, biogeochemistry, and advanced analytical chemistry, a biogeochemical hot spot was revealed in the mesotelm (30- to 50-cm depth) as a pronounced shift in microbial community composition in parallel with elevated peat decomposition. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria and the Syntrophobacteraceae, including known hydrocarbon-utilizing genera, was positively correlated with carbohydrate and organic acid content, showing a maximum in the mesotelm. The abundance of Archaea (primarily crenarchaeal groups 1.1c and 1.3) increased with depth, reaching up to 60% of total small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences in the deep peat below the 75-cm depth. Stable isotope geochemistry and potential rates of methane production paralleled vertical changes in methanogen community composition to indicate a predominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis mediated by the Methanosarcinales in the mesotelm, while hydrogen-utilizing methanogens predominated in the deeper catotelm. RNA-derived pyrosequence libraries corroborated DNA sequence data to indicate that the above-mentioned microbial groups are metabolically active in the mid-depth zone. Fungi showed a maximum in rRNA gene abundance above the 30-cm depth, which comprised only an average of 0.1% of total bacterial and archaeal rRNA gene abundance, indicating prokaryotic dominance. Ratios of C to P enzyme activities approached 0.5 at the acrotelm and catotelm, indicating phosphorus limitation. In contrast, P limitation pressure appeared to be relieved in the mesotelm, likely due to P solubilization by microbial production of organic acids and C-P lyases. Based on path analysis and the modeling of community spatial turnover, we hypothesize that P limitation outweighs N limitation at MEF, and microbial communities are structured by the dominant shrub, Chamaedaphne calyculata, which may act as a carbon source for major consumers in the peatland.

AB Mineral and peat forest soils, sampled at three depths, were incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 16-degrees-C for 26 wk and were monitored for CH4 and CO2 formation.
   Mean CO2 production rates were similar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in mineral subsoils with very low organic matter content, whereas in organic soils the rate was about 10 times greater under aerobic than anaerobic conditions. The correlations coefficient (r) between mean aerobic and mean anaerobic production rates was 0.98, for the entire data set.
   Mineral and organic samples incubated anaerobically both showed a decline in CO2 production rate with increasing time of incubation. The decline was more strongly related to incubation time than to the absolute concentrations of CO2 in the vials. The rates after 19 wk were approx. 10% of the initial rates. This inhibition was largely offset by flushing the vials with N2 gas, indicating the volatile nature of the inhibiting substances. Although CO2 production rates increased immediately upon flushing, there were still weak indications of a residual inhibiting effect. That, together with the rapid return of inhibition, suggested that non-volatile substances were also involved. One implication of these results is that the activity in anaerobic field soils very much depends on the removal of the inhibiting agents, e.g. by aeration during periodic draining of soil layers and by the movement of water through the soil.
   Methane formation occurred in most mor layers and peats. A well humified wood-Cyperaceae peat was, however, a notable exception. Methane production rates increased during the experimental period. The increasing CH4 production rates, and the final (26 wk) measured rates, were approximately proportional to the frequency of anaerobic conditions in the original field situation.

AB Carbon export in streams draining peat catchments represents a potential loss of carbon from long-term stores to downstream aquatic systems and ultimately, through mineralisation, to the atmosphere. There is now a large body of evidence that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export has increased significantly in recent decades at many sites, although there is still debate about the drivers of this increase. In this study, DOC export and particulate organic carbon (POC) export were quantified from a forested peatland catchment in the west of Ireland over two years at a fine temporal resolution. The principle drivers of change in stream DOC and POC concentrations were investigated using a general additive modelling (GAM) approach. The study period included drought conditions in the early summer of 2010 and clearfelling of some commercial forestry in early 2011. The results indicated that annual loads of 9.5 t DOC km(2) year(-1) and 6.2 t POC km(2) year(-1) were exported from the catchment in 2010. This combined annual load of 15.7 t C km(2) year(-1) would represent between 0.01% and 0.02% of typical estimates for peat soil carbon storage in the region. Soil temperature, river discharge and drought explained 59.7% the deviance in DOC concentrations, while soil temperature, river discharge, and rainfall were the significant drivers of variation in POC concentrations, explaining 58.3% of deviance. Although clearfelling was not a significant factor in either model, large spikes in POC export occurred in 2011 after the first forestry clearance. The results illustrate the complexity of the interactions between climate and land management in driving stream water carbon export. They also highlight the sensitivity of peatland carbon stores to changes in temperature and precipitation, which are projected to be more extreme and variable under future climate scenarios.

AB Past studies of the climatic influence on tree growth at peat bogs in northern latitudes have shown weak correlation between annual tree-ring widths and climatic parameters during the growing season. At Hanvedsmossen, a raised pear bog in south central Sweden, tree-ring width chronologies from one drained and one undrained growth site, as well as one dry site outside the bog, were compared to meteorological records. Low temperatures, which means less evaporation, as well as high precipitation appear to be inhibiting pine growth at the undisturbed bog site as the trees are sensitive to changes in the local water table. Drainage causes an instant increase in annual tree growth for approximately 10 years. If drainage is maintained, the response to climate of the pines resembles that of pines growing on mineral soils. The variance in annual tree-ring growth explained by temperature/precipitation or both was low for the entire lengths of all chronologies, but high for some analysed subperiods; the significant months changed with time. The reason for this seems to be that pines at Hanvedsmossen are growing in a region where precipitation and temperature are less limiting to tree growth than at higher and lower latitudes.

AB Peatland forests constitute a significant timber resource in several boreal countries. In Finland, peatlands have been intensively managed with large-scale drainage operations to enhance growth of the stands. In comparison with forests on mineral soils, a divergent feature in the management of peatland stands is the ditch network maintenance. We investigated the optimal forest management schedules for peatland stands using data from 17 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample stands representing the most important drained peatland site type in two climatic regions in northern Finland. We used the PIKAIA optimisation procedure (a genetic algorithm) to maximise the net present value of alternative management schedules involving ditch network maintenance operations and thinnings. Recent price and cost data were applied in the analyses. We found that the higher the interest rate, (i) the shorter the present generation's rotation period and (ii) the less silvicultural activities were involved in the management schedule. Harsh climatic conditions emphasised this result, also showing that a decrease in the mean annual increment may lead to a significant increase in net present value. For each individual stand, the optimal stand management clearly outperformed (with respect to financial outcome) reference management that was mainly based on prevailing silvicultural recommendations. The results highlight the importance of interest rates in financial analyses of forestry: it is not self-evident that optimal stand management would include several silvicultural activities, such as ditch network maintenance and thinnings.

AB Black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) forests on peat soils have been reported to be hotspots for high nitrous oxide (N2O) losses. High emissions may be attributed to alternating water tables of peatlands and to the incorporation of high amounts of easily decomposable nitrogen (N) into the ecosystem by symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2)-fixation of alder trees. Our study addressed the question to what extent drainage enhances the emissions of N2O from black alder forests and how N turnover processes and physical factors influence the production of N2O and total denitrification. The study was conducted in a drained black alder forest with variable groundwater tables at a southern German fen peatland. Fluxes of N2O were measured using the closed chamber method at two drained sites (D-1 and D-2) and one undrained site (U). Inorganic N contents and net N mineralization rates (NNM) were determined. Additionally a laboratory incubation experiment was carried out to investigate greenhouse gas and N-2 fluxes at different temperature and soil moisture conditions. Significantly different inorganic N contents and NNM rates were observed, which however did not result in significantly different N2O fluxes in the field but did in the laboratory experiment. N2O fluxes measured were low for all sites, with total annual emissions of 0.51 +/- 0.07 (U), 0.97 +/- 0.13 (D-1) and 0.93 +/- 0.08 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) (D-2). Only 37% of the spatiotemporal variation in field N2O fluxes could be explained by peat temperature and groundwater level, demonstrating the complex interlinking of the controlling factors for N2O emissions. However, temperature was one of the key variables of N2O fluxes in the incubation experiment conducted. Increasing soil moisture content was found to enhance total denitrification losses during the incubation experiment, whereas N2O fluxes remained constant. At the undrained site, permanently high groundwater level was found to prevent net nitrification, resulting in a limitation of available nitrate (NO3-) and negligible gaseous N losses. N2O flux rates that were up to four times higher were measured in the incubation experiment. They reveal the potential of high N2O losses under changing soil physical conditions at the drained alder sites. The high net nitrification rates observed and high NO3- contents bear the risk of considerable NO3- leaching at the drained sites.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine how drainage impacts carbon densities and recent rates (past 50years) of vertical accretion and carbon accumulation in southeastern forested peatlands. We compared these parameters in drained maple-gum (MAPL), Atlantic white cedar (CDR), and pocosin (POC) communities in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) of Virginia/North Carolina and in an intact (undrained) CDR swamp in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (AR) of North Carolina. Peat cores were analyzed for bulk density, percent organic carbon, and Cs-137 and Pb-210. An uncertainty analysis of both Cs-137 and Pb-210 approaches was used to constrain error at least partially related to mobility of both radioisotopes. GDS peats had lower porosities (89.6% (SD=1.71) versus 95.3% (0.18)) and higher carbon densities (0.082 (0.021) versus 0.037 (0.009)gCcm(-3)) than AR. Vertical accretion rates (0.10-0.56cmyr(-1)) were used to estimate a time period of similar to 84-362years for reestablishment of peat lost during the 2011 Lateral West fire at the GDS. Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 51 to 389gCm(-2)yr(-1) for all sites. In the drained (GDS) versus intact (AR) CDR sites, carbon accumulation rates were similar with Cs-137 (87(GDS) versus 92(AR)gCm(-2)yr(-1)) and somewhat less at the GDS than AR as determined with Pb-210 (111(GDS) versus 159(AR)gCm(-2)yr(-1)). Heightened productivity and high polyphenol content of peat may be responsible for similar rates of carbon accumulation in both drained and intact CDR peatlands.

AB Kaiparoro clearing is a 40 ha enclave of tussock grassland within forest, straddling a rounded peneplain remnant in the northern Tararua Range.  The grassland occurs at an unusually low altitude compared with other North Island red tussock grasslands.  Charcoal and pollen from a peat bog suggests that fire created the clearing and helped maintain open vegetation throughout its 3500+ year history.  There appear to be no edaphic constraints on forest occupation of most of the site.  Before the clearing was created, tussock grasses were probably confined to small riparian peat bogs within low forest on the peneplain surface.  Rates of shrub invasion of the tussock clearing by Dracophyllum longifolium, Leptospermum scoparium, and Olearia colensoi are slow.  A fire return-period of <400 years would be sufficient to perpetuate the open or non-forest vegetation.  Kaiparoro coincides with the modern-day distributional limits of Nothofagus in the northern Tararua Range.  The pollen record indicates that Nothofagus has had a delayed population growth there in the Holocene relative to the main population centre further south.  Similar trends for Nothofagus at other provincial limits in its distribution are evident elsewhere in New Zealand.  Pollen results from Kaiparoro and similar sites adjacent to Nothofagus boundaries, suggest that Nothofagus in non-competitive under humid, mild, low-insolation climates.

AB We investigated the structural dynamics of naturally established stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on peatland sites drained for forestry. The study was based on 3-10 repeated measurements of the distributions of tree diameters at breast height (DBH) of 83 stands located in southern and central Finland. Thinned as well as unthinned stands were included. Site nutrient levels ranged from poor (ombrotrophic) to moderately rich (mesotrophic). The Weibull function was used to parameterize the DBH distributions, and mixed linear models were constructed to characterize the impacts of different ecological factors and management on stand dynamics as described by the variation of the shape parameter of the Weibull function. The analyses were carried out separately for the dominant canopy layer and the under-Storey. The structural unevenness of the stands, indicated by positive skewness of the DBH distributions. initially increased after drainage. Ingrowth of new trees was enhanced more on sparsely forested composite peatland sites (Group II sites) than on more fully stocked sites (Group I sites). Structural heterogeneity started to decrease 20-30 years after drainage, depending on the site type. DBH distributions continued to develop towards normality and then to negative skewness. This trend reflected inherent stand dynamics mediated by increased inter-tree competition. which resulted in mortality of small trees. Thinnings hastened the change in DBH distributions. Highly uneven-sized understories of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. (Karst.)) and pubescent birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) became established beneath the dominant canopy layer of Group B sites.

AB Hyalospheniids are among the most common and conspicuous testate amoebae in high-latitude peatlands and forest humus. These testate amoebae were widely studied as bioindicators and are increasingly used as models in microbial biogeography. However, data on their diversity and ecology are still very unevenly distributed geographically: notably, data are lacking for low-latitude peatlands. We describe here a new species, Nebela jiuhuensis, from peatlands near the Middle Yangtze River reach of south-central China with characteristic morphology. The test ( shell) has hollow horn-like lateral extensions also found in N. saccifera, N. equicalceus (= N. hippocrepis), and N. ansata, three large species restricted mostly to Sphagnum peatlands of Eastern North America. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase ( COI) data confirm that N. jiuhuensis is closely related to the morphologically very similar North American species N. saccifera and more distantly to N. ansata within the N. penardiana group. These species are all found in wet mosses growing in poor fens. Earlier reports of morphologically similar specimens found in South Korea peatlands suggest that N. jiuhuensis may be distributed in comparable peatlands in Eastern Asia ( China and Korea). The discovery of such a conspicuous new species in Chinese peatlands suggests that many new testate amoebae species are yet to be discovered, including potential regional endemics. Furthermore, human activities ( e. g., drainage, agriculture, and pollution) have reduced the known habitat of N. jiuhuensis, which can thus be considered as locally endangered. We, therefore, suggest that this very conspicuous micro-organism with a probably limited geographical distribution and specific habitat requirement should be considered as a flagship species for microbial biogeography as well as local environmental conservation and management.

AB To understand the global carbon cycle and the impact of human activity on climate, it is necessary to quantify the net CO2 exchange of ecosystems in different land uses on a large scale. Methods to estimate soil net CO2 exchange (NECO2soil) for drained peatland forests have been largely based on chamber measurements and statistical models. The uncertainty in these methods has not been assessed. Yet, disturbed organic soils are a globally important, potential CO2 source due to their vast carbon storage and its sensitivity to changes in soil moisture.
   In this study, we estimated the countrywide NECO2soil for the 4.76 million ha of forestry-drained peat soils in Finland. We gathered available litter production and CO2 efflux data and constructed models to be used for the upscaling of NECO2soil from forest inventory data. The contribution of each model and the inventory sampling to the precision of the countrywide estimate was calculated. Also, the sensitivity to possible bias in selected model components was estimated.
   Compared to the estimated mean NECO2soil, ranging from a source of +20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C to a sink of -40 g m(-2) year(-1) of C, the uncertainty was high. The precision of the estimate (+/- 1 standard deviation) was +/- 20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C. Due to possible bias in the estimated belowground litter input, the overall uncertainty was much higher, around 60 g m(-2) year(-1) of C.
   The main reason for the high relative uncertainty was NECO2soil being on average close to zero in these boreal forestry-drained peatlands. Forest inventory sample size was large enough and the data for the models were mainly sufficient. To reduce the uncertainty, better understanding of belowground carbon fluxes in order to accurately determine the C input to soil, is crucial. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are unique wetland ecosystems that cover approximately 3% of the world's land area and are mostly located in boreal and temperate regions. Around 15 Mha of these peatlands have been drained for forestry during the last century. This study investigated soil archaeal and bacterial community structure and abundance, as well as the abundance of marker genes of nitrogen transformation processes (nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia) across distance gradients from drainage ditches in nine full-drained, middle-aged peatland forests dominated by Scots pine, Norway spruce, or Downy birch. The dominating tree species had a strong effect on the chemical properties (pH, N and C/N status) of initially similar Histosols and affected the bacterial and archaeal community structure and abundance of microbial groups involved in the soil nitrogen cycle. The pine forests were distinguished by having the lowest fine root biomass of trees, pH, and N content and the highest potential for N fixation. The distance from drainage ditches affected the spatial distribution of bacterial and archaeal communities (especially N-fixers, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers possessing nosZ clade II), but this effect was often dependent on the conditions created by the dominance of certain tree species. The composition of the nitrifying microbial community was dependent on the soil pH, and comammox bacteria contributed significantly to nitrate formation in the birch and spruce soils where the pH was higher than 4.6. The highest N2O emission was recorded from soils with higher bacterial and archaeal phylogenetic diversity such as birch forest soils. This study demonstrates that the long-term growth of forests dominated by birch, pine, and spruce on initially similar organic soil has resulted in tree-species-specific changes in the soil properties and the development of forest-type-specific soil prokaryotic communities with characteristic functional properties and relationships within microbial communities.

AB The increasing use of wood and peat in energy production has created a potential to utilize wood and peat ashes as forest fertilizers on a wide scale. Previous studies have shown that tree growth in peatland benefits most from ash fertilization. However, possible harmful effects on recipient watercourses have prevented any larger-scale fertilization activity. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term changes in runoff acidity and the transport of nutrients, heavy metals and dissolved organic carbon via drainage water from drained boreal peatland catchments fertilized with wood or peat ash. The hypotheses were that the site's peat type, the origin and formula of the ash and the time of application have an influence on leaching amounts. Therefore, the studied catchments represented different peat (Carex or Sphagnum) and site types with different standing tree stocks (8-127 m(3) ha(-1)). Loose, self-hardened and drum-granulated ashes (wood and peat ashes) were used and applied (5000-6500 kg ha(-1)) either in winter on snow or in summer on bare ground. Water samples from the runoff were taken over a 10-11-year period following the applications. After 10-11 years from the treatments, the concentrations of S, K, Na, Cl-, and Mg in the runoff water were still higher at the wood ash treatments compared to the controls. Leaching of elements from peat ash was lower than from wood ash due to the lower content of elements. We estimated that 15-52% of the added S and 2-28% of the added K were leached from the wood and peat ashes during the study period. Leaching of S was the highest after the winter application and higher from the Sphagnum than from the Carex peat dominated catchments. The leaching of K was the highest after the summer application and was the lowest from the catchments having the highest tree stock. No increased leaching of P, N, dissolved organic carbon or heavy metals was detected. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial organic carbon is exported to freshwater systems where it serves as substrate for bacterial growth. Temporal variations in the terrigenous organic carbon support for aquatic bacteria are not well understood. In this paper, we demonstrate how the combined influence of landscape characteristics and hydrology can shape such variations. Using a 13-day bioassay approach, the production and respiration of bacteria were measured in water samples from six small Swedish streams (64A degrees N, 19A degrees E), draining coniferous forests, peat mires, and mixed catchments with typical boreal proportions between forest and mire coverage. Forest drainage supported higher bacterial production and higher bacterial growth efficiency than drainage from mires. The areal export of organic carbon was several times higher from mire than from forest at low runoff, while there was no difference at high flow. As a consequence, mixed streams (catchments including both mire and forest) were dominated by mire organic carbon with low support of bacterial production at low discharge situations but dominated by forest carbon supporting higher bacterial production at high flow. The stimulation of bacterial growth during high-flow episodes was a result of higher relative export of organic carbon via forest drainage rather than increased drainage of specific "high-quality" carbon pools in mire or forest soils.

AB The aim of this study was to build regression models between mean water table depth (WTD, cm) and net soil CO2 emissions (g m(-2) year(-1)) using data from boreal peatlands drained for forestry. We found that net soil CO2 emissions increased linearly with increasing WTD to depths of approximately 60 cm. The regression equations differed between nutrient rich (n = 33) and nutrient poor (n = 39) study sites: net soil CO2 emissions = -115 + 12 x WTD (nutrient rich); net soil CO2 emissions = -259 + 6 x WTD (nutrient poor). These regressions can be used to estimate changes in CO2 emissions associated with changes in forest management practices.

AB Restoration of drained peatland forests is an important tool in maintaining and improving biodiversity in the boreal region. It has been shown to cause leaching of nutrients from the restoration area to lower waterbodies. Two drained peatland systems of different ecohydrological types in the Nuuksio (60 degrees 18'N, 24 degrees 27'E) and Seitseminen (61 degrees 56'N, 23 degrees 26'E) national parks were restored and total organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching was monitored for 6 years after restoration. The richer site proved to leach more nitrogen and less total organic carbon and phosphorus than the poor site although the per-treatment-area excess leaching of organic carbon caused by restoration was higher in the richer site. The pattern of excess leaching was more stable in the poor site. The differences in leaching reflect the ecohydrological differences between these two peatland basins. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The micromycetes complex was studied in the permafrost affected peat soil of the forest-tundra peatland (lower course of the Pechora river, forest tundra). Taxonomical list of microscopic fungi contains 42 species (including two forms of sterile mycelium). Division Zygomycota contains eight species (19%) from genera Mucor, Mortierella, and Umbelopsis; division Ascomycota - 32 species (76%). Penicillium genus contains the highest number of species (21). The other genera - Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Pseudogymnoascus, Chrysosporium, Cephalosporium, Fusarium and Trichoderma are presented by single species. The highest number of fungi species was found in the upper part of the active layer (depth 0-20 cm) - 38 species (Shannon index H = 2.53), the lowest - in the lower part of the active layer (20-55 cm) - 11 species (H = 0.90) and permafrost layer (55-115 cm) - 9 species (H = 1.31). The highest number (51-84 thousands CFU per g of soil) of microscopic fungi was found in the upper part of the active layer (depth 0-4 cm). in the lower part of active layer, high number of micromycetes (60-104 thousands CFU per g of soil) was found only at rich by hydrocarbons media (worth agar, Sabouraud's medium). In the permafrost layer, this number was lower by 1-2 orders of magnitude (0.2-3.7 thousands CFU per g of soil). According to the species abundance, the structure of micromycetes complex is presented by rare species - 60%, abundant species count 12-29%. Penicillium simplicissimum (23.6-48.3%), Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (12.0%), and Mycelia sterilia (white) (19.9%) were the most abundant in the active layer; .Penicillium implicalant (32.3%) and Penicillium simplicissimum (19.4%) and Mycelia sterilia (white) (17.7%) - in the permafrost layers.

AB The main aim of the current study was to estimate the annual net nitrogen mineralization (NNM) flux in stands of different tree species growing on drained peatlands, as well as to clarify the effect of tree species, soil properties and litter on annual NNM dynamics. Three study sites were set up in May 2014: a downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stand and a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand in Oxalis full-drained swamp (ODS) and a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in Myrtillus full-drained swamp (MDS). The NNM flux was estimated using the in situ method with incubated polyethylene bags. The highest value of NNM was found in stands that were growing on fertile ODS: 127.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 87.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), in the downy birch stand and in the Norway spruce stand, respectively. A significantly lower annual NNM flux (11.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) occurred in the Scots pine stand growing in MDS. Nitrification was highest at fertile ODS sites and ammonification was the highest at the low fertility MDS site. For all study sites, positive correlation was found between soil temperature and NNM intensity. The difference in annual NNM between the downy birch stand and the Norway spruce stand growing on similar drained fertile peatlands was due to litter quality. The annual N input into the soil through leaf litter was the highest at the downy birch site where also the C/N ratio of litter was the lowest. The second highest N input into the soil was found in the spruce stand and the lowest in the pine stand.

AB The aim of this study is to estimate wintertime emissions of greenhouse gases CO2, N2O and CH(4)in two abandoned peat extraction areas (APEA), Ess-soo and Laiuse, and in two Oxalis site-type drained peatland forests (DPF) on nitrogen-rich sapric histosol, a Norway spruce and a Downy birch forest, located in eastern Estonia. According to the long-term study using a closed chamber method, the APEAs emitted less CO(2)and N2O, and more CH(4)than the DPFs. Across the study sites, CO(2)flux correlated positively with soil, ground and air temperatures. Continuous snow depth > 5 cm did not influence CO2, but at no snow or a thin snow layer the fluxes varied on a large scale (from -1.1 to 106 mg C m(-2)h(-1)). In all sites, the highest N2O fluxes were observed at a water table depth of -30 to -40 cm. CH(4)was consumed in the DPFs and was always emitted from the APEAs, whereas the highest flux appeared at a water table >20 cm above the surface. Considering the global warming potential (GWP) of the greenhouse gas emissions from the DPFs in the wintertime, the flux of N2O was the main component of warming, showing 3-6 times higher radiative forcing values than that of CO(2)flux, while the role of CH(4)was unimportant. In the APEAs, CO(2)and CH(4)made up almost equal parts, whereas the impact of N2O on GWP was minor.

AB Many upland catchments in the UK have undergone afforestation; their characteristic waterlogged soils require extensive pre-plantation ground drainage to allow tree establishment. In peatland areas this can result in very highly coloured runoff and enhanced dissolved organic matter (DOM) export in rivers of naturally high concentrations. In 1966, the Coalburn Experimental Catchment, northern England, was established to investigate the impact of afforestation on an upland peat catchment. Here we report the variations in DOM spectrophotometric properties of streamflow in the catchment at canopy closure, especially with respect to potential carbon sources within the artificial drainage ditches. Drainage ditches are characterized by water that has higher absorption coefficients and which is more highly coloured than in the catchment tributaries. Ditched, afforested areas produce more highly-coloured runoff waters that are more fluorescent and absorbent normalized to carbon concentration compared to ditches in open moorland. Ditches that had been experimentally re-excavated have organic matter of different spectrophotometric character, with higher dissolved organic carbon concentration and less aromatic or lower molecular weight material. It is hypothesized that this is due to the exposure of bare peat faces within and adjacent to the ditches that are more susceptible to drying compared to vegetated areas. The large extent of this drainage network acts as both a rapid transport network increasing hydrological connectivity and a pool for the storage of DOM, which is of different spectrophotometric character under low flow conditions, depending on management conditions.

AB Watering up typically ensues after clearcutting forestry-drained peatland forests. Thus, the effectiveness of maintenance drainage and soil preparation procedures becomes paramount for establishing a new generation of commercial forest. Mounding is the primary method of soil preparation applied in regeneration sites lying on deep peat. As raised planting spots, mounds are resistant to waterlogging and assumed to be beneficial for organic matter (OM) decomposition via, e.g., increased soil aeration and temperature, which would also enhance seedling growth. In recent years, however, less intensive and cheaper alternatives like scalping have been sought with some reported cases of success. Our case study investigated the survival and growth of Scots pine outplants in mounds, scalps, and unprepared microsites along a moisture gradient. After three growing seasons, mounding accelerated neither seedling growth nor OM decomposition relative to the unprepared treatment. Survival in mounds was nonetheless superior overall. Scalps behaved as water collecting depressions leading to a catastrophic regeneration result. Based on our findings, water table level (WTL) overrides other growth-controlling factors in excess moisture conditions. To combat watering up coupled with greater than normal rainfall, we recommend reforestation strategies which provide elevated, prepared planting spots (i.e., mounds) or utilize unprepared, higher microforms.

AB Fertilization of drained peatland forests with easily soluble or slow-release apatite fertilizers can increase phosphorus (P) export to water courses, especially when the soil is low in aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) hydroxides and oxides. Application of Al and Fe together with P increases P adsorption to the soil and decreases the risk of leaching. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of recycled iron phosphate (rFePO(4)) as forest fertilizer raw material from environmental and forest production perspectives. Trial fertilizers with different mixtures of rFePO(4) and Russian Kola apatite (Kap) were applied on 15 mini-catchments (area 100 m(2)), where the discharge at the outlet was collected, sampled and analyzed throughout the about 4-year measurement period. The foliage P content and height growth of the trees on the mini-catchments were measured. The biomass growth of the extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) was studied with a separate in-growth mesh bag experiment conducted on the same site. The results indicated no increase in phosphorus export to surface waters after application of rFePO(4) and 25/75 and 50/50 mixtures of rFePO(4) and Kap. In contrast to earlier studies showing a relatively high P export with different types of apatite fertilizers, the Kap fertilizer showed only minor phosphorus export. The height growth measurements and needle analyses of the juvenile Scots pine stands indicated poor P availability from pure rFePO(4), but the P availability from the 50/50 and 25/75 mixtures of rFePO(4) and Kap was similar to pure Kap. The mixtures of Kap and rFePO(4) enhanced the EMM biomass by 2- to 3-fold, whereas Kap and rFePO(4) alone, and high P availability (superphosphate) had no significant effect compared to non-P controls. The increase in EMM biomass as induced by concurrent application of Kap and rFePO(4) was not clearly reflected in tree growth and P acquisition. However, longer follow-up studies than in this one may be needed in order to verify the effect of increased EMM biomass on mycorrhizal mycelia mediated nutrient uptake and tree growth.

AB Rotation forestry including clearcutting is a common method of practising forestry in Fennoscandia. Clearcutting in peatland forests markedly increases environmental loading: leaching of nutrients and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil. Continuous cover forestry has been suggested as an alternative because it does not include clearcutting but partial harvesting. However, impacts of partial harvesting on greenhouse gas fluxes are not well understood and in peatlands have not been studied at all. We conducted a partial harvest by removing 70% of the total stem volume in a mature nutrient-rich peatland forest in Southern Finland. The aim was to investigate how partial harvesting a peatland forest affects CH4 and N2O balances, and how much different surface types contribute to the balances. We used automatic and manual chamber methods to measure fluxes from both harvest and uncut control site. Fluxes were measured from the forest floor, logging trails, and ditches. Fluxes from these surface types were upscaled to obtain net ecosystem-level fluxes during two postharvest summers (June-August 2016 and 2017). After the harvest, forest floor CH4 fluxes did not change significantly at the harvested site compared to the control site. However, fluxes at logging trails increased significantly. N2O fluxes increased at the harvest site in the post-harvest years, but so did those at the control site as well. Upscaling CH4 fluxes to ecosystem-level indicated that despite their small area (2.4%), emissions from ditches could be large on ecosystem-scale, but their uncertainty was high, while the logging trail CH4 fluxes (20% of the total area) were small. In contrast, N2O fluxes from ditches were low, but the logging trail fluxes comprised 35-38% of the total surface balance. The overall conclusion is that partial harvesting did not cause considerable changes in CH4 and N2O fluxes from a forestry-drained peatland.

AB In the boreal and temperate zones about 15 million hectares of peatlands and wetlands have been drained for forestry purposes and a large number of these forests are now approaching their commercial thinning or regeneration age. One of the major concerns raised in connection with an increased harvesting of drained peatland forests is the deterioration of the downstream water quality due to an enhanced nutrient transport. Harvest residues left on the site are a potential high source of nutrients to recipient water bodies and both increased N and P exports have been reported after conventional stem-only clear-cutting. We studied the decomposition of Picea abies and Pin us sylvestris harvest residue needles at two clear-cut areas and two uncut forested areas on drained peatlands at two locations in southern Finland. Our results indicated that P is easily released from harvest residue needles. After the first three growing seasons, spruce and pine needles had lost approximately 31% and 47% of their initial P contents, respectively. There was no clear gain or loss of nitrogen. Most of the heavy metals accumulated in the needles as the decomposition process proceeded, especially at the more southern study location near the heavily industrialized Helsinki capital area with high atmospheric deposition. The conclusion is that harvest residue needles are not a likely source of the increased N export that has been observed to occur from peat soils soon after clear-cutting, but that P release from harvest residues may be a cause for the reported high P losses.

AB In a study of fungi growing in various root-associated habitats in and around Picea mariana, black spruce, in northern Ontario, Canada, an examination was made of the degree to which differences in growth sites within an area of a few square kilometers might influence the structure of root-associated filamentous microfungal populations. Picea mariana roots were collected at four strongly differing boreal forest sites: an undisturbed forest site with deep litter and humus layers; a recently regenerated forest; a clearcut, former portable sawmill site with a few small, naturally regenerated trees; and an open peat bog penetrated by roots from trees growing along the margin. Comparisons were done on isolate assemblages primarily from serially washed mycorrhizae, supplemented with comparison samples from washed root bark and adherent rhizosphere soil. The Bray & Curtis similarity index and nodal components analysis were utilised to identify trends within the data. Root endophyte fungi, mainly Phialocephala fortinii and Meliniomyces variabilis, were among the most common isolates from serially washed mycorrhizae and showed strong trends among the site types, with the former most common from sites low in humus and also low in known humus-associated microfungi, and the latter most common from the peat bog site. The overall composition of the isolate assemblages from washed mycorrhizae mainly reflected site factors, with assemblages from the undisturbed and regenerated forest sites similar to one another and those from the clearcut and peat bog sites strongly distinct. A major difference was also seen between two seasonal samples at the exposed clearcut site, but few seasonal differences were seen at the other sites. The regenerated and undisturbed forest sites were high in Umbelopsis isabellina, Mortierella verticillata and Penicillium spinulosum, fungi typical of humic horizons in boreal podzols; the clearcut yielded the greatest numbers of Fusarium proliferatum, Umbelopsis nana and Penicillium montanense isolates, an assemblage tending to indicate exposed mineral soil; while the peat bog was typified by the presence of characteristic northern peat inhabitants Mortierella pulchella and P spinulosum, as well as temperate peat inhabitant Penicillium lividum. A synthesis of these results with other data suggests that as a microhabitat, the mycorrhizosphere, as originally defined by Foster & Marks, is of little significance in determining the structure of filamentous fungal populations in soil influenced by the presence of ectomycorrhizal forest tree roots. Edaphic and overall microbial community conditions are much more significant, but the influence of a "symbiorhizosphere effect" exerted by certain ectomycorrhizal symbionts within the whole soil volume they occupy is also known in some cases and worthy of further investigation.

AB Ditch networks in drained peatland forests are maintained regularly to prevent water table rise and subsequent decrease in tree growth. The growing tree stand itself affects the level of water table through evapotranspiration, the magnitude of which is closely related to the living stand volume. In this study, regression analysis was applied to quantify the relationship between the late summer water table depth (D(WT)) and tree stand volume, mean monthly summertime precipitation (P(s)), drainage network condition, and latitude. The analysis was based on several large data sets from southern to northern Finland, including concurrent measurements of stand volume and summer water table depth. The identified model demonstrated a nonlinear effect of stand volume on D(WT), a linear effect of P(s) on D(WT), and an interactive effect of both stand volume and P(s). Latitude and ditch depth showed only marginal influence on D(WT). A separate analysis indicated that an increase of 10 m(3).ha(-1) in stand volume corresponded with a drop of 1 cm in water table level during the growing season. In a subsample of the data, high bulk density peat showed deeper D(WT) than peat with low bulk density at the same stand volume.

AB Testate amoebae (Protozoa) were examined in a Picea mariana forested mire in northern Ontario, Canada to assess the use of testate amoebae as environmental bioindicators of drainage. Habitat types included Picea mariana trees, Ericaceae shrubs, and Sphagnum mosses. Several of the species or species groups recorded in the study area, emerged as showing significant differences in abundance between control and drained microsites. Significant differences were recorded between control and drained microsites for Cyclopyxis arcelloides-type Assulina muscorum and Centropyxis aerophila-type in certain site types.  In other site types Cyclopyxis arcelloides.  Trinema lineare, and Centropyxis aerophila-type, decreased in abundance with drainage whereas Assulina muscorum and Corythion dubium increased in abundance with drainage. This study demonstrates for the first time that alterations in the soil microenvironment from drainage are reflected almost immediately by the abundance of certain species of testate amoebae, some of which increase in number, whereas other decrease in number.  Testate amoebae may, therefore, be used to monitor environmental effects of drainage in peatland forestry.

AB In warm and humid, tectonically active regions like Japan, landslides are an important influence on the development of mountain wetlands, but data bearing upon the relationship of Quaternary landslides to wetland development are scarce. We used lithological analysis, 14C dating, tephra age data, and carbon contents of wetland cores to compare the evolution of four wetlands, one (the Oyachi wetland) within a landslide area transformed by mass movement and three (the Appi Highland wetlands) outside of a landslide area, in the heavy snowfall region of the Hachimantai Mountains of northeastern Japan. Evidence from the Oyachi wetland shows that its transition from peatland to forest was interrupted at about 5500 cal BP by slope movement leading to the development of a lake that was drained by streams at about 3300 cal BP, after which a peatland environment has persisted until the present. We suggest that the evolution of this type of wetland is primarily influenced by landslide movements and stream dissection rather than climate change. In the Appi Highland wetlands, peatlands appeared much later, around the time of the To-a tephra fall in 915 AD, during the Medieval Warm Period, and have persisted with little change until the present. We suggest that the development of mountain wetlands outside of landslide areas is primarily related to climate changes rather than topographic changes. Sediment analyses of mountain wetlands within landslide areas may be useful for tracing the development of Quaternary landslides and subsequent topographic changes that may have implications for biodiversity in mountainous regions.

AB To assess the effect of peatland type and of forest-drainage performed 30 yr earlier on the occurrence of mycobacteria in runoff-waters, the counts of culturable mycobacteria were followed during a snow-free season. Runoff-waters were from a natural and a drained peatland and each had a different nutrient status. Samples were collected in May, June, August, and October of 1992. Mycobacteria were isolated from all waters. The highest culturable counts were detected in August (up to 7.3 x 10(3) CFU/L). The runoff waters from the two natural peatlands had similar median counts, whereas lowering of the water table by drainage slightly increased the mycobacterial counts in most cases. Changes in vegetation, such as a decrease in the coverage of Sphagnum species, or soil characteristics following drainage had little effect on the occurrence of mycobacteria in the runoff-waters, even though Sphagnum vegetation has been regarded as important for the growth of these bacteria. The counts of mycobacteria in the runoff-waters correlated with precipitation but not with air temperature. This indicates that the mycobacterial growth took plate mainly in vegetation and soil, not in the runoff-waters. when total runoff during May to October nas taken into account, the leaching rates of mycobacteria from all catchments were about 4 to 5 x 10(11) CFU km(-2). Thus drainage had a negligible effect on the leaching of mycobacteria from peatlands.

AB The aim of this study was to develop individual-tree diameter and height growth models for Scots pine, Norway spruce, and pubescent birch growing in drained peatlands in Finland. Trees growing in peatland sites have growth patterns that deviate from that of trees growing in mineral soil sites. Five-year growth was explained by tree diameter, different tree and stand level competition measures, management operations and site characteristics. The drainage status of the site was influencing growth directly or in interaction with other variables. Site quality had a direct impact but was also commonly related to current site drainage status (need for ditch maintenance). Recent thinning increased growth of all species and former PK fertilization increased growth of pine and birch. Temperature sum was a significant predictor in all models and altitude for spruce and birch. The data were a subsample of the 7th National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots representing northern and southern Finland and followed by repeated measurements for 15-20 yrs. Growth levels predicted by the models were calibrated using NFI11 data to remove bias originating from the sample of the modelling data. The mixed linear models technique was used in model estimation The models will be incorporated into the MOTT1 stand simulator to replace the current peatlands growth models.

AB In the humic River Nuorittajoki, northern Finland, the recapture rates of stocked yearling salmon, Salmo salar L., were lower in riffles affected by loading from peat mining and forest drainage areas than in the reference riffles receiving a considerably smaller loading. The salmon caught from the affected riffles were also smaller and thinner by the end of the summer than those from the reference riffles. The size was inversely related to the estimated particulate matter load imposed on the area. The salmon at the affected riffles appeared to feed less but there was no difference in the niche width between the two types of riffle. Hydropsyche and Rhyacophila larvae occupied significantly larger proportions of the stomach volume in the reference than in the affected riffles whereas Ephemerella larvae had an opposite trend. These observations suggest changes in the foraging of yearling salmon in riffles affected by increased particulate matter loading from drained peatlands.

AB Tree-ring and peat stratigraphy data were examined back to 5000 BC in order to identify and compare humidity changes in Fennoscandia. The temporal variation in distribution of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) was used as a measure of past lake-level fluctuations in central Sweden. The chronology, which spans 2893 BC - AD 1998 with minor gaps in AD 887 - 907 and 1633 - 1650 BC and with additional floating chronologies back to 4868 BC, was cross-dated and fixed to an absolute timescale using a chronology from Tornetrask, northern Sweden. The peat stratigraphy from the Stomyren peat bog, south-central Sweden, was transformed into humification indices to evaluate humidity changes during the past 8000 years. The peat chronology is established by four tephra datings and eight C-14 datings. Synchronous periods of drier conditions, interpreted from regeneration and the mortality pattern of pine, tree-ring chronology and peat humification, were recognized at c. 4900 - 4800 BC, 2400 - 2200 BC, 2100 - 1800 BC, 1500 - 1100 BC, AD 50 - 200, AD 400 - 600 and AD 1350 - 1500. Possible wetter periods were encountered at 3600 - 3400 BC, 3200 - 2900 BC, 2200 - 2100 BC, 1700 - 1500 BC, 1100 - 900 BC, 100 BC - AD 50, AD 200 - 400, AD 750 - 900 and AD 1550 - 1700. The wet and dry periods revealed by the tree rings and peat stratigraphy data indicate considerable humidity changes in the Holocene.

AB The potential short-term (less than or equal to10(2) years) and long-term (>10(2) years) biogeochemical and ecological effects of diverting stream water (pH 4.9-6.7) into a limed, flooded tailings impoundment (pH 8-12) were studied by combining geochemical and biological data. In the long-term perspective, the successional development of lakes was used as a natural analogue. Based on the vertical distribution of temperature and total dissolved solids (TDS < 0.22 mum), the impoundment can be characterised as a continuous/discontinuous cold polymictic lake, with holomictic summer circulation. A re-inoculation study indicated that the growth of autotrophic, aerobic bacteria (presumably Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) presently is inhibited by the high pH in the impoundment.
   In a short-term perspective, termination of liming and diversion of stream water into the impoundment will result in a complex interplay between physical, biogeochemical and ecological effects. A reduced vertical mixing of the similar to2-m-deep water column, dissolution of calcite and gypsum (compounds of a sludge formed in the impoundment) and an enhanced microbiological activity are major expected effects. The dissolution of calcite may act as a pH buffer and result in metal remobilisation from the sludge. Excluding autochthonous organic matter produced in the impoundment, streamwater input of suspended matter and formation of settling flocculants are expected to result in a sediment accumulation rate of similar to1.5 mg cm(-2) year(-1) (1.6-3.3 cm/10(2) years). Settling allochthonous organic C (0.15-0.30 mg C cm(-2) year(-1)) may serve as an oxygen barrier and as a reservoir of organic compounds capable of driving redox reactions.
   In a long-term perspective, a hydroseral development into a wetland/peatland can be expected, with a bog lake, poor fen or flat bog as final stage. This development presupposes a decreasing pH when liming is terminated and stream water is diverted into the impoundment. It also assumes that the impoundment will be similar to an acidified lake, and that the succession is driven by Sphagnum colonizing the impoundment. If the hydrological conditions/water level is affected (e.g., by climatic changes or a dam failure), a terrestrialization culminating in coniferous forest on peat soil may occur.

AB Drained peatlands are an important source of forest biomass in boreal regions and ditch network maintenance (DNM) operations may be needed to restore the drainage functions of ditches. By reviewing the available literature, as well as utilizing an existing hydrological model and analyzing the characteristics of eroded sediments, we assessed the impacts of DNM on runoff and exports of suspended solids (SS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). In general, DNM had minor impact on runoff and dissolved N and P, and it decreased rather than increased DOC exports. To increase the understanding of the hydrochemical impacts of DNM, future research should focus on the characteristics of SS and particulate nutrient exports. A major gap in knowledge is also the very limited regional representativeness of the available studies. High erosion risk in the ditches reaching the mineral soil below peat should be acknowledged when planning mitigation measures.

AB By the end of this century, much of the climate space of western Canada's boreal forest is expected to shift northwards and be replaced by climates that are currently associated with aspen forest, parkland and grassland ecosystems. In this study, we review the various processes that will mediate ecological responses to these projected changes in climate. We conclude that ecological transitions are unlikely to involve a gradual wave-like shift in ecotonal boundaries. Instead, we predict that ecological changes will lag substantially behind changes in climate and that individual ecosystem components will respond at different rates. In particular, if precipitation inputs are maintained as expected, then peatlands should exhibit considerable resilience to climate change and remain a dominant feature on the landscape in 2100. Because peatlands retain large amounts of water on the landscape their continued presence may in turn slow the rate of forest loss, especially the aspen component. Thus, ecological response to climate change in the western boreal region may involve a transition to a novel ecosystem that includes peatlands and aspen as dominant features -unlike anything that exists today. Moreover, this interim stage may remain in place well into the next century, potentially providing additional time for forest-dependent species to adapt. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We analyzed the fossil insect fauna of a palsa peatland located 10 km south and east of the treeline in subarctic Quebec (57 degrees 45'N, 76 degrees 15'W) to detect any changes in the species composition during the Holocene epoch and to infer past environmental conditions in the study area. A minimum of 802 beetle individuals were recovered from a 2-m pear section, representing 51 taxa (18 identified to the species level) and 8 families. Trechus crassiscapus, Eucnecosum brunnescens, and Olophrum rotundicolle were the most common species found in the peat. The insect assemblage was quite stable through the study interval (5850-1950 BP). The formation of the palsa (where the peat section was excavated) occurred probably after 1950 BP, raising the soil surface above water level and preventing additional peat accumulation. The proportion of boreal forest species in the faunal assemblage is high (88%). The only arctic (tundra) species found were Amara alpina and Pterostichus arcticola. Many species were out of their modern distribution range, but since collection localities are scarce in subarctic Quebec, the modern range of these species may extend to the study site. A mutual climatic range analysis, employing beetles identified to the species level, showed that the mean July temperature of the study area between 5850 and 1950 BP was possibly 2.8-5.5 degrees C higher than during the 20th century. This assertion is supported by other paleoecological data (pollen and charcoal remains) suggesting a cooling trend in the study area after 2000 BP. However, since the last 2000 years are missing from the sampled peat section, it was not possible to quantify the impact of the cooling trend on the beetle fauna.

AB Peat and other organic soils play a major role in the greenhouse gas balance and overall carbon sink function of the Nordic and Baltic forests. A peatland may act both as a source and a sink for all three main greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O. But how much is a matter of debate. An SNS-supported project will add facts to the discussion.

AB The protection of ecological functions of forested swamps and peatlands is the subject of legal and regulatory measures. In Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, wood harvesting is carried out on swamps and peatlands of merchantable forests. What is the impact of forestry practices on these wetlands hydrological functions such as sediment retention, groundwater recharge, flood reduction and low flow augmentation? The answer to this question is complex as the contribution of wetlands to these hydrological functions vary with each wetland type as underlined by the experts. With the aim of ascertaining the contribution of wetlands, and to infer the effects of forest management on forested swamps and peatlands, we carried out a literature review. The existing literature reviews only partially cover the subject or in the case of peatlands, they mainly consider drained sites. In this review, the links between the hydrologic functions and forest harvesting are treated by category of wetlands to take into account their anticipated specific contribution.

AB Data from 24 544 pine-dominated plots of the Eighth National Forest Inventory (NFI) in southern Finland were used in this study. The most commonly identified cause of damage was Gremmeniella abietina (10.6% of the stands). Disease assessments by NFI groups were reliable at the stand level. The disease was spatially clustered, being almost twice as common on peatland as on mineral soil plots. However, there was no difference between undrained peatlands and mineral soils. The more the original peatland site type had changed after drainage, the more common was the disease. On mineral soil, disease frequencies were highest on alluviated plots or on the most fertile plots. Naturally regenerated stands were affected more than artificially regenerated stands, but the difference was significant only on the richer sites. The proportion of diseased plots increased with stand density up to 25-28 m(2) ha(-1). Elevation of the plot had only a weak effect on damage frequency.

AB 1. Knowledge about the distribution and types of wetlands is in high demand by ecosystem modellers for full greenhouse gas accounting. The scope of this paper is to demonstrate the suitability of satellite radar data for the delineation of wetlands in the tundra and boreal forest biomes of central Siberia,
   2. An area of more than 3 million km(2) in central Siberia was investigated using satellite data. It covers freshwater ecosystems of the tundra and non-forested peatlands in tundra and boreal forest biornes. The satellite data represent the growing seasons of 2003/2004.
   3. Microwave data were acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument onboard ENVISAT. The multi-temporal capabilities and resolution (150 In x 150 m in WS mode) of the ASAR wide swath mode enabled the detection of dynamic features > 2 ha over this vast area. Scatterometer (QuikScat) data could be employed to distinguish hydro-periods.
   4. Wetland types have been identified on the basis of seasonal changes in backscatter. In a first step scatterometer data were used to identify the transition period from frozen to unfrozen conditions over a range of 15 degrees latitude. Inundation patterns and soil moisture changes could be identified for the different hydro-periods and used to classify wetlands. Results for peatlands have been compared with Russian forest inventory data which contain information on wetland distribution.
   5. The database of permanently inundated areas is an intermediate product which enables the mapping of wetlands in two ways: (1) identification of seasonal inundation in relation to snowmelt and high permafrost tables and (2) input for density analysis of permanent small and shallow lakes in tundra areas which are important freshwater ecosystems as well as a methane source. Differences in intensity and duration of soil moisture conditions allow the identification of peatlands. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We estimated the soil CO2 balance of 68 forestry-drained boreal peatland sites in Finland by subtracting the litter input to soil from the CO2 efflux from soil. We also measured soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and N2O and the CO2 sink of the growing tree stand in order to assess the current greenhouse gas impact of the study sites.
   The soil was, on average, a CO2 source of +190 +/- 70 g m(-2) year(-1) at the fertile Herb-rich and Vaccinium myrtillus type sites, but a CO2 sink of -70 +/- 30 g m(-2) year(-1) at the poor Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Dwarf shrub type sites. The source increased at the fertile and the sink decreased at the poor sites as the water table deepened. The source at the fertile sites also increased by increasing temperature sum, the highest CO2 sources being around +1000 g m(-2) year(-1) at well drained sites in Southern Finland.
   Both fertile and poor sites had a climate cooling impact. The sink in CO2 equivalents at the fertile sites was -690 +/- 90 g m(-2) year(-1) and at the poor sites -540 +/- 70 g m(-2) year(-1). The greater sink at the fertile sites was due to clearly better tree growth, their tree stand CO2 sink being -880 +/- 60 g m(-2) year(-1) compared to the -490 +/- 60 g m(-2) year(-1) at the poor sites.
   Ditching-based forestry can be climatically sustainable at nutrient-poor boreal peatlands since the peat soil continues to be a CO2 sink even after drainage. At the fertile sites, forestry will inevitably lead to loss of carbon in the long term, unless the tree biomass is stored after cuttings, for example in wooden buildings or as biochar in agricultural soils.

TI Peat-based emissions in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Peat-based emissions are reported under three different reporting sectors in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory: Agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Energy. Peat-based emissions comprise together around one third of the total reported net greenhouse gas emissions in Finland when also sinks and emissions from LULUCF sector are included. Most of the emissions come from the combustion of peat for energy but emissions from the agricultural use of peatlands and drained forest soils are also of importance. The IPCC (Intergovemmental Panel on Climate Change) provides the basic guidelines for the inventory calculations. However, the use of national methods and emission factors is encouraged. Introducing new country-specific methods or emission factors in the inventory calculations requires transparent documentation of the input parameters and the process how emission factors, parameters and models are derived. Here we describe the national system for estimating peat-based emissions for the greenhouse gas inventory, and the methods that are used in deriving the emission estimates, as well as possibilities to use new national emission factors for improving the estimates.

AB The nutrients removed from the forest when branches and tree tops are harvested for fuel can be returned to the site by bringing back the wood-ash from the burning. In Sweden, this compensation measure is not carried out to any appreciable extent, mostly because there is no economic incentive to the landowner. The ash contains all the elements required for tree growth except for nitrogen (N), the most important element limiting growth on mineral soils. Since ash, so far, is brought back only to mineral soils, increased forest growth cannot be expected. In contrast, for organic soils, N is often abundant whereas the amounts of other mineral nutrients in peat are small. This means that the peatland forests provide an opportunity for ash amendment in order to increase forest production. Old fertilization trials using wood-ash show that the growth increase can be very large. The aims of this study were (i) to calculate the area of peat-covered land that, with respect to stand growth responses, could be regarded as most suitable for biofuel ash (wood-ash and peat-ash) fertilization and (ii) to assess the amount of biofuel ash needed for fertilizing this area.
   Most of the area calculations were based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (SNFI) 1997-2001. Sites were selected using existing knowledge about ash fertilization effects on tree growth and with the aid of registrations made in SNFI regarding peat thickness, site productivity, drainage, condition of drains, dominating field vegetation, and stage of stand development. Additional calculations were made to estimate the area of abandoned peat harvesting fields ready for after-use by afforestation.
   According to the selection criteria used, the most suitable sites for biofuel ash fertilization are drained, mid-rotation or old peatland forests where the field vegetation is dominated by shrubs or low sedge plants indicative of medium-low site productivity. The selected area comprises 190,000 ha. Most are located in North and North Central Sweden (90,000 ha), whereas South Central and South Sweden accounted for 30,000 and 70,000 ha, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). To these areas, 2000-3000 ha of abandoned peat fields ready for afforestation should be available within a period of about 5 years.
   The present annual production of biofuel ash in Sweden, of acceptable quality for forest fertilization, is 250,000300,000 tonnes. If it were desired to fertilize all the sites (190,000 ha) identified in this study with 5000 kg per ha, it would require 3-4 years of the current annual production of bio-ash. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present the past 200 years palaeoecology of a peatland located in W Poland. This site is very important from the point of view of regional nature conservation. Plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat microtomography and radiocarbon dating were used in high-resolution to reconstruct the recent human impact on the peatland. In this study, we hypothesise that recent disturbance associated with peatland drainage and forest transformation has affected the development of the peatland and its trophic states. We sought to answer several questions. I) How pristine is the Rzecin peatland? II) Did the outbreak of Panolis flammea and the deforestation of 90% of the area of the Notec Forest affect the water table and the pH of the Rzecin peatland? III) Did the construction of the Rzecin Canal through the drainage of the peatland (in the 1880s and 1890s) strongly influence the changes in the ground water of the Rzecin peatland? Deforestation and the digging of the Rzecin drainage canal between AD 1880 and AD 1890 marked the beginning of major changes in the wetland ecosystem and caused habitat acidification. The next acidification event, connected with Sphagnum appearance, began ca AD 1990. Based on our quantitative reconstruction, the water table decreased during the years preceding P. flammea outbreak in AD 1923. Then, the water table increased after the outbreak correlated with the historical maps that show ephemeral lakes in the Notec Forest. The wetland examined by the current study was formerly perceived as highly natural, but its state is far from pristine, being very unstable during the last 200 years.

AB In the eastern Canadian boreal forest, drainage of unproductive black spruce peatlands is an infrequently used silvicultural treatment. The sparse scientific literature concerning its influence on tree growth is, however, relatively positive about the possibility of using drainage to convert unproductive stands into productive ones. This study aimed to address this issue by assessing the individual tree growth and by estimating the future stand productivity on a drained black spruce peatland stand. Results showed larger mean annual post-drainage stump diameter increment with increasing ditch proximity but they also showed the lack of effect of the treatment at distances greater than 15 m from the ditch. Small-sized trees reacted more strongly to the treatment than larger ones. Estimated site productivity was also influenced by the ditch proximity. The presence of excavating mounds on only one side of the ditch greatly influenced tree growth and site productivity. Considering the obtained results, intensive drainage operations, utilizing narrow ditch spacing, would be necessary in order to transform the type of unproductive sites studied into productive ones.

AB Peatland drainage has been an important component of forestry management in the boreal zone and the resulting ditch networks are maintained regularly to sustain forest productivity. In Finland, this is recognized as the most detrimental forestry practice increasing diffuse loads of suspended solids. Alongside forestry management on peatlands, interest in peatland restoration has grown lately. Distributed hydrological modeling has the potential to address these matters by recognizing relevant physical mechanisms and identifying most suitable strategies for mitigating undesired outcomes. This study investigates the utility of such a modeling approach in a drained peatland forest environment. To provide a suitable tool for this purpose, we coupled channel network flow to the three-dimensional distributed hydrological model FLUSH. The resulting model was applied to a 5.2 ha drained peatland forest catchment in Eastern Finland. The model was calibrated and validated using field measurements obtained over frost-free periods of five months. The application showed that distributed modeling can disentangle the importance of spatial factors on local soil moisture conditions, which is significant as peatland drainage aims to control these conditions. In our application, we limited the spatial aspect to the topography and the drainage network, and found that the drainage configuration had a clear effect on the spatial soil moisture patterns but that the effect was less pronounced during the wetter summer. Future applications of distributed modeling in this field comprises investigating the impacts of other spatial factors, modeling channel erosion and solid transport to address strategies for their mitigation, and evaluating restoration schemes.

AB The effects of climatic factors and vegetation type on evapotranspiration (E) and water use efficiency (WUE) were analyzed using tower-based eddy-covariance (EC) data for nine mature forest sites, two peatland sites and one grassland site across an east-west continental-scale transect in Canada during the period 2003-2006. The seasonal pattern of E was closely linked to growing-season length and rainfall distribution. Although annual precipitation (P) during the observation period was highly variable among sites (250-1450 mm), minimum annual E was not less than 200 mm and was limited to 400-500 ram where annual P exceeded 700 mm. Site-specific interannual variability in E could be explained by either changes in total P or variations in solar irradiance. A highly positive linear correlation was found between monthly mean values of E and net radiation (R-n) at the grassland site (AB-GRL), the two peatland sites (AB-WPL and ON-EPL), and only one of the forest sites (coastal Douglas-fir, BC-DF49) whereas a hysteretic relationship at the other forest sites indicated that E lagged behind the typical seasonal progression of R-n. Results of a cross-correlation analysis between daily (24-h) E and R-n revealed that site-specific lag times were between 10 and 40 days depending on the lag of vapour pressure deficit (D) behind R-n and the decoupiing coefficient, Omega. There was significant seasonal variation in daytime mean dry-foliage Priestley-Taylor alpha with maxima occurring in the growing season at all sites except BC-DF49 where it was relatively constant (similar to 0.55) throughout all years. Annual means of daytime dry-foliage alpha mostly ranging between 0.5 and 0.7 implied stomatal limitation to transpiration. Increasing D significantly decreased canopy conductance (g(c)) at the forest sites but had little effect at the peatland and grassland sites, while variation in soil water content caused only minor changes in g(c). At all sites, a strong linear correlation between monthly mean values of gross primary production (GPP) and E resulted in water use efficiency being relatively constant. While at most sites, WUE was in the range of 2.6-3.6 g C kg(-1) H2O, the BC-DF49 site had the highest WUE of the twelve sites with values near 6.0 g C kg(-1) H2O. Of the two peatland sites. AB-WPL, a western treed fen, had a significantly higher WUE (similar to 3.0 g C kg(-1) H2O) than ON-EPL, an eastern ombrotrophic bog (similar to 1.8 g C kg(-1) H2O), which was related to peatland productivity and plant functional type.

AB Ditch network maintenance promotes forest growth in drained peatland forests but increases nutrient and sediment loads, which are detrimental to water quality. Society needs to balance the harvest revenue from improved forest growth against deteriorating water quality. We examine socially optimal even-aged forest management in drained peatlands when harvesting and ditch network maintenance cause nutrient and sediment loading. The means to reduce loading include establishing overland flow fields and abstaining from ditch network maintenance. We characterize this choice analytically in a rotation framework and examine, in a numerical model, the key factors affecting the choice of forest management and water protection measures. We choose a drained peatland forest site located in northeastern Finland in the vicinity of ecologically vulnerable forest headwater streams. On the given drained forest site, we find a set of parameters under which implementing ditch network maintenance is privately but not socially optimal.

AB The improvement of soil conditions by water table lowering through drainage is indicative of the potential for tree growth response to this treatment. We measured water table level, peat water content and temperature, and rates of decomposition of Sphagnum peat, cellulose and wood sticks in a black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) peatland of eastern Quebec, on a control site and a drained site. In general, the water table was lowered within 15 m of the ditches, resulting in a marked difference between spacings of 20-30 m and 40-50-60 m. In the middle of the 40-m spacing, the frequencies of lowering below the root zone (20 cm) and the 30-cm depth were respectively increased by 33% and 40%. Feat water content at 10-cm depth decreased by 20% to 29% following drainage and the effect appeared related to ditch closeness. At 20- and 30-cm depths, decreases of the same order were observed only at 5 m from the ditch. At distances of 10 m and more, the average water content remained within 10% of saturation at 20 cm and within 5% at 30 cm. After drainage, the seasonal maximum temperature at the 10-cm depth increased by 3.5 degrees C at 5 m from the ditch and by 1.5 degrees C al greater distances, compared to the control where the mean seasonal maximum was 13.5 degrees C. At ail distances, the autumnal cooling of the substrate was accelerated and winter temperature was 1 to 2 degrees C less than the control site. Temperature at 30-cm depth was not modified by drainage. Rates of decomposition were accelerated, mainly at the 30-cm depth and within the first 10 m from the ditch. At 10-cm depth, decomposition was weakly related to drainage and it is possible that relatively low water contents countered the effect of temperature increase.

AB Wood ash produced as a by-product in paper mills and heating power plants contains many toxic heavy metals, including high cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The addition of wood ash on drained and forested peatlands to improve forest growth and nutrient balance is common practice in Finland but creates a risk of increasing Cd concentration in the soil and Cd release into recipient waters. Leaching of Cd from ash-treated peat was studied in a mesocosm experiment with three different ash doses (300, 600 and 1,200 g ash m(-2)), which have been commonly applied for fertilization in boreal forests and forested peatlands. Ash contained 5.4 mg Cd kg(-1), which corresponds doses of 1.6, 3.2 and 6.5 mg Cd m(-2). The mesocosm studies showed that all ash treatments clearly lowered pH (from 3.6 to 3.4-3.3) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations (from 97 to ca. 50 mg C l(-1)) in the run-off water during an 11-week experiment. However, only the application of the highest dose, 1,200 g ash m(-2), increased the Cd concentrations in the run-off water from the initial concentration of 1.25-1.75 mu g Cd l(-1). The treatment of peat with 300 or 600 g ash m(-2) did not increase Cd leaching as compared to the untreated peat. We measured high pH values (between 6.1 and 7.0) and high Cd concentrations only in the upper layers of ash-treated peat, which clearly indicated that most of Cd was tightly retained in the surface peat. The effects of Cd on the aquatic ecosystem were studied in microcosms where run-off water from mesocosms was added into aquariums containing humic lake water, lake sediment, bryophytes and benthic animals. The microcosm experiment showed that only the run-off water received from the highest ash treatment increased the Cd concentration of microcosm water. Greater Cd concentrations were found in benthic animals, Asellus aquaticus isopod, in treatments with the highest ash doses, but accumulation of Cd was not observed in the bottom material or in the bryophytes (Fontinalis antipyretica). According to the results, the risk of Cd release from peat after ash application is of minor short-term importance when low ash doses (between 300 and 600 g ash m(-2)) are used. Ash addition, however, temporally increased the acidity of discharge water, which may contribute to the mobilization of Cd from the peat and enhance the risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms especially in acid waters.

AB Recent studies have shown the establishment of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) to be successful in small canopy gaps cut in drained spruce mire stands in northern Finland. The aim of this study was to quantify seedling height growth in gaps and compare it to that observed in other canopy cuttings and plantations. We sampled spruce crop seedlings (maximum density ca. 3000 ha(-1)) in the spring of 2013 in a field experiment in which canopy gaps of 10, 15 and 20 m in diameter had been cut in winter 2004. The total seedling height in 2013 and the length of annual shoots over the past five years (2012-2008) were recorded in the survey. Seedling height varied from 20 cm to 2.7 m, with an average of 65 cm. The average annual height growth was 7.1 cm. A mixed linear model analysis was carried out to investigate seedling height growth variation. Seedling height was linearly and positively related to growth. Height growth started to increase in the fifth growing season after cutting. Seedling height growth in the 20 m gap was slightly better than in the smaller ones. In the 15 m gap, both the centrally located seedlings and those located at the northern edge grew best. In the 20 m gap, southerly located seedlings grew more slowly than seedlings in all other locations. The average seedling height growth in this study was about 60% of that in peatland plantations, but comparable to that in mineral soil gaps, and 2-3 times higher than in uneven-age cut stands.

AB Measurements of active layer thickness (ALT) are typically taken at the end of summer, a time synonymous with maximum thaw depth. By definition, the active layer is the layer above permafrost that freezes and thaws annually. This study, conducted in peatlands of subarctic Canada, in the zone of thawing discontinuous permafrost, demonstrates that the entire thickness of ground atop permafrost does not always refreeze over winter. In these instances, a talik exists between the permafrost and active layer, and ALT must therefore be measured by the depth of refreeze at the end of winter. As talik thickness increases at the expense of the underlying permafrost, ALT is shown to simultaneously decrease. This suggests that the active layer has a maximum thickness that is controlled by the amount of energy lost from the ground to the atmosphere during winter. The taliks documented in this study are relatively thin (<2m) and exist on forested peat plateaus. The presence of taliks greatly affects the stability of the underlying permafrost. Vertical permafrost thaw was found to be significantly greater in areas with taliks (0.07myear(-1)) than without (0.01myear(-1)). Furthermore, the spatial distribution of areas with taliks increased between 2011 and 2015 from 20% to 48%, a phenomenon likely caused by an anomalously large ground heat flux input in 2012. Rapid talik development and accelerated permafrost thaw indicates that permafrost loss may exhibit a nonlinear response to warming temperatures. Documentation of refreeze depths and talik development is needed across the circumpolar north.

AB Drainage and urea fertilization of forested peatlands in western Canada are being contemplated as means for increasing peatland conifer productivity. Surface application of urea-based fertilizers may result in loss of some N by volatilization of NH3. The objective of the present study was to assess the loss of NH3 from undrained and drained peatland sites as affected by various N dosages, i.e. 0 (unfertilized), 200 (N-2) and 400 kg N ha(-1) (N-4), following field broadcast application of urea fertilizer. Losses of NH3 from fertilized plots were higher on the undrained relative to the drained site. Increase in urea-N dosage increased NH3 volatilization from both sites. Most of the NH3 volatilization losses occurred during the first 9 days after fertilizer application. The precipitation that occurred on day 9 after fertilizer application decreased NH3 volatilization to background levels of unfertilized plots for the rest of the study period. Net mean losses of NH3 from the undrained site were 3% and 4% of applied N for N-2 and N-4, respectively. Corresponding losses on the drained site were 0.7% and 7%. These magnitudes of loss of N appear to be less important from a forest management point of view.

AB In drained, forested peatlands, ditch network maintenance (DNM) is often considered necessary for tree growth, but it also constitutes additional management costs. Commercial thinnings, in turn, in addition to their silvicultural benefits, are generally applied to enhance the financial performance of stand management but results from peatland stands are scarce. In this study, our aim was to find financially feasible management practices for Scots pine-dominated stands on drained peatland sites in Finland. Using mainly inventory data sets, we compiled altogether 29 typical model-stands for four climatic areas, four site types, and two stand conditions according to need for silvicultural care. We used MOTTI stand simulator to predict the development of the model-stands according to different management regimes consisting of various combinations of 0-2 DNM and 0-2 thinnings with different timings and thinning intensities. We then calculated and compared the financial feasibility of the regimes using net present value (NPV; discount rate 3%) analysis. The separate effect of DNM on the profitability was marginal, but the positive effect of thinnings was clear. The harvesting removals varied within a wide range, depending on the timing and intensity of thinnings, but on average, the NPV doubled due to the thinnings. In the stands of initially good silvicultural condition, regimes including only one thinning and a DNM operation generally displayed a good financial result. In the stands of initially poor silvicultural condition due to neglected early care, regimes with two thinnings produced the best NPV regardless of the often low-yielding first thinning.

AB Quantification of fine root biomass is needed for estimating the role of roots as carbon (C) stores and sources of C input into the soil, as well as for modelling of forest nutrient cycling. Due to the laborious nature of root biomass determinations, there is a need to develop indirect methods that would allow fine root biomass to be estimated using data on easily measurable stand and site variables. We developed models for estimating tree fine root (diameter <= 2 mm) biomass of boreal forests by compiling data from 95 Finnish forest stands (55 on upland soils and 40 on drained peatlands). Stand basal area predicted fine root biomass (R-2-adj. = 0.35, p < 0.001) better than any other stand variable alone. A model that included stand basal area, dominant tree species group [birch/other], soil type [upland soil/drained peatland], temperature sum and the interaction of soil type and temperature sum accounted for 46% of the variation in fine root biomass. Stand basal area, the C:N ratio of the organic layer or upper 0-20 cm peat layer and the dominant tree species group together explained 45% of the variation in fine root biomass. Temperature sum correlated with fine root biomass in opposite ways in upland soils and in drained peatlands: fine root biomass increased with decreasing temperature sum in upland soil sites, whereas in peatlands fine root biomass decreased as the temperature sum decreased. Although the models were based on a large dataset representing well the variation in stand age, basal area, site fertility and climatic conditions in northern European boreal forests, half of the variation in fine root biomass remained unexplained. More comprehensive fine root biomass sampling in relation to spatial and temporal variation in the forthcoming studies, for example in connection with monitoring campaigns, and additional predictors such as soil texture, successional stage and the fine root biomass of ground vegetation might improve the predictive power of fine root biomass models.

AB Forest clearfelling is potentially a major environmental problem with respect to the degradation of water quality in receiving water courses due to phosphorus (P) release from soil and clearfelling residue stocks. Recent studies have highlighted the need to investigate the performance and benefits of potential mitigation methods such as whole tree harvesting (WTH) and grass seeding. In this study, fifteen plots (0.014 ha each) were constructed in a standing coniferous forest and P concentrations in plot runoff were monitored for one year prior to clearfelling. Following clearfelling three replicates of five forest harvesting management practices/treatments were applied to the plots: brash with grass seeding (Treatment 1), brash (Treatment 2), brash mat/ tree extraction route (Treatment 3), WTH (Treatment 4) and WTH with grass seeding (Treatment 5). These treatments were designed to comparatively assess the benefits of WTH and grass seeding practices on mitigating P released from forested peatlands following clearfelling and to determine the sources and sinks of P following clearfelling operations. Annual average total reactive phosphorus (TRP) concentrations in the plot runoff were < 20 mu g L-1 in all treatments before clearfelling, and increased to 79 mu g L-1, 160 mu g L-1, 335 mu g L-1, 50 mu g L-1 and 38 mu g L-1 in Treatments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, after clearfelling. These results highlight that WTH and grass seeding can be used efficiently as methods to improve water quality, aiding in the protection of the biota residing in the aquatic systems draining peatland catchments.

AB Continuous determination of suspended solids (SS) by turbidity measurements in drained peatland is expanding, increasing the demand for reliable calibration data for load calculations. Turbidity was used to estimate SS (n = 333) and particulate nutrient loads (n = 157) after peatland drainage for forestry in Central Finland for three study catchments. SS data from the drainage outlet correlated well with turbidity, demonstrating that turbidity can be used as an accurate measure of SS in drained peatland conditions. Measurement error was found to be approximately 8% (p < 0.01). The proportion of organic and inorganic fractions in SS seemed to affect calibration. Total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and particulate phosphorus showed linear dependency on turbidity values because a fraction of these nutrients occurs in particulate form or adsorbed to organic matter. Regressions during snowmelt periods were markedly different from those in other periods that were related to changes in the dissolved/total nutrient ratio. A close correlation between nutrient content of SS and turbidity provided a novel method to calculate phosphorus load from drained peatland areas, which can be used to conduct nutrient load estimations during summer peak flows.

AB Boreal peatlands are frequently underlain by permafrost, which is thawing rapidly. A common ecological response to thaw is the conversion of raised forested plateaus to treeless wetlands, but unexplained spatial variation in responses, combined with a lack of stand-level data, make it difficult to predict future trajectories of boreal forest composition and structure.
   We sought to characterize patterns and identify drivers of forest structure, composition, mortality and recruitment in a boreal peatland experiencing permafrost thaw. To do this, we established a large (10 ha) permanent forest plot (completed in 2014), located in the Northwest Territories, Canada, that includes 40,584 mapped and measured trees. In 2018, we conducted a comprehensive mortality and recruitment recensus. We also measured frost table depth, soil moisture, soil humification and organic layer thickness within the plot between 2012 and 2018, and used habitat association tests to link these variables to forest characteristics and dynamics.
   Forest composition and structure varied markedly throughout the plot and were strongly governed by patterns in permafrost presence and organic layer thickness. Overall, there was a net loss of trees from the plot at a rate of 0.7% year(-1). Mortality of black spruce, the dominant tree species, was more than double that of recruitment and was strongly associated with permafrost thaw. In contrast, recruitment of larch was over four times greater than mortality, and occurred primarily in low-lying, permafrost-free wetlands with mineral soil near the surface.
   Synthesis. The trends in tree demography and underlying drivers suggest that spruce-dominated permafrost plateaus will be converted into larch-dominated wetlands as permafrost thaw progresses in boreal peatlands, particularly in areas where mineral soil is near the surface. In the longer term, thaw could increase the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape, resulting in widespread drainage and re-vegetation by spruce, but we did not find evidence that this is occurring yet. Given the increasing rates of permafrost thaw, and positive feedbacks between thaw and forest change, we predict that larch abundance will continue to increase in boreal peatlands over the coming decades, leading to shifts in ecosystem function, wildlife habitat, albedo and snow dynamics.

AB Drained peatland forests form an important timber resource in Finland. They also form a sink for atmospheric carbon (C) because of the increased growth and C sequestration rates following drainage. These rates have, however, been poorly quantified. We simulated the tree stand dynamics for drained peatland stands with and without cuttings over two stand rotations. Simulations were done on four peatland site types and two regions in Finland with different climatic conditions, using recently published peatland tree growth models applied in a stand simulator. We then calculated the amount of C stored in the stands on the basis of previously published tree-level biomass and C content models. Finally, we developed regression models to estimate C stores in the tree stands using stand stem volume as the predictor variable. In the managed stands, the mean growth (annual volume increment) ranged from 2 to 9 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), depending on the rotation (first/second), site type and region. Total yield during one rotation varied from 250 to 970 m(3) ha(-1). The maximum stand volumes varied from 220 to 520 m(3) ha(-1) in the managed stands and from 360 to 770 m(3) ha(-1) in the unmanaged. By the end of the first post-drainage rotation the total C store in the managed stands had increased by 6-12 kg C m(-2) (i.e. 45-140 g C m(-2) a(-1)) compared to that in the undrained situation. Averaged over two rotations, the increase in the total C store was 3-6 kg C m(-2). in the corresponding unmanaged stands the C stores increased by 8-15 kg m(-2) over the same periods. At stand level, the C stores were almost linearly related to the stern volume and the developed regression equations could explain the variation in the simulated C stores almost entirely.

AB The conversion of peatland from forest to non-forest causes environmental damage and increases high land dryness. Mapping of peatland based on dryness is very important to control and prevent fires. This study aims at characterizing peatland based on the level of temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and evaluating the correlation between TVDI value and soil moisture. The research was conducted in August 2018 during the dry season. The area of research located in peat hydrological unit of Sibumbung River - Batok River in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) District of South Sumatra Province covering 63,427 ha area that consists of various land uses. The result showed that extreme wet category is found in water bodies and secondary forests that have high density, moderate wet is found in paddy fields and grass, normal area is found in the area covered by low-density trees, moderate dry is found in shrubs and oil palm plantations with good management and extreme dry areas is found in grasses and oil palm with poor cultivation management. There is a correlation between the TVDI value to the soil moisture on 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm depth.

AB Northern peat soils are both sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). These fluxes are regulated by the activity of microbial communities. Temporal, spatial and depth related differences in potential activity and composition of the denitrifier and methanotrophic bacterial communities were compared between winter and summer in relation to in situ fluxes of N2O and CH4 from a drained and forested peat land in Sweden. The composition of the genetic pool of these guilds was assessed using terminal fragment length polymorphism analysis of signature genes in the denitrification and methane oxidation pathways, respectively. The composition of the communities was similar throughout the soil profile, although both denitrification and methane oxidation rates decreased with soil depth. The potential methane oxidation rates were significantly correlated to soil N content, and , indicating a nitrogen induced stimulation of methane oxidation capacity. The site was a source of N2O and a small sink for CH4, and although the fluxes did not vary significantly over time, both the methane oxidizing and denitrifier community composition exhibited temporal patterns. Differences in the composition of the methanotrophic community reflected that the peat site shifted from a summer to a winter community. The denitrifiers exhibited a similar trend, but also differed significantly between the sampling occasions during summer, as well as between locations at the site. The latter was explained by differences in soil pH. It was only the differences in the methane oxidizer community composition that correlated with its corresponding potential activity, which implies a higher degree of functional redundancy within the denitrifier community.

AB Ditch cleaning in drained peatland forests increases sediment loads and degrades water quality in headwater streams and lakes. A better understanding of the processes controlling ditch erosion and sediment transport in such systems is a prerequisite for proper peatland management. In order to relate hydrological observations to key erosion processes in headwater peatlands drained for forestry, a two-year study was conducted in a nested sub-catchment system (treated with ditch cleaning) and at two reference sites. The treated catchment was instrumented for continuous discharge and turbidity monitoring, erosion pin measurements of changes in ditch bed and banks and time-integrated sampling of suspended sediment (SS) composition. The results showed that ditch cleaning clearly increased transient suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) and suspended sediment yields (SSYs), and resulted in temporary storage of loosely deposited organic sediment in the ditch network. After exhaustion of this sediment storage, subaerial processes and erosion from ditch banks became dominant in producing sediment for transport. Recorded SSCs were higher on the rising limbs of event hydrographs throughout the study period, indicating that SS transport was limited by availability of erosion-prone sediment. A strong positive correlation (R-2=0.84, p<0.001) between rainfall intensity (above a threshold of 1mmh(-1)) and average SSC obtained on the rising limb of hydrographs for the sub-catchment showed that soil detachment from ditch banks by raindrop impact can directly increase SSC in runoff. At the main catchment outlet, variation in SSC was best explained (R-2=0.67, p<0.05) by the linear combination of initial discharge (-), peak discharge (+) and the lag time from initial to peak discharge (-). Based on these factors, ditch cleaning slightly increased peak discharges and decreased transit times in the study catchment. The implications of the results for water pollution management in peatland forests are discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.

AB Ecologically extreme habitats at a species' distribution edges bear significance for biota under adverse climatic conditions and climate change. Range-edge populations adjust their functional traits to the special local ecological conditions, leading to increased intraspecific variability in their morpho-anatomical structure and, consequently, favor population survival in the absence of competitors. On the basis of wood anatomical traits, such as tracheid lumen area (CA), cell wall thickness (CWTrad), cell diameter-to-radial cell wall thickness ratio (CD/CWT), and the number of tracheids in the radial tracheid files (TNo), we investigated the xylem adjustment of Pinus sylvestris L. populations from six ecologically extreme habitats from the Eastern Carpathians and the Pannonian Basin. Results indicated significant differences among all studied sites in case of all wood anatomical traits as signs of the local adaptation of trees. Peat bog populations adapted their wood anatomical traits to the generally hydric, cool and anaerobic conditions of the peat bogs, exhibiting smaller CA and proportionally thick CWTrad to ensure the hydraulic safety of the stem, whereas, on the lowland site, trees were characterized by a more effective water-conducting system, developing larger CA with relatively thin CWTrad with lower carbon-per-conduit-costs at the expense of higher vulnerability to cavitation. Radial tree ring growth and TNo also differed markedly among sites, following the temperature and groundwater constraints of the habitats. Wood anatomical variability among tree rings and the corresponding short-term climate response of populations differed from the adaptive responses of the trees to the ecological characteristics of the habitat. In addition to the different phylogeographic origin evidenced in former studies, phenotypic differentiation by the habitat type of the studied populations linked to the variance in morpho-anatomical traits have contributed to the survival of the peripheral Scots pine populations at the species' range margins.

AB Land cover changes can impact the climate by influencing the surface energy and water balance. Naturally treeless or sparsely treed peatlands were extensively drained to stimulate forest growth in Finland over the second half of 20th century. The aim of this study is to investigate the biogeophysical effects of peatland forestation on regional climate in Finland. Two sets of 18-year climate simulations were done with the regional climate model REMO by using land cover data based on pre-drainage (1920s) and post-drainage (2000s) Finnish national forest inventories. In the most intensive peatland forestation area, located in the middle west of Finland, the results show a warming in April of up to 0.43K in monthly-averaged daily mean 2m air temperature, whereas a slight cooling from May to October of less than 0.1K in general is found. Consequently, snow clearance days over that area are advanced up to 5 days in the mean of 15 years. No clear signal is found for precipitation. Through analysing the simulated temperature and energy balance terms, as well as snow depth over five selected subregions, a positive feedback induced by peatland forestation is found between decreased surface albedo and increased surface air temperature in the snow-melting period. Our modelled results show good qualitative agreements with the observational data. In general, decreased surface albedo in the snow-melting period and increased evapotranspiration in the growing period are the most important biogeophysical aspects induced by peatland forestation that cause changes in climate. The results from this study can be further integrally analysed with biogeochemical effects of peatland forestation to provide background information for adapting future forest management to mitigate climate warming effects. Moreover, they provide insights about the impacts of projected forestation of tundra at high latitudes due to climate change.

AB The aquatic effects of forestry practices and peat extraction continue to cause serious concerns. The effect mechanisms of peat extraction on water quality and aquatic ecology of the receiving surface waters are well known, but the impacts are often difficult to differentiate from those of forest management. A pairwise temporal sediment study was conducted on two adjacent lakes in Central Finland to study whether the unique effects of peat extraction can be detected in an area of intensive forest drainage. Both lakes are affected by forestry, but the reference lake has no history of peat extraction in its watershed. The deepest parts of the lakes were cored through the lacustrine sediments, and the recent carbon and dry matter sedimentation rates were compared to their site-specific reference values. Recent changes in benthic macroinvertebrates (chironomids) and diatom algae were studied to assess the ecological effects of these practices in the lakes. No significant differences in recent increases in carbon accumulation were found between the peat extraction-impacted lake and the reference lake. The pairwise comparison allowed identification of a regional pattern of impacts that is closely related to the history of land use, particularly forestry, in the region. The approach also allowed identification of the transient signs of peat extraction in the chemical and chironomid records of the impacted lake. The recent changes in chironomids and diatoms suggest eutrophication and deterioration in benthic conditions likely caused by drainage ditch network maintenance activities in the catchments.

AB High-latitude region is sensitive to global climate change, and pollen record in sediments could reflect vegetation variation which responded to climate change. The Great Hinggan Mountains are main distribution areas of peatlands in high-latitude region in China and located at East Asian summer monsoonal margin, however, the variation of vegetation and climate in this region is still unclear. Based on the AMS C-14 dating, we analyzed the pollen assemblages to reconstruct vegetation history in Tuqiang (TQ) peatland, and we also used the principal component analysis to reconstruct the temperature and effective moisture and compared with other palaeoclimate records. Pollen assemblage denoted a coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest on the surrounding mountains, and peatland vegetation gradually evolved from herb community (Cyperaceae) to bush community (Ericaceae). The climate of north part in the Great Hinggan Mountains was mainly controlled by the East Asian Summer Monsoon which related to ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. During the period from 3300 to 1150 cal yr BP, the dominant plant was Cyperaceae, with coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests bordered the peatland, which pointed to a relatively warm and wet climate. Between 1150 and 600 cal yr BP, the expansion of pine forests indicated a cool climate. The interval of 600-300 cal yr BP, the climate became cold and dry which related to the Little Ice Age. Since the 300 cal yr BP, Betula and Ericaceae dominated, the climate became warmer and drier. The obvious increase of secondary birch forests at the expense of pine forests may be the results of human disturbance, anthropogenic activities strengthened gradually and the variation of peatland vegetation was influenced mainly by anthropogenic activities rather than by climate since approximately 600 cal yr BP.

AB Size structural dynamics of naturally established Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands growing on peatlands drained for forestry were investigated. The study was based on modelling of diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions of repeatedly measured stands in southern Finland. The Weibull function was used to parameterize the DBH distributions and mixed linear models were constructed to characterize the impacts of different ecological factors on stand dynamics. Initially, the positive skewness of the DBH distributions increased after drainage as a result of increases in stem numbers and a reduction in mean diameters. Simultaneously, the size inequality among trees increased. These changes were due to regeneration and (or) ingrowth and indicated only little competition from the larger trees. Subsequently, the DBH distributions changed from positively skewed to normal and finally to negatively skewed resulting from tree growth and a reduction in the number of small DBH trees. This indicated increased asymmetric intertree competition. Size inequality did not change during this later stage in stand development, suggesting a concurrent component of symmetric competition. Thinnings had little impact on DBH distribution trends. The observed stand dynamics allow the allocation of growth resources to the desired crop component by appropriate silvicultural treatments.

DT Article
ID CARBON
AB Water table position, through the creation of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the soil profile, plays an important role in controlling CH4 flux from wetlands. A laboratory study of peat columns revealed that CH4 emission rates initially increased and then decreased as the water table was lowered from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm, with the release of CH4 trapped in pores.  There was a strong hysteresis between CH4 flux on the falling and rising water table limbs (falling > rising). When expressed as seasonal average values, there was a strong relationship (r2 0.08 - 0.74) between log CH4 flux and water table position for sites within 5 wetland regions in boreal-subarctic Canada. The regression coefficients were similar among regions (0.022 - 0.037), but there were differences in the regression constants (0.47 - 1.89). CH4 flux from drained, forested peatland soils decreased as the water table depth increased, and several sites were transformed from sources to sinks of CH4. Global CH4 emissions to the atmosphere may have been reduced by almost-equal-to 1 Tg yr-1 by peatland drainage during the last 100 yr.

AB The studied objects represent the lacustrine bottom deposits in the southeast of the Kola Peninsula and the peat bed in the Cape Rybachii, exemplifying the northernmost occurrence of this substance in the European part of Russia. A detailed radiocarbon dating and palynological analysis provided grounds to establish the Holocene chrono- and climatostratigraphy of the region and to correlate the studied sections with coeval deposits in Scandinavia. Sedimentation in the lakes commenced in the region 11000-10000 years ago. The pine species spread over the Kola Peninsula 9000-7000 years ago. The peat accumulation was initiated here 8000-7500 years ago. The birch tundra forests advanced up to the Parents Sea coast 6000-5000/4500 years ago. The northern forest boundary retreated southward after the climate deteriorated 4500 years ago. When the pine forest areas decreased, peat bogs became more widespread in the southeastern Kola Peninsula, and the tundra belt appeared at the coast of the Parents Sea. Spruce trees arrived at their northern distribution limit in the peninsula about 3500 years ago. The current structure of the vegetation cover was formed during the last 2500-2000 years.

AB Glacial relicts have been regionally more common in glacial than in recent times. A rigorous assessment of which species are indeed glacial relicts is extremely difficult because direct evidence is untraceable or equivocal for many species. We aimed to identify species of the Western Carpathian flora (vascular plants, bryophytes and terrestrial lichens) that display apparent biogeographical and ecological symptoms, suggesting a wider regional or supra-regional distribution during glacial times, or at least before the middle-Holocene climate optimum. We worked with the premise that exemplary relict species should tolerate continental and/or arctic climates, should have large distribution ranges with disjunctions, being regionally rare and ecologically conservative nowadays, should be associated with habitats that occurred during glacial times (tundra, steppe, peatland, open coniferous forest) and should display a restriction of ecological niches in the study region. The assessed species were primarily those with boreo-continental or artcic-alpine distribution. We demonstrated a conspicuous gradient of glacial-relict symptoms, with Carex vaginata, Betula nana, Trichophorum pumilum, Nephroma arcticum, Saxifraga hirculus and Cladonia stellaris topping the ranking. Based on the arbitrary ranking, 289 taxa can be considered high-probability relicts. For only a minority of them, there are any phylogeographical and/or palaeoecological data available from the study area. Biogeographical and ecological symptoms of 144 taxa suggest that they retreated rapidly after the Last Glacial Maximum whereas other species probably retreated later. The first principal component of biogeographical symptoms sorted species from circumpolar arctic-alpine species of acidic peatlands and wet tundra to strongly continental species of steppe, steppe-tundra and mineral-rich fens. This differentiation may mirror the altitudinal zonation of glacial vegetation in the Western Carpathians.

AB Edge effects of native forest fragmentation have been well studied, but there are few studies of open-ground habitats fragmented by plantation forests. We measure forestry edge effects on open-ground breeding birds, following one of Europe's biggest and most controversial land-use transformations. The Flow Country' of northern Scotland is one of the world's greatest expanses of blanket bog. It became fragmented by conifer forests planted in the late 20th century, and these now adjoin open peatlands protected under European conservation legislation. Detrimental edge effects on breeding birds were anticipated, but not apparent shortly after planting. Using survey data collected in 2003-2006, and logistic regression modelling, we tested whether breeding distributions of three wader species of international conservation concern, dunlin, European golden plover and common greenshank, were influenced by distance to forest edge, controlling for habitat and topography. All three species were more likely to occupy flatter, more exposed ground close to bog pools and were influenced by peatland vegetation structure. There was an additive and adverse effect of proximity to forest edge for dunlin and European golden plover, but not common greenshank. This effect was strongest within 700m of forest edges. We used these results to predict which areas should benefit most from removal of adjacent forestry and so guide maintenance and restoration of the bird interests of the protected areas.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects of mature forestry on dunlin and golden plover are apparent over several hundred metres and are now being used to guide forest planning in northern Scotland. The scale of edge effect is broadly consistent with other avian studies in open-ground habitats across Eurasia and North America, so buffer zones of this order are consistent with possible impacts of plantation forestry on open-ground habitats of bird conservation interest. Given renewed interest in conifer afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an improved understanding of edge effects and the mechanisms through which they operate is vital to managing plantation forestry in ways that maintain open-ground landscapes of high conservation value.

AB Peatland rewetting aims to restore biomass accumulation from peat-forming plants for climate change mitigation, biotope conservation and water purification purposes. Boreal spruce swamp forests in Europe have suffered heavily from drainage for forestry and are now a focus of restoration efforts. We measured Sphagnum height and biomass increment by allowing Sphagnum to grow through mesh nets located in nine undrained, nine drained and 18 rewetted boreal spruce swamp forests. At the moss patch level, rewetting led to a recovery of Sphagnum growth: height increment and biomass increment at the rewetted sites (5907cmyear(-1) and 14715gm(-2)year(-1), meanSE) were similar to increment at the undrained sites (49 +/- 05cmyear(-1) and 128 +/- 12gm(-2)year(-1)), while remnant patches of Sphagnum at the drained sites showed smaller increment (28 +/- 08cmyear(-1) and 76 +/- 19gm(-2)year(-1)). Sphagnum in the ditches at the drained sites showed similar increment as the moss at the undrained and rewetted sites, while ditches at the rewetted sites had the greatest increment (87 +/- 07cmyear(-1) and 183 +/- 16gm(-2)year(-1)). A higher water-table increased Sphagnum growth, and Sphagnum riparium grew more rapidly than the other species. At the ecosystem level, where information on moss cover was utilized, rewetting had increased Sphagnum production to values close to the undrained sites. At the drained sites, biomass production was 8 +/- 17g (mean +/- SE) m(-2)year(-1), at the rewetted sites 42 +/- 15gm(-2)year(-1) and at the undrained sites 66 +/- 12gm(-2)year(-1). Sphagnum cover was the most important variable that determined Sphagnum production in the ecosystem.Synthesis and applications. Drained spruce swamp forests appear to be a suitable target for restoration as they respond readily to rather inexpensive rewetting. The result points out that even in boreal conditions, restoration results can be achieved in a time-scale of years rather than decades. At the ecosystem level, rewetting had resulted in a biomass gain of 34gm(-2)year(-1) when compared to drained sites.

AB Harvest residue decomposition can significantly contribute to nutrient and heavy metal exports to receiving water courses. This study monitors the nutrient and heavy metal dynamics in decaying Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine harvest residue needles on Atlantic blanket peat forests in the west of Ireland. Using the litterbag method, harvest residue was placed both within and between furrows in two uncut forest and two clear-cut sites. On the clear-cut sites, the litterbags were positioned outside the harvest residue piles (i.e. brash windrows). Over the 2-year monitoring period, the needles decomposed slower at the clear-cut sites than the uncut forest sites, with mass losses of 46-55 and 58-77 %, respectively. Approximately 20 % less phosphorous (P) was released from the decaying needles at the clear-cut sites, while nitrogen (N) was released only at the uncut sites. Tree species was a significant factor contributing to nutrient and heavy metal release and accumulation patterns, with higher concentrations of aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in the decaying spruce needles than in pine. Conversely, the spruce needles showed accelerated depletion of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) relative to the pine. The harvest residue needle positioning (inside furrow/between furrows) and the site soil characteristics contributed significantly to Al transformations in spruce needles and iron (Fe) in both spruce and pine needles, with more accumulation occurring inside the furrows where Al and Fe contents of the peat were high. Manganese (Mn) was released from the needles in three of the four sites with a total release of over 90 % within 2 years. In the remaining site, where the Mn content of the peat was high, an accumulation of Mn in the needles was observed. The decomposition of needles on blanket peat catchments may be a significant source of P to receiving water courses, owing to their fast release of P, but not a likely source for N export.

AB The swamp peatland forests within the 8 geobotanical districts (ca. 2.900 km2) of Latvia were studied. Forests dominated by black alder, birch, Norway spruce and Scots pine and growing in peatland of various depths (from 30 cm to 5 m) are described.
   By summarizing the floristic and phytosociological data from more than 300 tracts, in-depth phytogeographical analyses of 11 communities were carried out and found to coincide well with the ecological-phytosociological features.
   Only 6 species of vascular plants and mosses found in the swamps are in close connection with the geographical position within the state. Hence the peatland forests are more or less homogeneous in the whole of Latvia.
   Distribution according to 13 sectoral, 10 oceanic-continental and 8 zonal groups and a comparison with the mean values found for Latvia in general is specified.

AB Nannophryne variegata is an endemic species of the southern forests of Chile and Argentina. It has a wide distribution in Chilean territory and to a lesser extent, in Argentine territory. Along this extensive latitudinal distribution, it inhabits different ecological regions, characterized mainly by low temperatures and high precipitation. There are few antecedents regarding habitat preferences and threats to this species. This paper reports on new distribution records in the extreme south of Chile and Argentina. It also describes the characteristics of the habitats it occupies and the representation in protected areas of both countries. Nannophryne variegata is distributed from 37 degrees 28' to 52 degrees 10' South latitude, becoming one the southernmost amphibians in the world. It inhabits different environments that include humid forest associations, peat bogs, Magellanic tundra and neighboring high Andean environments. It is well represented in protected areas with a large number of observed populations.

AB Several rivers around the Baltic Sea coast have poor water quality status due to occasional low pH and high metal concentrations. One potential cause of low pH is intensive drainage of shallow peat soils (<80 cm thick peat layer) overlying sulphide-rich sediments. This results in oxidation of iron sulphides to sulphuric acid, lowering water pH dramatically, and increases the concentrations of soluble toxic metals (e.g. Al, Cd, Ni, Zn). This study examined soil properties and hydrology in order to investigate the leaching of acidity derived from peatland forestry and devise potential ways to prevent acid leaching after drain maintenance work. Groundwater (GW) level, runoff amount and water quality were recorded at regular intervals for three small forested catchments (drained area 8.5-13 ha) during two growing seasons, 2010 and 2011. The soil was sampled and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and sulphur. Undisturbed soil columns consisting of mineral subsoil were taken to the laboratory and exposed to lowered water levels in a controlled drainage experiment. The DRAINMOD model was used to simulate the impact of different drainage configurations. The simulation results suggest that the oxidation risk of sulphidic materials in subsoil during normal hydrological years is small in drained peatland forestry areas with a thick peat layer. The risk of oxidation of sulphidic materials increases during dry summers with a clear decline in GW level into the sulphidic subsoil. According to laboratory data, this can considerably lower the pH (down to 2.5) and increase metal concentrations (e.g. maximum Al, Cu and Zn concentrations of 1010, 257 and 186 mu g L-1, respectively) in runoff waters. However, with effective management methods these effects can be avoided. Changes in drainage practices (avoiding deep drainage) and controlled drainage may in some cases reduce the GW level drawdown and reduce the risk of sulphide oxidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB A 291 cm sediment core was taken from Lake Tsuolbmajavri in the Finnish tree-line area. The core was dated by means of 14 AMS C-14-dates. Pollen data indicate that during the early-Holocene the catchment was characterized by birch forest. Gradual expansion of pine started at 9200 cal BP. Pine reached its maximum occurrence at 7200-6000 cal BP and pine tree-line retreated from the area at 4600 cal BP. During the late Holocene, the cooler and moister climate led to increasing peatland development in the catchment. The influence of vegetation dynamics on the limnology of the lake was investigated by means of diatom-stratigraphical data. The increasing total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, water color, and decreasing pH from 8500 cal BP to 6000 cal BP reflect the gradual development of forest and more humic soil. The disappearance of pine caused a slight rise in pH and a decrease of TOC and water color values. At 3000 cal BP, TOC concentrations and water color started to increase again. This change is synchronous with the rise of Sphagnum spore influx values and may reflect the impact of peatland expansion on lake water quality. The results suggest that the catchment vegetation patterns, mainly tree-line dynamics and peatland distribution, have influenced the limnological features of Lake Tsuolbmajavri.

AB We quantified the response of peatland water table level (WTL) and energy fluxes to harvesting of a drained peatland forest. Two alternative harvests (clear-cut and partial harvest) were carried out in a mixed-species ditch-drained peatland forest in southern Finland, where water and energy balance components were monitored for six pre-treatment and three post-treatment growing seasons. To explore the responses caused by harvestings, we applied a mechanistic multi-layer soil-plant-atmosphere transfer model. At the clear-cut site, the mean growing season WTL rose by 0.18 +/- 0.02 m (error estimate based on measurement uncertainty), while net radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes decreased after harvest. On the contrary, we observed only minor changes in energy fluxes and mean WTL (0.05 +/- 0.03 m increase) at the partial harvest site, although as much as 70% of the stand basal area was removed and leaf-area index was reduced to half. The small changes were mainly explained by increased water use of spruce undergrowth and field layer vegetation, as well as increased forest floor evaporation. The rapid establishment of field layer vegetation had a significant role in energy balance recovery at the clear-cut site. At partial harvest, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and model-data comparison suggested the shade-adapted spruce undergrowth was suffering from light stress during the first post-harvest growing season. We conclude that in addition to stand basal area, species composition and stand structure need to be considered when controlling WTL in peatland forests with partial harvesting. Our results have important implications on the operational use of continuous cover forestry on drained peatlands. A continuously maintained tree cover with significant evapotranspiration capacity could enable optimizing WTL from both tree growth and environmental perspectives.

AB Forest stream riparian wetlands have a number of important features. This investigation treats one aspect, the nitrogen retention after upland clear-cutting which leads to elevated nitrate leaching, and the importance of the flow pathways in this connection. The runoff occurs mainly via the upper permeable section of the peat while the lower peat act as an aquitard, restricting the flow from the underlying till. The till groundwater is progressively artesian towards the discharging stream. Water analyses from piezometers show that the water chemistry in the peat is rather variable, indicating the presence of channelling. Channelling is also indicated by spring discharges from the peat that have elevated nitrate contents pointing to bypass flow. Redox bars indicating sulphate reduction display the same picture of irregular distribution. However, a general observation is that volumes with sulphate reduction increase towards the stream and that sulphate reduction occurs preferably in the surface peat, indicating the importance of a degradable substrate for the sulphate reducers. Nitrate reduction during the growth season occurs predominantly close to the upland till areas. The riparian tree stand is dominated by spruces which are likely to be disfavoured by the rising groundwater level after clear-cutting. The riparian tree stand does not extend far enough towards the upland to be benefited by the elevated nitrate flux. Buffer stands should be broader, extending into the till upland where they can utilise the leached nitrate and, more important, thanks to their deeper rooting depth protect the peatland trees against wind felling.

AB In Finland nearly 6 million hectares of peatlands are drained for forestry purposes. Ditch network maintenance in the drained peatlands, i.e. cleaning old ditches or digging complementary ditches, deteriorates surface water quality by increasing the export of dissolved elements and suspended solids (SS). Effect of ditch network maintenance on the export of SS, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) was studied in nine pairs of treated and control (no maintenance) catchments located in southern and central Finland. In this study we extended the paired catchment approach by combining data from several catchments and identifying the treatment effect on SS and element loads from the entire dataset. Following the method of Lauren et al. (2009) we identified how uncertainty in correlation between treatment and control catchments during pre-treatment period is reflected in the estimated treatment effect on SS and element loads. In the experiment, the export of SS increased significantly for the four year study period following the ditch network maintenance and Al export increased for one year. The export of N, P and Fe was not significantly changed and DOC and Mn export decreased after the ditch maintenance operation.

AB Northern landscapes accumulate carbon in vegetation and soils while rivers transport significant amounts of land-derived carbon to coastal areas. Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990-2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway's four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 +/- A 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m(-2)) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m(-2) year(-1)): tree biomass (40 +/- A 3) > peatlands (19 +/- A 15) > forest soils (9 +/- A 1) a parts per thousand << lakes (2 +/- A 1) > mountains (0.5 +/- A 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (-36 +/- A 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 +/- A 0.1 Tg C year(-1) (3.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and lowest (1.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.

AB Depending on the soil preparation method applied and peat characteristics. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings planted in prepared spots on forestry-drained peatlands may become more susceptible to extreme weather events such as drought or flooding. Only by studying its coping strategies can we eventually design methodology better suited for Scots pine regeneration on peat soils. In this study, we evaluated the tolerance of two-year-old seedlings to the two extremes of water-associated stress, drought and waterlogging, in unprocessed peat. Over one growing season in controlled conditions, drought distinctly reduced root and shoot growth in addition to photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) particularly in previous-year needles, whilst wet stress had little discernible impact. Drought also influenced polyamine metabolism by increasing free putrescine and spermine concentrations especially in current-year needles, whereas no impact was discerned in the wet treatment. Furthermore, reduced root hydraulic conductance (K-r) was observed in drought-stressed root systems. Apparently, waterlogging does not modify Scots pine seedling growth or vitality immediately, but rather in the longer term. However, no fatalities occurred in either of the stress treatments, this despite water availability in the Sphagnum peat reaching its lower (permanent wilting point) and upper (10% soil air content) limits. Maintenance of rather high photochemical efficiency despite severe drought stress would seem to indicate a potential for seedling recovery if water availability in the peat substrate improved.

AB The greenhouse-gas (GHG) balance of CH4 and N2O emissions and CO2 respiration in peatlands plays a key role in climate change. A GHG balance is mostly calculated from point measurements. In this study we propose and test a geophysical method of low frequency domain electromagnetic method (FDEM) as a proxy for forest-floor CO2 respiration and CH4 emissions in two 50 x 100 m drained peatlands in Estonia: a Downy birch and a Scots pine stand from April to September 2015. The FDEM measurement campaign in September 2015 yielded a detailed map of topsoil electrical conductivity. We explain the predictive power of FDEM on GHG emissions through relationships with dry bulk density of soil. Although we over- or underestimated some fluxes owing to soil heterogeneity, we composed reasonably credible GHG emission maps. The initial results seem promising and we recommend further application of FDEM methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1 We used tree ring analysis to determine stem radius and thus examine size variation over time in two even-aged (approximately 40-year-old) mixed populations of black spruce and tamarack established on peatlands in a boreal forest. We also followed the response of one of these populations to improved edaphic conditions over 8 years following drainage.
   2 Populations of trees in undrained areas showed a decline in size variability over time until age 20-25 years, after which size heterogeneity was relatively stable.
   3 For trees in undrained areas there was a relationship between age and size for the first 20-25 years, but this relationship then broke down due to a period where relative growth rate and size were inversely related.
   4 For the population of trees in the drained area, smaller trees (i.e. those that had been growing more slowly prior to drainage) showed significantly greater drainage-induced release growth, while larger trees (those growing faster prior to drainage) showed an initial reduction in growth following drainage and, overall, less release growth.
   5 The response of tamarack to drainage was more dramatic than for black spruce.
   6 Despite extensive variation in tree size, drainage dramatically reduced variability in growth rate among trees of each species, such that size variability in the populations declined.
   7 We postulate that the heterogeneity of microsites with respect to edaphic conditions, perhaps associated with the hummock to hollow microtopographic gradient, has a major influence on growth variation, and hence size inequality, in peatland populations of black spruce and tamarack.

AB Fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured on a drained and forested peatland in 1992-1995. Net mineralization and nitrification were studied in situ in 1993-1994. Nitrogen additions in 1992 as KNO3, NH4Cl, or urea (100 kg N.ha(-1)) were used to study the fate and transformations of N in peat. The mean N2O emissions during the growth season in 1993 were 1.9, 2.6, 3.3, and 3.5 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Mean NO fluxes during the growth season in 1993 averaged 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.6 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea treatment, respectively. Annual net N mineralization was 87 kg N.ha(-1) in the control soil and 107, 129, and 91 kg.ha(-1) in the KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Added N increased the fluxes of N oxides at least for a year after the treatments. The study showed that forests on drained N-rich peat soils may be significant sources of N2O and NO and that their production of nitrogenous trace gases is enhanced by additional N.

AB Habitat suitability as characterized by the presence of a species and by reproductive success was modelled in relation to different parameters of landscape diversity at different scales. Parameters characterizing landscape pattern were determined for the UTM 10 km x 10 km cells covering the whole of Estonia and were correlated to the distribution of over 30 forest bird species. The landscape parameters include areas of lakes, mires and built-up areas, length of borders between different land cover units and length of selected line elements, share of different kinds of forest and peatland. The bird species are grouped by correlation into three major groups: (a) independent, (b) wetland preferring (with subgroups of those avoiding built-up areas and roads and those not) and (c) built-up area dependent (with subgroups depending on the importance of line elements). For selected predator species, nesting success was related to landscape parameters on a finer scale, using cells of 10 km(2). Land pattern was characterized by total length of line elements (streams, roads, borders, ecotones) and certain areal coverage (forest, mires, fields, built-up areas) within the cell. The impact of variations of food availability was linked to the relation. Possibilities for downscaling and upscaling of relations determined at different scales and areal coverage are discussed.

AB Samples of summer pasture plants that reindeer feed on were collected in order to study Cs-137 concentrations in different plant species and in species nested in certain site types, and to study the regional distribution of Cs-137 in the Finnish reindeer management area. Plant species were categorized by the site types of mineral soil forest (xeric heath forest and mesic heath forest) and peatland. A third category called 'other plant species' included plants with various site types, poorly determined species and species with poor statistics. The Cs-137 concentrations in different site types differed significantly. The mean Cs-137 concentrations of the whole reindeer management area in the xeric heath forest plant species was 44 +/- 27 Bq/kg dw, in the mesic heath forest plant species 75 +/- 59 Bq/kg dw and in the peatland plant species 219 +/- 150 Bq/kg dw. The peatland species uptake Cs-137 more efficiently than plant species of mineral soil forests. A particularly efficient collector of Cs-137 was Trichophorum sp. It is suggested that Trichophorum sp. could be used as an indicator species for reindeer summer fodder plants. The highest concentrations of Cs-137 were found in Southern Lapland and the lowest in Northern Lapland. Today, the concentrations of Cs-137 in summer pasture plants that reindeer feed on in Finland are at such a level that there is no need to avoid any plant species. In the case of future nuclear fallout, reindeer grazing in peatlands would increase concentrations of Cs-137 in reindeer meat. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies were carried out during 1989-1992 at an experimental site in Rumster, Caithness to determine the initial effects, particularly on hydrochemistry, of the establishment of trees on deep peats. Inputs were measured to determine seasonal and between-year variability. Increases in potential interception due to the filtering effect of the maturing forest canopy were assessed. Results indicate that air quality improved during the study, particularly sulphate inputs, and suggest that loadings of marine-derived materials to the soil may be greatly increased in the future by canopy capture. Site disturbances by ploughing and draining have affected nutrient cycles, especially N and S, in both control and forested plots, leading to losses into drainage waters. After a delay of around a year, there were fertilizer losses of applied phosphorus (1-2 kgP ha(-1)) and potassium (25-35 kgK ha(-1)) over the period.

AB Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 bm mumol m(-2) s(-1) for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m(-2) year- 1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m(-2) year(-1). These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal.

AB The effects of wood ash fertilisation on tree nutrition and growth on forested peatlands has been studied using loose ash, but in practice, ash fertilisation is done almost exclusively with granulated ash. In this study, the effects of granulated ash and loose ash (both 5 Mg ha(-1)) on the growth and nutrition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were compared between a nitrogen-poor and a nitrogen-rich site over 15 years. On the nitrogen-rich site, wood ash application was also compared with commercial PK fertilisation. On the nitrogen-rich site, mean stand volume growth increase over unfertilised control treatment during the 15 year study period using granulated ash and commercial PK fertiliser was of the same magnitude (on average, 2.2-2.3 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). However, when loose ash was used growth increase over control was higher (3.7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). On the nitrogenpoor site, the mean growth increase gained by loose or granulated ash (1.4-1.5 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) over the unfertilised control treatment was not significant. Fertilisation with loose ash or PK increased foliar P, K and B concentrations already in the first or second growing season, following fertilisation on both sites. Granulated ash increased foliar P concentrations on the nitrogen-rich site less than loose ash. After an initial increase, foliar P, K and B concentrations decreased at the end of study period. On the nitrogen-poor site. foliar P concentrations were below the deficiency limit by the end of the study period.

AB Elevated levels of nutrients and suspended sediment (SS), and changes to other environmental parameters, are frequently associated with forestry harvesting (clearfelling) operations, and are indicative of the potentially complex changing environment associated with clearfelling. Current and future recommended best management practices (BMPs) for forestry clearfelling on upland peat catchments must provide for a healthy soil and good water quality. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of implementation, or violation, of BMPs in the clearfelling of an upland peat conifer forest. Over periods of 12 months prior to clearfelling and 15 months after clearfelling, two peatland forests, comprising a study control (no clearfelling) and a study site (clearfelling), were monitored for the release of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) species (dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N)), SS, dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and stream water temperature. Clearfelling was conducted during poor weather conditions and a watercourse, which drained the study site, was not protected. The maximum recorded concentration exported from the study site after clearfelling was 471 mu g L-1 for DRP, 611 mu g L-1 for TP, 1336 mu g L-1 for NH4+-N, and 194 mu g L-1 for TON. Concentrations of SS exiting the study site increased in one of the two samples taken during clearfelling (maximum release of 481 mg L-1, with 68% of this organic) and returned to pre-clearfelling levels, or below, within 6 months of the commencement of clearfelling. Exports of TP and DRP from the study site were 0.9 and 0.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), which were greater than the study control (0.6 and 0.2 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). This indicated that the mitigation practices employed on site were not effective in phosphorus retention. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured during a two month campaign at a drained peatland forest in Finland by the eddy covariance (EC) technique (CO2 and N2O), and automatic and manual chambers (CO2, CH4 and N2O). In addition, GHG concentrations and soil parameters (mineral nitrogen, temperature, moisture content) in the peat profile were measured. The aim of the measurement campaign was to quantify the GHG fluxes during freezing and thawing of the top-soil, a time period with potentially high GHG fluxes, and to compare different flux measurement methods. The forest was a net CO2 sink during the two months and the fluxes of CO2 dominated the GHG exchange. The peat soil was a small sink of atmospheric CH4 and a small source of N2O. Both CH4 oxidation and N2O production took place in the top-soil whereas CH4 was produced in the deeper layers of the peat, which were unfrozen throughout the measurement period. During the frost-thaw events of the litter layer distinct peaks in CO2 and N2O emissions were observed. The CO2 peak followed tightly the increase in soil temperature, whereas the N2O peak occurred with a delay after the thawing of the litter layer. CH4 fluxes did not respond to the thawing of the peat soil. The CO2 and N2O emission peaks were not captured by the manual chambers and hence we conclude that high time-resolution measurements with automatic chambers or EC are necessary to quantify fluxes during peak emission periods. Sub-canopy EC measurements and chamber-based fluxes of CO2 and N2O were comparable, although the fluxes of N2O measured by EC were close to the detection limit of the system. We conclude that if fluxes are high enough, i.e. greater than 5-10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), the EC method is a good alternative to measure N2O and CO2 fluxes at ecosystem scale, thereby minimizing problems with chamber enclosures and spatial representativeness of the measurements.

AB The long-term effects of fertilization on the needle nutrient concentrations, growth and financial performance of a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand was examined in a thick-peated drained peatland forest located in Central Finland. At the trial establishment in 1985, the trees were suffering from P and K deficiencies, but their N status was good. The fertilizer treatments were Control, PK (rock phosphate + potassium chloride), ApaBio (apatite phosphorus + biotite) and wood ash, applied both with and without N and replicated six times. All treatments containing phosphorus and potassium increased foliar P and K concentrations above the deficiency limits up to the end of the study period of 26 years. The effect of the fertilization on stand volume growth of Scots pine was strong and continued still at the end of the study period. The trees on ApaBio and PK plots grew nearly two-fold and those on Ash plots over two-fold compared with the control plots. In a thinning made at the end of the study period the total logging removal on fertilized plots was 1.5-2.2 times greater and included more saw logs than on the control plots. Ash fertilizer treatment outperformed other fertilizer treatments as well as the control. With a 5% discounted equivalent annual income (EAI) of Ash fertilizer treatment was statistically significantly (p = 0.009) almost three times higher than that of control. As a conclusion, fertilization (either using PK fertilizers or Ash) in N-rich drained peatlands is a financially feasible method of management.

AB Multilevel logistic regression models were constructed to predict the 5-year mortality of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pubescent birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) growing in drained peatland stands in northern and central Finland. Data concerning tree mortality were obtained from two successive measurements of the National Forest Inventory-based permanent sample plot data base covering pure and mixed stands of Scots pine and pubescent birch. In the modeling data, Scots pine showed an average observed mortality of 2.73% compared to 2.98% for pubescent birch. In the,model construction, stepwise logistic regression and multilevel models methods were applied, the latter making it possible to address the hierarchical data, thus obtaining unbiased estimates for model parameters. For both species, mortality was explained by tree size, competitive position, stand density, species admixture, and site quality. The expected need for ditch network maintenance or re-paludification did not influence mortality. The multilevel models showed the lowest bias in the modeling data. The models were further validated against independent test data and by embedding them in a stand simulator. In 100-year simulations with different initial stand conditions, the models resulted in a 72% and 66% higher total mortality rate for the stem numbers of pine and birch, respectively, compared to previously used mortality models. The developed models are expected to improve the accuracy of stand forecasts in drained peatland sites.

AB Net mineralization and nitrification in surface forest soils were measured in upland forest stands and valley peatlands using in situ soil incubations at two headwater catchments of Harp Lake, Ontario from July 1995 to October 1996. No difference in either net N mineralization or nitrification was observed between the two adjacent catchments despite differences in catchment N export. Annual rates of net N mineralization in surface 10 cm were higher in forest soils of the deciduous (11.5 +/- 3.1 g/m(2); mean +/- SE) and conifer-mixed (conifer-hardwoods) (13.9 +/- 2.3 g/m(2)) stands than in peatland soils (1.6 +/- 0.6 g/m(2)). Mean annual nitrification rates were higher in deciduous soils (6.6 +/- 0.7 g N/m(2)) than in mixed stands (1.9 +/- 0.6 g N/m(2)) and peatland soils (0.1 +/- 0.2 g N/m(2)). Annual net N mineralization and nitrification were correlated with variations in soil C and N content and moisture associated with different forest stands. Frequent winter incubations indicate that net mineralization and nitrification under snow cover in upland surface soils can contribute as much as 49 and 23% of the annual net production, respectively. The importance of forest vegetation patterns, winter N transformations, and dissolved organic N pools to total N and NO3- cycling and leaching in these catchments is discussed.

ID MODEL
AB Models for predicting tree height were constructed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce( Picea abies) and pubescent birch (Betula pubescens). The data consisted of two separate sets of permanent sample plots forming a representative sample of drained peatland stands in the whole country. A logarithmic height-diameter curve with one nonlinear parameter specific to each tree species was applied. It was assumed that the intercept and slope of the curve would vary randomly from stand to stand. Stand characteristics were used to predict the mean intercept and slope. A nonhomogeneous variance of the residual error was modelled as a function of tree diameter. A mixed linear model technique was applied to fit the models. The diameter of the tree of the median basal area, stand basal area, geographical location of the stand, and site quality were used as fixed independent variables in explaining the variation in the intercept. The diameter of the tree of the median basal area and the stand basal area were used in explaining the variation in the slope. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Lichens are recognized as bioindicators of ecosystem processes associated with environmental disturbances. However, its evaluation in the time requires systematic records of biodiversity which are non-existent in the Katalalixar National Reserve. The aim of this study was to catalog the richness and distribution of lichen biota of Katalalixar National Reserve, not only by identifying the species but interpreting them in their ecological and biogeographic context. By random sampling in Nothofagus nitida, Pilgerodendron uviferum forests and peat bogs 70 species were identified, belonging to 32 families and 65 genera. A high number of endemism was found, with 34% of the species endemic to Southern South American and the Chilean endemic Pseudocyphellaria guzmanii constitutes a new record for the Aisen Region.

AB Forestry is the largest scale human impact affecting catchments in Finland and a prominent source of diffuse pollution in many water courses. Among the forestry activities, draining of wetlands had the most pronounced impacts on sediment, nutrient, and metal loading in the past. At present, renovation of old ditches and fertilization of peatlands constitute the major risk of forestry-induced diffuse pollution. Contemporary forestry aims at decreasing this risk with various riparian buffer strip designs. Among such designs, creation of overland flow areas by plugging the outlet ditches is increasingly used. Our objectives were to evaluate the potential of constructed overland flow areas to function as riparian buffers and estimate the quality and quantity of diffuse pollution from old versus recent forest drainages. We studied retention and release of pollutants from 20 constructed, 2- to 10-m-wide overland flow areas receiving drainage water from forested peatlands. Drainage waters were sampled above and below the plugged ditches three times per year from 1998 to 1999. Chemical oxygen demand and nutrient and metal loads and concentrations varied strongly between seasons, years, and drainage areas. Areas subjected to recent ditch renovations and fertilizations had clearly elevated seasonal loads and concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), PO4, Fe, and A in comparison to old treatment areas. Especially TP loads were high above the national average values measured for forestry-induced diffuse pollution. In general, water quality above and below the buffer strips did not differ significantly. Our results indicate that plugged outlet ditches and associated narrow overland flow areas do not function as proper buffers in peatland areas. We suggest that wider buffers with extensive overland flow areas are needed in order to control diffuse pollution from forested and drained peatlands.

AB Digitised maps of Quaternary deposits, (40)K radiation data and Integrated Agricultural Control System databases (IACS) were used in a GIS analysis to estimate the distribution and land use of agricultural peat and gyttja soils in Sweden. The total area of agricultural land (cropland and pastures) in Sweden was estimated at 3,496,665 ha and 8.6% of this area (301,489 ha) was classified as agricultural peat and gyttja soils, with 202,383 ha of deep peat, 50,191 ha of shallow peat and 48,915 ha of gyttja soils. Using detailed information on crop distribution from agricultural databases, it was possible to estimate the Cultivation intensity (land use) of the agricultural land. One-quarter of the agricultural area of peat soils was intensively cultivated with annual crops and the remaining area was extensively used, dominated by managed grasslands and pastures. There was great variation in cultivation intensity between areas, from 50% annual crops down to 10%. The gyttja soils were in general more intensively cultivated than the peat soils. The improved estimates of acreage and cultivation intensity of agricultural peat soils were used to calculate annual greenhouse gas emissions from subsidence data. The total carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from Swedish agricultural peat soils in 2003 were estimated to be between 3100 Gg CO(2) and 4600 Gg CO(2), which is similar to or lower than previously reported values. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) were estimated at 3.2 Gg N(2)O in 2003. Estimated combined total emissions Of CO(2) and N(2)O from agricultural peat soils in Sweden in 2003 amounted to 4000-5600 Gg CO(2)-equivalents, which Corresponds to approximately 6-8% of the total emissions of all greenhouse gases reported by Sweden (excluding the sink for land use, land use change and forestry - LULUCF). Agricultural peat soils represent a minor fraction of the agricultural land in Sweden but still have a significant effect on total national greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The CoupModel was used to simulate a Norway spruce forest on fertile drained peat over 60 years, from planting in 1951 until 2011, describing abiotic, biotic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O). By calibrating the model against tree ring data a "vegetation fitted" model was obtained by which we were able to describe the fluxes and controlling factors over the 60 years. We discuss some conceptual issues relevant to improving the model in order to better understand peat soil simulations. However, the present model was able to describe the most important ecosystem dynamics such as the plant biomass development and GHG emissions. The GHG fluxes are composed of two important quantities, the spruce forest carbon (C) uptake, 413 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the decomposition of peat soil, 399 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . N2O emissions contribute to the GHG emissions by up to 0.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to 76 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . The 60-year old spruce forest has an accumulated biomass of 16.0 kg C m(-2) (corresponding to 60 kg CO2 m(-2)). However, over this period, 26.4 kg C m(-2) (97 kg CO2 eq m(-2)) has been added to the atmosphere, as both CO2 and N2O originating from the peat soil and, indirectly, from forest thinning products, which we assume have a short lifetime. We conclude that after harvest at an age of 80 years, most of the stored biomass carbon is liable to be released, the system having captured C only temporarily and with a cost of disappeared peat, adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB The purpose of the study is to find which habitats within Central Europe support the persistence of isolated populations of spider species of both boreal and Alpine origins. Twenty-five species exhibited disjunctive distributions with their main sub-area in the tundra or boreal forest, and isolated sub-areas in the temperate zone of Central Europe. Six species exhibited disjunctive distributions with their main sub-area in the Alps, and isolated sub-areas in the temperate zone in Central Europe. Only (approximately) one-third of the species of boreal origin have the same habitat, as in the boreal zone. Two-thirds of the species inhabit different habitats, or have narrowed their ecological valency. Screes play an important role in the survival of these isolated populations of species of boreal origin in the temperate zone, together with mountain summits, mountain forests, and peat bogs. Extensive complexes of sandstone rocks also enables the survival of isolated populations of species of boreal origin.

AB Isotopic data are increasingly being used to quantify and understand the processes that control the release of carbon (C) from northern peatlands. We used delta C-13 and C-14 measurements to investigate the source and age of different forms of aquatic C (DOC, POC and evasion CO2) released from 2 contrasting (undrained v drained) forested peatland catchments at the end of the winter snowmelt period in boreal E Finland. The delta C-13(VPDB) values of DOC (range -28.3 to -28.8 aEuro degrees) were generally more C-13 depleted than evasion CO2 (range -22.7 to -31.5 aEuro degrees) and showed no clear differences between the pre-flood, flood and post-flood periods. Both forms of C had evidence of bomb-C-14 (i.e. > 100%modern), indicating that they contained substantial quantities of C fixed since the mid AD 1950s. However, DOC was C-14 enriched compared to evasion CO2, with C-14 concentrations suggesting that, on average, DOC-C was similar to 5-6 years younger than evasion CO2-C, with the most recently fixed C being released when temperatures were highest. POC was significantly depleted in C-14 with conventional (uncalibrated) radiocarbon ages of 805-1135 BP. In contrast to other studies, the isotopic compositions of DOC and evasion CO2 were very similar, suggesting a predominantly single and consistent C source (decomposition of soil organic matter; SOM) during the snowmelt period. Whilst we found no evidence to suggest that old (pre-bomb) C was being released at the end of the winter period, the drained site was associated with more C-14 depleted and C-13 enriched evasion CO2, suggesting a closer link to the atmospheric CO2 pool. Our isotopic data suggest that the various forms of C released to the aquatic system from these forested Finnish peatlands are closely related, largely unaffected by drainage and (at least in the case of evasion CO2 and DOC) indicate strong connectivity between C cycling in the soil-plant-water system.

AB The Yorkshire Dales is one of the most iconic agricultural landscapes in Britain. However, many questions remain over the evolution of this landscape through time and its natural state before major human impacts. Here we present new palynological data that provide insight into the vegetation and fire history of the southern Yorkshire Dales from the late glacial period to present day. Our data suggest that there is considerable variation in vegetation history between sites, which probably reflects topographic and edaphic factors. Several of the records contain hiatuses that may reflect forest clearance, slow peat accumulation, or peat drainage, cutting and/or burning. Our data show a marked clearance of woodland beginning in the Neolithic period and intensifying in more recent times, marking the development of the contemporary agricultural landscape of the Yorkshire Dales.

AB The discontinuous permafrost zone is undergoing rapid transformation as a result of unprecedented permafrost thaw brought on by circumpolar climate warming. Rapid warming over recent decades has significantly decreased the area underlain by permafrost in peatland complexes. It has catalysed extensive landscape transitions in the Taiga Plains of northwestern Canada, transforming forest-dominated landscapes to those that are wetland dominated. However, the advanced stages of this landscape transition, and the hydrological and thermal mechanisms and feedbacks governing these environments, are unclear. This study explores the current trajectory of land cover change across a 300 000 km(2) region of northwestern Canada's discontinuous permafrost zone by presenting a north-south space-for-time substitution that capitalizes on the region's 600 km latitudinal span. We combine extensive geomatics data across the Taiga Plains with ground-based hydrometeorological measurements collected in the Scotty Creek basin, Northwest Territories, Canada, which is located in the medial latitudes of the Taiga Plains and is undergoing rapid landscape change. These data are used to inform a new conceptual framework of landscape evolution that accounts for the observed patterns of permafrost thaw-induced land cover change and provides a basis for predicting future changes. Permafrost thaw-induced changes in hydrology promote partial drainage and drying of collapse scar wetlands, leading to areas of afforestation forming treed wetlands without underlying permafrost. Across the north-south latitudinal gradient spanning the Taiga Plains, relatively undisturbed forested plateau-wetland complexes dominate the region's higher latitudes, forest-wetland patch-work are most prevalent at the medial latitudes, and forested peatlands are increasingly present across lower latitudes. This trend reflects the progression of wetland transition occurring locally in the plateau-wetland complexes of the Scotty Creek basin and informs our understanding of the anticipated trajectory of change in the discontinuous permafrost zone.

AB In boreal forest, drainage can be successfully used to lower the water-table level of postharvest forested peatland stands suffering from watering-up. The later vegetation revival and growth is suspected to gradually create a water-table drawdown described in this study as biological drainage. Its effect on the annual stump diameter increment of planted eastern larch (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) and naturally regenerated black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) was studied on a postharvested and drained forested peatland located in eastern part of the Canadian boreal forest. A factor describing the neighbourhood occupancy of every subject tree was used to illustrate biological drainage in a retrospective growth analysis. Results showed the dual effect of the neighbourhood occupancy factor: competing situations close to the ditch and growth-favouring situations farther from it. In the latter case, the studied trees demonstrated better growth with moderately increasing neighbourhood occupancy. This was interpreted as evidence of the beneficial effect of biological drainage on tree growth. The presence of speckled alder (Alnus incana subsp.rugosa (Du Roi) J. Clausen) in the neighbourhood of selected trees corresponded to improved growth for both studied species.

AB We estimated the magnitude of the radiative forcing (RF) due to changes in albedo following the forestation of peatlands, and calculated the net RF by taking into account the changes in both the albedo and the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes during one forest rotation. Data on radiation, tree biomass, and soil GHG fluxes were combined with models for canopy cover, tree carbon accumulation, and the RF due to increased atmospheric GHG concentrations for four typical site cases in Finland covering two soil nutrient levels in the south and north of the country. We also studied the observed long-term surface temperatures to detect any indications of drainage-induced effects. The magnitude of the albedo-induced RF was similar to that caused by the carbon sequestration of the growing trees. At three site cases out of four the drainage induced a cooling or negative RF, the tendency for cooling being higher at sites with a higher nutrient level. The differences in albedo-induced RF mainly arose from the spring season due to (1) the different snow cover duration in the south versus the north, and (2) the different albedos of drained and undrained snow covered peatlands. An increase in the maximum daily temperatures was observed in April in southern Finland, where the most intensive drainage practices have taken place, suggesting that forestry drainage has potentially affected the local climate. Our results show that the decreasing albedo resulting from peatland forestation contributes significantly to the RF, balancing out or even exceeding the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes.

DE peatland forest; post-drainage stand development; total stand yield;
   simulation; site productivity; site classification
AB Linear regression functions are presented for predicting the volume increment and yield of peatland stands on sites drained far forestry in southern Finland. The data were collected from 329 permanent sample plots measured over a 70-yr period. Site was incorporated into the functions by means of four post-drainage classes (I-IV). These site classes were derived from the functional relationships between the post-drainage yield (total yield minus initial stand volume) at a reference time of 40 yr since drainage within the 21 vegetational site types represented in the data. The growth and yield functions were derived separately for each yield class. Stand volume, stem number, age since drainage, effective temperature sum, peat depth, and ditch spacing were used as predictors in the growth and yield functions. A site classification table, based on stand dominant height, drainage age, and initial volume, is presented for determining the yield class when applying the functions. Yield class can also be determined from the vegetational site types widely used in Finland. The reliability of the forecasts primarily depends on the quality of the data used in deriving the functions and on the input data in an application situation. Care should be taken when applying the functions to long-term simulations of future post-drainage growth and yield, where the growth and yield functions can be applied together.

AB Buffer zones can be used to reduce nutrient and suspended sediment export following forest clearfelling by directing runoff over a vegetated area. This study demonstrates the achievability of constructing a buffer zone by initially clearfelling the standing forest, seeding with two native grass species and directing the water from a semi-natural stream draining an upstream 10 ha forested peatland site through it. Following the clearfelling of the upstream study site this study tested the efficacy of this management practice in reducing nutrient and suspended sediment concentration in the receiving water. The buffer zone reduced total reactive phosphorus (TRP) and suspended sediment (SS) loads by 18% and 33%, respectively. Phosphorus (P) retention efficiency was dependent on inlet concentrations, loading and hydraulic loading rates. In storm events with a loading rate of >28 g P ha(-1), a flow rate higher than 88.5 L s(-1) and an inlet concentration of <17 mu g L-1 the buffer zone became a TRP release source. The maximum P concentration in the buffer zone did not exceed 40 mu g L-1 during this study demonstrating that the buffer zone method could be used efficiently in peatland forestry to moderate the high P concentrations and assist in protecting salmonids and freshwater pearl mussels.

AB A three-dimensional reconstruction is provided of the composition, spatial distribution, and structure of a single-aged, Middle Pennsylvanian (Moscovian) peat-forming forest of a high-ash, planar (rheotrophic) mire, buried in situ by volcanic ash and preserved in the Lower Radnice Coal of the Radnice Basin (Czech Republic). The reconstruction is based on a detailed taxonomic and taphonomic analysis of fossils in a similar to 0.5-m-thick tuff bed at the base of the Whetstone Horizon excavated over an area of 93.5 m(2). In all, 24 whole-plant taxa of various growth forms were identified. This assemblage represents a lepidodendrid- and Cordaites borassifolius-dominated forest, with a well-developed understory of subarborescent lycopsids, tree ferns, medullosan pteridosperms, and calamites, as well as herbaceous ground cover. Lycopsids were dominated by Lepidodendron simile bearing Flemingites-type cones and L. lycopodioides; Lepidophloios cf. acerosus was subdominant. Lianas, mostly lyginopterid pteridosperms and some ferns, were usually found close to upright stems. The ground cover, mostly ferns and sphenophyllaleans, was taxonomically the most diverse stratum, although only a minor contributor to the peat. Based on samples from the coal roof, the palynological record is in agreement with the tuff bed assemblage except for the quantity of certain taxa. To reduce this bias, compression R-values were calculated from the percent cover of aerial plant parts in the excavation and in the dispersed palynoflora. These R-values suggest that in the palynological record, arborescent lycopsids and sphenophylls are greatly overrepresented, ferns and cordaites strongly underrepresented, and calamites are almost the same in both records.

AB Boreal forests at high latitudes are climate-sensitive ecosystems that respond directly to environmental forcing by changing their position according to latitude or by changing their abundance at local and regional scales. South of the arctic treeline, external forcing (warming, cooling, drought, fire) necessarily results in the changing abundance of the impacted forests; in particular, the deforestation of well-drained sites through fire is the most important factor. In this study, we examined the changing abundance of wetland forests located at the arctic treeline (northern Quebec, Canada) during the last 1500 years, a period of known contrasting climatic conditions. Black spruce (Picea mariana) trees submerged in small lakes and peatland ponds and soil-peat stratigraphy were used concurrently to reconstruct the millennial-long developmental sequence of wetland stands associated with moisture changes and fire disturbance. Changing lake levels from AD 300 to the present were identified based on radiocarbon-dated submerged paleosols and tree-rinc, cross-dating of submerged trees distributed in three wetlands from the same watershed. Dead and living trees in a standing position below and above present water level of a small lake (LE Lake) showed direct evidence of past water levels from the 12th century to the present day. Submerged subfossil trees from another lake (LB Lake) and two peatland ponds (PB Peatland) also responded synchronously to changes in soil moisture during the last 1500 years. Regional-scale catastrophic flooding around AD 1150, inferred from paleosol and subfossil tree data, eliminated riparian peat and wetland trees growing at least since AD 300. Also, the coincidence of events such as the mass mortality of wetland spruce and post-fire deforestation of a small hill surrounding LE Lake during the late 1500s suggests the impact of local-scale flooding, probably attributable to greater snow transportation and accumulation on the lake surface after fire disturbance. Massive tree mortality climaxed at ca. 1750, when all wetland trees at LB Lake and PB Peatland died because of permafrost disturbance and soil upthrusting. Lower water levels from AD 300 to 1750 were associated with drier conditions, possibly caused by greater evaporation and/or reduced snow accumulation. Permafrost development in shallow waters occurred during the Little Ice Age, after 1600. It is concluded that the climate at the eastern Canadian treeline was warmer and drier from AD 300 to the onset of the Little Ice Age and promoted tree establishment. The highest water levels were recorded recently (19th and 20th centuries), causing lake and peatland expansion. Any future Moisture changes at these subarctic latitudes will result in important spatial rearrangements of wetland ecosystems.

AB Forest management practices in boreal peatlands increase nutrient export and suspended solids to watercourses calling for development of new water protection methods. One potential solution could be adsorption-based purification of runoff water using biochar. The aim of this study was to determine the adsorption rate and capacity for Norway spruce and silver birch biochars to design a biochar-filled reactor for a ditch drain. In a 10-day laboratory experiment, biochar was stirred with runoff water from a clear-cut peatland forest, and changes in water pH, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus, and total organic carbon concentrations were measured. Based on the concentration changes, adsorption was quantified and adsorption model containing the adsorption rate and capacity was fitted to the data. Our results indicate that biochar effectively adsorbs both inorganic and organic nitrogen from runoff water. Birch biochar had higher adsorption capacity of nitrogen than spruce biochar. This study demonstrates that the adsorption of nitrogen compounds onto biochar surfaces increases with increasing initial concentrations. Thus, aquatic ecosystems exposed to high nutrient loads from fertile peatlands would particularly benefit from biochar-based water purification.

AB Organic soils are a main source of direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas (GHG). Observed N2O emissions from organic soils are highly variable in space and time, which causes high uncertainties in national emission inventories. Those uncertainties could be reduced when relating the upscaling process to a priori-identified key drivers by using available N2O observations from plot scale in empirical approaches. We used the empirical fuzzy modelling approach MODE to identify main drivers for N2O and utilize them to predict the spatial emission pattern of European organic soils. We conducted a meta-study with a total amount of 659 annual N2O measurements, which was used to derive separate models for different land use types. We applied our models to available, spatially explicit input driver maps to upscale N2O emissions at European level and compared the inventory with recently published IPCC emission factors. The final statistical models explained up to 60% of the N2O variance. Our study results showed that cropland and grasslands emitted the highest N2O fluxes 0.98 +/- 1.08 and 0.58 +/- 1.03 gN(2)O-N m(-2) a(-1), respectively. High fluxes from cropland sites were mainly controlled by low soil pH value and deep-drained ground-water tables. Grassland hotspot emissions were strongly related to high amount of N-fertilizer inputs and warmer winter temperatures. In contrast, N2O fluxes from natural peatlands were predominantly low (0.07 +/- 0.27 gN(2)O-N m(-2) a(-1)) and we found no relationship with the tested drivers. The total inventory for direct N2O emissions from organic soils in Europe amount up to 149.5 GgN(2)O-N a(-1), which also included fluxes from forest and peat extraction sites and exceeds the inventory calculated by IPCC emission factors of 87.4 GgN(2)O-N a(-1). N2O emissions from organic soils represent up to 13% of total European N2O emissions reported in the European Union (EU) greenhouse gas inventory of 2011 from only 7% of the EU area. Thereby the model demonstrated that the major part (85 %) of the inventory is induced by anthropogenic management, which shows the significant reduction potential by rewetting and extensification of agriculturally used peat soils.

AB Time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery are useful in measuring vegetation response to climate warming in remote northern regions. These indices show that productivity is generally declining in the boreal forest, but it is unclear which components of boreal vegetation are driving these trends. We aimed to compare trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to forest growth and demographic data taken from a 10 ha mapped plot located in a spruce-dominated boreal peatland. We used microcores to quantify recent growth trends and tree census data to characterize mortality and recruitment rates of the three dominant tree species. We then compared spatial patterns in growth and demography to patterns in Landsat-derived maximum NDVI trends (1984-2019) in 78 pixels that fell within the plot. We found that NDVI trends were predominantly positive (i.e., "greening") in spite of the ongoing loss of black spruce (the dominant species; 80% of stems) from the plot. The magnitude of these trends correlated positively with black spruce growth trends, but was also governed to a large extent by tree mortality and recruitment. Greening trends were weaker (lower slope) in areas with high larch mortality, and high turnover of spruce and birch, but stronger (higher slope) in areas with high larch recruitment. Larch dominance is currently low (similar to 11% of stems), but it is increasing in abundance as permafrost thaw progresses and will likely have a substantial influence on future NDVI trends. Our results emphasize that NDVI trends in boreal peatlands can be positive even when the forest as a whole is in decline, and that the magnitude of trends can be strongly influenced by the demographics of uncommon species.

AB The presence or absence of permafrost strongly influences the hydrology and ecology of northern watersheds. Resource exploration activities are currently having profound effects on hydrological and ecological processes in sub-arctic peatlands. In wetland-dominated zones of discontinuous permafrost, permafrost occurs below tree-covered peat plateaus where the tree-canopy and vadose zone act to insulate and preserve permafrost below. Linear disturbances such as seismic lines result in removal of the canopy, and cause permafrost thaw, which results in increased soil moisture, land subsidence, and deforestation. This contributes to land-cover transformation, habitat and vegetation loss, and changes to basin hydrologic cycles. The resultant permafrost-degraded corridors comprise large portions of the drainage density of sub-arctic basins, and alter the region's water and energy balances. Mulching over disturbances, with the removed tree canopy, has been proposed as a best management practice to help reduce this environmental impact. Here we present climate chamber and numerical modeling results which quantify the effects of mulching and its ability to limit permafrost thaw and alterations to the ground thermal regime. Overall, the thermal buffering ability of the mulch had beneficial effects on slowing thaw, due to its low thermal conductivity, which decouples the subsurface from meteorological forcing and impedes heat conduction. Results indicate that mulching is an effective technique to reduce permafrost thaw and provides a scientific basis to assess the mitigation measure on its ability to slow permafrost degradation. This study will provide guidance as to how northern exploration may be performed in a more environmentally sustainable manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The mid- to high-boreal forest in Canada occupies the discontinuous permafrost zone, and is often underlain by glaciolacustrine sediments mantled by a highly porous organic mat. The result is a poorly drained landscape dominated by wetlands. Frost-table dynamics and surface storage conditions help to control runoff contributions from various landscape elements, hydrological linkages between these elements, and basin streamflow during spring snowmelt. Runoff components and pathways in a forested peatland basin were assessed during two spring snowmelts with contrasting input and basin conditions. Runoff from relatively intense melt (up to 16 mm day(-1)) on slopes with limited soil thawing combined with large pre-melt storage in surface depressions to produce high flows composed primarily of meltwater (78% of the 0.29 m(3) s(-1) peak discharge) routed over wetland surfaces and through permeable upper peat layers. Melt intensity was less in the subsequent year (maximum of 10 mm day(-1)) and active layer development was relatively greater (0.2 m deeper at the end of spring melt), resulting in less slope runoff. Coupling of reduced slope contributions with lower storage levels in basin wetlands led to relatively subdued streamflows dominated by older water (73% of the 0.09 m(3) s(-1) peak discharge) routed through less-permeable deeper peat layers and mineral soil. Interannual differences in runoff conditions provide important insight for the development of distributed hydrological models for boreal forest basins and into potential influences on biogeochemical cycling in this landscape under a warming climate.

AB Restoration impact of forestry-drained peatlands on runoff water quality and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient export was studied. Eight catchments were included: three mesotrophic (one undrained control, two treatments), two ombrotrophic (one drained control, one treatment) and three oligotrophic catchments (one undrained control, two treatments). Three calibration years and four post-restoration years were included in the data from seven catchments, for which runoff was recorded. For one mesotrophic treatment catchment only one year of pre-restoration and two years of post-restoration water quality data is reported. Restoration was done by filling in and damming the ditches. Water samples were collected monthly-biweekly during the snow-free period; runoff was recorded continuously during the same period. Water quality was estimated for winter using ratios derived from external data. Runoff for non-recorded periods were estimated using the FEMMA model.
   A high impact on DOC, nitrogen (N) and phosporus (P) was observed in the mesotrophic catchments, and mostly no significant impact in the nutrient-poor catchments. The DOC load from one catchment exceeded 1000 kg (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year; increase of DOC concentration from 50 to 250 mg l(-1) was observed in the other mesotrophic treatment catchment. Impact on total nitrogen export of over 30 kg (restored-ha)(-1) was observed in one fertile catchment during the first year. An impact of over 5 kg (restored-ha()-1) on ammonium export was observed in one year in the mesotrophic catchment. Impact on P export from the mesotrophic catchment was nearly 5 kg P (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year.
   The results imply that restoration of nutrient-rich forestry-drained peatlands poses significant risk for at least short term elevated loads degrading the water quality in receiving water bodies. Restoration of nutrient-poor peatlands poses a minor risk in comparison. Research is needed regarding the factors behind these risks and how to mitigate them. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Purpose Boreal peat soils comprise about 3% of the terrestrial environments, and when drained, they become sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Ammonia oxidation can result in N2O emissions, either directly or by fuelling denitrification, but we know little about the ecology of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in peat soils. Our aim was to determine temporal alterations in abundance and composition of these communities in a drained and forested peat soil in relation to N2O emissions and ammonia oxidation activity.
   Materials and methods The peat was sampled at three different depths in the upper 0.5 m over a period of 9 months covering two summer and two winter samplings. Community composition and abundance were determined by T-RFLP and quantitative real-time PCR of the bacterial and archaeal amoA genes. Potential ammonia oxidation rates were measured using the chlorate inhibition technique, and in situ N2O emission was determined using chambers.
   Results and discussion The soil parameters displayed little spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which probably explained why there were no depth-related effects on the abundance, composition, or activity of the ammonia oxidizers. In contrast to most terrestrial environments, the AOB dominated numerically over the AOA. Both groups changed in community composition between sampling occasions, although the AOB showed more significant seasonal signatures than the AOA. Temporal changes in abundance were only observed for the AOB, with a decrease in numbers from May to March. Such differences were not reflected by the activity or N2O emissions.
   Conclusions The high ammonium concentrations in the peat soil likely favored the AOB over the AOA, and we hypothesize that they were more active than the AOA and therefore responded to climatic and environmental changes. However, other processes rather than ammonia oxidation were likely responsible for N2O emissions at the site.

AB Boreal black spruce forests typically have a dense ground cover of bryophytes. The two main bryophyte groups in boreal black spruce forests, feathermoss and Sphagnum, have ecophysiological characteristics that influence the biogeochemical cycles of black spruce forests differently. The objective of this study was to examine the environmental controls of ground cover composition and net primary production (NPP) of feathermoss and Sphagnum in a boreal black spruce forest in central Saskatchewan. The fraction of Sphagnum ground cover was positively correlated to canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance (r(2)=0.48, P=0.03), but the fraction of feathermoss ground cover was negatively correlated to canopy PAR transmittance in plots where Sphagnum was present (r(2)=0.87, P <0.0001). Sphagnum presence was inversely correlated (P=0.0001) to water table index, defined as water table depth relative to the peat layer, while feathermoss occurred in a wider range of microenvironments. Average NPP for 1998 was more than three times greater for Sphagnum (77 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than feathermoss (24 g C m(-2) year(-1)), but the average bryophyte NPP for 1998 was 25 g C m(-2) year(-1) because feathermoss was the dominant ground cover. The large, but differing, peat carbon content of Sphagnum- versus feathermoss-dominated boreal forests and peatlands necessitates the need to accurately quantify fraction ground cover. Additional validation of the empirical models between environmental variables and fraction ground cover of bryophytes is necessary, but the reported relationships offer an approach to model carbon dynamics of bryophytes in boreal forests and peatlands.

AB We present a decadal (1994-2004) record of carbon dioxide flux in a 160-year-old black spruce forest/veneer bog complex in central Manitoba, Canada. The ecosystem shifted from a source (+41 g C m(-2), 1995) to a sink (-21 g C m(-2), 2004) of CO2 over the decade, with an average net carbon balance near zero. Annual mean temperatures increased 1-2 degrees during the period, consistent with the decadal trend across the North American boreal biome. We found that ecosystem carbon exchange responded strongly to air temperature, moisture status, potential evapotranspiration, and summertime solar radiation. The seasonal cycle of ecosystem respiration significantly lagged that of photosynthesis, limited by the rate of soil thaw and the slow drainage of the soil column. Factors acting over long time scales, especially water table depth, strongly influenced the carbon budget on annual time scales. Net uptake was enhanced and respiration inhibited by multiple years of rainfall in excess of evaporative demand. Contrary to expectations, we observed no correlation between longer growing seasons and net uptake, possibly because of offsetting increases in ecosystem respiration. The results indicate that the interactions between soil thaw and water table depth provide critical controls on carbon exchange in boreal forests underlain by peat, on seasonal to decadal time scales, and these factors must be simulated in terrestrial biosphere models to predict response of these regions to future climate.

AB Soil-surface temperature acts as a master variable driving nonlinear terrestrial ecohydrological, biogeochemical, and micrometeorological processes, inducing short-lived or spatially isolated extremes across heterogeneous landscape surfaces. However, subcanopy soil-surface temperatures have been, to date, characterized through isolated, spatially discrete measurements. Using spatially complex forested northern peatlands as an exemplar ecosystem, we explore the high-resolution spatiotemporal thermal behavior of this critical interface and its response to disturbances by using Fiber-Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing. Soil-surface thermal patterning was identified from 1.9 million temperature measurements under undisturbed, trees removed and vascular subcanopy removed conditions. Removing layers of the structurally diverse vegetation canopy not only increased mean temperatures but it shifted the spatial and temporal distribution, range, and longevity of thermal hot spots and hot moments. We argue that linking hot spots and/or hot moments with spatially variable ecosystem processes and feedbacks is key for predicting ecosystem function and resilience.

AB We measured molecular distributions and compound-specific hydrogen (delta D) and stable carbon isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of mid- and long-chain n-alkanes in forest soils, wetland peats and lake sediments within the Dorokawa watershed, Hokkaido, Japan, to better understand sources and processes associate with delivery of terrestrial organic matter into the lake sediments. delta C-13 values of odd carbon numbered C-23-C-33 n-alkanes ranged from -37.2 parts per thousand to -31.5 parts per thousand, while delta D values of these alkanes showed a large degree of variability that ranged from -244 parts per thousand to -180 parts per thousand. Molecular distributions in combination with stable carbon isotopic compositions indicate a large contribution of C3 trees as the main source of n-alkanes in forested soils whereas n-alkanes in wetland soil are exclusively derived from marsh grass and/or moss. We found that the n-alkane delta D values are much higher in forest soils than wetland peat. The higher delta D values in forest samples could be explained by the enrichment of deuterium in leaf and soil waters due to increased evapotranspiration in the forest or differences in physiology of source plants between wetland and forest. A delta C-13 vs. delta D diagram of n-alkanes among forest, wetland and lake samples showed that C-25-C-31 n-alkanes deposited in lake sediments are mainly derived-from tree leaves due to the preferential transport of the forest soil organic matter over the wetland or an increased contribution of atmospheric input of tree leaf wax in the offshore sites. This study demonstrates that compound-specific delta D analysis provides a useful approach for better understanding source and transport of terrestrial biomarkers in a C3 plant-dominated catchment.

AB There is fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in key vegetation properties including leaf-area index (LAI) and biomass in treeless northern peatlands, and hyperspectral drone data with high spatial and spectral resolution could detect the spatial patterns with high accuracy. However, the advantage of hyperspectral drone data has not been tested in a multi-source remote sensing approach (i.e. inclusion of multiple different remote sensing datatypes); and overall, sub-meter-level leaf-area index (LAI) and biomass maps have largely been absent. We evaluated the detectability of LAI and biomass patterns at a northern boreal fen (Halssiaapa) in northern Finland with multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data and assessed the benefit of hyperspectral drone data. We measured vascular plant percentage cover and height as well as moss cover in 140 field plots and connected the structural information to measured aboveground vascular LAI and biomass and moss biomass with linear regressions. We predicted both total and plant functional type (PFT) specific LAI and biomass patterns with random forests regressions with predictors including RGB and hyperspectral drone (28 bands in a spectral range of 500-900 nm), aerial and satellite imagery as well as topography and vegetation height information derived from structure-from-motion drone photogrammetry and aerial lidar data. The modeling performance was between moderate and good for total LAI and biomass (mean explained variance between 49.8 and 66.5%) and variable for PFTs (0.3-61.6%). Hyperspectral data increased model performance in most of the regressions, usually relatively little, but in some of the regressions, the inclusion of hyperspectral data even decreased model performance (change in mean explained variance between -14.5 and 9.1%-points). The most important features in regressions included drone topography, vegetation height, hyperspectral and RGB features. The spatial patterns and landscape estimates of LAI and biomass were quite similar in regressions with or without hyperspectral data, in particular for moss and total biomass. The results suggest that the fine-scale spatial patterns of peatland LAI and biomass can be detected with multi-source remote sensing data, vegetation mapping should include both spectral and topographic predictors at sub-meter-level spatial resolution and that hyperspectral imagery gives only slight benefits.

AB Prediction of the effect of harvests and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of forests is necessary both for CC mitigation and adaptation purposes.
   We assessed the impact of roundwood and fuelwood removals and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of Finnish forests during 2007-2042. We considered three harvest scenarios: two based on the recent projections of roundwood and fuelwood demand, and the third reflecting the maximum sustainable cutting level. We applied two climate scenarios: the climate was in the state that prevailed around year 2006, or it changed according to the IPCC SRES A1B scenario.
   We combined the large-scale forestry model MELA with the soil carbon model Yasso07 for mineral soils. For soils of drained, forested peatlands, we used a method based on emission factors.
   The stock change of trees accounted for approximately 80 % of the total stock change. Trees and mineral soils acted as carbon sinks and the drained peatland soils as a carbon source. The forest carbon sink increased clearly in both of the demand-based scenarios, reaching the level of 13-20 Tg C/year (without CC). The planned increase in the use of bioenergy reduced the forest sink by 2.6 Tg C/year. CC increased the forest carbon sink in 2042 by 38 %-58 % depending on the scenario. CC decreased the sink of mineral soils in the initial years of the simulations; after 2030, the effect was slightly positive. CC increased the emissions from the drained peatland soils.
   It is likely that forest land in Finland acts as a carbon sink in the future. The changes in carbon stocks of trees, mineral soils, and peatland soils respond differently to CC and fuelwood and roundwood harvests.

AB The distribution and quantitative recovery of N-15-labelled urea fertilizer was studied in a tamarack/black spruce ecosystem on a drained minerotrophic peatland in central Alberta, Canada. The site was ditched in Fall 1987 and urea fertilizer at 53 kg ha(-1) was applied on 1 June 1989. Recovery of labelled N 3 and 15 months after fertilization was determined in tree and understory vegetation biomass, and in soil. Fertilizer N showed little mobility in soil and tended to accumulate within the 0-20 cm depth. Mean fertilizer N recovery in soil at 3 and 15 months after fertilization was about 54 and 47%, respectively, of the applied N. Corresponding recovery in above tree components was 5.7 and 9.2%, respectively. This increase in recovery of fertilizer N in aboveground tree components was attributable to black spruce since N-15 recovered in black spruce increased significantly during the second growing season. In both years a greater proportion of N was recovered in black spruce compared with tamarack. A substantial amount of N was recovered in understory vegetation suggesting that understory may be a significant sink for N.

AB Boreal forest fires are an important source of terrestrial carbon emissions, particularly during years of widespread wildfires. Most carbon emission models parameterize wildfire impacts and carbon flux to area burned by fires, therein making the assumption that fires consume a spatiotemporally homogeneous landscape composed of predominantly spruce forests and peat bogs with deep duff layers. While recent efforts have demonstrated that boreal forest fires heterogeneously consume aboveground vegetation, little remains known about the vegetation consumed during such fires. We examined climate, land cover, area burned, and fire impacts for large fires (2002 to 2009) across the Alaskan boreal landscape to address the validity of assumptions made by carbon emissions models for boreal fires. Results indicated that while coniferous vegetation, particularly spruce forests and spruce bogs, comprised the majority of the area burned in all years, shrub land cover comprised a substantial proportion (up to 35%) of the area burned during warmer years of the study period. Interannual climate variability significantly influenced both the proportion of vegetation classes burned and the distribution of fire impacts across years and vegetation classes. We found that surface fuel modifications were sensitive to both the vegetation type that burned and climatic conditions. Area burned is an inadequate input metric for increasingly refined carbon emissions models, and consideration of heterogeneous fire impacts may improve carbon emissions modeling.

AB The prospect of harvesting forest-peatland systems in the coastal western hemlock forest region of British Columbia has created the need for an understanding of the interrelationship between topography, groundwater flow, and site productivity. Detailed topographic mapping including the use of ground-penetrating radar coupled with point measurements of specific yield, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and groundwater level were used to determine the characteristics of groundwater flow along forest-peatland complexes. A topographic index was then used to characterize the spatial distribution of groundwater flow and site conditions (as represented by water table depth and organic horizon thickness) influencing forest community type. Forest community type mean index decreased from open peatland to upland forest. Areas with high slope indices had thicker organic horizons (0.7-1.8 m), water tables closer to the surface (0-0.2 m), and higher soil moisture contents (46-92%). These conditions affect successional dynamics and favour the invasion of hydrophytic species such as Sphagnum mosses. Areas with low slope index values were associated with shallower organic horizons (< 0.4 m), deeper water table (0.3 to > 1.6 m), and drier soil moisture (35-76%), favouring more prolific timber growth.

AB Wetland research has described changes in plant communities along environmental gradients, however, little is known about the relationship between fine-scale hydrologic and abiotic factors and the relative abundances of individual, co-occurring species. Larix laricina (Eastern Larch) and Picea mariana (Black Spruce) are the 2 dominant tree species in open boreal peatlands in the northeastern US. In order to describe abiotic gradients that correlate with species abundances at local spatial scales, we collected data on Eastern Larch and Black Spruce stem abundances, groundwater pH, conductivity, depth to water table, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and canopy closure from 42 plots along 6 transects in an Adirondack wetland. We correlated stem abundances with each of the abiotic variables and then used regression to explain variation in stem abundances of the 2 species along those abiotic gradients. Percent canopy closure explained 56% of the variability in Eastern Larch stem abundance, and depth to groundwater was also positively correlated with number of Eastern Larch stems. These 2 abiotic conditions covaried; thus, the best model to explain variability in Eastern Larch stem abundance included only canopy closure. Black Spruce stem abundance was significantly lower in plots with higher water temperatures (R-2 = 0.31). In a multiple-regression model, depth to the water table explained an additional 6% of the variance and substantially reduced Mallows' C-p. Eastern Larch and Black Spruce appear to establish along different abiotic gradients at the scale of tens of meters within this study wetland. Although light levels, as mediated by canopy closure, would be predicted to influence the establishment of Eastern Larch based on its silvics, the strong negative relationship between Black Spruce stem abundance and water temperature has not been previously reported. Sampling other peatlands will allow us to determine the universality of these patterns and to better understand which environmental gradients operate at local spatial scales to structure patterns of tree distribution within peatlands.

TI Domination of growing-season evapotranspiration over runoff makes ditch

AB In Finland, ditch network maintenance (DNM) is carried out annually on 60-70,000 ha of drained peatland to promote tree growth for forestry purposes. However, it is important to avoid ditching that contributes little to the stand growth and productivity, both to improve the economical profitability of forestry and to mitigate DNM-induced nutrient release to watercourses.
   We hypothesised that mature forest stands with substantial evapotranspiration potential do not necessarily need DNM, even if the ditch networks are in poor condition. We estimated evapotranspiration (EVT) of forest vegetation during the growing seasons (June-September) of 2007-2011 in four forested artificial peatland catchments dominated by Scots pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.) (stand volume 93-151 m(3) ha(-1)) located in southern, western, central and northern Finland. Precipitation (P), runoff (R) and water table level (WTL) were monitored continuously in the field. The water storage change (Delta S) was estimated on the basis of WTL measurements and peat pF curves determined from in situ peat samples. In addition, tree stand transpiration (T) was estimated in two of the catchments using the sap flow method. EVT was estimated as the residual term of the water balance equation.
   During the growing season, EVT (153-295 mm) was 49-161 % of the total accumulated P (155-368 mm), and decreased from south to north. Within each growing season, EVT was always largest in July or August. Tree transpiration was about 50 % of the total forest EVT in the two sites where it was measured directly. The mean WTL was at depth 36-63 cm during the growing seasons. Clear-cutting of a 100m(3) ha(-1) stand on one site resulted in an average rise of WTL by 18 cm.
   The results suggested that, in the southernmost site in particular, no drainage network management would be necessary to sustain satisfactory drainage conditions for tree growth because growing-season precipitation is transferred back to the atmosphere by forest EVT. In the northernmost site, ditch networks were considered important in controlling drainage conditions because of the low EVT potential of <100 m(3) ha(-1) tree stands. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind forest EVT potential, as one site with high tree stand volume had surprisingly low EVT potential.

AB Wetland determination relies on assumptions that site hydrologic and edaphic conditions limit plant species to certain environments. For example, using species' wetland indicator status for wetland determination assumes that tolerance of wetland conditions best explains distributional patterns. However, abiotic and biotic factors often interact to create complex plant responses across different environments. To evaluate these interactions, we used a hydrologic gradient in the coastal temperate rainforest of southeast Alaska to (1) quantify the primary determinants of conifer distributions, (2) identify thresholds in environmental factors limiting species' success and (3) assess current wetland indicator status of local conifers (Pinus contorta, Picea sitchensis, and Tsuga heterophylla). Data were collected using a hierarchical sampling scheme and analyzed within a Bayesian framework. Topography and hydrologic regime were the primary determinants of distributional patterns, but species were limited by specific microsite factors. Competitively dominant P.sitchensis occurred where hydrology, pH, and nitrogen were most favorable for establishment, while stress-tolerant P.contorta was competitively excluded from these sites. Tsugaheterophylla occurred across the gradient but took advantage of drier conditions, which promoted biomass accumulation. Tree distributions were limited by the interaction between abiotic and biotic factors rather than by abiotic tolerance alone. This knowledge of local and regional drivers of species' distributions and the relative importance of interacting abiotic and biotic drivers provide critical information for land management and regulation. Wetland delineation procedures can be improved through application of the regional empirical limits identified for plant species, as implemented and addressed in this study.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is among the vegetation parameters that play an important role in climate, hydrological and ecological studies, and is used for assessing growth and expansion of vegetation. The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to map the LAI distribution of birch trees (Betula pendula) in peatland ecosystems using field-based instruments and airborne-based remote-sensing techniques. The developed mapping method was validated using field-based LAI measurements using the LAI-2000 instrument. First vegetation indices, including simple ratio (SR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and reduced simple ratio (RSR), were derived from HyMap data and related to ground-based measurements of LAI. LAI related better with RSR (R-2 = 0.68), followed by NDVI (R-2 = 0.63) and SR (R-2 = 0.58), respectively. Areas with birch were identified using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) to classify the image into 11 end members of dominant species including bare soil and open water. Next, the relationship between LAI and RSR was applied to areas with birch, yielding a birch LAI map. Comparison of the map of the birch trees and field-based LAI data was done using linear regression, yielding an R-2 = 0.38 and an RMSE = 0.25, which is fairly accurate for a structurally highly diverse field situation. The method may prove an invaluable tool to monitor tree encroachment and assess tree LAI in these remote and poorly accessible areas.

AB Retention of stormwater can in theory reduce peak flows, sediment and nutrient transport. This study presents results of peak runoff control (PRC) as a water protection method to decrease sediment and nutrient loads from drained peatland forestry in boreal conditions. Peak runoff rate and peak concentrations were reduced. The PRC method reduced suspended solids (SS) load (86%) by reducing flow velocities and improving settling conditions in the ditch network. The method had a considerable effect on SS-bound nutrients, reducing total nitrogen (N-tot) load by 65% and total phosphorus (P-tot) load by 67%. Reductions in velocity resulted in smaller particle size distributions in transported SS. No effect on groundwater elevation was observed and drainage conditions for forestry were maintained. The results clearly show that the PRC method can be used efficiently in peatland forestry as a water protection method to improve water quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The boreal landscape is a complex, spatio-temporally varying mosaic of forest and mire landscape elements that control surface water hydrology and chemistry. Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e. g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humic-rich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment.

AB In drained peatland forests ditch networks need regular maintenance operations in order to sustain their drainage capacity. These operations however have a significant impact on the quality of the runoff water from the ditched areas. Peak runoff control (PRC) method has been proposed as a possible method to diminish the load to water courses through retention of the runoff temporarily in the ditch network during maximum runoff events using dams with a plastic control pipe. However, blocking water into the ditched area for periods of varying length during the growing season may have a negative impact on the growth of the tree stands. In this study past stand growth was investigated in Central Finland in altogether 10 sample Scots pine thinning stands in which the PRC method has been applied 5 growing seasons earlier. In each stand, a pair of sample plots was established: one plot next to the dam within the influence of periodic flooding and the other one outside the effect of periodic flooding. For determining stand growth, field measurements were made in August 2009. Stand growth near the dam was on average 0.54 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) lower than farther away from the dam but the analysis of covariance showed that the dam effect was not significant. The results of this study suggest that the PCR method does not decrease Scots pine stand growth during the first five year growth period after ditch cleaning.

ID C-14
AB We have studied 6 reference sections of bog and lake sediments in the Leningrad and Novgorod provinces to develop a geochronological scale for vegetational and paleoclimatic changes in northwestern Russia during the Late Glacial and Holocene. Every IO-cm layer along the pear and gyttja sections (4-8.5 m thick) was investigated palynologically and the great majority of them were radiocarbon dated. Using the data obtained, standard palynological diagrams were plotted and vegetation history reconstructed. The palynozones indicated on the diagrams were related to the climatic periods and sub-periods (phases) of the Blytt-Sernander scheme. On the basis of 230 C-14 dates obtained, we derived the geochronology of climatic periods and phases; as well as the chronology for the appearance and areal distribution of forest-forming tree species. The uppermost peat layers were dated by using the "bomb effect". We compared the stages of Holocene vegetation and pale oclimatic changes discovered for the Leningrad and Novgorod provinces with the those obtained for Karelia, which we had studied earlier using the same methodology.

AB The quantitative relationship between stand growth rate and water table level in peatland forest sites has not been fully ascertained in the literature. In this study, we investigated this relationship by means of a bivariate regression model, Tree and stand attributes, including volume and past 5-year volume growth as well as median water table depth (WTM) during the 1984 growing season, were observed in 69 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample stands with three subplots established in each stand. All stands were located in deep-peated, moderately rich to poor organic soil sites in Central Finland (61 degrees 45'-62 degrees 26'N, 22 degrees 40'-28 degrees 29'E) that had been ditched for forestry about 25 years earlier (1959-1961). Prediction models for the fixed mean functions for 5-year volume growth and WTM as well as estimates for variances and the correlation of random effects at plot and subplot levels were estimated simultaneously using bivariate regression methods. The correlation of model residuals at the plot level was highly significant. The model was applied to simulate stand volume development for a period of 20 years. Simulations illustrated the dynamic interaction of stand volume, volume growth, and soil water levels: deep initial WTM resulted in stand growth and volume-development increases and subsequently further deepened the WTM in the stand. The model can be applied to southern boreal drained Scots pine peatlands to estimate the WTM in different stand volume conditions and to assess the effect of stand management on WTM.

AB In boreal areas where forestry extends to drained peatlands, erosion and sediment transport from ditch networks are among the most harmful effects of forestry. To explore and quantify the initial bank erosion processes at their source area, topography of a 3.8-metre-long section of a newly cleaned ditch bank was measured at different times with a pin meter. The risk of erosion in the ditch bank was increased by generating elevated water table conditions using artificial irrigation. Erosion and soil deposition were estimated by calculating the changes in the bank topography between the sequential measurements. The total erosion was 41 kg m(-1) within the studied stretch. The eroded material was deposited at the bottom of the ditch and exposed to transportation only later during greater discharge events. The pin meter was found to be a workable device for detecting the erosion-induced changes (1-15 cm) in the ditch dimensions.

   MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; PH; BIODIVERSITY; CATCHMENT
AB Catchment-scale land-use change is recognised as a major threat to aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning globally. In the UK uplands rotational vegetation burning is practised widely to boost production of recreational game birds, and while some recent studies have suggested burning can alter river water quality there has been minimal attention paid to effects on aquatic biota. We studied ten rivers across the north of England between March 2010 and October 2011, five of which drained burned catchments and five from unburned catchments. There were significant effects of burning, season and their interaction on river macroinvertebrate communities, with rivers draining burned catchments having significantly lower taxonomic richness and Simpson's diversity. ANOSIM revealed a significant effect of burning on macroinvertebrate community composition, with typically reduced Ephemeroptera abundance and diversity and greater abundance of Chironomidae and Nemouridae. Grazer and collector-gatherer feeding groups were also significantly less abundant in rivers draining burned catchments. These biotic changes were associated with lower pH and higher Si, Mn, Fe and Al in burned systems. Vegetation burning on peatland therefore has effects beyond the terrestrial part of the system where the management intervention is being practiced. Similar responses of river macroinvertebrate communities have been observed in peatlands disturbed by forestry activity across northern Europe. Finally we found river ecosystem changes similar to those observed in studies of wild and prescribed forest fires across North America and South Africa, illustrating some potentially generic effects of fire on aquatic ecosystems.

AB Growing bioeconomy is increasing the pressure to clear-cut drained peatland forests. Yet, the cumulative effects of peatland drainage and clear-cutting on the biodiversity of recipient freshwater ecosystems are largely unknown.
   We studied the isolated and combined effects of peatland drainage and clear-cutting on stream macroinvertebrate communities. We further explored whether the impact of these forestry-driven catchment alterations to benthic invertebrates is related to stream size. We quantified the impact on invertebrate biodiversity by comparing communities in forestry-impacted streams to expected communities modelled with a multi-taxon niche model.
   The impact of clear-cutting of drained peatland forests exceeded the sum of the independent effects of drainage and clear-cutting, indicating a synergistic interaction between the two disturbances in small streams. Peatland drainage reduced benthic biodiversity in both small and large streams, whereas clear-cutting did the same only in small streams. Small headwater streams were more sensitive to forestry impacts than the larger downstream sites.
   We found 11 taxa (out of 25 modelled) to respond to forestry disturbances. These taxa were mainly different from those previously reported as sensitive to forestry-driven alterations, indicating the context dependence of taxonomic responses to forestry. In contrast, most of the functional traits previously identified as responsive to agricultural sedimentation also responded to forestry pressures. In particular, taxa that live temporarily in hyporheic habitats, move by crawling, disperse actively in water, live longer than 1 year, use eggs as resistance form and obtain their food by scraping became less abundant than expected, particularly in streams impacted by both drainage and clear-cutting.
   Synthesis and applications. Drained peatland forests in boreal areas are reaching maturity and will soon be harvested. Clear-cutting of these forests incurs multiple environmental hazards but previous studies have focused on terrestrial ecosystems. Our results show that the combined impacts of peatland drainage and clear-cutting may extend across ecosystem boundaries and cause significant biodiversity loss in recipient freshwater ecosystems. This information supports a paradigm shift in boreal forest management, whereby continuous-cover forestry based on partial harvest may provide the most sustainable approach to peatland forestry.

AB Drained peatlands in northern Europe comprise more than 10 million ha of forestland and thus constitute a considerable production potential in forestry. Much of this area consists of stands dominated by Scots pine and close to maturity regarding commercial thinning. The trees within these stands typically vary in terms of age, size, and growth rate. The impacts of silvicultural cuttings on these uneven-structured stands are inadequately known. We simulated the impacts of a control regime with no thinnings, and three different thinning regimes, involving different thinning intensities, on the development of fifteen pine-dominated stands in Finland. The simulations started from the first thinnings and were continued until regeneration maturity. The predicted total yields ranged from 244 to 595 m(3)ha(-1), depending on site and thinning regime. The highest total yields were observed for the control regime in which 18-38% of the yield was, however, predicted to self-thin by the end of the simulation. Thus, the differences in the yields of merchantable wood were fairly small among the compared regimes. However, the regimes involving thinnings generally needed less time than the control regime to reach regeneration maturity. The mean annual increment of total stem volume was at its highest in the control regime. The highest mean annual increment of merchantable wood was obtained in the regime involving two moderate thinnings, but excluding the most low-productive sites where thinnings did not increase the yield of merchantable wood.

AB The results of studies on the improvement of technology for producing high-quality planting material of half-high blueberry and Arctic bramble by the method of clonal micropropagation are presented in the current paper. Creation of forest berry plantations in peat extraction areas allows reducing environmental damage and significantly increasing the efficiency of the timber industry. In recent decades, there has been an increasing interest in the creation of forest berry plantations on drained and cutover peatlands in Russia and other countries. It is necessary to use varietal planting material for the successful cultivation of forest berry plants on an industrial scale. Clonal micropropagation is the most effective of the vegetative methods for obtaining planting material, which allows receiving a huge amount of healthy planting material all year round in the conditions of a small laboratory area. Chloride-free ecosterilizer and bleaching agent based on sodium hypochlorite "Belizna" with an exposure of 15 and 20 min showed high efficiency in sterilization of explants of half-high blueberry and Arctic bramble. The highest viability of explants of the studied forest berry crops was observed when sterilized with a 0.1 % mercuric chloride solution and 15 min exposure, and its sharp decrease at 20 min exposure. At the stage of micropropagation, with an increase in the concentration of cytokinin 6-BAP from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L on the nutrient Woody Plant Medium the number of shoots in regenerated plants of half-high blueberry (Northcountry and Northblue cultivars) and Arctic bramble (Anna and Sofia cultivars) increased. The effect of the concentration of IBA-derived auxin on the number and length of roots of regenerated plants was observed at thein vitro rooting stage.

AB The effect of clear-cutting on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, NO3-, and P in outflow water from three productive, Norway spruce dominated drained peatlands (R-CC, VCC-1, VCC-2) were studied. Changes in runoff and transport loads (concentration x runoff) at two of the catchments during the frost-free period are also presented. Approximately 40% of the area was cut at RCC and VCC-2, and 72% at VCC-1. The volume removed was 250 m(3) ha(-1) at R-CC, 259 m(3) ha(-1) at VCC-1, and for VCC-2, 317 m(3) ha(-1). The mean annual increase in outflow concentrations of DOC during the first four years after clear-cutting was 9.0 mg l(-1) at RCC, 22.8 mg l(-1) at VCC-1 and 8.4 mg l(-1) at VCC-2. Corresponding increases in the forms of nitrogen were: 0.23, 0.51 and 0.16 mg DON l(-1); 0.06, 0.31 and 0.04 mg NH4+-N l(-1); and 0.05, 0.12 and 0.22 mg NO3--Nl(-1). Clear-cutting did not significantly (p>0.05) increase P concentrations. The increase in non-frost season runoff over the first three years after clear-cutting was 107 mm at R-CC and 207 mm at VCC-1. The export loads of DOC during the nonfrost season increased by 80 kg ha(-1) at RCC and by 184 kg ha(-1) at VCC-1 over the first three years. Corresponding increases for the other studied solutes were: 1.78 and 3.98 kg DON ha(-1); 0.39 and 1.49 kg NH4+-N ha(-1); 0.45 and 0.48 kg NO3--N ha(-1), and 0.09 and 0.06 kg P ha(-1). The study demonstrated that clear-cutting may significantly increase the export of DOC and different forms of nitrogen from drained productive peatlands while only small increases in phosphorus export may occur.

AB Extreme hydrological events are known to contribute significantly to total annual carbon export, the largest of which in Arctic and boreal catchments is spring snowmelt. Whilst previous work has quantified the export of carbon during snowmelt, the source of the carbon remains unclear. Here we use cation hydrochemistry to trace the primary flowpaths which govern the export of carbon during the snowmelt period; specifically we aim to examine the importance of snowpack meltwater to catchment carbon export. The study was carried out in two forested peatland (drained and undrained) catchments in Eastern Finland. Both catchments were characterised by base-poor stream water chemistry, with cation concentrations generally decreasing in response to increasing discharge. Streamflow during the snowmelt period was best described as a mixture of three sources: pre-event water, snowpack meltwater and a third dilute component we attribute to the upper snow layer which was chemically similar to recent precipitation. Over the study period, pre-event water contributed 32% and 43% of the total stream runoff in Valipuro (undrained) and Suopuro (drained), respectively. The results also suggest a greater near-surface throughflow component in Suopuro, the drained catchment, prior to snowmelt. CO2 and DOC concentrations correlated positively with cation concentrations in both catchments indicating a common, peat/groundwater flowpath. CH4 concentrations were significantly higher in the drained catchment and appeared to be transported in near-surface throughflow. Meltwater from the snowpack represented an important source of stream water CO2 in both catchments, contributing up to 49% of total downstream CO2 export during the study period. We conclude that the snowpack represents a potentially important, and often overlooked, transient carbon store in boreal snow-covered catchments. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic properties of vertical profiles, of forest soils (podzols, cambisols, peat bogs) in Krkonose (Giant Mountains) National Park are reported. Values of low-field magnetic susceptibility were obtained by detailed in-situ measurements using a field probe. Thermomagnetic analysis, acquisition of remanent magnetization, alternating field demagnetization of saturation remanence, and further magnetic characteristics, such as frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility and coercive parameters for individual soil subhorizons were acquired in laboratory, The uppermost layer, which is dominated by magnetically, soft magnetite, most probably of anthropogenic origin, can be reliably identified in the soil profiles over the whole region in concern. Subsoil horizons are characterised by significantly different magnetic properties. Our results suggest that magnetic mapping can be beneficially used also in areas with comparatively low pollution impact. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic soils comprise a large yet fragile carbon (C) store in the global C cycle. Drainage, necessary for agriculture and forestry, triggers rapid decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), typically increasing in the order forest < grassland < cropland. However, there is also large variation in decomposition due to differences in hydrological conditions, climate and specific management. Here we studied the role of SOM composition on peat decomposability in a variety of differently managed drained organic soils. We collected a total of 560 samples from 21 organic cropland, grassland and forest soils in Switzerland, monitored their CO2 emission rates in lab incubation experiments over 6 months at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) and related them to various soil characteristics, including bulk density, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and elemental ratios (C = N, H / C and O / C). CO2 release ranged from 6 to 195 mg CO(2-)Cg(-1) SOC at 10 degrees C and from 12 to 423 mg g(-1) at 20 degrees C. This variation occurring under controlled conditions suggests that besides soil water regime, weather and management, SOM composition may be an underestimated factor that determines CO2 fluxes measured in field experiments. However, correlations between the investigated chemical SOM characteristics and CO2 emissions were weak. The latter also did not show a dependence on land-use type, although peat under forest was decomposed the least. High CO2 emissions in some topsoils were probably related to the accrual of labile crop residues. A comparison with published CO2 rates from incubated mineral soils indicated no difference in SOM decomposability between these soil classes, suggesting that accumulation of recent, labile plant materials that presumably account for most of the evolved CO2 is not systematically different between mineral and organic soils. In our data set, temperature sensitivity of decomposition (Q(10) on average 2.57 +/- 0.05) was the same for all land uses but lowest below 60 cm in croplands and grasslands. This, in turn, indicates a relative accumulation of recalcitrant peat in topsoils.

AB We present the 10-year results of a forest drainage experiment conducted in a pre-mature uneven-aged black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) stand, in Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada. The set up included 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 m ditch spacings, and the data were pooled in three diameter classes, <= 4 cm (small stems), 6-10 cm (medium-size stems) and >= 12 cm (large stems), in order to take into account stand structure in the analysis. The diameter growth of large stems (dominant cover, height similar to 8-12 m) was not improved by drainage. Medium-size stems (intermediate story, similar to 4-8 m) showed a better growth at a 5-10 m distance from the ditches, while small stems (understory similar to 1-4 m) reacted well to drainage, proportionally to ditch closeness. Generally, growth and gain attributable to drainage increased with the live crown ratio, from one third of the total tree height. We did not detect any effect of drainage or distance from the nearest ditch on the nutrient content of the current year foliage of the large stems. For small stems, even the individuals located at 25-30 m from the ditches showed a growth increase compared to the control, although the understory did not benefit from full light conditions. Results suggest that drainage aiming at correcting watering-up following harvesting could permit a rapid growth increase of advance growth.

LA English
DT Article
DE biogenic; pyrogenic; contribution; peat deposition; landscapes; soil
AB The article deals with the evaluation of the contribution of peat deposition (a natural process causing long-term removal of toxic elements from the migration streams) to the natural capability of the Meshchera lowland landscapes to act as the buffer with respect to the anthropogenic input of heavy metals (HM). It was found that even despite the prevalence of peat soil, it plays a minor role in the heavy metal assimilation capacity of the landscapes, compared to the accumulation of heavy metals by wood and bark, which is 5 to 9 times higher, and to the involvement of heavy metals in the recyclic flows, which is 70 to 150 times higher. In the conditions of the low trophic level of sandy substrates in Meshchera, the mobile forms of heavy metals are extensively involved in the biogenic migration, and peat accumulates them residually, in small amounts. The highest probability of accumulation in peat is typical of slow-moving toxic agents (Pb), while the lowest one is typical of highly mobile biophiles (Zn). The main factors of the vertical distribution of heavy metals in peat strata are their accumulation in the boundary layers, i.e. pyrogenic and trees-tump horizons (2010, the Early Subatlantic, the Subboreal, and more ancient ones), including that in the course of vertical water migration. All of the above factors significantly impede the use of peat deposits in the Polesye-type landscapes as the natural site for studying aerial technogenic pollution. Fires in forest and peat areas release up to 43% of radiocesium deposited in peat into the atmosphere along with the combustion gases, while natural radionuclides remain relatively stable.

AB Upgraded biofuels such as pellets, briquettes, and powder are today commonly used in small as well as large scale appliances. In order to cover an increasing fuel demand new materials such as bark, whole tree assortments, and peat are introduced. These materials have higher ash content which is why they are potentially more problematic compared with stem wood. In general, few studies can be found regarding cocombustion of peat and biomass and in particular where the slagging tendencies are discussed. The overall objective of this study was therefore to determine the influence of peat addition to woody biomass pellets on slagging characteristics. Two different peat assortments (peat A and B) were copelletized separately in four different dry matter levels (0-5-15-30 wt %) into stem wood and energy wood, respectively. Peat A was a traditional Scandinavian fuel peat, with a high ash and Si content (carex), and peat B had a low ash content and relatively high Ca/Si ratio (sphagnum) chosen for its special characteristics. The produced pellets were combusted in a commercial underfed pellet burner (15 kW) installed in a reference boiler. The collected deposits (bottom ash and slag) from the combustion experiments were chemically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) regarding the elemental distribution and morphology and phase composition, respectively. In addition, the bottom ashes were characterized according to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). To interpret the experimental findings chemical equilibrium model calculations were performed. The slagging tendency increased when adding peat into the woody biomasses. Especially sawdust with its relatively low ash and Ca content was generally more sensitive for the different peat assortments. Cofiring with the relatively Si and ash rich peat A resulted in the most severe slagging tendency. A significant increment of the Si, Al, and Fe content and a significant decrement of the Ca content in the slag could be seen when increasing the content of peat A in both woody biomasses. The slagging tendency increased when adding peat A because high temperature melting Ca-Mg oxides react to form more low temperature melting Ca/Mg-Al-K silicates. The slagging tendency was significantly lower when adding the more ash poor peat B, with relatively high Ca/Si ratio, into the woody biomass fuels compared with the peat A mixtures. The slag from the peat B mixings had a slightly higher Ca content compared with the Si content and a clearly higher content of Ca compared with the peat A mixtures. There were still Ca-Mg oxides left in the bottom ash i.e. a less amount of sticky low temperature melting K-silicate rich melt was formed when peat B was added to the woody biomasses.

AB A reciprocal experiment was analyzed to determine whether 30 open-pollinated families of peatland and upland populations of black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] sampled from a single area in north-central Alberta, Canada, performed consistently when grown in either flooded or well-drained soils (i.e., if there is a family x soil interaction or generally called genotype x environment interaction (GEI)). The data for the analysis consisted of five traits (height, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, root/shoot dry weight ratio and number of braches) describing growth and rooting performance of tree seedlings in flooded and drained soils (root environments) in a greenhouse for 16 weeks. A mixed-model analysis was used to characterize GEL The analysis revealed an interesting contrast of GEI patterns between the peatland vs. upland populations: GEI was absent (as indicated by a perfect correlation between flooded and drained soils) in peatland population but present in the upland population. Our results from the characterization of GEI are also consistent with the well-known theory about selection in different environments that correlated responses due to indirect selection are in general less than direct responses. The contrasting patterns of GEI in peatland vs. upland populations may be reflective of different strategies of adaptation to the contrasting environmental conditions, with the peatland trees growing slowly but steadily and with the upland populations growing fast and very responsive to environmental changes.

ID GROWTH
AB Forest drainage is recognized as a means of improving soil conditions for tree growth, but it may also have environmental impacts. This article presents the 5-y time trend of soil and surface water quality observed in a drainage experiment conducted in a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) peatland of eastern Quebec, Canada, using the paired watershed approach. Nutrient content of peat soil water was enhanced by drainage. The effect was generally proportional to ditch closeness for S and Mg, while increases of N, Na, K and Ca were mainly observed within 5 m of the ditches, even though high levels of K and Ca were occasionally observed at 15-m distance. Drainage increased and sustained summer low flows by 25% through a 80 m(3) d(-1) increase of base flow on the 8 ha basin. The concentration of suspended sediments significantly increased and exceeded acceptable limits For aquatic organisms only during ditching and during the peak Rows of the following weeks. No effect on suspended sediments was detected during the spring following ditching but an increase was observed during a storm 2 y after ditching. Drainage modified the basin outflow temperature fluctuations by lowering the average weekly minimum and increasing the maximum, by 2 degrees C and 7 degrees C, respectively. Water temperature increases to 25 degrees C or more at the outlet of the drained basin were above the preferred range for brook trout. The treatment significantly increased specific conductivity of surface water, which was clearly related to increases in mineral N (NH4 + NOx), Ca, Mg, Na and S concentrations. However, conductivity and the increased nutrient concentrations remained within the acceptable criteria for aquatic organisms. Drainage also produced a pH increase of one unit, a result attributed to increased runoff from the upland part of the treated watershed. No effect related to drainage was found for Zn, Fe and Al contents. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The acid-sensitive upland blanket peat catchments are important habitats for diatom assemblages. In this study, the distribution patterns of epilithic diatom assemblages in the streams of upland forested blanket peat in north-west of Ireland are presented and the associated environmental factors are discussed. A total of 43 sites in 16 rivers were sampled. Multivariate analysis highlighted alkalinity and conductivity as the main physicochemical drivers of riverine diatom assemblages. Contrary to expectations nutrients were not found to have a major influence on the diatoms. A major flood event had a significant impact on the diatom assemblage, and one year after the event, long stalked diatom taxa were still largely absent from the river, indicating that floods could be one of the important factors affecting diatom assemblages. However, the ecological status of the affected sites, as determined by the EQR, did not alter from before to after the flood. The results of this study could be applied to similar acid-sensitive upland peat forest catchments and used as the benchmark to assess the impact of forest operations and peat degradation on ecological status.

ID NUTRIENT REMOVAL; WATER; WETLAND
AB In 1995-2001, the efficiency of riparian buffer zone areas to reduce the concentrations of suspended solids in discharge from peatlands drained for forestry purposes was studied at.,est buffer zones reduced the concentra-7 locations in south-central Finland. The two largest buffer zones reduced the concentration of suspended solids by > 70%. The efficiency of the three medium-sized buffer zones to reduce through-flow sediment concentrations was 50-60%, but no reduction occurred at the smallest two buffer areas. Thus, the capacity of buffer zones to reduce sediment concentrations was strongly related to their size. However, significant correlations were also found between reduction capacity and inflow water sediment concentrations, although the correlations at the two smallest buffer zones were low. The use of buffer zones in reducing sediment load from peatlands drained for forestry purposes is recommended, but relatively large areas for efficient removal capacity are needed.

AB We selected two sites dominated by the sub-Mediterranean oak Quercus pyrenaica Willd. close to its distribution boundary in northwestern Iberia, within a mountain region with a high winter precipitation. The sites differed in their soil water regime, corresponding to the edge of a peat bog, and to a moderate slope. We obtained tree-ring chronologies of total ring width (RW), and mean earlywood vessel area (MVA); their responses to climatic factors were compared for the period 1945-2002. RW presented a higher chronology quality than MVA, but was rather independent of climate, probably because of the presence of recurrent growth reductions. In contrast, MVA was closely related to precipitation during April and May, whereby a high water availability was coupled to smaller vessels. We found remarkable differences between the climatic signal of both stands, as trees growing on the peat soil responded later and with considerably lower intensity. We hypothesize that spring waterlogging causes that the response at the wettest site occurs only when soil desiccation begins, which results in a delayed climatic signal, and also lower intra- and inter-annual variation due to more homogeneous conditions. Climate-growth relationships at the driest site were mainly associated with the first row, whereas it is vessels expanding later in the season that show this relation for the moist site. Our results confirm that MVA chronologies are reliable proxies of both regional and local climatic conditions, but only a careful optimization by selecting vessel subsets does provide a complete view of their potential.

AB The study involves a palaeoecological model for both the coals and associated sediments of the Lampertice Member of the Zacler Formation in the Intra-Sudetic Basin, Czech Republic is proposed. The study area was an intramontane valley drained by a braided to low-sinuosity meandering river with a well developed floodplain. The river probably flowed to the northeast. Taphonomic analysis of the fossil record of various lithologies revealed the existence of autochthonous, parautochthonous-autochthonous and allochthonous plant associations. These associations served as the basis for the restoration of the original phytocoenoses colonizing different areas of the valley: (1) channel banks dominated by pteridosperms with subdominant calamiteans and ferns: (2) clastic floodplains colonised either by pteridosperms, ferns and calamiteans in well-drained areas or by arborescent lycopsids and ferns in poorly-drained areas: (3) mire (peat-forming) forests composed of arborescent lycopsids, ferns and sphenophylls: and (4) valley margin and slopes dominated by cordaiteans and pteridosperms.

   LOGGING RESIDUE; NITROUS-OXIDE; CO2 EXCHANGE; WATER-VAPOR; N2O FLUXES;

AB The most common forest management method in Fennoscandia is rotation forestry, including clear-cutting and forest regeneration. In clear-cutting, stem wood is removed and the logging residues are either removed or left on site. Clear-cutting changes the microclimate and vegetation structure at the site, both of which affect the site's carbon balance. Peat soils with poor aeration and high carbon densities are especially prone to such changes, and significant changes in greenhouse gas exchange can be expected. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy fluxes with the eddy covariance method for 2 years (April 2016-March 2018) after clear-cutting a drained peatland forest. We observed a significant rise (23 cm) in the water table level and a large CO2 source (first year: 3086 +/- 148 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1); second year: 2072 +/- 124 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). These large CO2 emissions resulted from the very low gross primary production (GPP) following the removal of photosynthesizing trees and the decline of ground vegetation, unable to compensate for the decomposition of logging residues and peat. During the second summer (June-August) after the clear-cutting, GPP had already increased by 96% and total ecosystem respiration decreased by 14% from the previous summer. The mean daytime ratio of sensible to latent heat flux decreased after harvesting from 2.6 in May 2016 to 1.0 in August 2016, and in 2017 it varied mostly within 0.6-1.0. In April-September, the mean daytime sensible heat flux was 33% lower and latent heat flux 40% higher in 2017, probably due to the recovery of ground vegetation that increased evapotranspiration and albedo of the site. In addition to CO2 and energy fluxes, we measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes with manual chambers. After the clear-cutting, the site turned from a small CH4 sink into a small source and from N2O neutral to a significant N2O source. Compared to the large CO2 emissions, the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) of the CH4 emissions was negligible. Also, the GWP100 due to increased N2O emissions was less than 10% of that of the CO2 emission change.

AB British vegetation is estimated to contain 113.8 million tC, 80 per cent of which is in forests and woodlands (91.9 million tC). Sitka spruce plantations, although covering 21.4 per cent of the forest/woodland area, contain only 8.2 per cent of the forest/woodland carbon, because the plantations are young and have an average of only 14.1 tC ha(-1). Broadleaved woodlands in Britain have an average of 61.9 tC ha(-1) and contain 46.8 per cent of the total carbon in all vegetation. A breakdown is given of the carbon density (tC ha(-1)) and content of different tree species. A carbon density map of Britain highlights the concentration of carbon in the broadleaved woodlands in southern England and in the large conifer plantations in southern Scotland and northern England.
   Carbon storage in the trees, products, litter and soil can be evaluated in terms of long-term equilibrium storage or short-term rate of storage. These two components vary among forest types in Britain and globally. Plantations harvested at the time of maximum mean annual increment (MAI) will not store as much carbon as mature, old-growth forests on the same site unless they have long-lasting products and/or are very fast growing. Maximum equilibrium carbon storage is generally achieved by harvesting at the time of maximum MAI when the lifetime of products exceeds the time to maximum MAI. Undisturbed peatlands sequester CO2 and emit CH4, and may be greenhouse neutral. When peatlands are drained and planted with trees, they stop emitting CH4 and store carbon in the trees, forest litter, forest soil and wood products. However, these greenhouse gas 'gains' are offset by the oxidation to CO2 of the pear, and the gains are exceeded by CO2 losses when 20-40 cm depth of peat has been oxidized. Forests in Britain are currently sequestering 1.5-1.7 million tC a(-1) in trees, 0.3-0.5 tC a(-1) in litter and 0.5 million tC a(-1) in wood products, totalling about 2.5 million tC, equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of the carbon currently emitted by burning fossil fuels in the UK. In order to maintain the current forest carbon sink, the forest area needs to continue to expand at about 25000 ha a(-1) of upland conifers or 10000 ha a(-1) of poplars on good land.

AB Wetlands in the Russian Forest Fund occupy more than 12 % of the country's territory exceeding 100 min ha. These are primarily afforested swamps with low-quality forest stands. A significant part of raised bogs is generally forestless. Meanwhile, about 60 % of the eutrophic and mesotrophic swamps are potentially rich. Here, only excess of water interferes with successful forest growth. The world forestry has accumulated wide experience in regulation of soil water retention through irrigation improvement and drainage. In Russia there are classic examples when stands of the 1st quality class grew in the large (several thousands of hectares) areas after irrigation improvement. One such case is the Kheynovskoye swamp with an area of over 2 ths. ha located in the Lisino training and experimental forest of the Saint-Petersburg State Forest Technical University and drained in 1847. However, there are enough cases of unsuccessful drainage. The better half of the drained swamps before drainage were grown over with forests. Irrigation improvement has turned around the growth conditions of all stands existed before drainage, but in poor eutrophic swamps forest growth is insufficient. The research purpose was to study brand new stands in the drained territory taking into account the whole formation cycle of the biotope and its change with time. In order to get that done, a pilot plot was laid out on a eutrophic-mcsotrophic treeless peat. where drainage was carried out using a frequent network of small grooves (furrows). They were dug with the help of a double moldboard (trench digger) and directed into the channels of the drainage network, thus providing for constant water drainage. Forest plantations were laid out on the layers formed along the furrows with the participation of the author. We had been assessing changes in the stand condition each 5-10 years for almost 60 years. The studies have shown that in the first years after removal of excess water and better soil warming, sedimentation and depletion of peat occurred. At a depth of 0.4-0.5 m in 20 years after planting the trees, the depth of peat decreased by almost 2 times. The living ground cover has changed under the influence of drainage and the developed stand. The initial (swamp) type of soil formation was replaced with soddy soil. High-quality heavy-producing plantation was formed. When comparing the parameters of the created artificial plantation with the stands of natural origin according to the growth course tables, it was found that the stock of the created stands at the age of 50 is almost twice higher than the stock of natural stands. It can be assumed that when growing wood pulp for its intended purposes in 100 years two yields can be harvested. Changes in peat soil have taken place during the last 50 years. The carbon (C) content decreased and the total nitrogen (N) content increased due to the intensive decomposition of peat, as evidenced by the decrease in the ratio of C:N. Structure developed in peat soil. The beginning of podzol-forming is noticed. Probably, the actual and hydrolytic acidity have increased due to the needle litter.

AB We investigate the air pollution in the central European part of Russia during the 2010 summer fires. The results of ground-based (Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Moscow State University (MSU), and Zvenigorod Scientific Station (ZSS)) and satellite (MOPITT, AIRS, of Terra and Aqua satellites) measurements of the total content and concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), as well as MODIS data on the spatial and temporal distribution of forest and peat fires obtained from Terra and Aqua satellites, are presented. A comparison between similar situations in 2010 and 2002 revealed the causes of higher pollution levels in 2010. The use of trajectory analysis, detailed space imagery, and model calculations made it possible to reveal the location of peat fires and their contribution to the air pollution over the Moscow megalopolis. Fireemission estimates were obtained using two independent methods.

AB Peatland drainage enhances tree growth, changes catchment hydrology and increases export of nutrients and suspended solids to water bodies. In this study, impacts of peatland drainage on the properties of water flow paths in terrestrial parts of catchments were assessed in terms of slope, elevation, length and soil type. Three study catchments (area 31.8-153.5 km(2)) were delineated using a 25m x 25m digital elevation model (DEM). Typical water flow paths were calculated for each catchment to characterize the mean elevation above the receiving water body as a function of distance along water flow paths. The resulting two-dimensional (2D) profile also allowed calculations of horizontally distributed properties of catchments as a function of distance to the water body. Peatland drainage decreased the length and elevation of the typical water flow path, and increased the area near water bodies. Increasing drainage from 10.7% to 55.4% of the total catchment area increased the area residing close to a water body (no farther than 25 m) from 17.1% to 60.7%. This area estimate is useful for assessing the costs of water protection, arising from restricting forestry operations in the vicinity of water bodies.

TI Wood ash as a fertilizer on drained mires - growth and foliar nutrients

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE
   FORESTIERE
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST
AB The availability of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) commonly limits tree growth on drained peatlands. The nutritional status and volume growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) after varying doses of wood ash fertilization were investigated in seven field experiments located on deep-peated sites in Finland between latitudes 63 degrees N and 67 degrees N. Needle samples were taken 14-20 years after fertilization and trees measured 15 years after fertilization. Annual growth rates and differences in foliar nutrients were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA model. A regression model was used in the analysis of periodic relative volume growth. High doses of wood ash (100-265 kg P(.)ha(-1), 225-450 kg K(.)ha(-1)) resulted in greater changes in foliar nutrient concentrations and in a stronger growth response than low doses (5-50 kg P(.)ha(-1), 14-210 kg K(.)ha(-1)). Significant increases in needle mass and concentrations of P, K, and B were observed in the ash-fertilized stands, with a good status for these elements 20 years after fertilization. Depending on the ash dose, the mean annual volume growth was 0.5-1.4 m(3.)ha(-1) higher than in the control plots during the 15 year postfertilization period.

AB The magnitude of future emissions of greenhouse gases from the northern permafrost region depends crucially on the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) that has accumulated over millennia in these perennially frozen soils. Many recent studies have used radiocarbon (C-14) to quantify the release of this "old" SOC as CO2 or CH4 to the atmosphere or as dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) to surface waters. We compiled similar to 1,900 C-14 measurements from 51 sites in the northern permafrost region to assess the vulnerability of thawing SOC in tundra, forest, peatland, lake, and river ecosystems. We found that growing season soil C-14-CO2 emissions generally had a modern (post-1950s) signature, but that well-drained, oxic soils had increased CO(2)emissions derived from older sources following recent thaw. The age of CO2 and CH4 emitted from lakes depended primarily on the age and quantity of SOC in sediments and on the mode of emission, and indicated substantial losses of previously frozen SOC from actively expanding thermokarst lakes. Increased fluvial export of aged DOC and POC occurred from sites where permafrost thaw caused soil thermal erosion. There was limited evidence supporting release of previously frozen SOC as CO2, CH4, and DOC from thawing peatlands with anoxic soils. This synthesis thus suggests widespread but not universal release of permafrost SOC following thaw. We show that different definitions of "old" sources among studies hamper the comparison of vulnerability of permafrost SOC across ecosystems and disturbances. We also highlight opportunities for future C-14 studies in the permafrost region.

AB Northern regions are expected to experience large environmental change over the next few decades. The response of biota will depend on changes in the local environment, regional processes that influence lake connectivity, and species interactions. In 2008, we surveyed 92 lakes and ponds across Wapusk National Park, located on the southwestern shore of Hudson Bay. At each site we assessed water chemistry and zooplankton community composition. In an effort to understand how the aquatic ecosystems will respond to future environmental change, we determined local characteristics (e.g., water chemistry), regional spatial factors (e.g., dispersal), and biotic interactions (e.g., species associations) influencing community composition. Important environmental variables included lake area, pH, ionic composition, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a; however, spatial variables explained more variation than environmental variables, suggesting that dispersal is an important driver of zooplankton composition in this region. Additionally, species exhibited negative co-occurrence patterns, suggesting biotic interactions are important in structuring the zooplankton communities. As environmental conditions change and the distribution of habitat (i.e., coastal fen, interior peatland, and spruce forest) shifts, evidence that the park's zooplankton community is spatially structured coupled with our suspicion that zooplankton are likely to experience high dispersal levels in Wapusk leads us to suggest zooplankton may indeed be able to track changing environmental conditions within the park, although it remains unclear how species interactions will modify this expectation.

AB Spring phenophases such as the beginning of leaf unfolding, measured in the Irish gardens of the International Phenological Garden (IPG) network, indicate an earlier spring occurrence hence a longer growing season. However, these measurements are limited to selected species of trees at a few point locations in the southern half of the country. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology, based on satellite remote sensing, to measure the vegetation start of season (SOS) across the whole island of Ireland on an annual basis, complementary to existing ground-based methods.
   The SOS metric was extracted for each year in a 7-year time series of 10-day composited, 1.2 km reduced resolution MERIS Global Vegetation Index (MGVI) data from 2003 to 2009, based on curve fitting, using the time series analysis software, TIMESAT. Spatio-temporal variability in the SOS was detected across the island on an annual basis and highlighted in a series of anomaly images showing variation from the 7-year mean SOS. The 2006 SOS was late across the island while there were strong geographical gradients to the SOS anomalies in 2009 when it occurred later in the south and earlier in the north. There was a mix of early and late anomaly values throughout the country in the other years.
   Qualitatively, the spatial patterns in the timing of the SOS were related to the distribution of landcover types as indicated by the CORINE Land Cover map (CLC). Three statistically separable groups of CLC classes were derived from differences in the SOS, namely agricultural and forest land cover types, peat bogs, and natural and semi-natural vegetation types. These groups demonstrated that vegetation in cultivated areas like pastures has a significantly earlier SOS than in areas of unmanaged vegetation such as peat bogs. An initial climate analysis indicated that an anomalously cold winter and spring in 2005/2006 delayed the 2006 SOS countrywide; while a cold winter followed by a mild spring in 2009 caused considerable spatial variability in the 2009 SOS across the country, ranging from later SOS in the south to early SOS in the north.
   This study has demonstrated the utility of 10-day MGVI composites for derivation of an SOS metric which can be used as an indicator of spatial variability in vegetation seasonality and has highlighted how SOS varies according to landcover type. The availability of longer time series in the future will allow more focused studies on the sensitivity of the SOS metric to changes in climate as well as short term weather events.

AB Erosion and suspended sediment transport dynamics were studied in the open water season (April-November) of three consecutive years in a drained peatland forest. Discharge and suspended solids were monitored continuously and sediment properties surveyed with individual samples. Sediment transport dynamics were studied using statistical methods and plotted as hysteresis, duration and effective discharge plots. Sediment rating curves for averaged daily data for months and total season were established to seek empirical sediment yield predictive model(s). The discharge patterns in the study catchment were dominated by peak runoff events resulting from snowmelt and intensive rainfall. Fluctuations in suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were associated with discharge fluctuations. Sediment transport varied markedly during the study months and years, with organic sediment playing an important role. The present study demonstrates sediment transport processes and reveals the underlying mechanics operating in forested peatland areas. These include inter-storm sediment storage, bank collapse and the role of peak runoff rate on erosion in peak flow events. Sediment availability in drainage network channels also played a major role in erosion and SSC. The results indicate that summer runoff peaks can be a dominant element controlling annual sediment yield, partly contradicting previous studies in drained peatland areas identifying spring snowmelt as the dominant element. Sediment yield prediction with the empirical sediment-transport rating curve gave good regressions for some data, but simple regression models were not adequate to provide accurate annual predictions.

AB Artic and subarctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change with a faster warming compared to other latitudes. Vegetation is changing but its role on the biogeochemical cycling is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the distribution of trace elements in subarctic soils from different land covers at Abisko, northern Sweden: grassland, moor, broad-leaved forest, and peat bog. Using various multivariate analysis approaches, results indicated a spatial heterogeneity with a strong influence of soil horizon classes considered: lithogenic elements (e.g., Al, Cr, Ti) were accumulated in mineral horizon classes and surface process-influenced elements (e.g., Cd, Cu, Se) in organic horizon classes. Atmospheric influences included contamination by both local mines (e.g., Cu, Fe, Ni) and regional or long-range atmospheric transport (e.g.. Cd, Pb, Zn). A non-negative matrix factorization was used to estimate, for each element, the contribution of various sources identified. For the first time, a comparison between geochemical and ecological data was performed to evaluate the influence of vegetation on element distribution. Apart from soil pH that could control dynamics of As, Cu, and Se, two vegetation classes were reported to be correlated to geochemical factors: forbs and shrubs/dwarf shrubs probably due to their annual vs. perennial activities, respectively. Since these are considered as the main vegetation classes that quickly evolve with climate change, we expect to see modifications in trace element biogeochemical cycling in the future.

AB Palaeovegetation reconstructions, particularly of fossil forests, are generally restricted to scant information on the taxonomic composition, relative abundance of individual taxa, or on tree density. We have developed new techniques for the analysis of stump horizons that result in a relatively detailed three-dimensional reconstruction of ancient forests. In addition, a rough estimate of their above-ground standing biomass can be calculated. These techniques are applied to an in-situ Miocene peat forest preserved in the Lower Rhine Embayment, northwestern Germany. In a study area of 2500 m(2), 476 stumps were mapped and used in the forest reconstruction. Additionally, pollen samples and leaf remains have been analysed. The peat forest consists primarily of conifers (in particular Taxodiaceae and Pinaceae) with Sciadopitys being the most common genus. The only angiosperms in the wood flora were palms, but in the pollen flora, evidence for the Myricaceae, Mastixiaceae, Ericaceae and a few other angiosperms is also present. The forest was relatively dense with 1904 trees/ha and a basal area of 164 m(2). Mean trunk diameter was 28 cm, while mean tree height is calculated to have been 9.9 m. Height, diameter and density distribution are illustrated using contour and three-dimensional surface plots. Estimated above ground biomass is 750 t/ha, but this value also includes dead or partly dead trees. This peat forest does not closely compare with previous reconstructions of Miocene peat forests. Its three dimensional structure and biomass differ from those of modern bald cypress swamps.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in forest floors and in mineral and peat forest soils were estimated at the European scale. The assessment was based on measured C concentration, bulk density, coarse fragments and effective soil depth data originating from 4914 plots in 22 EU countries belonging to the UN/ECE ICP Forests 16 x 16 km Level I network. Plots were sampled and analysed according to harmonized methods during the 2nd European Forest Soil Condition Survey. Using continuous carbon density depth functions, we estimated SOC stocks to 30-cm and 1-m depth, and stratified these stocks according to 22 WRB Reference Soil Groups (RSGs) and 8 humus forms to provide European scale benchmark values. Average SOC stocks amounted to 22.1 t C ha(-1) in forest floors, 108 t C ha(-1) in mineral soils and 578 t C ha(-1) in peat soils, to 1 m depth. Relative to 1-m stocks, the vertical SOC distribution confirmed global patterns reported for forest soils: similar to 50% of SOC was stored in the upper 20 cm, and similar to 55-65% in the upper 30 cm of soil. Assuming 163 Mha of European forest cover and by using various scaling up procedures, we estimated total stocks at 3.50-3.94 Gt C in forest floors and 21.4-22.7 Gt C in mineral and peat soils down to 1-m, which is similar to 40% more than commonly published. The most useful predictors and stratifiers for C stocks were humus form and tree species for the forest floor, RSG for mineral soils and parent material for peat soils.
   This dataset will be further explored, predominantly for validation of soil C models, resampling and comparison with legacy and future forest SOC inventories. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Today we see an increased use of wetlands for N removal in agricultural catchments. Since the most important process for nitrate (NO3-) removal, denitrification, requires organic C, different soils could be expected to be differently suited for wetland construction. In this study, we evaluate the importance of soil organic C and the effects of added dissolved organic C on N transformations in existing and proposed wetlands. We used N-15-labeled NO3- to study N transformations in soil columns from five locations (a forest peaty soil, a field peaty soil, a silt loam, a loam, and a sandy loam). All five soils removed NO3- at substantial rates (13-73% of the load). The held peaty soil had highest denitrification rate (11 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), while sandy loam soil had the lowest rate (2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Dissolved organic C did not seem to limit N removal in the soils, as glucose additions affected N turnover only slightly. The forest peat soil differed from the others by exhibiting low nitrification, and relatively high production of nitrite (NO2-), probably a result of low pH, Nitrate removal in the field peat soil and the sandy loam soil was counteracted by production of ammonium (NH4+) and dissolved organic N, causing net N release. Although there was a positive relationship between soil organic matter and NO3- consumption, we conclude that all soils were suited for N removal. The lack of response to glucose additions indicate that there was no short-term lack of electron donor in any of the soils, including the sandy loam soil.

AB Drainage-induced diffuse pollution and erosion are key water quality problems in peatland forestry. A major part of the pollutant load is transported during peak runoff periods after snowmelt or intense rainfall. This study investigated possibilities to increase retention time of runoff waters in drained peatland catchments on purpose to diminish peak runoff and improve settling conditions of suspended solids (SS). To create retention, a peak runoff control (PRC) structure was developed and its functioning, dimensioning and practical applications were studied in five partly or completely ditch-drained catchments in Central Finland. The method reduced runoff peaks by 10-73% or 5.07-57.631(-1) s(-1) km(-2), and functioned especially well during largest runoff peaks. The effectiveness of the PRC method depended on (i) catchment topography (slope) and available detention volume, (ii) dimensioning and location of the PRC structure, and (iii) runoff rates. The PRC structure is cheap and can easily be created with forest drainage machinery during the ditching and ditch network maintenance operations. Different issues relating to the structural design, water quality benefits, and impacts on forestry are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The soil atmosphere in forested peat soils with depths of 0.8-1.2 m was monitored regularly for 3 years. Samples from gas equilibration chambers were analysed for N2, O2, CO2, CH4, N2O and Ne by gas chromatography.
   Short spring periods with simultaneous and rapid O2 decrease/CO2 increase were the characteristics features at a soil depth of 5 cm. They were the effects of perched water tables on frozen soil layers. The soil atmosphere composition at a depth of 20 cm was particularly variable in the poorly drained sites, where this soil depth was close to the alternating level of the groundwater. At a depth of 50 cm, CO2 and CH4 had minimum concentrations in early or mid-summer and maximum concentrations in the late autumn or early winter. The reverse pattern for O2 was indicated, but was less clear.
   In individual profiles and on average, O2 decreased and CO2 increased with increasing depth, except during some transient periods in the spring.
   Medium (H6) humified, inadequately drained Sphagnum peat differed from well humified (H8), well-drained wood peat, in that it contained considerable concentrations of CH4. Only very small concentrations were occasionally found in the humified wood peat and they did not increase when the groundwater level rose after clearfelling.
   The groundwater level rose after clearfelling on both types of peat. Concentrations of O2 decreased and CO2 increased in the topsoil, particularly in the medium humified and insufficiently drained Sphagnum peat.
   The soil atmospheres, as represented by mean concentrations and extreme concentrations at three depths during the growing season, were significantly different on all plots, including the parallel clearfelled and forested plots.

AB In western Finland, acid leaching to watercourses is mainly due to drainage of acid sulphate (AS) soils. This study examined how different land-use and land-cover types affect water acidity in the northwestern coastal region of Finland, which has abundant drained AS soils and peatlands. Sampling conducted in different hydrological conditions in studied river basins revealed two different catchment types: catchments dominated by drained forested peatlands and catchments used by agriculture. Low pH and high electric conductivity (EC) were typical in rivers affected by agriculture. In rivers dominated by forested peatlands and wetlands, EC was considerably lower. During spring and autumn high runoff events, water quality was poor and showed large spatial variation. Thus it is important to ensure that in river basin status assessment, sampling is carried out in different hydrological situations and in also water from some tributaries is sampled.

AB We developed and applied a computational model for simulating unsteady flow in a drainage network of a boreal forested peatland site. The input to the model was the hourly runoff produced by a hydrological model. The simulations of the flow in the ditch network were performed using an iterative procedure for solving the Saint-Venant equations that govern the flow in each of the network channels. These equations were solved separately for each ditch branch, and the flow depths at the junctions were corrected using the method of characteristics. The model was applied to the drainage network of a peatland catchment in Eastern Finland over a period of 15 months. Because flow resistance in the ditches depended strongly on flow conditions, flow resistance (Manning's n) was introduced as a function of discharge. The model was calibrated and validated against field data and the simulation results were further applied to assess erosion risk. The highest risk of erosion occurred during long lasting flows induced by snowmelt at ditch sections with a steep slope and a large upstream area. These model results can aid in the design and siting of water protection measures within the drained area.

AB We studied the effect of soil temperature on nutrient allocation and mycorrhizal development in seedlings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) during the first 9 weeks of the growing season. One-year-old seedlings were grown in Carex-peat from a drained and forested peatland at soil temperatures of 5, 9, 13 and 17 degreesC under controlled environmental conditions. Fourteen seedlings from each temperature treatment were harvested at intervals of three weeks and the current and previous year's parts of the roots, stems and needles were separated. Mineral nutrient and Al contents in all plant parts were determined and the tips and mycorrhizas of the new roots were counted. Microbial biomass C and N in the growth medium were determined at the end of the experiment. None of the elements studied, except Fe, were taken up from the soil by the seedlings during the first three weeks. Thereafter, the contents of all the elements increased at all soil temperatures except 5 degreesC. Element concentrations in needles, stems and roots increased with soil temperature. Higher soil temperature greatly increased the number of root tips and mycorrhizas, and the numbers of mycorrhizas increased more than did the length of new roots. Cenococcum geophilum was relatively more abundant at lower soil temperatures (5 and 9 degreesC) than at higher ones (13 and 17 degreesC). A trend was observed for decreased microbial biomass C and N in the peat soil at higher soil temperatures at the end of the experiment.

AB The fauna of the Solovetslcy Archipelago represents an extremely impoverished and reduced variant of the continental northern boreal one. The level of its impoverishment roughly corresponds to a latitudinal shift by one or two nature subzones, that is, by the number of species it is comparable to mainland local faunas of the forested tundra or hypoarctic tundra. Only very few arctic species, let alone more southern (nemoral) faunal elements occur on the archipelago. The compositions of the basic fauna groups and their dominant species are determined thereby three main factors: a wide distribution of intrazonal ecosystems (coastal heathlands and grasslands, birch sparse forests, peat bogs), a limited living space and extreme climatic conditions. Among the dominants are eurytopic polyzonal and, to a lesser degree, hypoarctic species. The isolation of Solovetsky Islands is no significant barrier to the dispersal of numerous animal species, but these islands form the highly specific environment that strongly prevents the invasion of new species lacking relevant preadaptations to local habitat and climatic conditions. The effect of "density compensation" in response to a lower taxonomic diversity is revealed in the archipelago in numerous taxonomic groups, thereby the mass species spectrum can vary considerably with time depending on climatic conditions. The Solovetsky Islands' fauna is originally continental in origin, having mainly been formed in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (similar to 9-10 ka before present).

AB We determined the fluxes of total mercury (HgT), total organic carbon (TOC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from five upland/peatland watersheds at the watershed outlet. The difference between TOC and DOC was defined as particulate OC(POC), Concentrations of HgT showed moderate to strong relationships with POC (R-2 = 0.77) when all watersheds were grouped, Although POC only accounts for 10 to 20% of the OC transported, we estimate that it is associated with 52 to 80% of the HgT transported from the five watersheds. Total transport of HgT from the watersheds ranged from 0.70 to 2.82 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) Watershed geometry and hydrology play important roles in determining the influence of OC on HgT transport in forested watersheds. Watershed properties such as peatland area have considerable promise as predictors for estimating HgT transport in streams draining forested watersheds in the Great Lakes States.

AB A substantial amount of below-ground carbon (C) is suggested to be associated with fungi, which may significantly affect the soil C balance in forested ecosystems. Ergosterol from in-growth mesh bags and litterbags was used to estimate fungal biomass production and community composition in drained peatland forests with differing fertility. Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) biomass production was generally higher in the nutrient-poor site, increased with deeper water table level and decreased along the length of the recovery time. EMM biomass production was of the same magnitude as in mineral-soil forests. Saprotrophic fungal biomass production was higher in the nutrient-rich site. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungal community composition changed according to site fertility and water table level. ECM fungal community composition with different exploration types may explain the differences in fungal biomass production between peatland forests. Melanin-rich Hyaloscypha may indicate decreased turnover of biomass in nutrient-rich young peatland forest. Genera Lactarius and Laccaria may be important in nutrient rich and Piloderma in the nutrient-poor conditions, respectively. Furthermore, Paxillus involutus and Cortinarius sp. may be important generalists in all sites and responsible for EMM biomass production during the first summer months. Saprotrophs showed a functionally more diverse fungal community in the nutrient-rich site.

AB Centennial-to-millennial temperature records of the past provide a context for the interpretation of current and future changes in climate. Quaternary climates have been relatively well studied in north-east North America and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean over the last decades, and new research methods have been developed to improve reconstructions. We present newly inferred reconstructions of sea surface temperature for the north-western Atlantic region, together with a compilation of published temperature records. The database thus comprises a total of 86 records from both marine and terrestrial sites, including lakes, peatlands, ice and tree rings, each covering at least part of the Holocene. For each record, we present details on seasons covered, chronologies and information on radiocarbon dates and analytical time steps. The 86 records contain a total of 154 reconstructions of temperature and temperature-related variables. Main proxies include pollen and dinocysts, while summer was the season for which the highest number of reconstructions were available. Many records covered most of the Holocene, but many dinocyst records did not extend to the surface, due to sediment mixing, and dendroclimate records were limited to the last millennium. The database allows for the exploration of linkages between sea ice and climate and may be used in conjunction with other palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental records, such as wildfire records and peatland dynamics. This inventory may also aid the identification of gaps in the geographic distribution of past temperature records thus guiding future research efforts.

AB More reliable assessments of nutrient export to surface waters and the Baltic Sea are required to achieve good ecological status of all water bodies. Previous nutrient export estimates have recently been questioned since they did not include the long-term impacts of drainage for forestry. We made new estimates of the total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and total organic carbon (TOC) export from forests to surface waters at different spatial scales in Finland. This was done by formulating statistical equations between streamwater concentrations and climate, soil, forest management and runoff variables and spatial data on catchment characteristics. The equations were based on a large, long-term runoff and streamwater quality dataset, which was collected from 28 pristine and 61 managed boreal forest catchments located around Finland. We found that the concentrations increased with temperature sum (TS), i.e. from north to south. Nitrogen, P and TOC concentrations increased with the proportion of drained areas in the catchment; those of N and TOC also increased with the proportion of peatlands. In contrast, with the increasing concentrations of N and TOC with time, P concentrations showed a decreasing trend over the last few decades. According to our estimates, altogether 47,300 Mg of N, 1780 Mg of P and 1814 Gg of TOC is transported from forest areas to surface waters in Finland. Forest management contributes 17% of the N export, 35% of the P export and 12% of the TOC export. Our new forest management export estimates for N and P are more than two times higher than the old estimates used by the environment authorities. The differences may be explained by the long-term impact of forest drainage. The spatial results indicate that peatland forests are hotspots for N, P and TOC export, especially in the river basins draining to the Gulf of Bothnia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lowering of the water table resulting from peatland drainage may dramatically alter C and N cycling in peatland ecosystems, which contain one-third of the total terrestrial C. In this study, tree annual ring width and C (delta C-13) and N (delta N-15) isotope ratios in soil and plant tissues ( tree foliage, growth rings, and understory foliage) in a black spruce-tamarack ( Picea mariana-Larix laricina) mixed-wood forest were examined to study the effects of drainage on tree growth and C and N dynamics in a minerotrophic peatland in west-central Alberta, Canada. Drainage increased the delta N-15 of soil NH4+ from a range of +0.6 parts per thousand to +2.9 parts per thousand to a range of +4.6 parts per thousand to +7.0 parts per thousand most likely through increased nitrification following enhanced mineralization. Plant uptake of N-15-enriched NH4+ in the drained treatment resulted in higher plant delta N-15 (+0.8 parts per thousand to +1.8 parts per thousand in the drained plots and -3.9 parts per thousand to -5.4 parts per thousand in the undrained plots), and deposition of litterfall N enriched with N-15 increased the delta N-15 of total soil N in the surface layer in the drained (+2.9 parts per thousand) as compared with that in the undrained plots ( +0.6 parts per thousand). The effect of drainage on foliar delta C-13 was species-specicfic, i.e., only tamarack showed a considerably less negative foliar delta C-13 in the drained (-28.1 parts per thousand) than in the undrained plots (-29.1 parts per thousand), indicating improved water use efficiency (WUE) by drainage. Tree ring area increments were significantly increased following drainage, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 in tree growth rings of both species showed responses to drainage retrospectively. Tree-ring delta C-13 data suggested that drainage improved WUE of both species, with a greater and more prolonged response in tamarack than in black spruce. Our results indicate that drainage caused the studied minerotrophic peatland to become a more open ecosystem in terms of C and N cycling and loss. The effects of forested peatland drainage or drying on C and N balances deserve further research in order to better understand their roles in future global change.

AB This paper presents a landscape-ecological analysis of Ladoga Region, a 30 000 km(2) territory around Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe. The Region includes the contact zone between the crystalline bedrock of Baltic Shield and the sedimentary rocks of the East European plain, and the transition from Boreonemoral to Southern Boreal (Taiga) forest vegetation; it is characterized by abundance of lakes. The Region is divided into 17 discrete landscape areas that are classified in 6 groups.
   The author uses the landscape-dynamical approach to the analysis of recent (from 2-3 to 40-50 yr) environmental changes in the region, caused by human activities: forest felling, fires, peat excavation, agriculture, recreational development etc. The following processes are observed: vegetation successions after clearcutting and selective logging, effects of forest fires on the spreading and conservation of pine forests; consequences of peatland drainage; landscape effects of collective farming and gardening; forest succession from pine and deciduous tree dominance towards spruce dominance (observable in all landscape regions); natural vegetation succession on former Finnish arable lands (two types of scenarios: forest succession or development of sedge meadows).

AB This study addressed how microsite conditions may affect tree regeneration in a forested minerotrophic peatland in central New York. The objectives were to (i) determine the microsite associations, especially the bryophyte component, of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Thuja occidentalis L., Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr., and Pinus strobus L. seedlings and (ii) determine if different bryophyte substrates affect germination of A. balsamea, Thuja occidentalis, and P. strobus, and first-year survival of A. balsamea and P. strobus. Principal components analysis revealed that seedling groups overlap in habitat, but separate from random sites based on a second axis related to microtopography. Germination experiments indicate that A. balsamea and P. strobus germinate better on Hypnum imponens than on Hylocomium splendens and Sphagnum girgensohnii in the field, but not in the greenhouse. First-year survival differed little on the different mosses.

AB In the future management and sustainable use of boreal forests, it is crucial to consider the rate and strength of tree responses to an elevated water table and the concurrent oxygen limitations, especially in peatlands. We examined the response dynamics of 7-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings to a 5-week waterlogging (WL) treatment during a growing season in a root lab (dasotron) experiment. WL took place after shoot elongation had ended but while growth of the trunk diameter was still in progress. Trunk sap flow and needle water potential started to decrease immediately after the onset of WL, while the first signs in needle gas exchange - seen as decreases in the potential efficiency of photosystem II, the rates of light-saturated net assimilation and transpiration, and increased needle respiration-were observed after 3 weeks of WL. New needles responded to WL more strongly than the old ones. Drainage with consequent re-oxygenation of the soil caused a further decrease in sap flow. We conclude that through negative feedback on transpiration and net photosynthesis, WL during the growing season is harmful for Scots pine, leading to potential growth losses or even dying of trees within a few weeks of WL.

AB Continuous cover management on peatland forests has gained interest in recent years, in part because the tree biomass with significant evapotranspiration capacity retained in selection cuttings could be used as a tool to optimize the site water table level (WTL) from both tree growth and environmental perspectives. This study reports WTL responses from six field trials established on fertile Norway spruce-dominated drained peatland forests across Finland. At each site, replicates of different intensity selection cuttings (removing 17-74% of the stand basal area) or clear-cut in parallel with intact control stands were established and monitored for the WTL for 2-5 postharvest years. The observed WTL rose after selection cuttings, and the response increased with harvest intensity and depended on the reference WTL; that is, larger responses were found during dry summers or in more southern location. Selection cuttings removing about 50% of the stand basal area raised the WTL typically by 15-40%. Using a process-based ecohydrological model, tested against data from the field trials, we show that the role of tree stand in controlling the WTL clearly decreases along the latitudinal climate gradient in Finland. This suggests that the potential of controlling WTL using selection cuttings is more prominent in southern than in northern Finland. Predictions with future climate (2070-2099) further indicated a general decrease of the WTL and that the importance of the tree stand in controlling the WTL will increase, especially in northern Finland. The results overall thus suggest that selection cuttings can be used as a tool to control the WTL in boreal drained peatland forests, and the potential is likely to increase in future climate.

AB Glacial recession is a major process in terrestrial ecosystems of the world and an obvious result of global warming Here we describe the alpine (above tree line) and subalpine forested and wetland/peatland vegetation chronosequences in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska We derived the results from three products (1) 4 deglaciation map of 50,000-, 13,000, and 1 to 246-year-old (Neoglacial) surfaces, (2) a landcover map, and (3) a plant association classification For the alpine chronosequence, Neoglactal surfaces are dominated by the tall shrub (>1 5 m) (Alnus and Salix), dwarf shrub (<0 1 m) (Salix and Dryas), and mesic herbaceous landcover classes These landcover classes also dominate the 13,000- and 50,000-year-old surfaces but dwarf shrub dominance changes to ericaceous The subalpine forested chronosequence consists of Populus balsamifera ssp trichocarpa and Picea sitchensis classes dominating the mid- and late seral Neoglacial surfaces, then Tsuga mertensiana and Picea sitchensis classes dominating the 13,000- and 50,000-year-old surfaces Wetlands/peatlands are rare on the Neoglacial and 13,000-year-old surfaces but common on the 50,000-year-old surface Alnus is rare on the 50,000-year-old surface yet common on the 13,000-year-old surface and, we speculate, is a relict from the end of the Pleistocene

AB Sediment surface samples (0-2 cm) from 66 sites, and longer cores (up to 540 cm) from 9 sites in the estuary of the river Kyronjoki, Western Finland, were analysed for organic content, P, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn.  One core was dated on the basis of annual laminations.
   Chemical analyses of the cores showed that organic matter and heavy metal content have increased in recent decades.  The heavy metal content was clearly lower than in areas polluted by industry.  The sedimentation rate in the delta increased between the 1930s and 1950.  It decreased in the 1960s, and has been below 1930s levels since 1970.  The sedimentation rates of organic matter were fairly stable all through the period measured, even though the organic content increased.
   The increase in organic matter and the heavy metal content of the sediment in recent decades is evidently due to the increased intensity of agriculture, forestry and peat harvesting in the drainage basin.  Drainage of peatlands in particular has increased erosion and the organic sediment load of the river.  Reservoir building after 1970 has decreased the sedimentation rates in the delta.

AB The characteristic features of airspace hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) are considered in order to develop classification techniques for relevant images. Currently available approaches to constructing classifiers (computational procedures) are described for recognizing natural and anthropogenic objects in hyperspectral images. We confirm that the methods under development are effective enough with the reduced dimensionality of the feature space of original spectra and the decreased sample volumes in supervising procedures for the selected object classes. Data from joint hyperspectral and aerial photography provide examples of the spectral distributions smoke of different intensities from forest and peat fires in the presence and absence of fire sources, for the smoke coverage of water surfaces, and for the forest vegetation without ignition sources within a selected area. The results obtained in the supervising procedures are used for pattern recognition and scene analysis in airborne images obtained for the test areas during forest-fire season.

AB Spring snowmelt in the arctic and boreal regions represents the most significant event in the hydrological year. We measured concentrations and fluxes of different carbon species in 2 small contrasting (control v drained) forested peatland catchments in E. Finland between April and June 2008 and compared these to long-term annual fluxes. Measurements were made using a combination of continuous sensors (CO2, temperature, pH, discharge) and routine spot sampling (DOC, POC, DIC, CO2, CH4, N2O). The highest concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in streamwater were observed under low flow conditions before the spring flood event, reflecting accumulation and downstream release of gaseous C at the end of the winter period. Over the length of the study mean CH4 concentrations were 10x higher in the drained site. The snowmelt event was associated with a dilution of DOC and CO2, with the drained catchment showing a much flashier hydrological response compared to the control site, and post-event, a slower recovery in DOC and CO2 concentrations. Fluxes of all carbon species during the snowmelt event were significant and represented 37-45% of the annual flux. This highlights the challenge of quantifying aquatic C fluxes in areas with large temporal variability and suggests that inability to "capture" the spring snowmelt event may lead to under-estimation of C fluxes in northern regions.

AB A Middle Pennsylvanian tuff bed (the Belka bed) in the roof of the Lower Radnice Coal bears To peat-forming vegetation preserved in growth position. This vegetation has been studied in detail at the 12 hectares large Oval coal deposit in the southern part of the Radnice Basin. Documentation of the fossil record in six excavations and that previously collected in the former opencast mine allowed for a detailed reconstruction of the local peat-forming lepidodendrid-cordaitalean forest structured into well-developed stories. It consists of about 33 species, which colonized the occasionally flooded planar peat swamp precursor of the Lower Radnice Coal. The canopy story of this vegetation was dominated by Lepidodendron (Paralycopodites) simile, L lycopodioides, Lepidophloios acerosus and Cordaites borassifolius. They formed a relatively dense canopy, locally interrupted with significant gaps allowing development of a rich groundcover that together with liana-like plants represents the most diverse part of the forest. A less diverse understory composed of calamites, medullosan pteridosperms and Psaronius tree ferns displays a patchy distribution pattern presumably related to density of the canopy. The minimal area that sufficiently represents the pattern of this forest phytocoenosis is estimated to be about 200 m(2), although lower stories are well represented even within much smaller areas of about 60 m(2). Slight heterogeneity in the population density of dominant taxa (Cordaites vs. lepidodendrid lycopsids) was documented across the Oval coal deposit. The fossil record of the Balka tuff bed also indicates that the coal-forest colonizing the peat swamp prior the generation of forest killed by volcanic ash fall, was destroyed, presumably due to long-lasting flooding and thus suggests that catastrophic events were probably a relatively common part of the evolution of peat-forming Pennsylvanian successions.

AB We report tenth-year growth and yield improvements in the Wally Creek area, an experimental, systematic drainage project established in 1984 and fertilized in 1986, in a forested Ontario peatland. We analyzed and compared results for dominant-codominant and intermediate black spruce in two site types. Response of trees to NPK-fertilization was more immediate than to drainage. Response to drainage took about five to seven years, whereas response to fertilization occurred earlier, from three to five years. Some indication of an asymmetric response, with larger trees experiencing higher growth increases, was observed for the OG 11 (Ledum) site type, while yield increases were potentially higher in the OG 12 (Alnus herb-poor) site type. Drainage was most effective in combination with fertilization. Consistent for both site types were increases in phosphorus associated with fertilization. The Wally Creek project is a benchmark in the analysis of growth and yield response from intensive peatland silviculture.

AB Nearly all Hg in vegetation is derived directly from the atmosphere. Mass of Hg in forest vegetation (roughly 0.1 mg m(-2)) is about an order of magnitude smaller than that in the forest floor (1 mg m(-2)) and two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the mineral soil (10 mg m(-2)). Mass of Hg in peat (20 mg m(-2)) is greater than the sum of that in mineral soil and the forest floor; wetlands usually sequester more Hg than associated uplands. The strong relationship of Hg to organic matter, associated with binding by reduced S groups, is fundamental to understanding Hg distribution and behavior in terrestrial systems. The stoichiometry of the Hg-C relationship varies; Hg-S relationships, though less variable, are not constant. Because of the Hg-organic matter link, landscape conditions that lead to differential soil organic matter accumulation are likely to lead to differential Hg accumulation. The ratio of methylmercury (MeHg) to total Hg is generally low in both vegetation (near 1.5%) and soil (< 1%), but areas of poorly drained soils and wetlands are sites of MeHg production. The annual emission of anthropic Hg from the 48;contiguous states of the USA (144 Mg) is two orders of magnitude less than the pool of Hg in forests of those states (30 300 Mg). Peattands, less than 2% of total land area, sequester more than 20 times annual emissions (2930 Mg). If global climate change affects C storage it will indirectly affect Hg storage, having a major effect on the balance between emissions and sequestration and on the global Hg cycle.

AB Combustion of biofuel mixtures for heat and power production is often combined with ash related operational problems. Their reliable prediction is therefore essential in order to improve boiler performance and availability. In this work, an ash behavior prediction tool based on computational fluid dynamics and advanced fuel analysis is used to predict the ash deposition tendencies in a 295 MW(th) bubbling fluidized bed boiler fired with mixtures of peat and forest residue. The work focuses especially on two new modeling approaches for fuel distribution and bubbling bed. The overall combustion and deposition prediction results agree well with conditions in a real boiler. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4001798]

The PAH accumulation features in the soils of three reserved areas of forest, steppe, and peat fires were revealed. The distribution features of the PAHs resulting from the anthropogenic pyrogenic processes (the household combustion of wood and the inflammation of coal dumps) in soils were established. The differences in the qualitative composition of the PAHs arriving to the soils from the different pyrogenic sources were shown.

AB Peatland buffer zones with sedimentation ponds are established with the intention of capturing solids and nutrients liberated in drained forestry catchments. As noted in earlier fertilization experiments, added nitrogen (N) immediately increases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in such buffers, and we expected the same to happen after disturbances in the catchment caused by clear-cutting, soil preparation, and ditch cleaning. We measured N2O fluxes, water table dynamics, and vegetation cover from a wetland one year before and two years after the clear-cut and buffer establishment. The low pre-harvest emissions did not increase, but N2O emissions from the sedimentation pond exceeded those from humic lakes with a high N load. In the soil profile, N2O concentrations were high, indicating a potential to produce N2O in the buffer. In one sub-site the soil N2O concentration was below the atmospheric level, which was in accordance with the high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The change in vegetation along the overland flow paths could be explained by a shift in the species thriving in wet conditions but not in those requiring higher nutrient levels. In spite of the apparent potential of soil to produce N2O, the fluxes to the atmosphere remained low. Transformation of N2O to unobserved N-2 may explain some of the low N emissions, together with the low concentrations entering the buffer.

AB Following forest harvest, mechanical site preparation (MSP) is commonly used to regenerate harvested sites. In boreal forested peatlands, however, the effectiveness of MSP to regenerate harvested sites is likely to be hampered by thick organic layers.
   We sought to determine the capability of different MSP techniques to improve growth conditions of planted black spruce seedlings in boreal forested peatlands where closed-crown productive forests could revert to unproductive forested peatlands in the absence of severe soil disturbance.
   The effects of disc scarification, mounding and patch scarification on soil chemistry and seedling growth were contrasted.
   Seedlings of site-prepared plots were 15% taller than those of untreated ones, irrespective of the MSP technique used, likely owing to the greater abundance of exposed mineral soil and mesic substrates created. Mounding and patch scarification were able to expose mineral soil over a greater proportion (> 25% vs. < 10%) of the treated area compared with disc scarification and control, whereas the combined surface area of exposed mineral soil and mesic substrates was higher in every MSP treatments relative to the control (> 57% vs. 41%, respectively). Individual seedling growth was influenced by substrate type and drainage. Seedlings planted in moderately and well-drained mesic substrates and mineral soil were 25% taller than those planted in poorly drained fibric substrates.
   All three MSP techniques were effective because they succeeded in creating high-quality microsites despite thick organic layers.

The stands, selected to cover a maximal range of the potential variation, were all at a stage of development where the first commercial thinnings would be feasible. Differences in the processability of the thinning removals were small. In similar kraft cooking conditions, a 5-unit variation in the kappa number of unbleached pulp was observed among the stands. Stand origin had no effect on pulp bleaching. The wood formed prior to drainage had a higher density, shorter fibers, was slightly slower delignified by cooking, and its yield was slightly lower than that of post-drainage wood. These properties, except for high density, are typical for juvenile wood in general, and at stand level they did not correlate with the proportion of pre-drainage wood. When the variation in fiber and pulp properties was broken down into its components, most of it was derived from tree-level in all the cases. On average, the fiber and pulp properties did not differ from those observed for first-thinning pulpwood from upland sites. Consequently, peatland-grown pulpwood may be mixed with other pulpwood in industrial processes. It would probably be best suited as the raw material for pulps with high bonding requirements, e.g. in the top ply of multi-ply board grades or in some specialty grades.

AB The properties of wood and wood tracheids from trees growing in peatland stands are still insufficiently known. The long-term effects of thinning on wood and tracheid properties of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were investigated in two thinning experiments on peatland sites in central Finland. The two sites were ditched for the first time in 1958 and 1973, and thinning experiments were established in 1987 and 1993, respectively. Thinning increased the basal area increment of the remaining trees by 20 per cent. No differences between the trees that were growing on the thinned plots and those that were growing on the unthinned control plots were found in the latewood proportion, wood density, tracheid diameter, cell wall thickness and tracheid length. Moreover, the wood and tracheid properties did not differ markedly from those of corresponding material originating from mineral soil sites. The results confirm the previous results on mineral soils, which showed that an increasing availability of resources primarily increases the rate of tracheid production but has no major effects on wood and tracheid properties.

AB Ditch network maintenance in drained peatland forests increases sediment load and causes harmful effects on downstream watercourses. The objective of this study was to identify the immediate erosion processes in the ditch network and quantify the impact of the ditch network maintenance on suspended solids (SS) load at the catchment outlet. Ditch level processes were measured by conducting field campaigns and catchment-level responses were obtained by using the paired catchment approach. Measurements were conducted at two nested catchments in Koivupuro, Eastern Finland, where runoff and turbidity were monitored continuously at the catchment outlets and erosion and deposition were measured in selected ditches with a pin meter, erosion pins and sediment collectors. According to the results, the sediment load was at its highest during the first year after the ditch network maintenance and especially high during the first spring snow-melt period. Pin-meter measurements, sediment-collector data and results of ditch-bed erosion pins showed that the erosion was more severe in the ditch cut into mineral subsoil than in the ditch cut into thick peat. The SS load from the whole Koivupuro catchment during the first year after the ditch network maintenance was, depending on the estimation method, 185 or 250 kg treated-ha (1) a (1) (0.56 or 0.75 kg ditch-m (1)), while the net erosion within the ditch network was much higher, 6300 kg treated-ha (1) a (1) (19 kg ditch-m (1)), indicating that suspended solids were deposited before reaching the outlet of the catchment. Compared to the earlier studies which have focused on the catchment-level effects of ditch network maintenance on the SS loads, the current study succeeded in showing erosion processes and their variability within the ditch network and provided information for improving water protection during ditch network maintenance.

AB Novel ecosystem development is occurring within the western boreal forest of Canada due to land reclamation following oil sand surface mining. Sphagnum peat is the primary organic amendment used to reconstruct soil in these novel ecosystems. We hypothesised that ecosystem recovery would be indicated by an increasing similarity in the biomolecular characteristics of novel soil organic matter (SOM) derived from peat to those of natural boreal ecosystems. We evaluated the use of the homologous series of long chain ( >= C-21) n-alkanes with odd/even predominance to monitor the re-establishment of boreal forest on these anthropogenic soils. The lipids were extracted from dominant vegetation inputs and SOM from a series of natural and novel ecosystem reference plots. Twice the concentration of n-alkanes was extracted from natural than from novel ecosystem SOM ( p < 0.01). We observed unique n-alkane signatures for the source vegetation, e. g. peat material was dominated by C-31, and aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) leaves by C-25. The n-alkane distribution differed between the two systems ( p < 0.001) and reflected the dominant vegetation input, i. e. peat or tree species. Our results indicate that further research is required to clarify the influence of vegetation or disturbance on the signature of n-alkanes in SOM; however, the use of n-alkanes as biomarkers of novel ecosystem development is a promising application.

AB In order to understand habitat selection in birds, it is important to know how individuals respond when encountering a variety of habitats during dispersal and must choose between them. However, very few field studies have addressed this question. We compared habitat selection of ortolan buntings Emberiza hortulana before and after dispersal events. In Norway, this species has a patchy distribution and breeds in different open habitats of which the two major ones are botanically distinct: raised peat bogs and forest clear-cuts on dry, sandy soil. There was no evidence that habitat selection of males after natal dispersal was influenced by natal habitat, and 83% changed vegetation type. Habitat selection was random when taking the availability of each vegetation type into account, both at the landscape level and among habitats encountered along likely dispersal routes. Habitat selection after breeding dispersal was not influenced by the habitat of the patch of origin, and 62-71% changed habitat during successive dispersal events. Changing habitat did not seem to affect pairing or breeding success, but decreased with age. Lifetime patterns of habitat selection indicated that the majority (86%) changed habitat one or more times. However, the proportion never changing habitat (14%) was significantly higher than expected if settlement after dispersal was random (5%), suggesting that the majority of males were flexible whereas a minority was habitat conservative. These results provide some of the first systematic evidence based on settlement decisions of individuals that habitat selection of birds can be flexible with regard to vegetation type.

AB Key uncertainties remain in accurately measuring soil respiration, including how the commonly-used technique of collar insertion affects measured soil and root-derived CO2 fluxes. We hypothesized that total soil respiration is frequently under-estimated because soil collar insertions sever surface roots, which coupled with the preferential practice of taking daytime measurements, leads to the autotrophic (root-derived) component frequently being missed. We measured root distribution and soil CO2 efflux in three contrasting ecosystems: a Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plantation, an upland heather-dominated peatland and a lowland sheep-grazed grassland, where we combined shallow surface collars with collars at different soil insertion depths for occasional and continuous hourly flux measurements. Collar insertion by only a few centimetres reduced total soil CO2 efflux in all three ecosystems by an average of 15% but at times by up to 30-50%, and was directly proportional to the quantity of cut fine roots. Most reduction occurred in the shallow-rooted peatland system and least in the deep-rooted grassland. In the forest and grassland, soil temperatures explained most of the deep-collar (largely heterotrophic) variation and did not relate to the root-derived (largely autotrophic) flux component, whilst the opposite was true for the peatland site. For the forest, the autotrophic flux component peaked at night during moist periods and was drought-limited. Mean flux estimates differed between sampling time and insertion depth. Our results suggest strongly that accurate measurement and modelling of soil respiration needs explicitly to consider collar insertion, and the root-derived flux component, with its own temperature sensitivity and potential time-lag effects.

AB The different conceptions of wetlands and their classifications as well as their definitions in Lithuania are represented in this paper. According to existing databases, Lithuanian wetlands are represented by: suo wetlands, peatlands, lentic, lotic, and marine/coastal wetlands. The harmonisation of the Ramsar classification system with the traditional classifications of Lithuanian wetlands is emphasised. The distribution of the distinguishable wetland types is identified. The following Ramsar inland and man-made wetland types are found in Lithuania: non-forested and forested peatlands (9.9% area of Lithuania), seasonal pools on mineral soils and tree-dominated wetlands (>13.92% area of Lithuania), permanent freshwater lakes (1.27% area of Lithuania), permanent freshwater marshes/pools (0.08% area of Lithuania), aquaculture ponds (0.18% area of Lithuania), ponds (0.16% area of Lithuania), water storage areas (0.3% area of Lithuania), excavations (0.04% area of Lithuania), permanent rivers/streams/creeks, seasonal streams/creeks (similar to 0.69% area of Lithuania), canals and drainage ditches (0.11% area of Lithuania), and permanent inland deltas (0.01% area of Lithuania). The authors identified the following types of Ramsar marine/coastal wetlands in Lithuania: permanent shallow marine waters (0.09% area of Lithuania), sand, shingle or pebble shores (94 km marine and 77.89 km lagoon shores), coastal freshwater lagoons (0.52% area of Lithuania).

AB Atmospheric deposition is the most important pathway by which Hg reaches marine ecosystems, where it can be methylated and enter the base of food chain. The deposition, transport and chemical interactions of atmospheric Hg have been simulated over Europe for the year 2013 in the framework of the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project, performing 14 different model sensitivity tests using two high-resolution three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs), varying the anthropogenic emission datasets, atmospheric Br input fields, Hg oxidation schemes and modelling domain boundary condition input. Sensitivity simulation results were compared with observations from 28 monitoring sites in Europe to assess model performance and particularly to analyse the influence of anthropogenic emission speciation and the Hg-(g)(0) atmospheric oxidation mechanism. The contribution of anthropogenic Hg emissions, their speciation and vertical distribution are crucial to the simulated concentration and deposition fields, as is also the choice of Hg-(g)(0) oxidation pathway. The areas most sensitive to changes in Hg emission speciation and the emission vertical distribution are those near major sources, but also the Aegean and the Black seas, the English Channel, the Skagerrak Strait and the northern German coast. Considerable influence was found also evident over the Mediterranean, the North Sea and Baltic Sea and some influence is seen over continental Europe, while this difference is least over the north-western part of the modelling domain, which includes the Norwegian Sea and Iceland. The Br oxidation pathway produces more Hg-(g)(II) in the lower model levels, but overall wet deposition is lower in comparison to the simulations which employ an O-3/OH oxidation mechanism. The necessity to perform continuous measurements of speciated Hg and to investigate the local impacts of Hg emissions and deposition, as well as interactions dependent on land use and vegetation, forests, peat bogs, etc., is highlighted in this study.

AB In an unusual combined nested and paired catchment experiment in northern England, the 1.5-km(2) Coalbum catchment (90% mature plantation forest with a dense drainage ditch network) is paired with the 1.4-km(2) Flothers catchment (64% peat grassland), both being nested within the 6.9-km(2) Throssburn mixed forest and peat grassland catchment. In only the second such UK quantification, a 100% forest cover reduces annual runoff relative to a 100% grassland cover by 24%. The study provides rare field (as opposed to model) evidence showing that the impact of land use on flood peaks is moderated by catchment saturation and by extreme rainfall. Flood frequency curves differ according to land use at the smaller return periods but the data are not sufficient to confirm that the pattern extends to the highest floods. Against conventional expectation, flood peaks tend to be larger and flashier in the forest catchment, apparently the consequence of the forest ditching. Springtime monthly runoff/rainfall ratios in the peat grassland catchment may reach 100%, representing a seasonal sponge effect which is eliminated from the forest catchment through the effects of the ditches. Combination of the paired and nested catchments provides a highly unusual opportunity to show that, at the annual scale, the integrated catchment response can be obtained by combining the responses of the separate land covers according to the proportions of the catchment that they occupy, an assumption widely made but rarely, if ever, tested.

AB Usage of potential of drained soils due to the maximum attraction of natural biological sources of nutrients is actual and perspective in solving the problem of organic production, namely the use of organo-mineral bioactive fertilizers, improvement of agrochemical and agrophysical properties of peat soil by attracting a subsoil mineral layer rich in nutrients. The purpose of the research was to develop and define the basic principles of organic farming on dehydrated soils. As a result of studies we conducted during 2013-2015 in the Left bank of Forest Steppe on peat-glued soil for growing of winter rye, the influence of the methods of basic soil cultivation, fertilization on changes in water-physical, biological parameters of soil fertility, infestation of crops, formation of a crop, and the quality of the grain of the studied culture. We established that for preservation and increase of fertility of shallow (45-50 cm) carbonate dewatered peat-glue soils of the Left Bank Forest-steppe it is necessary to carry out plowing plowing on 55 cm with a breeding of peat-shaped mineral rock (gleyed light loam) in the thickness of 8-10 cm. Such technological measure provides the yield of winter rye more than 4.8 t/ha with high indicators of product quality.

AB Nearly 30% of Finland's land area is covered by peatlands. In Northern parts of the country there is a significant amount of low-productive drained peatlands (LPDPs) where the average annual stem volume growth is less than 1 m(3) ha(-1). The re-use of LPDPs has been considered thoroughly since Finnish forest legislation was updated and the forest regeneration prerequisite was removed from LPDPs in January 2014. Currently, forestry is one of the re-use alternatives, thus detailed forest resource information is required for allocating activities. However, current forest inventory practices have not been evaluated for sparse growing stocks (e.g., LPDPs). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the suitability of airborne laser scanning (ALS) for mapping forest inventory attributes in LPDPs. We used ALS data with a density of 0.8 pulses per m(2), 558 field-measured reference plots (500 from productive forests and 58 from LPDPs) and k nearest neighbour (k-NN) estimation. Our main aim was to study the sensitivity of predictions to the number of LPDP reference plots used in the k-NN estimation. When the reference data consisted of 500 plots from productive forest stands, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the prediction accuracy of Lorey's height, basal area and stem volume were 1.4 m, 2.7 m(2) ha(-1) and 13.7 m(3) ha(-1) in LPDPs, respectively. When 30 additional reference plots were allocated to LPDPs, the respective RMSEs were 1.1 m, 1.7 m(2) ha(-1) and 10.0 m(3) ha(-1). Additional reference plot allocation did not affect the predictions in productive forest stands.

AB AimAn understanding of the factors that influence species distributions in heterogeneous landscapes is important when making decisions regarding conservation. Moreover, occupancy probabilities based on detection data can reveal important species-habitat relationships. Accounting for the spatial autocorrelation of detection data increases the statistical validity of occupancy models, but is not often considered. Using novel occupancy modelling that explicitly incorporates detectability and spatial autocorrelation, we assessed the influence of habitat on occupancy patterns of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), moose (Alces alces) and wolves (Canis lupus) across a broad biogeographical extent where fire is the dominant agent of disturbance.
   LocationNorthern Ontario, Canada.
   MethodsWe aerially surveyed 3851 sampling units, each covering 100km(2), for woodland caribou, moose and wolves in February-March in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and visited 1663 units more than once to estimate detectability. We used restricted spatial regression to model occupancy probabilities of each species with respect to habitat factors in two ecozones, accounting for both imperfect detection and lack of independence of sampling units.
   ResultsCovariates influencing species detection varied among ecozones and species. Caribou occupancy was positively related to bogs and negatively related to disturbed areas, while moose occupancy showed opposite responses to these covariates. Wolf occupancy was related to high prey occupancy. Explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in detection data reduced the chance of type I error in occupancy estimates compared with non-spatial models.
   Main conclusionsHabitat relationships and occupancy patterns support the hypothesis that caribou remain spatially segregated from moose to reduce predation risk. The broad scale of analysis indicated changes in species-habitat relationships, suggesting that limiting factors vary across biogeographical gradients. The spatial pattern in caribou occupancy allowed us to identify important areas used by caribou across the region, including the ecotone between fire-driven boreal forests and peatland complexes. The evidence for significant relationships between caribou and land cover, predators and alternate prey underscores the need for careful planning of development and infrastructure in the area.

The harvesting regimes are whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and conventional stem-only harvesting. The harvesting regimes are evaluated under two alternative climate policy contexts. The first alternative is a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, which assumes the carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality of bioenergy and produces substitution benefits, as bioenergy replaces fossil fuels. The second alternative climate policy, a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy, takes into account the fact that bioenergy causes carbon dioxide emissions, producing substitution costs, and that harvested woody biomass affects the ability of a forest to act as a carbon sink. We extend the traditional Faustmann (1849) rotation model to include nutrient load damage, biodiversity benefits, and climate impacts. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish data from a catchment experiment carried out on drained peatland forests. The empirical results show that under a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, whole-tree harvesting with stump removal produces the highest net social benefits. However, if a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy is assumed, the net social benefits are greater under stem-only harvesting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp, a freshwater forested peatland, has accumulated massive amounts of soil carbon since the postglacial period. Logging and draining have severely altered the hydrology and forest composition, leading to drier soils, accelerated oxidation, and vulnerability to disturbance. The once dominant Atlantic white cedar, cypress, and pocosin forest types are now fragmented, resulting in maple-gum forest communities replacing over half the remaining area. In order to determine the effect of environmental variabes on carbon emissions, this study observes 2 years of CO2 and CH4 soil flux, which will also help inform future management decisions. Soil emissions were measured using opaque, non-permanent chambers set into the soil. As soil moisture increased by 1 unit of soil moisture content, CH4 flux increased by 457 mu g CH4-C/m(2)/h. As soil temperature increased by 1 degrees C, CO2 emissions increased by 5109 mu g CO2-C/m(2)/h. The area of Atlantic white cedar in the study boundary has an average yearly flux of 8.6 metric tons (t) of carbon from CH4 and 3270 t of carbon from CO2; maple-gum has an average yearly flux of 923 t of carbon from CH4 and 59,843 t of carbon from CO2; pocosin has an average yearly flux of 431 t of carbon from CH4 and 15,899 t of carbon from CO2. Total Cha(-1)year(-1) ranged from 1845 kg of Cha(-1)year(-1) in maple-gum to 2024 kg Cha(-1)year(-1) for Atlantic white cedar. These results show that soil carbon gas flux depends on soil moisture, temperature and forest type, which are affected by anthropogenic activities.

AB The relationship between host plant predictability and food niche width was tested using monocotyledonous plants (Juncales, Cyperales, Poales) and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha, Hemiptera). Plants with unpredictable dynamics were represented by species in initial phases of secondary succession on drained pond bottoms and predictable plants were studied in such permanent habitats as alpine meadows. wetlands, peat bogs. and forest understories. The average host plant range of leafhoppers was wider in ephemeral than in permanent habitats. The majority of trophic interactions between leafhopper and host plant found in ephemeral habitats involved polyphagous leafhoppers. whereas the opposite pattern, with specialised leathoppers prevalent, prevailed in permanent habitats. The difference between the average host plant range width of leafhoppers in permanent and in ephemeral habitats results from a higher number of polyphagous leafhoppers per plant in the ephemeral habitats; average number of specialists per plant was approximately the same in permanent and ephemeral habitats. Extremely polyphagous leafhoppers feeding on all three orders of plants were collected exclusively from host plants of ephemeral habitats. These species. classified as ''disturbance specialists''. have high host plant searching efficiency and make great demands on host plant quality. An expansion of their host range to permanent plants is restricted by the low nutrient suitability and, possibly, the better anti-herbivore defences of permanent plant species.

AB We measured methane (CH4) exchange rates with automatic chambers at the forest floor of a nutrient-rich drained peatland in 2011-2013. The fen, located in southern Finland, was drained for forestry in 1969 and the tree stand is now a mixture of Scots pine, Norway spruce, and pubescent birch. Our measurement system consisted of six transparent chambers and stainless steel frames, positioned on a number of different field and moss layer compositions. Gas concentrations were measured with an online cavity ring-down spectroscopy gas analyzer. Fluxes were calculated with both linear and exponential regression. The use of linear regression resulted in systematically smaller CH4 fluxes by 10-45% as compared to exponential regression. However, the use of exponential regression with small fluxes (<2.5 mu gCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) typically resulted in anomalously large absolute fluxes and high hour-to-hour deviations. Therefore, we recommend that fluxes are initially calculated with linear regression to determine the threshold for "low" fluxes and that higher fluxes are then recalculated using exponential regression. The exponential flux was clearly affected by the length of the fitting period when this period was <190 s, but stabilized with longer periods. Thus, we also recommend the use of a fitting period of several minutes to stabilize the results and decrease the flux detection limit. There were clear seasonal dynamics in the CH4 flux: the forest floor acted as a CH4 sink particularly from early summer until the end of the year, while in late winter the flux was very small and fluctuated around zero. However, the magnitude of fluxes was relatively small throughout the year, ranging mainly from -130 to +100 mu gCH(4) m(-2) h(-1). CH4 emission peaks were observed occasionally, mostly in summer during heavy rainfall events. Diurnal variation, showing a lower CH4 uptake rate during the daytime, was observed in all of the chambers, mainly in the summer and late spring, particularly in dry conditions. It was attributed more to changes in wind speed than air or soil temperature, which suggest that physical rather than biological phenomena are responsible for the observed variation. The annual net CH4 exchange varied from -104 +/- 30 to -505 +/- 39 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) among the six chambers, with an average of -219 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) over the 2-year measurement period.

AB The article presents analysis of optical and microphysical aerosol properties, and their distribution in atmosphere over Kyiv city using lidar and sun-photometer observation at the beginning of September 2015. This period of time characterized with forest and peat fires nearby and at suburb of Kyiv. Observations were carried out with the CIMEL370 lidar and the sun-photometer of the AERONET Kyiv station located on the roof of the Main astronomical observatory of the NAS of Ukraine. The recently developed GARRLiC (Generalized Aerosol Retrieval from Radiometer and LIDAR Combined Data) algorithm was used for data analysis. It was established that at the beginning of the event (1-2 September) typical atmosphere with insignificant aerosol content was observed. A large amount of combustion products which increase aerosol content in several times has arrived into Kyiv from north-north-west direction starting from evening of 2 September. Range resolved aerosol properties were obtained in the first time for Ukraine region. Comparison with the corresponding values of aerosol properties obtained by the AERONET algorithm is made.

AB Archaeological excavations and environmental archaeological studies over many years in the Shanghai Area have provided a wealth of information for Holocene environmental changes, growth and decline of human settlements and man-land interaction. Distribution of archaeological sites between 7000 and 3000 cal. yr BP indicates a regression process and a southward advance of the coastline in the study area. Temporal and spatial analyses of C-14 dates for archaeological sites, shell ridges, buried trees, and peat suggest that Holocene environmental changes may well have been a major cause of the rise and fall of human settlements and their civilization. A relative sea-level curve of the Shanghai Area was derived from dated shell ridges and peat, and correlates well with the reconstructed sea-level curves of the Yangtze Delta and East China. The development of human settlements was interrupted at least four times in the Shanghai Area, matching four periods of high sea-level, peat accumulation, and increase in shell ridges, after which Neolithic communities moved onto the plain and reclaimed their lowlands for rice cultivation. The Chenier Ridges played an important role in sheltering the Neolithic settlers. The collapse of Liangzhu Culture about 4000 cal. yr BP was followed by the less-developed Maqiao Culture. These studies suggest that extreme environmental and hydrological conditions such as terrestrial inundation caused by sea-level rise and heavy rainfall, contributed to the cessation of paddy exploitation and to the social stress that led to the Liangzhu Culture demise.

CY MAR 08-11, 1994

AB The analyses of 248 samples have revealed that the composition and distribution patterns of sediments within the Albemarle estuarine system (AES) represent a complex interaction between multiple sediment sources, basin morphology and evolution, and associated estuarine processes. Three sediment end-member types are dominant: sand, peat, and organic-rich mud (ORM). Throughout the AES, shallow perimeter platforms and associated sediment-bank shorelines are eroded into Pleistocene units. Shoreline recession supplies sand to the platforms and mud to the central basins; these sediments mix with suspended sediment from the fluvial drainages. Swamp forest-peat and marsh-peat shorelines are actively eroding and supply fine organic detritus to produce the dominant ORM sediment in the central basins. Perimeter platform sands grade into ORM on the platform slope. ORM constitutes about 70% of the benthic habitats within the AES and has an average composition of 76.2% inorganic mud, 13.1% sand, and 10.7% organic matter. The characteristics of ORM greatly affect the benthic community structure, chemical quality of the sediments, and the water quality of the estuary. ORM readily moves in and out of the water column in response to natural and anthropogenic activities, affecting water column turbidity and trace and major element geochemistry. Organic matter and clay minerals in ORM are chemically reactive and interact with the water column to adsorb or release contaminants, nutrients, and gases. Thus, ORM acts as both a sink and source for many different chemical constituents in the water column and plays important, but poorly understood, functions in the physical and chemical dynamics of estuarine ecosystems.

AB The increasing use of wood fuels to replace fossil fuels in energy and heat production results in increasing amounts of waste in the form of ash. Since wood ash contains nutrients that trees need in the right proportions, except for N, it is a potentially excellent forest fertiliser. However, any harmful elements, e.g., heavy metals are also concentrated in the ash, which has raised concern about possible adverse effects that ash fertilisation could induce in the environment. A considerable body of new results has been published on ash fertilisation impacts on, e.g., heavy metal concentrations in berries and mushrooms, ground vegetation, soil microbial processes, greenhouse gas emissions and watercourses. In this review, we synthesise this information to map the environmental benefits and risks related to ash fertilisation. We pay special attention to peatland forests, N-rich ecosystems where ash may induce considerable increases in timber production, but for which a thorough evaluation of environmental impacts has been lacking. The longest monitoring periods currently span more than five decades. In well-targeted sites, ash increases tree production and/or reduces soil acidity for decades. No enrichment of heavy metals in the food webs or leaching of heavy metals to watercourses has been reported. CO2 emissions increase in the longer term (10-50 years), especially from N-rich peat soils. Also, changes in plant community may be so extensive that ash application cannot be recommended where conservation of the original vegetation is required. Immobilisation of heavy metals in soil depends on the neutralising effect of ash on soil acidity. The most crucial question that remains to be answered is how long this effect lasts, and what happens thereafter. Future research should investigate further whether heavy metals may accumulate in plant roots, even if above-ground parts remain unaffected. Finally, the duration of the impact of ash fertilisation on the nutrition of peatland trees, as well as optimal schedules of repeated fertilisations for different rotations, still need to be verified.

ID ASSIMILABLE ORGANIC-CARBON; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM; LAKES
AB The availability of organic carbon is considered the key factor to regulate microbial regrowth in drinking water networks. However, boreal regions (northern Europe, Russia, and North America) contain a large amount of organic carbon in forests and peatlands, Therefore, natural waters (lakes, rivers, and groundwater) in the northern hemisphere generally have a high content of organic carbon. We found that microbial growth in drinking water in Finland is highly regulated not only by organic carbon but also bg the availability of phosphorus. Microbial growth increased up to a phosphate concentration of 10 mu g of PO4-P liter(-1). Inorganic elements other than phosphorus did not affect microbial growth in drinking water. This observation offers novel possibilities to restrict microbial growth in water distribution systems by developing technologies to remove phosphorus efficiently from drinking water.

AB Habitat selection is a hierarchical process that may yield various patterns depending on the scales of investigation. We employed satellite radio-telemetry to examine patterns of habitat selection by female woodland caribou in central Saskatchewan at both coarse (seasonal range) and fine (daily area) scales. At each scale, we converted spatial data describing compositions of available and used habitat to standardised resource selection indices and examined them with multivariate analyses of variance. Seasonal ranges generally showed preferential inclusion of peatlands and black spruce dominated stands relative to recently disturbed stands and early seral stage forests. In all populations, caribou preferred peatlands and black spruce forests to all other habitat types at the daily area scale. In general, these patterns may reveal the effective avoidance of wolves, the primary factor limiting caribou throughout the boreal forest. In three populations where seasonal ranges showed the selective inclusion of either young jack pine stands or clearcuts along with peatlands and black spruce forests, we found a relative avoidance of the clearcuts and young jack Dine stands at the daily area scale. As all caribou populations in the area are thought to be relies of a once more continuous distribution, the seasonal range selection by animals in disturbed areas may better describe historic rather than current habitat selection. We found inter-annual variation in selection at the coarser spatial scale in one population, and inter-seasonal variation in selection at the finer spatial scale in three populations, indicating that the relative grains of the spatial and temporal scales coincide. We were better able to explain the seasonal variations in finer scale selection by considering available forage, a factor less likely than predation to limit woodland caribou populations. The data agree with the theory that the spatial and temporal hierarchy of habitat selection reflects the hierarchy of factors potentially limiting individual fitness.

AB Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GC MS) were applied to lyophilized dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples taken along a small river (Oder river, Harz Mountains, Germany) draining a peatland and an adjacent spruce forest to study sources and processes that determine DOM composition. The FTIR and Py-GC MS data show that the DOM is composed predominantly of lignin derivatives and microbial/degraded carbohydrates, and that the relative proportions of the former decrease relative to the latter as the stream advances from the peatland through the forest. This can be explained by a combination of leaching of more degraded/microbial DOM from the forest soils than from the peatland, and selective co-precipitation with mineral particulate matter from the forest soils, even though increased autochthonous DOM sources (from microbial activity in the stream, for example by algae) may be involved as well. Furthermore, Py-GC MS and THM-GC MS revealed that the DOM froth the peatland outlet inherited the fingerprint of Sphagnum moss (sphagnum acid) which was progressively outweighed by guaiacyl lignin as the Odersprung advances through the coniferous forest, and that the small proportion of suberin derivatives from root-and bark-derived forest vegetation increased downstream. Py-GC MS and FTIR spectroscopy provided comparable proportions of the main biomolecular components of the DOM, whereas the apparent insensitivity of THM-GC MS to microbial carbohydrates and microbial N-containing structures (including chitin) implied bias towards the lignin derivatives. Nevertheless, the structure-resolving capacity of THM-GC MS for the phenolic DOM exceeds that of Py-GC-MS indicating that a combination of both methods, supported by FTIR, allows differentiation of DOM sources and changes throughout the flow path.

AB In response to an enhanced interest in submerged landscapes and their nature, use and exploitation by early inhabitants, a multidisciplinary inventory of intertidal, nearshore and offshore peat deposits and 'submerged forests' around the English coast was compiled. The main driver was to assess the research potential of these types of deposits, in terms of their number, distribution and characteristics in order to identify recording priorities, especially where there is risk of either loss by erosion or of further submergence. The data collected included detailed site descriptions, locations, altitudes relative to modern sea-level, associated archaeological artefacts and any radiocarbon ages, as well as bibliographic references. Information was gathered from published sources, grey literature and the National Monuments Record, although some data (particularly those associated with offshore developments and aggregate extraction) remain confidential. At present the database contains information on over 300 sites, stored electronically. It constitutes a centralised resource to facilitate future coastal and marine research projects. Currently the database is only accessible on a one-to-one basis, but there are plans to make it available to users online. The project successfully involved the amalgamation of information from diverse sources and resulted in bringing together the often-segregated disciplines of Archaeology, Geology and Geography, with the hope of strengthening these relationships in the future.

AB Two C-14-dated pollen profiles from mires in the steppe belt of southern Russia are presented. On the basis of these and data from earlier investigations, the Holocene forest history of the southern part of Russia and Ukraine is reconstructed. The steppe belt is very sensitive to climatic oscillations and, in particular, to changes in evapotranspiration. The most favourable climate occurred between 6000 and 4500 B.P. (6800-5200 cal. B.P.), when forest attained its maximum extent in the steppe belt. The period 4500-3500 B.P. (5200-3800 cal. B.P.) was characterised by drier climate with the most arid phase occurring between 4200-3700 B.P. (4700-4000 cal. B.P.). During arid phases, the area under forest and also peat accumulation rates declined. Subsequently, a number of less pronounced climatic oscillations occurred such as in the period 3400/3300-2800 B.P. (3600/3500-2900 cal. B.P.) when there was a return to more humid conditions. During the last 2500 years, the vegetation cover of the steppe belt in southern Russia and Ukraine took on its present-day aspect. On the one hand, there is close correlation between the Holocene vegetation history of southern Russia and Ukraine and, on the other hand, the steppe belt of Kazakhstan and transgressions in the Caspian sea. Human impact on the natural vegetation became important from the Bronze Age onwards (after 4500 B.P.; 5200 cal. B.P.). Particular attention is given to the history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), which had a much wider distribution in the southern part of eastern Europe in the early Holocene. The reduction in range during recent millennia has come about as a result of the combined effects of both climatic deterioration and increased human impact.

AB Forested wetlands and peatlands are important in boreal and terrestrial biogeochemical cycling, but most general-purpose forest process models are designed and parameterized for upland systems. We describe changes made to Biome-BGC, an ecophysiological process model, that improve its ability to simulate poorly drained forests. Model changes allowed for: (1) lateral water inflow from a surrounding watershed, and variable surface and subsurface drainage; (2) adverse effects of anoxic soil on decomposition and nutrient mineralization; (3) closure of leaf stomata in flooded soils; and (4) growth of nonvascular plants (i.e., bryophytes). Bryophytes were treated as ectohydric broadleaf evergreen plants with zero stomatal conductance, whose cuticular conductance to CO2 was dependent on plant water content. Individual model changes were parameterized with published data, and ecosystem-level model performance was assessed by comparing simulated output to field data from the northern BOREAS site in Manitoba, Canada. The simulation of the poorly drained forest model exhibited reduced decomposition and vascular plant growth (-90%) compared with that of the well-drained forest rnodel; the integrated bryophyte photosynthetic response accorded well with published data. Simulated net primary production, biomass and soil carbon accumulation broadly agreed with field measurements, although simulated net primary production was higher than observed data in well-drained stands. Simulated net primary production in the poorly drained forest was most sensitive to oxygen restriction on soil processes, and secondarily to stomatal closure in flooded conditions. The modified Biome-BGC remains unable to simulate true wetlands that are subject to prolonged flooding, because it does not track organic soil formation, water table changes, soil redox potential or anaerobic processes.

AB An increasing amount of biomass fly ash is produced because of the increased usage of renewable energy sources. Therefore, novel applications in which biomass fly ashes can be utilized efficiently are required. One interesting option is to use biomass fly ashes in hardening applications, such as earth construction. In this study, the self hardening of ground fly ash from a Finnish power plant with a bubbling fluidized bed boiler that burns forest industry residuals and peat was investigated. Fly ash was ground with three different mills, namely, tumbling ball mill, impact mill, and jet mill, to different particle size distributions. Results showed that the amount of reactive components for ground fly ash samples was more or less the same with the original sample, but the particle size distribution was different. Moreover, the water requirement for self-hardening samples was completely different depending on the grinding mechanism. When particle size distribution was wider (after ball and impact milling), the water requirement was much lower due to the better packing of the particles. A smaller water requirement also led to greater compressive strength even the fly ash samples were chemically and mineralogically the same. After ball milling, obtaining four times higher self-hardening compressive strength, from 5 MPa to 20 MPa, was possible. For jet milled fly ash, the particle size distribution was narrow due to the classifier in the mill, and the water requirement was high. Therefore, the packing and self-hardening compressive strength of jet milled fly ash was lower than that of impact and ball milled samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In boreal-drained peatland forests, tree growth is retarded by the gradual deterioration of drainage ditch networks. In order to avoid the development of suboptimal growth conditions, ditch network maintenance (DNM) operations (ditch cleaning and/or complementary ditching) are annually conducted on an area of about 70,000 ha in Finland. The previous studies indicate that the depth of the water table prior to DNM may influence the magnitude of the growth response to DNM. Tree growth does not necessarily increase after DNM at sites with large stand volume and subsequent low water levels due to tree stand evapotranspiration. We investigated how the pre-treatment water table depth (pre-WTD) in late summer relates to the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands after the DNM operation in 12 field experiments. The increase in mean annual volume growth caused by DNM was negatively related to the pre-WTD, with the highest growth response in stands where the pre-WTD was less than 25-30 cm. DNM did not clearly increase stand growth in sites where the pre-WTD was more than 35-40 cm below the soil surface. There was a high variation in growth response to DNM between the water levels from 20 to 35 cm below the soil surface, indicating that factors other than water table depth are also needed as decision criteria for assessing the appropriate timing of ditch network maintenance.

AB Fertilizers are applied in drained peatland forests to correct nutrient imbalances, but few models have been developed for predicting the stand growth response. We used 10- to 34-year-long stem growth increment data from 51 fertilization experiments involving ash, PK, and NPK treatments (doses of P, K, and N varying between 35 and 45, 60 and 80, and 80 and 90 kg.ha(-1), respectively) and controls to model the volume growth response of young Scots pine (Pinus sylvetris L.) stands to fertilization in drained peatland sites of middle and northern Finland. We used the linear mixed models method to express the stand-level growth response as a function of time (5-year periods), site type group, location, and the fertilization treatment (ash-PK combined and NPK). Different growth responses were obtained for nitrogen-rich sites with PK treatment and nitrogen-poor sites with NPK treatment. The PK fertilization in nitrogen-rich sites resulted in the largest volume growth response and longest temporal effect (1.0-2.0 m(3).ha(-1).a(-1) higher mean growth for at least 35 years), with quicker and stronger effects in more southern conditions where average temperature sums were greater than 1000 degree-days (degrees C). NPK fertilization in nitrogen-poor sites gave a modest response (0.4-0.8 m(3).ha(-1).a(-1) in 35 years).

AB There is little scientific information on substrates for pot-in-pot shade tree production. The objective of this research was to examine various organic-waste-derived substrates for growing shade trees in pot-in-pot systems. Seedling whips of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.), Japanese birch [Betula platyphylla var, japonica (Miq.) Hara], and silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) were grown for two seasons in 76-L containers. The containers were trickle irrigated and fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers. Treatments included a control nursery mix (50% by volume of pine bark:15% compost:35% topsoil) and nine other mixes classified into three groups: Group I (25, 50 or 75% bark mixed with 50, 25, or 0% wood chips, and 25% paper mill sludge); Group II (25, 50 or 75% bark; 50, 25 or 0% wood chips; and 25% peat); and Group III (25, 50 or 75% peat; 50, 25 or 0% wood chips; and 25% paper mill sludge). In both years, trunk diameters of the three species were greatest with Group III substrates, intermediate with Group II, and least with Group I. Trunk growth was positively correlated with water retention porosity, which ranged from 42 to 57%, 38 to 42%, and 20 to 27% for Groups III, II, and I, respectively. Trunk diameters of Group II and III trees were equal to, or slightly exceeded (10-12%), those of the nursery mix. The nursery mix had a water retention porosity of 49% and generally the highest content of soluble salts. The high-peat (50 and 75%) substrates marginally but consistently produced trees with the largest trunk diameters, although with birch (not the other species) shorter trees resulted as the peat content increased.

AB Increasing and more intensive energy wood harvesting from forests necessitate efforts to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are recycled back onto the site. Recycling nutrients back to the forest in the form of wood ash is a natural means to correct the nutrient imbalance and acidity of forest soils that can occur from intensive management, as well as to solve the problem of disposing of wood combustion wastes. Methods of refining and spreading have been developed to improve the logistics and cost competitiveness of recycling wood ash back into the forest as fertilizer. In this study, the costs of spreading granulated wood ash in the forest were calculated under Finnish conditions. The profitability of recycling wood ash to drained peatland forests as a fertilizer was also analyzed, from the forest owner's point of view. For this analysis, wood ash was compared with chemical fertilizer in terms of effect, cost and profitability. Wood ash fertilization using the ground-based forwarder system was two to three times cheaper than using the aerial helicopter-loader system. From the forest owner's point of view, the fertilization of peatland forest with wood ash proved to be a very profitable silvicultural investment (IRR 3-12 percent). To improve the economics of wood ash recycling to forests, ground-based spreading of granulated ash should be emphasized. Furthermore, in order to create large enough operational units for the cost-efficient spreading of ash, there needs to be comprehensive planning of spreading sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forest harvesting activities, if not carefully carried out, can disturb the forest soils and can cause significant suspended solid concentration increases in receiving water. This study examined how harvesting, following forestry guidelines, influenced suspended solid concentrations and loads in the receiving water of a blanket peat salmonid catchment. The study site comprised of two forest coupes of 34-year-old conifers drained by a first-order stream. The upper coupe was not felled and acted as a baseline 'control' catchment; the downstream coupe was completely harvested in summer 2005 and served as the 'experimental' catchment. Good management practices such as the proper use of brash mats and harvesting only in dry weather were implemented to minimize soil surface disturbance and streambank erosion. Stream flow and suspended solid measurements at an upstream station (US) and a downstream station (DS) in the study stream commenced over a year before felling took place. The suspended solid concentrations, yields and release patterns at US and DS were compared before and after harvesting. These showed that post-guideline harvesting of upland blanket peat forest did not significantly increase the suspended solid concentrations in the receiving water and the aquatic zone need not be adversely affected by soil releases from sites without a buffer strip.

AB The paper presents the results of archaeological research on animal remains found in the territory of Chornobyl hillfort and its surroundings. The Medieval Chornobyl was an important settlement of the sparsely populated Kyivan Polesia, a vast land of peat bogs and boreal forests. Today, the city is the centre of Chornobyl Exclusion Zone that was established after the 1986 nuclear disaster. Archaeological surveys have been conducted in this restricted area since 2003 and a significant amount of materials has been amassed during excavations of Chornobyl hillfort. In this paper, we analyse 1060 specimens of fish, birds and small mammal remains in order to reconstruct the economy of the Chornobyl hillfort and the environmental conditions of the surrounding area. The obtained result allow to suggest that (1) fishing and hunting played a considerably higher role in life of the settlement as opposed to animal husbandry, (2) the latter was insignificant because of the surrounding environmental conditions, in particular due to the predominating areas of wetlands and forests, and the small portion of arable lands. When comparing the current species composition of the Chornobyl area with the list of identified medieval remains, we can notice that species dynamics have been affected by both natural (warming, shifts of natural zones) and anthropogenic (fishing, hunting, deforestation disturbance, wetland drainage) factors. In general, our results suggest that the Medieval Chornobyl was surrounded by a typical boreal faunal assemblage with a predominance of water-related (waterfowl and semi-aquatic) species among its terrestrial component.

AB Pine tree substrate (PTS) is a relatively new alternative to the commonly used pine bark and peat-based substrates for container crop production. Physical and chemical properties of freshly manufactured PTS have been studied; however, this new substrate will sometimes be manufactured and stored for later use by growers. The objective of this research was to determine how chemical and physical properties of PTS were affected by storage duration with or without amendments of limestone or peatmoss. We also studied how the growth of marigold was influenced by PTS storage time and by lime and peat amendments. Substrate properties studied were pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N), bulk density (BD), and particle size distribution. Pine tree substrate was manufactured by hammermilling chips of approximate to 15-year-old loblolly pine trees (Pinus taeda L.) through two screen sizes, 4.76 mm (PTS) and 15.9 mm [amended with peat (PTSP)]. Pine tree substrate and PTSP were amended with lime at five rates and a peat-perlite mix (PL) served as a control treatment. Substrates were prepared, placed in plastic storage bags, and stored on shelves in an open shed in Blacksburg, VA. Substrates were subsampled at 1, 42, 84, 168, 270, and 365 days after storage. At each subsampling day, twelve I-L containers were filled with a subsample of each treatment. Six of the 12 were left fallow and six were planted with 14-day-old marigold (Tagetes erecta L. 'Inca Gold') seedlings. Substrate was also collected for analysis of CEC, C:N, BD, and particle size distribution. The pH of non-limed PTS decreased during storage, and at least 1 kg.m(-3) lime was needed to maintain PTS pH 5.4 or greater over the 365-day storage period (Day 1 pH = 5.8) and 2 to 4 kg.m(-3) was needed to maintain PTSP pH 5.4 or greater for 365 days (Day 1 pH = 5.2). EC measurements were highest at Day 1 (1.02 to 1.21 dS-m(-1)) in all treatments and decreased by Day 42. Cation exchange capacity decreased over time in non-limed PTS and PTSP. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and BD remained the same over time for all treatments. There were minor changes in particle size distribution for limed PTS. Marigold growth in all limed PTS and PTSP treatments was equal to or greater than in PL, except at Day 1; the lower growth in PTS and PTSP at Day 1 compared with PL suggests that freshly manufactured PTS may contain a phytotoxic substance that was not present in PTS by Day 42. Pine tree substrate and PTSP are relatively stable when stored as described previously, except for a pH decrease that can be prevented with additions of lime before storage.

AB Little is known about the terrestrial response of high-latitude Scandinavian vegetation to the warmer than-present climate of the late Pliocene (Piacenzian, 3.60-2.58 Ma). In order to assess Piacenzian terrestrial climate variability, we present the first high-resolution reconstruction of vegetation and climate change in northern Norway between 3.6 and 3.14 Ma. The reconstructions are derived from pollen assemblages in the marine sediments of ODP Hole 642B, Norwegian Sea (67 N). The palynological assemblages provide a unique record of latitudinal and altitudinal shifting of the forest boundaries, with vegetation alternating between cool temperate forest during warmer than -present intervals and boreal forest similar to today during cooler intervals. The northern boundary of the nemoral to boreonemoral forest zone was displaced at least 4-8 further north, and warmest-month temperatures were 614.5 C higher than at present during warm phases. Warm climatic conditions persisted during the earliest Piacenzian (ca. 3.6-3.47 Ma) with diverse cool temperate nemoral to boreonemoral forests growing in the lowlands of the Scandinavian mountains A distinct cooling event at ca. 3.47 Ma resulted in a southward shift of vegetation zones, leading to the predominance of boreal forest and the development of open, low alpine environments. The cooling culminated around 3.3 Ma, coinciding with Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2. Warmer climate conditions returned after ca. 3.29 Ma, with higher climate variability indicated by the repeated expansion of forests and peatlands during warmer and cooler periods, respectively. Climate progres- sively cooled after 3.18 Ma, resembling climatic conditions during MIS M2. A high variability of Norwegian vegetation and climate changes during the Piacenzian is superimposed on a long-term cooling trend. This cooling was accompanied by an expansion of Sphagnum peatlands that potentially contributed to the decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the end of the Piacenzian warm period and facilitated ice growth through positive vegetation snow albedo feedbacks. Correlations with other Northern Hemisphere vegetation records suggest hemisphere -wide effects of climate cooling.

AB Seven new species and two varieties of Klebsormidium were described using an integrative approach on the base of 28 strains from the poorly studied phylogenetic superclade G. These strains originated from the unusual and exotic habitats (semi-deserts, semi-arid shrublands, Mediterranean shrub and deciduous vegetation, temperate Araucaria forests, peat bogs, dumps after coal mining, maritime sand dunes etc.) of four continents (Africa, South and North America, and Europe). Molecular phylogenies based on ITS-1,2, rbcL gene and concatenated dataset of ITS-1,2-rbcL, secondary structure of ITS-2, morphology, ecology and biogeography, micrographs and drawings of the investigated strains were assessed. Additionally, phylogeny and morphology of 18 Klebsormidium strains from other lineages isolated from the same localities (different vegetation types of Chile and maritime sand dunes of Germany) were investigated for the comparison with representatives of Glade G. Clade G Klebsormidium is characterized by distant phylogenetic position from the other Klebsormidium lineages and prominent morphology: four-lobed chloroplasts and mostly short swollen cells in young culture, compact small pyrenoids, curved or disintegrated filaments, unusual elongation of cells in old culture, formation of specific cluster- and knot-like colonies on agar surface, especially prominent in strains isolated from desert regions, from which the group probably originated. Comparison of Klebsormidium diversity from different biogeographic regions showed that the representatives of Glade G are common algae in regions of the southern hemisphere (South Africa and Chile) and rare representatives in terrestrial ecosystems of the northern hemisphere. Further investigation of mostly unstudied territories of the southern hemisphere could bring many surprises and discoveries, leading to a change of the present concept that Klebsormidium is cosmopolitan in distribution.

AB Maintaining and improving surface water quality requires knowledge of nutrient and sediment loads due to past and future land-use practices, but historical data on land cover and its changes are often lacking. In this study, we tested whether land-use-specific export coefficients can be used together with satellite images (Landsat) and/or regional land-use statistics to estimate riverine nutrient loads and concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and suspended solids (SS). The study area, Simojoki (3160 km(2)) in northern Finland, has been intensively drained for peatland forestry since the 1960s. We used different approaches at multiple sub catchment scales to simulate TN, TP, and SS export in the Simojoki catchment. The uncertainty in estimates based on specific export coefficients was quantified based on historical land-use changes (derived from Landsat data), and an uncertainty boundary was established for each land-use. The uncertainty boundary captured at least 60% of measured values of TN, TP, and SS loads or concentrations. However, the uncertainty in estimates compared with measured values ranged from 7% to 20% for TN, 0% to 18% for TP, and 13% to 43% for SS for different catchments. Some discrepancy between predicted and measured loads and concentrations was expected, as the method did not account for inter-annual variability in hydrological conditions or river processes. However, combining historical land-use change estimates with simple export coefficients can be a practical approach for evaluating the influence on water quality of historical land-use changes such as peatland drainage for forest establishment.

AB We compiled available data and information on the global and regional areas (Ramsar regions), and changes in area, of 22 classes of marine or coastal and inland wetlands. From those classes for which there is information, inland natural surface wetlands (forming similar to 77% of total surface wetland extent) are dominated by non-forested peatlands, marshes and swamps on alluvial soils, with peatlands forming similar to 33% of natural inland wetlands. The smaller area of marine or coastal wetlands (similar to 10% of total wetland extent) is dominated by unvegetated tidal flats and saltmarshes. Largest areas of human-made wetlands for which there is information are rice paddy and water storage bodies, with a much smaller area of tropical oil palm and pulpwood plantations. These human-made wetlands are all increasing in area. The reported decline in global natural wetland area is occurring across almost all classes of inland and marine or coastal natural wetlands. Total global wetland area estimated from these wetland classes is between 15.2 x 10(6) and 16.2 x 10(6) km(2), similar to recent global wetland area estimates derived from remote sensing. Given the considerable data gaps for area of wetland classes, even the most recent other estimates of global wetland extent are likely to be underestimates.

AB A field experiment was conducted in a 13-year-old Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) plantation on shallow oligotrophic peat to investigate short-term changes in soil pH and trace metal concentrations and in tree growth responses to applications of rural and urban alkaline biosolids. There were five treatments: (1) control (no amendment); (2)-(4) rural biosolids at application rates of 20, 40 and 60 t fresh material (FM) ha(-1); and (5) urban biosolids applied at one rate (40 t ha(-1)) only. The biosolids were spread by hand on the ground surface of each plot on 12 March 1992. Feat and foliar samples were collected in February each year from 1993 to 1995. Annual tree height was also measured. The results show that alkaline biosolid-derived Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb and Cr accumulated in the litter layer. The magnitude of surface soil metal enrichment was related to sludge type and application rate. There was spatial and temporal variation in metal concentrations, probably due to uneven distribution of the sludge biosolids and the uneven depth of the litter layer on the forest floor. Rural biosolids markedly increased the dilute acetic acid extractable Zn while urban biosolids greatly elevated extractable Cu in the litter layer, reflecting the different metal loadings in the two sources of sewage sludge. Alkaline biosolids raised the pH of the litter layer, and of the top 5 cm land occasionally the top 10 cm) of the underlying peat profile and elicited tree growth responses. Small amounts of heavy metals such as Cu and Zn may have leached down the soil profile. Heavy metals that have accumulated in the litter layer may represent a potential pool for long-term leaching as litter decomposition and acidification proceed. Long-term monitoring would therefore be required to determine the full environmental impact following application of alkaline biosolids to spruce forests on oligotrophic peat.

   DIAGENESIS
AB The Dobrudzha Basin in northeast Bulgaria contains 86 coal seams distributed within three coal-bearing formations of Late Carboniferous age. This study presents the organic petrological and geochemical characteristics of coals from the Makedonka and Krupen Formations, containing some of the most prominent coal seams. These were characterized by means of proximate and Rock-Eval analyses, vitrinite reflectance measurements, organic petrography and GCMS analysis in order to establish variations in vegetation and depositional settings. Based on random vitrinite reflectance (avg. 0.7% R-r) and TOC contents (avg. similar to 80%, daf) the coals can be classified as low rank bituminous (high volatile B-C). Low Tmax values (avg. 430 degrees C) further indicate a low degree of organic matter maturity. The low to moderately high ash yields, together with the presence of shaly partings, and generally low sulfur contents are consistent with peat formation in a fluviatile sedimentary environment. Petrographic analysis reveals complex maceral composition with abundant liptinite and inertinite. The predominance of detrovitrinite and the almost complete lack of strongly gelified macerals argue for enhanced humification of the plant tissues and peat formation in relatively dry environments (above water table). The distributions of n-alkanes, diterpenoids, and steranes indicate that the organic matter originated from terrestrial vascular plants. The high pristane/phytane ratios point to peat deposition under oxic conditions. Low concentrations of hopanes argue for limited bacterial degradation of the organic matter, possibly due to low pH conditions during peatification. The presence of tetracyclic diterpanes and their aromatic counterparts is attributed to pre-gymnosperm (cordaitean) input. The existence of cordaiteans, although as minor component of the palaeovegetational communities, is further evidenced by the presence of trace amounts of aromatic arborane/fernane derivatives in almost all studied samples. The occurrence of combustion-derived PAHs in all studied samples is consistent with the abundant inertinite and indicates frequent forest fires during peat formation.

AB The direct and indirect effects of iron on the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are reviewed. In addition to the mining of Fe enriched ores, intensified forestry, peat production and agricultural draining have increased the load of iron in many river ecosystems. The effects of iron on aquatic animals and their habitats are mainly indirect, although the direct toxic effects of Fe2+ are also important in some lotic habitats receiving Fe-enriched effluents in cold seasons, in particular. Ferric hydroxide and Fe-humus precipitates, on both biological and other surfaces, indirectly effect lotic organisms by disturbing the normal metabolism and osmoregulation, and by changing the structure and quality of benthic habitats and food resources. The combined direct and indirect effects of iron contamination decrease the species diversity and abundance of periphyton, benthic invertebrates and fishes. Sorption and co-precipitation of metals by Fe-oxides decrease the bioavailability and toxicity of water-borne metals, but may increase the dietary supply of metals and lead to toxic effects along the food chain. At the cellular level, Fe functions both as a detoxification mechanism, as well as a cell degeneration agent by inducing the formation of hydroxyl free radicals. More research is needed on the factors that affect the environmental fate and ecotoxicological impacts of iron on river ecosystems. As the flux of iron is heavily affected by seasonally varying physical, chemical and biological processes, its impact on ecosystems should be studied on multiple spatial, and temporal scales and at different levels of biological organisation.

AB There has been little study of whether different variants of tropical rainforest have distinct soil microbial communities and levels of diversity. We compared bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity between primary mixed dipterocarp, secondary mixed dipterocarp, white sand heath, inland heath, and peat swamp forests in Brunei Darussalam, Northwest Borneo by analyzing Illumina Miseq sequence data of 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 region. We hypothesized that white sand heath, inland heath and peat swamp forests would show lower microbial diversity and relatively distinct microbial communities (compared to MDF primary and secondary forests) due to their distinctive environments. We found that soil properties together with bacterial and fungal communities varied significantly between forest types. Alpha and beta-diversity of bacteria was highest in secondary dipterocarp and white sand heath forests. Also, bacterial alpha diversity was strongly structured by pH, adding another instance of this widespread pattern in nature. The alpha diversity of fungi was equally high in all forest types except peat swamp forest, although fungal beta diversity was highest in primary and secondary mixed dipterocarp forests. The relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi varied significantly between forest types, with highest relative abundance observed in MDF primary forest. Overall, our results suggest that the soil bacterial and fungal communities in these forest types are to a certain extent predictable and structured by soil properties, but that diversity is not determined by how distinctive the conditions are. This contrasts with the diversity patterns seen in rainforest trees, where distinctive soil conditions have consistently lower tree diversity.

AB Environmental characteristics of the total and size fractionated concentrations of metals in bottom ash and fly ash from a large (246 MW) fluidized-bed boiler incinerating forest residues and peat at a pulp and paper mill complex in Finland were studied. Although the enrichment factors for total metal concentrations in the fly ash varied between 1.3 (potassium and sodium) and 34.5 (sulphur), all metal concentrations in both the bottom ash and fly ash were significantly lower than the current Finnish limit values for maximum allowable metal concentrations for forest fertilizers. Therefore, both the studied ashes are residues with a potential to be utilized as forest fertilizers as such. Only the arsenic concentration of 33.0 mg/kg (d.w.) in the fly ash fraction between 1.0-2.0 mm exceeded the Finnish limit value of 30 mg/kg (d.w.) set for arsenic in the forestry fertilizers. This means that the fly ash fraction of 1.0-2.0 mm is not suitable for a forestry fertilizer alone.

AB Forest fires are abrupt transformations of the natural ecosystem and management authorities are required to take preventive measures to tackle fire events. Geographic information system (GIS) is a powerful tool for providing information with a spatial context and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a well-established technique for multiple criteria decision making. In this study, GIS and AHP are combined to analyse seven fire-related factors related to climate, topography and human influence. Fire risk for a peat swamp forested area in Kuan Kreng, Nakorn Sri Thammarat province, Thailand is estimated in five categories. 705 historic fire events from 2006 to 2017 are used to validate our approach. 82% of the historic fire incidents occurred within the highest fire risk class categories while only a few omission errors were recorded. The combined approach of GIS and AHP techniques can yield useful fire risk maps, which can consequently be used for future planning and management of fire prone areas.

AB Ditch run-off chemistry of 40 catchments was monitored before and for 2-3 yrs after maintenance of the peatland ditch network and compared with data collected from 34 control catchments. Increases in mean pH, electrical conductivity, and the concentrations of suspended solids and base cations (sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium) and a decrease in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon were observed. Because of high concentrations in a few areas immediately after the digging operations and during the first post-treatment year in general, the mean concentrations of aluminium and iron also increased. No major changes occurred in the concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (N) and total dissolved phosphorus. High phosphorus concentrations were observed at a few sites immediately after the digging operations. Concentrations of mineral N, especially NH4+-N, increased significantly, while the concentrations of organic N decreased. The largest relative changes in element transport during the 3 yr period following treatment were the increases in the loads of NH4+-N and suspended solids. From the point of view of water protection, the loading of suspended solids was considered the most harmful effect of ditch network maintenance.

AB Riverine wetlands are created and transformed by geomorphological processes that determine their vegetation composition, primary production and soil accretion, all of which are likely to influence C stocks. Here, we compared ecosystem C stocks (trees, soil and downed wood) and soil N stocks of different types of riverine wetlands (marsh, peat swamp forest and mangroves) whose distribution spans from an environment dominated by river forces to an estuarine environment dominated by coastal processes. We also estimated soil C sequestration rates of mangroves on the basis of soil C accumulation. We predicted that C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps would be larger than marshes, and that C, N stocks and C sequestration rates would be larger in the upper compared to the lower estuary. Mean C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps (784.5 +/- 73.5 and 722.2 +/- 63.6 MgC ha(-1), respectively) were higher than those of marshes (336.5 +/- 38.3 MgC ha(-1)). Soil C and N stocks of mangroves were highest in the upper estuary and decreased towards the lower estuary. C stock variability within mangroves was much lower in the upper estuary (range 744-912 MgC ha(-1)) compared to the intermediate and lower estuary (range 537-1115 MgC ha(-1)) probably as a result of a highly dynamic coastline. Soil C sequestration values were 1.3 +/- 0.2 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) and were similar across sites. Estimations of C stocks within large areas need to include spatial variability related to vegetation composition and geomorphological setting to accurately reflect variability within riverine wetlands.

AB The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from land to ocean via rivers is a significant term in the global C cycle, and has been modified in many areas by human activity. DOC exports from large global rivers are fairly well quantified, but those from smaller river systems, including those draining oceanic regions, are generally under-represented in global syntheses. Given that these regions typically have high runoff and high peat cover, they may exert a disproportionate influence on the global land-ocean DOC export. Here we describe a comprehensive new assessment of the annual riverine DOC export to estuaries across the island of Great Britain (GB), which spans the latitude range 50-60 degrees N with strong spatial gradients of topography, soils, rainfall, land use and population density. DOC yields (export per unit area) were positively related to and best predicted by rainfall, peat extent and forest cover, but relatively insensitive to population density or agricultural development. Based on an empirical relationship with land use and rainfall we estimate that the DOC export from the GB land area to the freshwater-seawater interface was 1.15 Tg C year(-1) in 2017. The average yield for GB rivers is 5.04 g C m(-2) year(-1), higher than most of the world's major rivers, including those of the humid tropics and Arctic, supporting the conclusion that under-representation of smaller river systems draining peat-rich areas could lead to under-estimation of the global land-ocean DOC export. The main anthropogenic factor influencing the spatial distribution of GB DOC exports appears to be upland conifer plantation forestry, which is estimated to have raised the overall DOC export by 0.168 Tg C year(-1). This is equivalent to 15% of the estimated current rate of net CO2 uptake by British forests. With the UK and many other countries seeking to expand plantation forest cover for climate change mitigation, this 'leak in the ecosystem' should be incorporated in future assessments of the CO2 sequestration potential of forest planting strategies.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate how the biomass of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) is influenced by the addition of different phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and PK fertilizers in peatland forests with variable P and K availability. Four fertilizers were used: apatite, biotite, Rauta-PK (TM) (apatite and ferrosulphate) and a test fertilizer (50% apatite and 50% recycled iron phosphate). Forest plots with four different types of nutrient balance (deficient P and deficient K, deficient P and sufficient K, sufficient P and deficient K, and sufficient P and sufficient K) were studied. The effects on EMM biomass and ectomycorrhizal (EM) biomass in roots were estimated by ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis using in-growth mesh bags. Nutrients and rare-earth elements in EM roots surrounding the mesh bags were quantified and used as indicators of nutrient transport by the EMM in the mesh bags. The biomass of EMM was enhanced by P, K and PK deficiency of the trees, and EM fungal biomass in the roots was increased by P deficiency. The test fertilizer enhanced EMM biomass in all the plots studied, whereas the other fertilizers did not have any significant effect. No significant interactions between the P and K availability of host and mycelial fertilizer response could be detected. Deficiency of P or K or both in needles did not affect the concentrations of rare-earth elements in the tree roots. Earlier results from laboratory experiments have shown reduced carbon allocation to EM fungi under K deficiency, but this was not the case in these mature forests. Instead, we observed increased EMM biomass in response to both P and K deficiency.

AB In central Ontario, elevated SO4 concentrations and export have been measured in both upland and wetland-draming catchments following summer droughts, although the source of excess SO4 is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of drying and rewetting and temperature, respectively, on the release Of SO4 from the primary S pools in wetlands (Sphagnum and peat) and uplands (forest floor and mineral soil), using material collected from the PC I catchment in Haliburton County, and from catchment S50 in the Turkey Lakes Watershed. Peat exhibited the most marked response to drying of the four materials considered, and within 24 h of re-wetting dried peat from both catchments released 3-4 times more SO4 (50-67 mg kg(-1) S-SO4) than continuously moist peat (16 mg kg(-1) S-SO4), although temperature had only a marginal effect on SO4 concentrations. There was no immediate response of Sphagnum to either drying or temperature, although S-SO4 concentrations in Sphagnum tended to increase over the 30-day (d) incubation. There was a small but immediate increase in S-SO4 concentrations in forest floor material (LFH) front both catchments within the first 24 h of incubation, which was greatest in treatments that were dried and/or incubated at a higher temperature. In contrast, neither temperature nor drying appeared to affect SO4 release from mineral soil collected from either site. Results of laboratory incubations suggest that increases in SO4 concentration that have been reported in wetland-draining streams immediately following summer dry periods may be quantitatively explained by drying and rewetting of peat rather than increased mineralization in Sphagnum. Similarly, the higher SO4 concentrations that have been measured in upland streams following summer droughts may in part be due to enhanced SO4 release from the forest floor following drying and re-wetting. In contrast, while the mineral soil constitutes a large pool of total S, it does not appear to be responsive to changes in moisture or temperature in the short-term (<30 d) and therefore likely does not contribute to reported climate-related temporal variations in stream SO4.

AB It is currently recommended to use buffer areas in reducing nutrient export from forested areas to water courses. Nutrient retention in buffer areas has been studied mostly by using artificial nutrient additions, hence information is needed from areas where the increased export originates from an actual forestry practice. We investigated the capacity of riparian buffer areas to reduce the ammonium (NH4-N) export originating from ditch network maintenance areas on boreal forested peatlands. Our results indicated that buffers are inefficient for reducing loadings that already are close to background levels of forested areas. In such a case, the buffer may even release NH4-N into through-flow waters. When the loading rate increased high above the background level, efficient reduction in NH4-N transport became possible. Besides the rate of ammonium loading, a factor behind efficient retention was the sufficient length of the buffer, whereas high volume of runoff decreased retention efficiency. Other buffer characteristics, such as the soil properties (bulk density, CEC), the tree stand structure, and the density of surface vegetation, were insignificant for ammonium retention efficiency.

AB In this study, the physical and chemical properties of bottom ash and fly ash originating from the co-combustion of biomass-derived fuels (i.e. wood chips, sawdust, bark, and peat) from a 32 MW fluidized bed boiler at a municipal district heating plant were investigated. Silicate minerals were predominant in the bottom ash and calcium minerals in the fly ash, with most of the inorganic nutrients and heavy metals being enriched in the fly ash. The enrichment factors for heavy metals in the fly ash varied between 0.2 for silicon and 16.3 for lead, and for plant nutrients. between 1.5 for phosphorous and 108 for potassium. However. all heavy metal concentrations in both the bottom ash and fly ash were significantly lower than the current Finnish limit for maximum allowable heavy metal concentrations for forest fertilizers, which came into force in March 2007. According to the particle size distribution. the mass loadings of heavy metals in the fly ash were more than 90% contributed by the smallest particle size fraction lower than 0.074 mm. In the bottom ash, between 83.6 and 91.9% of the mass loadings of heavy metals were contributed by the particle size fraction between 0.5 and 2.0 mm. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Streams and drains in blanket-peatland forest in western Ireland were sampled weekly over 5 years, 1996-2000, using continuous, depth-proportional. passive sampling. Analysis was for pH, alkalinity by Gran titration, anions by IC, metals by ICP, aluminium speciation by loaded-resin exchange, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by absorbance at 320 nm.
   Effects of felling are identified graphically from two forest drains whose catchments (both about 1 ha) were clearfelled, and partial clearfelling of one larger catchment (somewhat over 1 km(2)), in summer 1999. Calcium concentrations and alkalinity were increased in the drain- and streamwater from the felled areas. The pH was increased in drains, while in the larger stream, pH range decreased while the mean increased. Phosphorus increased markedly with clearfell, in the absence of recent fertilising, and also increased with fertilising; these results are reported in an accompanying paper. Ammonium-nitrogen concentrations were increased in the two drains with felling, and temporarily decreased in the larger stream. Nitrate increased in some cases. Potassium and manganese concentrations also increased. Concentrations of DOC and organic monomeric aluminium increased gradually, subject to a continuing strong annual cycle. There were no clearfelling effects on concentrations of solphate, suspended solids or inorganic monomeric aluminium. In the two drains (fully clearfelled), concentrations of sodium, chloride and magnesium, and conductivity, were all reduced after felling. Fertilising effects other than for phosphorus were indistinct.
   Effects of the combined clearfell-reforestation treatment were testable statistically, using randomised intervention analysis, between two larger streams (1 km(2)) as a treatment-control comparison. There were statistically significant positive responses in streamwater concentrations of nitrate, potassium, calcium, DOC and aluminium fractions. The implications for management practice depend on whether the loss of nutrients is sustainable for future crop productivity, and whether critical limits and loads of receiving ecosystems are exceeded.

AB Tropical wetlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle and climate system. To elaborate government policies that protect wetland ecosystem services, spatially explicit data on the existing C stocks are needed. This study quantified above and below ground C stocks in mangrove, swamp forests, marshes, and grazed wetlands in three different regions in Mexico (Veracruz, Tabasco/Campeche, and Chiapas states), using a combination of remote sensing techniques and field data collection. We report a 0.688 Gt C stock in the areas investigated showing that these wetlands hold important C stocks. The total C stock of Mexico's wetlands is expected to be considerably larger as our study is not a complete survey of Mexico's total wetland area. Across the three regions, the currently unprotected swamp forests and marshes had substantial peat deposits storing approximate to 0.232 and 0.375 Pg C, respectively. The high C stocks found in swamp forests (1801 +/- 283 Mg C ha(-1)) and marshes (1100 +/- 376 Mg C ha(-1)) are likely to be vulnerable to human interventions such as drainage. Flooded grasslands, used for grazing, had substantially lower C storage (271 +/- 122 Mg C ha(-1)), showing that grazed areas are less effective as C stores. Across sites the belowground C pool that was two orders of magnitude greater than the aboveground biomass C stocks. Carbon storage in wetland vegetation types differed among the three study regions, indicating the need for developing government policies considering a specific regional approach to protect the C stocks of coastal wetlands. Given that freshwater swamps had the greatest C stocks and freshwater marshes stored most C, these wetland peat deposits should be prioritized for conservation, via new legislation or inclusion in payment for ecosystem services schemes.

AB The Middle Longcraig Limestone (late Visean) at Catcraig, Scotland, is densely covered with large (about 1 m in diameter) hollows, which are surrounded by numerous fossilized roots. The latter represent the positions of tree-sized plants belonging to a fossil forest. This paper aims to reconstruct its ecology based on paleosol properties, size and spatial distribution of root-casts, rooting system morphology and characteristics of coalified plant remnants. The obtained data are consistent with the supposition that the Visean peat wetland forest of Catcraig represents a Cordaitalean dominated community composed of mono-sized, most probably, even-aged giant trees. The peaty paleosol (Histosol) contains pyrite and siderite, indicating reducing and acidic conditions, whilst the abundant presence of gypsum testifies periods of elevated salinity. The adaptation of trees to such conditions is supported by morphologically evident large root mass (typically more than 1000 individual roots per cast). Good preservation of plant tissues in peat, in addition to other paleosol and rooting system characteristics allow us to conclude that the trees occupied seacoast settings or lagoons, which were not permanently flooded.

DE active tractor train; trailer wheel drive; braking dynamics; selection

AB The paper considers an important problem in improvement of braking dynamics potential as part of the overall tractor train dynamics consisting of an all-wheel drive tractor and heavy-duty trailers which are either locally manufactured or developed with the participation of the paper's authors. The trailers have a mechanical drive for their wheels from the tractor engine. The trains are intended for transportation peat, organic fertilizers and various loads in forest exploitation and under other complicated soil and climatic and road conditions where there is justified necessity to activate the trailer wheels.
   Methodological tools have been developed with the purpose to analyze an influence of the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of an active tractor train on distribution of braking forces in double-reduction axles with due account of the heavy-duty peat trailer specificity. Theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles have been developed with regard to the braking application specificity of active tractor trains with mechanical multi-path drive for wheels of a multi-double-reduction axle propulsion device. The paper presents calculation and theoretical data in order to estimate distribution of specific braking forces in the double-reduction axle links of the active tractor train when the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of the tractor and trailer wheels is switched on and also in the case when the tractor engine is involved in braking process and a clutch coupling is switched-on.
   Sequence of the calculation formula has been completely carried out in the paper. They represent clear design and operational parameters of the active tractor train. Such approach has made it possible to realize them in the form of a software application which is convenient for analysis of the braking process pertaining to the investigated objects in order to select means for improvement of braking dynamics, rational parameters of multi-path wheel drive and tire completing of the active tractor train under design. The proposed information has a theoretical and practical value for specialists who are involved in development of new machine-tractor units for transport application in peat extraction, forestry, and agriculture.

DE FRAGSTATS; remote sensing; wetlands landscape
AB Desert oasis wetlands are distributed along the Heihe River, especially in lowland oases along the middle reach of the river, in northwestern China. Landscape maps of the wetlands in 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2006 were compiled based on data collected from Landsat TM and ETM+ images using GIS and analyzed in July 2008. Various landscape indices were calculated using the landscape structure analysis software FRAGSTATS, at both class and landscape levels. The results showed that floodplain wetland is the dominant type of wetlands in the middle reach of the Heihe River, followed by non-forested peatland, then river and reservoir wetland, with the proportion of shrub-dominated wetland low. During these 16 years, the area of wetlands in our study area decreased by 38.4%, or 107.8 km(2). The major type of wetland lost in the study area was non-forested peatland during the first five years, but floodplain wetland since then. The landscape pattern shows that the fragmentation level is very high, especially in the floodplain wetlands: the patch density increased by 154% during the study period. It is clear that the wetlands along the middle reach of the Heihe River have become increasingly fragmental during the past 16 years.

AB Fire is one of the main causes of environmental and ecosystem change. Geospatial data, derived from satellite images and surveying observations, are a useful tool in managing land use and land cover changes. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria-based geographical information system (GIS) for fire risk assessment and fire potential mapping in a peat swamp forest at Hua Sai district, Thailand. Fifty-five fire points in peat swamp areas were reported from 2012 to 2016. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and GIS methods were used synergistically to analyze the following contributing factors: elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, distance from river, distance from settlement and land use. The results of the present study indicate that the predicted fire risk areas from the methodology proposed are found to be in agreement with recorded past fire events. The fire risk map produced can be used for planning and management of wildland fire events in the future. GIS multi-criteria-based models have been developed in the context of fire prognosis; however, most of them attribute weights from simple pair-wise comparisons; we showcase that the integration of AHP provides accurate results for this study area in Thailand.

AB The C:N ratio is considered as an indicator of nitrate leaching in response to high atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. However, the C:N ratio is influenced by a multitude of other site-related factors. This study aimed to unravel the factors determining C:N ratios of forest floor, mineral soil and peat top soils in more than 4000 plots of the ICP Forests large-scale monitoring network. The first objective was to quantify forest floor, mineral and peat soil C:N ratios across European forests. Secondly we determined the main factors explaining this C:N ratio using a boosted regression tree analysis (BRT), including fifteen site and environmental variables.
   Ninety-five percent of the C:N ratios were between 16 and 44 in the forest floor, between 13 and 44 in the peat topsoil and between 10 and 32 in the mineral topsoil. Within the aerated forest floor and the mineral soil, the C:N ratios decreased with depth, while in the hydromorphic forest floor and the peats no clear trend with depth was observed.
   Tree species was clearly the most important explanatory variable for the C:N ratio in both forest floors and topsoils, while it was soil type in the deeper mineral soil layers. The lowest C:N ratios both in the forest floor and the top mineral soil were found in black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L) stands, both N fixing tree species. While in the forest floor the highest C:N ratios were found in evergreen species like pine, cork oak (Quercus suber L.) and eucalyptus, the pine species and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) showed the highest C:N ratios in the mineral soil. The second most important explanatory variable in the forest floor and mineral topsoil was the biogeographical zoning (ecoregion). In the peat topsoil and in the deeper mineral soil layers it was the humus type. Deposition and climatic variables were of minor importance at the European scale.
   Further analysis for eight main forest tree species individually, showed that the influence of environmental variables on C:N ratios was tree species dependent. For Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Miller) and holm oak (Quercus Hex L.), both with a typical Mediterranean distribution, the relationship between N and S deposition and C:N ratio appeared to be positive. This study suggests that applying C:N ratios as a general indicator of the N status in forests at the European level, without explicitly accounting for tree species, is too simplistic and may result in misleading conclusions.

AB Understanding the determinants of species' niche breadth is important due to the negative relationship between niche breadth and extinction probability. Species tolerant to extremely harsh abiotic conditions (e.g. low pH or hypoxia) often have relatively small realised niches due to a trade-off between abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to extinction. We hypothesised that tolerance to multiple extreme conditions (e.g. low pH, hypoxia and drought) in brown mudfish Neochanna apoda, would increase their realised niche breadth because each extreme would provide additive refuge against a dominant species, the banded kokopu Galaxias fasciatus. Fish distributions were surveyed in 65 peat-swamp-forest streams and pools in New Zealand, which varied in dissolved oxygen, acidity and hydroperiod. Mudfish distribution was extremely patchy, and almost completely allopatric with kokopu. Allopatry was driven mainly by pool hydroperiod; mudfish occupied 88 percent of temporary pools due to their tolerance of habitat drying, whereas kokopu were absent from temporary pools. Within permanent pools, mudfish occurrence was negatively related to pool oxygen and pH, whereas kokopu occurrence was positively related to these conditions. Pool conditions were independently distributed in the landscape, suggesting that each abiotic stressor offered additive refuge for mudfish from kokopu predation/competition. Consequently, the mudfish realised niche breadth depended on the number of abiotic factors driving their allopatry with kokopu. Given the widespread negative relationships between niche breadth and species extinction probabilities, our results indicate that tolerance to multiple stressors may play an important role in insuring species persistence against the multiple drivers of global environmental change.

Gomphandra palustris is known from peat swamp forests in Borneo, Sarawak, G. halconensis is known from the Philippines, Mindoro, Mt Halcon, and G. conklinii from the Philippines, Ifugao Province, Banaue. Gomphandra rarinervis is offered as a new name for Stemonurus puberulus, which was incorrectly synonymised with G. papuana by Sleumer. This commonly collected taxon is known from Madang and Morobe Provinces in Papua New Guinea and does not overlap in distribution with G. papuana.

ID INORGANIC C-14; CARBON; ROOTS
AB The storage of low level radioactive waste in trenches overlying an unconfined groundwater how system in sands has generated a contaminant plume (with chemical characteristics of dilute sanitary landfill leachate) containing C-14 both as dissolved inorganic and organic C. In the groundwater, dissolved organic compounds account, on average, for 22% of the total C and 10% of the C-14. Approximately 300 m from the waste management site, the groundwater discharges to the surface in a wetland containing up to 3 m of peat and an extensive tree cover. Drainage from the wetland passes through a gauged stream. Radiocarbon input to the groundwater discharge area in 1991 was determined to be between 3.3 and 4.2 GBq, based on data from a line of sampling wells along the groundwater input boundary of the wetland, with control provided by water and tritium balance data. During the 1991 study year, only 1.5-2% of both the inorganic and organic C-14 inputs left the wetland in surface water drainage. Vegetation growth in the wetland during the study year contained 8-10% of the released radiocarbon. If the rate of C accumulation in the peat has been constant, 7-9% of the annual radiocarbon input has been retained in the organic soil. Much of this soil accumulation can be attributed to litter from standing vegetation, making distribution coefficients an inappropriate model for C-14 partitioning between groundwater and soil. The plant/soil C-14 concentration ratio was 24 to 33, but application of a concentration ratio to describe the transfer of radiocarbon to plants is also believed to be inappropriate. This study indicates that over 80% of the groundwater radiocarbon is rapidly lost to the atmosphere when the groundwater comes to surface, and we infer that most of the C-14 accumulation in vegetation occurs by CO2 transfer from the air to the plant.

AB This paper documents a continuous similar to 44,000-yr pollen record derived from the Mfabeni Peatland on the Maputaland Coastal Plain. A detailed fossil pollen analysis indicates the existence of extensive Podocarpus-abundant coastal forests before similar to 33,000 call yr BP. The onset of wetter local conditions after this time is inferred from forest retreat and the development of swampy conditions. Conditions during the last glacial maximum (similar to 21,000 cal yr BP) are inferred to have been colder and drier than the present, as evidenced by forest retreat and replacement of swampy reed/sedge communities by dry grassland. Forest growth and expansion during the Holocene Altithermal (similar to 8000-6000 cal yr BP) indicates warm, relatively moist conditions. Previous records from Maputaland have suggested a northward migration of Podocarpus forest during the late Holocene. However, we interpret a mid-Holocene decline in Podocarpus at Mfabeni as evidence of deforestation. Forest clearance during the mid-Holocene is supported by the appearance of Morella serrata, suggesting a shift towards more open grassland/savanna, possibly due to burning. These signals of human impact are coupled with an increase in Acacia, indicative of the development of secondary forest and hence disturbance. (C) 2008 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

ID SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; ERS-1 SAR
AB This publication reports results of an experiment carried out to examine the potential of polarimetric C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for mapping various wetland classes found in the Mer Bleue region (near Ottawa, Canada). The Mer Bleue region was surveyed by the C-band (5.3 GHz) polarimetric (HH, HV, VH, VV) SAR of the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing ( CCRS) at three times within the vegetation season: 16 June (spring flush for vegetation), 6 July (mature growth stage for vegetation) and 3 October 1995 (senescence). Signatures of six different cover types (forested and nonforested peat bog, marsh, open water, clearing and forests) have been derived as a function of incidence angle. Separability between various classes was used to determine the relationships between season(s) and polarization(s) needed to differentiate various wetland classes. A supervised classification was used for wetlands mapping by means of multipolarization data. These investigations demonstrate some of the capabilities of SAR at C-band for mapping wetlands. The cross-polarization data provided the best separation between the observed classes. The October dataset was better suited for discriminating between the classes present than the other periods observed. The overall accuracies of the classification are 73% for June, 73% for July and 86% for October. Classification using a single polarization has been investigated and the results have shown that the HH and cross-polarizations are better than VV polarization. For October, the percentage of all pixels correctly classified is 74% for HH polarization, 76% for cross-polarization, and 59% for VV polarization.
   Investigations were carried out to determine whether temporal changes can be used to increase the information content of single polarization C-band SAR data, which are now available from ERS-2 and RADARSAT satellites. They demonstrated that the use of multitemporal data acquired in June, July and October do not provide a substantial amelioration of the classification of wetlands when the differentiation is not possible in any single period.

AB Despite near-extinction in the nineteenth century, after efficient restoration measures the population of Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber L.) in Latvia currently is viable and growing. While the ecological effect of the species on water quality and biodiversity is generally positive, the high number of animals in production forests often creates challenges for management. Drainage ditches are among the most favoured habitats of beavers resulting in flooded stands, reduced tree growth and economical losses. The aim of the study was to evaluate the chemical properties of water in forest drainage ditches, affected by beaver activity, and their changes after the dam removal. Chemical composition of surface water in ditches was analysed in sampling points above dam, below dam and in the ditch itself after removal of the dam; results compared to pristine beaver site nearby on a small stream. Results did not show significant differences between concentrations above and below dams. After removal of the dams, significant increase in DOC, N-NO3 (-), N-NH4 (+) and TSS concentrations and significant decrease in TP concentrations were observed in some of the sites. Observed concentrations of all measured parameters were significantly lower in pristine beaver site than in beaver sites on drainage ditches.

AB Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.

AB We studied rattan communities in four forest types in Borneo and Java to clarify the pattern of species diversity and vegetation structure. Within six plots of 4.82 ha in total, we found 42 rattan species in six genera with 4,736 stems (>= 20 cm long). There was a significant positive correlation between rattans and trees in species diversity, decreasing in the order mixed dipterocarp (for rattans: Shannon-Wiener diversity index, H' = 2.87-3.34) > alluvial (1.96) > lower montane (1.43) > peat swamp forests (1.34). This pattern coincided with the diversity of the regional flora. The density of rattan stems (ha(-1)) decreased in the order lower montane (5,997) > mixed dipterocarp (598-992) > alluvial (592) > peat swamp forests (162). The maximum height of rattans would be determined by the canopy height, rather than by the maximum tree height. The rattan stem volume ranged from 0.25 to 1.88 m(3) ha(-1) and was not correlated with the stem density. The cool montane climate seemed to decrease the maximum height of rattans, and a few small rattans made denser colonies. Swampy environments apparently suppressed the survival of non-climbing rattans strongly, but that of tall climbing rattans less so.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns in streamwater acidity are ecologically important, but difficult to measure in parallel. Here we present the spatial distribution of streamwater chemistry relevant to acidity from 60 stream sites distributed throughout a 67 km(2) boreal catchment, sampled during a period of winter baseflow (high pH) and during a spring flood episode (low pH). Sites were grouped based on pH level and pH change from winter baseflow to spring flood. The site attributes of each pH group were then assessed in terms of both stream chemistry and subcatchment landscape characteristics. Winter baseflow pH was high throughout most of the stream network (median pH 6.4), but during the spring flood episode stream sites experienced declines in pH ranging from 0-1.6 pH units, resulting in pH ranging from 4.3-6.3. Spring flood pH was highest in larger, lower altitude catchments underlain by fine sorted sediments, and lowest in small, higher altitude catchments with a mixture of peat wetlands and forested till. Wetland-dominated headwater catchments had low but stable pH, while the spring flood pH drop was largest in a group of catchments of intermediate size which contained well-developed coniferous forest and a moderate proportion of peat wetlands. There was a trend with distance downstream of higher pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and base cation concentrations together with lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC, strongly negatively correlated with pH). This apparent scale-dependence of stream chemistry could be explained by a number of environmental factors which vary predictably with altitude, catchment area and distance downstream-most notably, a shift in surficial sediment type from unsorted till and peat wetlands to fine sorted sediments at lower altitudes in this catchment. As a result of the combination of spatial heterogeneity in landscape characteristics and scale-related processes, boreal catchments like this one can be expected to experience high spatial variability both in terms of chemistry at any given point in time, and in the change experienced during high discharge episodes. Although chemistry patterns showed associations with landscape characteristics, considerable additional variability remained, suggesting that the modeling of dynamic stream chemistry from map parameters will continue to present a challenge.

AB The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in alpine soils of the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have unique optical properties. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the photodegradation characteristics of DOM helps in revealing regional DOC dynamics and carbon cycle at the water-land interface in alpine soils. Typical soil samples of the subalpine forest and peat wetland were collected and DOM were extracted and cultivated, ultraviolet-visible absorbance and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with two-dimensional correlation spectrum (2D-COS) and fluorescence regional integration (FRI) were used to characterize the environmental behavior responses to light irradiation. The results showed that the first-order decay constants and photodegradation rates of subalpine forest soil and alpine peat wetland soil were 0.0777 d(-1), 0.0907 d(-1) and 42.06%, 45.47%, respectively. The aromaticity and humification degree of CDOM in alpine soils were decreased with increasing exposure time. The FDOM in alpine soil showed four components (C1-C4), all components degraded in different degrees under light. According to the synchronous and asynchronous map, tyrosine- and tryptophan-like FDOM showed higher susceptibility in subalpine forest soil, while fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like FDOM showed higher susceptibility in alpine peat wetland soil. It confirmed that DOM of alpine soils showed good photodegradation characteristics, light might increase the instability of DOM in alpine soils.

AB Humate-based products have been aggressively marketed as biostimulants that increase plant growth. Little data are available on their effect on tree establishment or their interaction with fertilizer and irrigation regimes. This experiment tested several types of biostimulants on posttransplant growth of Acer rubrum L. (red maple) and Crataegus phaenopyrum (Blume) Hara (Washington hawthorn) trees, both with and without irrigation and fertilization. Soil treatments were applied at planting as: 1) control (native backfill only); 2) compost (native backfill + yard-waste compost); 3) peat (native backfill + Canadian sphagnum peat); 4) granular humate, 100 g/tree; 5) granular humate, 200 g/tree; and 6) liquid humate +, a proprietary liquid mixture of humate, kelp extract, thiamine, and intermediate "metabolites." Irrigation regime x soil treatment interaction was significant for red maple, but soil treatments did not increase height, stem diameter, top dry mass, or root length. For Washington hawthorn, soil treatments did not increase height, stem diameter, or root length, but top dry mass in all treatments as a group and in humate-treated trees in particular was greater than that of controls. Roots of peat-treated trees of both species were longer than those in other treatments. Granular humate applied at 200 g/tree increased total root length more than did 100 g/tree in Washington hawthorn but not in red maple. Fertilizing at planting with N at 14.5 g.m(-2) had no effect on any parameter measured for either species.

ID RUNOFF; PEAT; ENGLAND
AB It is increasingly recognised that the management of land and the management of water are strongly interdependent, and that integrated management approaches are needed. There is evidence that modern land management practices have an effect on runoff generation in rural upland areas, so there is the potential to use land management control as a tool in flood risk mitigation programmes. Flooding from historical extreme rainfall events must be considered when designing mitigation programmes, especially if the designs have to take into account the possibility that such events will become more frequent in the future.
   The largest 90 min rainfall ever recorded in the UK was 117 mm, recorded in 1967 in the Dunsop tributary (25 km(2)) of the Hodder catchment, northwest England. Extensive land management changes have recently been made in the catchment, including peat restoration, tree planting and reductions in sheep stocking density, and the analysis of the flooding in 1967 has been undertaken as part of a wider study on the potential impact of the recent changes.
   A method is demonstrated in which maps of sensitivity are plotted which show how peak flows for extreme events are affected by spatial patterns of changes in runoff generation. This method uses a gridded model for runoff generation containing an embedded hydraulic model of the river network which can calculate sensitivities efficiently and accurately using reverse algorithmic differentiation. The modelling examines the sensitivity of the hydrograph peak at the catchment outlet to changes in flashy runoff generation, which can be affected by land management practices including the blocking of open drainage channels in peat moorland. It is concluded that, as a result of hydraulic and geomorphologic dispersion in the network, changes in land management that affect the flashiness of runoff generation at small scales would probably have had only a relatively minor effect on the flow peaks at the outlet from the catchment during the 1967 extreme event.

AB The distribution and ecological impacts of plant-associated fungi is determined in large part by their degree of specificity for particular host species or environmental conditions. Here we evaluate the host and habitat preferences among the Aphyllophorales, a guild of wood-decay basidiomycete fungi usually considered to be host generalists. We determined the patterns of host association in three well-defined, floristically distinct, tropical wetlands - freshwater forested wetlands, saltwater mangrove forests, and peatlands with scattered trees - on the islands of Kosrae and Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. Of 33 fungal species, 20 were locally rare. of the 11 species sufficiently common to evaluate habitat specificity, nine showed significant habitat preferences. of eight species common enough to evaluate within-habitat host specificity, six showed strong host preferences. All except one of the nine habitat-specialized fungi showed either statistically significant host specificity or strong numerical biases toward single host species. Our results suggest that host preferences may be important in shaping the assemblages of wood-decay fungi and that the effect of environment on the distribution of susceptible plant species, rather on the fungi themselves, may ultimately drive the apparent habitat specificity of many fungi.

AB The distribution of modern diatom assemblages in surficial sediments of 64 Labrador (Canada) lakes across broad vegetational biomes was studied in order to explore species-environment relationships and to develop transfer functions for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The study sites were situated along a latitudinal gradient (51degrees27' to 57degrees37' N) and classified according to six catchment vegetation types: wetland (peatland) forest, spruce/fir forest, lichen woodland, forest-tundra, coastal tundra, and tundra. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that among 28 environmental variables determined for each site, water colour and alkalinity accounted for most of the variance in the diatom data. Using weighted-averaging partial least squares techniques, we developed transfer functions for inference of water colour (CLR) (r(jack)(2) = 0.85, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.18log(CLR + 1) or 1.51 Pt units) and alkalinity (ALK) (r(jack)(2) = 0.63, RMSEP = 0.25log(ALK + 1) or 1.78 mueq.L-1) from the percent abundance of the 132 most abundant diatom taxa. By determining diatom distribution in relation to more detailed vegetation types within the boreal forest zone (wetland forest, spruce/fir forest, and lichen woodland), this calibration data set demonstrated the potential of these assemblages for revealing more subtle changes in lake catchment vegetation over time.

AB For confidently estimating the amount of carbon stored in boreal forest soil, better knowledge of smaller regions is needed,In order to estimate the amount of soil C in forests on mineral soil in Finland, i.e. excluding peatland forests, and illustrate the regional patterns of the storage, statistical models were first made for the C densities of the organic and 0-1 m mineral soil layers. A forest type, which indicated site productivity, and the effective temperature sum were used as explanatory variables of the models, In addition, a constant C density was applied for the soil layer below the depth of 1 m on sorted sediments. Using these models the C densities were calculated for a total of 46673 sites of the National Forest Inventory (NFI). The amount of the soil C was then calculated in two ways: 1) weighting the C densities of the NFI sites by the land area represented by these sites and 2) interpolating the C densities of the NFI sites for 4 ha blocks to cover the whole land area of Finland and summing up the blocks on forested mineral soil. The soil C storage totalled 1109 Tg and 1315 Tg, when calculated by the areal weighting and the interpolated blocks, respectively. Of that storage, 28% was in the organic layer, 68% in the 0-1 m mineral soil layer and 4% in the layer below 1 m. The total soil C equals more than two times the amount of C in tree biomass and 20% of the amount of C in peat in Finland. Soil C maps made using the interpolated blocks indicated that the largest soil C reserves are located in central parts of southern Finland. The C storage of the organic layer was assessed to be overestimated at largest by 13% and that of the 0-1 m mineral soil layer by 29%. The largest error in the organic layer estimate is associated with the effects of forest harvesting and in the mineral soil estimate with the stone content of the soil.

AB The effect of ditching of boreal (Finnish) peat-rich forest land on leaching patterns of phosphorus and nitrogen was assessed using a paired catchment approach (response stream + control stream) for a 4 + 1 year study period. After the ditching operations, the leaching of the organic nitrogen (TON) decreases, while that of the inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) and phosphorus (total reactive P and total non-reactive P) increases. The TON does not decrease as much as TOC does, indicating that the pool of organic material being leached after the ditching is enriched in nitrogen. The increased leaching of ammonium and nitrate after ditching is related most likely to ammonification and nitrification processes in peat biomass after the release of excess surface water. The behaviour of P is complex. The data indicate that the major controls of the determined P fractions are the Fe redox chemistry and the behaviour of Fe hydroxides.

AB Artificial drainage (ditching) is widely used to increase timber yield in northern forests. When the drainage systems are maintained, their environmental impacts are likely to accumulate over time and along accompanying management, notably after logging when new forest develops on decayed peat. Our study provides the first comprehensive documentation of long-term ditching impacts on terrestrial and arboreal biodiversity by comparing natural alder swamps and second-generation drained forests that have evolved from such swamps in Estonia. We explored species composition of four potentially drainage-sensitive taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, and snails), abundance of species of conservation concern, and their relationships with stand structure in two-ha plots representing four management types (ranging from old growth to clearcut). We found that drainage affected plot-scale species richness only weakly but it profoundly changed assemblage composition. Bryophytes and lichens were the taxonomic groups that were most sensitive both to drainage and timber-harvesting; in closed stands they responded to changed microhabitat structure, notably impoverished tree diversity and dead-wood supply. As a result, natural old-growth plots were the most species-rich and hosted several specific species of conservation concern. Because the most influential structural changes are slow, drainage impacts may be long hidden. The results also indicated that even very old drained stands do not provide quality habitats for old-growth species of drier forest types. However, drained forests hosted many threatened species that were less site type specific, including early-successional vascular plants and snails on clearcuts and retention cuts, and bryophytes and lichens of successional and old forests. We conclude that three types of specific science-based management tools are needed to mitigate ditching effects on forest biodiversity: (i) silvicultural techniques to maintain stand structural complexity; (ii) context-dependent spatial analysis and planning of drained landscapes; and (iii) lists of focal species to monitor and guide ditching practices.

AB The effect of tree (lodgepole pine) planting with and without intensive drainage on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was assessed after 45 yr at a raised peatbog in West Flanders Moss, central Scotland. Fluxes of CO2 CH4 and N2O from the soil were monitored over a 2-yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO2 and CH4 effluxes which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. Effluxes of N2O were low and no significant differences were observed between the treatments. Annual CH4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP < uDP < uDuP < n-pris with mean annual effluxes over the 2-yr monitoring period of 0.15, 0.64, 7.70 and 22.63 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. For CO2, effluxes increased in the order uDP < DP < npris < uDuP, with mean annual effluxes of 1.23, 1.66, 1.82 and 2.55 kgCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. CO2 effluxes dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76-98 %), and only in the n-pris site was CH4 a substantial contribution (23 %). Based on soil effluxes only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43% higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH4 effluxes and the DP treatment had 33% higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO2 effluxes. Restoration is likely to increase CH4 emissions, but reduce CO2 effluxes. Our study suggests that if estimates of CO2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees.

AB Moose Alces alces is abundant throughout the boreal zone. However, in the landscapes occupied by moose the density of predators and human influence often vary considerably, as do the arrival of spring and phenology of vegetation - all crucial factors for moose, especially during their calving period.
   During calving, female moose are faced with a dilemma between choosing a habitat offering high quality forage or one offering protection for the vulnerable calf. This study examined the timing of calving and habitat structure of female moose during and after calving in two areas of Finland with different predator and human densities. Data from 14 GPS-collared moose were integrated with data on landscape composition and forest structure from airborne Lidar.
   In both study areas, calves were born in May and mostly in drained forests (with ditches) on peatland soils. After giving birth, females in the more human-influenced landscape moved to more fertile forests on mineral soils, whereas the females in the landscape with little human influence stayed mostly on the drained and pine-dominated peatland forests, which also had less shrub vegetation. Moose were also seen giving birth near human settlements (farms) and staying close to them (<500 m) throughout summer. Thus, females in both study areas illustrated a high degree of adaptability by selecting the highly modified drained landscapes or areas near humans for calving sites over other available landscapes.

SO BALTIC FORESTRY

DT Article
DE young broadleaved stands of natural origin; forest stand structure
AB The structure of 2 to 9-year-old natural origin broadleaved stands is analyzed, using the method of component analysis. The stands under study represent natural regrowth of trees in fertile cutovers of dry mineral, wet mineral, wet peatland, drained mineral, and drained peatland forest growing conditions. For analyzing the internal structure of young stands the following traits are used: a) the forest stand before felling and the forest adjoining the cutover - 22 traits; b) the structure of ground cover vegetation in cutover - 31 traits; c) the structure of young stand and soil characteristics - 45 traits. The results of component analysis show that the 160 young stands of the age from 2 to 9 years ought to be treated as a single population that could be denoted by a common term - young stands in fertile forest types.
   The initial density of natural origin broadleaved stands is notably high: in 89 % of the stands surveyed the number of stems exceeded 10,000 trees/ha while in individual cases it exceeded 120,000 trees/ha. The number tree stems shooting up naturally does not depend on the cutover width. As it follows from the analysis of stand structure (species composition and height), in a cutover the young stand may form a variety of biogroups. Because of significant differences in biogroup structure a unified thinning regime is not suitable for the whole site. In such cases the tending of young broadleaved stands ought to follow the biogroups of particular tree species.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the release of phosphorus (P) to receiving waters resulting from harvesting 34-year-old lodgepole pine trees in an upland peat catchment. The study site was within a 25.3-hectare (ha) area, and was drained by a stream that received flows from ploughed furrows, mainly, via collector drains, and discharged directly to the salmonid Shrahrevagh River, Burrishoole, Co. Mayo, Ireland. The study site was divided into two parts: the upstream part was left intact and the downstream part was harvested in early Autumn 2005 following implementation of forest guidelines. Good management practices such as proper use of brash mats and harvesting only in dry weather were implemented. Two instrumented stations were established - one just upstream (US) and the other just downstream (DS) of the clearfelled area. The measurement of P concentrations at the two stations commenced in May 2005, two months before the harvesting started. The daily mean P concentration at the DS station increased from about 6 mu g L-1 of total reactive phosphorus (TRP) during pre-clearfelling to 429 mu g L-1 in August 2006. By October 2009, four years after clearfelling, the P concentrations at the DS station had returned to pre-clearfelling levels. In the first three years after harvesting, up to 5.15 kg ha(-1) of TRP was released from the harvested catchment to the receiving water; in the second year alone, 2.3 kg ha(-1) of TRP was released. Linear regression can be used to describe the relationship between TRP load and water discharge. About 80% of the total phosphorus (TP) in the study stream was soluble and more than 70% of the P release occurred in storm events, indicating that traditional buffer strips with widths of 15-20 m might not be efficient for P immobilization. The P concentrations were affected by antecedent weather conditions and highest concentrations occurred during storm events following prolonged drought periods. The water extractable phosphorus (WEP) contents in the soil were significantly higher below windrow/brash material than in brash-free areas, and whole-tree harvesting should be studied as one of the means to decrease P export from blanket peats.

AB Magellanic Sub-Antarctic streams run through steep, low-altitude mountainous gradients characterized by a topography that supports a mosaic of evergreen, mixed, and deciduous forests, peat lands, and scrublands. Here, the macroinvertebrate fauna and their ecological interactions are poorly known. This study linked the distribution, community composition, and functional feeding structure of benthic macroinvertebrates with physicochemical and thermal patterns along the altitudinal gradient of a Magellanic Sub-Antarctic watershed. Invertebrates were collected during the austral summers of 2008, 2009, and 2010 at five different altitudes. Our results indicate that benthic macroinvertebrate community distributions are predominantly affected by temperature and certain species show distribution restrictions through the altitudinal gradient studied. Temperature profiles indicate that this Sub-Antarctic watershed is characterized by a sharp thermal gradient, in which cumulative degree-days (A degrees C) per year sharply increase through a relatively short altitudinal gradient (0-600 m above sea level). With the results from this study, we can now study thermal tolerances of altitude-restricted species or project changes in their distributions and voltinism patterns according to climate change scenarios. Ecosystems at higher latitudes and altitudes are experiencing some of the fastest rates of warming on the planet, and Magellanic Sub-Antarctic watersheds could be considered as "sentinel systems," providing early warning of wider scale change.

AB Context Spatial patterns of CH4 fluxes can be modeled with remotely sensed data representing land cover, soil moisture and topography. Spatially extensive CH4 flux measurements conducted with portable analyzers have not been previously upscaled with remote sensing. Objectives How well can the CH4 fluxes be predicted with plot-based vegetation measures and remote sensing? How does the predictive skill of the model change when using different combinations of predictor variables? Methods We measured CH4 fluxes in 279 plots in a 12.4 km(2) peatland-forest-mosaic landscape in Pallas area, northern Finland in July 2019. We compared 20 different CH4 flux maps produced with vegetation field data and remote sensing data including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and digital terrain model (DTM). Results The landscape acted as a net source of CH4 (253-502 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and the proportion of source areas varied considerably between maps (12-50%). The amount of explained variance was high in CH4 regressions (59-76%, nRMSE 8-10%). Regressions including remote sensing predictors had better performance than regressions with plot-based vegetation predictors. The most important remote sensing predictors included VH-polarized Sentinel-1 features together with topographic wetness index and other DTM features. Spatial patterns were most accurately predicted when the landscape was divided into sinks and sources with remote sensing-based classifications, and the fluxes were modeled for sinks and sources separately. Conclusions CH4 fluxes can be predicted accurately with multi-source remote sensing in northern boreal peatland landscapes. High spatial resolution remote sensing-based maps constrain uncertainties related to CH4 fluxes and their spatial patterns.

AB Forest harvesting, especially when intensified harvesting method as whole-tree harvesting with stump lifting (WTHs) are used, may increase mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) leaching to recipient water courses. The effect can be enhanced if the underlying bedrock and overburden soil contain Hg. The impact of stem-only harvesting (SOH) and WTHs on the concentrations of Hg and MeHg as well as several other variables in the ditch water was studied using a paired catchment approach in eight drained peatland-dominated catchments in Finland (2008-2012). Four of the catchments were on felsic bedrock and four on black schist bedrock containing heavy metals, Although both Hg and MeHg concentrations increased after harvesting in all treated sites according to the randomized intervention analyses (RIAs), there was only a weak indication of a harvest-induced mobilization of Hg and MeHg into the ditches. Furthermore, no clear differences between WTHs and SOH were found, although MeHg showed a nearly significant difference (p = 0.06) between the harvesting regimes. However, there was a clear bedrock effect, since the MeHg concentrations in the ditch water were higher at catchments on black schist than at those on felsic bedrock. The pH, suspended solid matter (SSM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and iron (Fe) concentrations increased after harvest while the sulfate (SO4-S) concentration decreased. The highest abundances of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were found on the sites with high MeHg concentrations. The biggest changes in ditch water concentrations occurred first 2 years after harvesting.

TI THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS FOR THE LAND BIRDS OF SOUTHERN
   FINLAND
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Protected areas (nature reserves) cover 0.7% of the land area in southern Finland (162,000 km2), which belongs to the south- and mid-boreal coniferous forest zones. The value of these areas in preserving land birds was studied on the basis of quantitative censuses. The numbers of bird pairs were estimated in nature reserves and in the whole of southern Finland, and the significance of the reserves was evaluated based on bow large a proportion of the total population in southern Finland was found in them. Forest habitat generalists and species of coniferous forests occurred in protected areas as expected by the proportion of these areas in southern Finland Specimens of these species groups comprise two thirds of all the country's land birds. Species of old-growth forests and open peatlands clearly preferred protected areas, whereas species of bushes, and lush and deciduous forest were scarcer in protected areas than elsewhere in southern Finland The latter fertile habitats are poorly represented in protected areas, even though due to their disappearance or alteration elsewhere several species confined to these habitats have declined and are even threatened. Drainage of open peatlands and clear cutting of old-growth forests has caused a decrease in the area of these habitats in southern Finland during the past decades. Therefore, protected areas have a high significance in preserving bird species preferring these habitats. Protected areas are particularly important for decreased species of old-growth forests, such as the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus and the Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus, as about 10% of their total population in southern Finland was estimated to breed in protected areas. The future protection of both old-growth and deciduous forests is important if we are to preserve biodiversity of land birds in Finland

AB The effect of potash fertilizers with a high (potassium chloride) and low (potassium sulfate) content of chlorine on the physiological processes of spruce and pine, depending on the water regime of peat soil is studied. The introduction of potassium chloride as a mineral fertilizer for trees in peat soil leads to the potassium and chlorine accumulation in the needles. Chlorine accumulates in large quantities (more than 50 %) in plants in drained soil, where the roots are well supplied with oxygen. Potassium chloride rapidly passes into the soil solution in waterlogged soil, and is carried out of the rooting horizon; so the substantial chlorine accumulation in the tree parts does not occur. The combined introduction of potassium chloride and nitrogen does not lead to the chlorine accumulation in spruce and pine, as a result of the antagonistic relationships between chlorine and nitrogen. Measuring the concentration of pigments, photosynthesis intensity, and the state of the energy-converting system demonstrates a significant decrease of these physiological parameters of plants, enriched by phosphorus-potassium fertilizers, in comparison with plants, fertilized by phosphorus only. These data suggest that the main cause of the violation of physiological and growth processes in plants is the negative effect of chloride ions on the chloroplasts; since we observe their intensification in the sites with the phosphorus introduction. The combining use of potassium chloride and potassium sulfate as a mineral fertilizing of trees confirms the assumption of a negative effect of chloride ions on woody plants, which is particularly intensified in the drained soil. The use of potassium chloride as a mineral fertilizer for trees in order to increase their productivity without the participation of nitrogen is the undesirable and even harmful forest management activity. This leads to the fact that the effectiveness of complex fertilizers for woody plants with chlorine-containing potash fertilizers is significantly reduced.

TI ESTIMATING RELEASE OF CARBON FROM 1990 AND 1991 FOREST-FIRES IN ALASKA

AB An improved method to estimate the amounts of carbon released during fires in the boreal forest zone of Alaska in 1990 and 1991 is described. This method divides the state into 64 distinct physiographic regions and estimates areal extent of five different land covers: two forest types, peat land, tundra, and nonvegetated. The areal extent of each cover type was estimated from a review of topographic maps of each region and observations on the distribution of forest types within the state. Using previous observations and theoretical models for the two forest types found in interior Alaska, models of biomass accumulation as a function of stand age were developed. Stand age distributions for each region were determined using a statistical distribution based on fire frequency, which was from available long-term historical records. Estimates of the degree of biomass combusted were based on recent field observations as well as research reported in the literature. The location and areal extent of fires in this region for 1990 and 1991 were based on both field observations and analysis of satellite (advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR)) data sets. Estimates of average carbon release for the two study years ranged between 2.54 and 3.00 kg m(-2), which are 2.2 to 2.6 times greater than estimates used in other studies of carbon release through biomass burning in boreal forests. Total average annual carbon release for the two years ranged between 0.012 and 0.018 Pg C yr(-1), with the lower value resulting from the AVHRR estimates of fire location and area.

AB The carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of five different peatland systems across Europe with a wide gradient in land use intensity, water table depth, soil fertility and climate was simulated with the process oriented CoupModel. The aim of the study was to find out whether CO2 fluxes, measured at different sites, can be explained by common processes and parameters or to what extend a site specific configuration is needed. The model was calibrated to fit measured CO2 fluxes, soil temperature, snow depth and leaf area index (LAI) and resulting differences in model parameters were analyzed. Finding site independent model parameters would mean that differences in the measured fluxes could be explained solely by model input data: water table, meteorological data, management and soil inventory data.
   Seasonal variability in the major fluxes was well captured, when a site independent configuration was utilized for most of the parameters. Parameters that differed between sites included the rate of soil organic decomposition, photosynthetic efficiency, and regulation of the mobile carbon (C) pool from senescence to shooting in the next year.
   The largest difference between sites was the rate coefficient for heterotrophic respiration. Setting it to a common value would lead to underestimation of mean total respiration by a factor of 2.8 up to an overestimation by a factor of 4. Despite testing a wide range of different responses to soil water and temperature, rate coefficients for heterotrophic respiration were consistently the lowest on formerly drained sites and the highest on the managed sites. Substrate decomposability, pH and vegetation characteristics are possible explanations for the differences in decomposition rates.
   Specific parameter values for the timing of plant shooting and senescence, the photosynthesis response to temperature, litter fall and plant respiration rates, leaf morphology and allocation fractions of new assimilates, were not needed, even though the gradient in site latitude ranged from 48 degrees N (southern Germany) to 68 degrees N (northern Finland) differed largely in their vegetation. This was also true for common parameters defining the moisture and temperature response for decomposition, leading to the conclusion that a site specific interpretation of these processes is not necessary. In contrast, the rate of soil organic decomposition, photosynthetic efficiency, and the regulation of the mobile carbon pool need to be estimated from available information on specific soil conditions, vegetation and management of the ecosystems, to be able to describe CO2 fluxes under different conditions.

AB Following the introduction of the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) to Ireland in 1911, the species quickly established and spread to cover the eastern half of Ireland. Historically, the River Shannon has delineated the western boundary of its distribution in Ireland, however the factors limiting the spread of the species westwards were unclear. The aims of this study were to assess the current squirrel distribution in the area directly bordering the River Shannon, and to identify habitat types and landscape characteristics that could be facilitating or impeding the spread of grey squirrels in Ireland. The current distribution was established through hair tube and live trapping surveys and through sightings from a citizen science survey. Grey squirrels are absent or in very low numbers in much of the study area. In some areas, red squirrels have reappeared where they previously had been displaced by the grey squirrel. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify significant differences in habitat types and landscape characteristics between a region with high grey squirrel occurrence records and a region where they are now rare. Several landscape attributes were found to be significantly different, including the presence of pine marten, water bodies, peatland and coniferous forests. The area in which grey squirrels have disappeared overlaps with the core pine marten population range, and in a landscape that is more fragmented than the areas in which grey squirrel are continuing to be invasive. The demise of the grey squirrel in Ireland is more widespread than previously believed.

AB Significant progress has been made on the investigation of Quaternary submerged prehistory in the British Isles. Mainly through collaboration with industry, a considerable knowledge base has been developed on the distribution and nature of preserved palaeolandscapes of the last 1 million years in UK waters. A diverse array of material has been recovered from the seabed including bone and stone artefacts, extinct fauna, peat deposits, submerged forests and other remnants of relict landscapes from around the British Isles. Archaeological sites are rarer but Palaeolithic and Mesolithic examples are providing critical resources to reinterpret early prehistory in association with Quaternary palaeogeography.

AB The behaviour of different ashes was predicted by the combination of extended fuel analysis with advanced global thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The extended fuel analysis is a fractionation method that consists of sequential leaching of a solid fuel with water, ammonium acetate and hydrochloric acid. In order to cover a broad spectrum of fuels a coal, a peat, a forest residue and Salix (i.e. willow) were studied. The last was taken with and without soil contamination, i.e. with a high and low content of silica, respectively.
   Results from the fractionation showed clear differences in mineral distribution in the fuels. More ash-forming elements were present as included minerals in the older fuels. In relatively young fuels, almost half of the inorganic material was found in the soluble fractions after leaching with water and ammonium acetate. Fouling and slagging predictions based on the combined use of the extended fuel analysis and the advanced global equilibrium analysis indicated that no ash-related problems should be expected in FBC boilers firing the studied coal. The peat that was studied could cause minor ash depositions in the flue gas channel at temperatures above 700 degrees C. The studied forest residue could form fly ash deposits in the flue gas channel at temperatures between 600 and 860 degrees C. The Salix could cause fly ash depositions at temperatures between 840 and approximately 1000 degrees C. If soil contamination was present as well, Salix could cause bed sintering at temperatures above 1030 degrees C. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite supporting the highest biodiversity on Earth, tropical rainforests are undergoing intensive economic development. In particular, the island of Borneo has lost over 56 % of original lowland forest to resource extraction, fires, and illegal logging. Its rainforests contain 16 primate species, which serve as excellent 'umbrella' taxa for conservation initiatives. The genus Presbytis (Colobinae) is well represented across Borneo by four endemic species (P. chrysomelas; P. frontata; P. hosei, and P. rubicunda), but remains relatively understudied. Using ecological niche modelling, I calculated the distributions of the 12 Bornean Presbytis subspecies; evaluated habitat loss between 2000 and 2010, and examined the current land-use policies across remnant distributions. Subspecies experienced a mean 12.7 % (N = 12 sp.) habitat reduction over the 10 year period. 12.5 % of all habitats were allocated for conversion to oil palm and industrial tree plantations, while logging concessions accounted for a mean 26.3 % across distributions. While the current protected area networks encompassed an average 33.4 % of distributions, most PAs are underfunded, degraded and threatened by logging and mining operations. I therefore recommend priority gazetting of unallocated lands to new PAs within the distribution of Presbytis chrysomelas and Presbytis hosei sabana, which have experienced the highest forest loss in the last 10 years (22-50 %) and are critically endangered. Logging concessions appear to be at least as effective in maintaining forest cover as PAs and have the economic advantage for effective management, but may have detrimental effects to monkey populations. I recommend an urgent assessment of the effects of selective logging practices on species' persistence, and further recommend population surveys to quantify the populations of critically endangered and data deficient subspecies.

AB Cranberry blues (Agriades optilete) are butterflies of conservation interest worldwide. Less than 20 populations are known in Alberta, Canada, mostly inhabiting boreal forests that are increasingly fragmented by oil sands developments and subject to wildfires. We modeled the abundance of cranberry blues in the boreal forests of Alberta's Wood Buffalo Region as a function of forest characteristics, presence of disturbances associated with in situ oil sands exploration, and wildfire disturbance, while accounting for butterfly detectability as a function of sampling conditions. We counted 188 cranberry blues during 1280 samples, discovering 14 unknown populations using a species distribution model based on forest wetness and canopy height. Probability of detection peaked around 5th July, and at higher temperatures and in the absence of wind, with cranberry blues preferring wetter treed peatland forests with low canopy heights. Seismic lines were positively related to the abundance of cranberry blues (400% increase), while exploratory well pads and wildfires were negatively related (60% and 90% loss, respectively). Overall, cranberry blue populations are small and locally sensitive to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Despite a narrow habitat specificity, cranberry blues seem more widely distributed than previously thought in northern Alberta (57% of the study area deemed suitable).

AB The spatial distribution of lake-water pH near the Horne smelter in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada, is affected not only by industrial sulphur dioxide emissions, but also by other anthropogenic and natural factors. Regional calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits from glacial lakes Barlow and Ojibway provide buffering capacity. Locally, some kettle lakes are buffered by silicate weathering. Small mines, tailings, and natural sources of acidity (e.g. peat basins, forested catchment areas with acidic soils) also contribute to lake acidification. Interpreting the modern regional distribution of lake-water pH, ranging from 3.7 to 9.3 in 99 lakes, is equivocal in this area where wind-transported emissions and buffering from calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits can yield similar spatial trends. However, in a parallel study, diatom assemblages have been used as bio-indicators of past lake-water pH since they respond to temporal shifts in environmental conditions, including take-water acidity. The historical pH reconstructions for two lakes within a 100-km radius of Rouyn-Noranda suggest that they were naturally acidic before industrialization and have further acidified. Lac de la Pepiniere was naturally acidic in the 1800s (PH 5.5) and reached a pH of 4.8 by 1998; its increased rate of acidification since 1927 corresponds to the beginning of mining and smelting operations.

AB The results of studies into the aerosol optical depth (AOD) for the atmosphere in the Middle Urals in the spectrum range of 0.34-1.02 mu m for 2004-2010 is presented. The interannual, annual, seasonal, and daily variations in the AOD are analyzed. The major statistical characteristics of the AOD, the parameters of the probability density function of distributions over different wave lengths, and the parameters of Angstrom's formula for the different seasons are calculated. The monitoring stations in the Russian segment of the AERONET network are ranked with respect to the AOD value. A shift from March to May in the spring maximum of the AOD is revealed in comparison with the results of the actinometric observations for the period of 1960-1986. A qualitative assessment is given to the influence of forest and peat fires in the region on the AOD. A classification of the states of aerosol haze in the atmosphere according to the AOD values is proposed.

AB Three incidental sightings of the flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps, a Little-known species, were made in south-east Sumatra. Sightings were on lowland floodplains in two distinct habitats, primary peat swamp forest and secondary lowland forest, the latter suggesting some tolerance to modified habitats. Sightings were along or near waterways. A dead adult male found in Berbak National Park is the first confirmed record for the park. Morphometrics of this individual were consistent with other published measurements for the species. Museum specimens indicate a wide historic distribution in south-east Sumatra. Recent information confirms the species's presence in protected areas of eastern, southern and western Sumatra, although this is mostly limited to presence/absence data, and the conservation status and habitat requirements of the species in south-east Sumatra are unknown. Regional degradation of riparian habitats and the isolation of protected areas warrant concern for the conservation status of the species.

AB Bernardo O'Higgins National Park (BONP) is the largest protected area in Chile and southern hemisphere. With over 3.5 million hectares, it has a complex continental and archipelagic topography with a mosaic of evergreen forests, coastal scrub and peatlands. Given the future of the Chilean environmental legislation, all protected areas will be re-evaluated according to scientific parameters. Therefore, and considering that insects are currently recognized by the Chilean law, we aim at providing information on the spatial distribution of beetles using pitfall traps in 20 sites associated with the park. We evaluate the effect of vegetation and type of environment (insular, continental) on taxonomic composition, richness, abundance and diversity of beetles. A total of 15 families, 33 genera and 38 species were recorded. Many of these represent monotypic groups. The most diverse families were Carabidae, Staphylinidae and Curculionidae. No significant effect of vegetation and type of environment on any community measurement was observed since the vegetation and sectors analyzed are part of a larger biogeographic unit. Additionally, we determined 11 species to the park, which are significantly associated among them. We discuss the importance of this kind of information to make biogeographical approaches.

TI Wood-decaying fungi in old-growth boreal forest fragments: extinctions

ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; DIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; LICHENS
AB According to ecology theory, isolated habitat fragments cannot maintain populations of specialized species. Yet, empirical evidence based on monitoring of the same fragments over time is still limited. We studied the colonization-extinction dynamics of eight wood-decaying fungal species in 16 old-growth forest fragments (<14 ha) over a 20-year period (1997-2017). We observed 19 extinctions and 5 colonizations; yet, the distribution of extinctions and colonizations did not differ from the one expected by chance for any of the species. Twenty-six percent of the extinctions took place in two natural fragments amid large forest-peatland complexes. Phellinus nigrolimitatus (Romell) Bourdot and Galzin decreased and Phellinus ferrugineofuscus (P. Karst.) Bourdot increased in abundance (number of logs occupied). The volume of living spruce trees in the forest fragments correlated positively with the number of logs inhabited in five of the study species. Because fragment characteristics did not affect species turnover, it seems that stochastic processes governed colonizations and extinctions. Although the least abundant species in 1997 had declined, and the most abundant species had become more abundant, it appears that specialized wood-decaying fungi can persist for decades in isolated old-growth forest fragments, if suitable dead wood is continuously available.

AB Research throughout Europe has indicated the continuing reductions in acidic aerial deposition and associated improvements in freshwater pH. However, information on macroinvertebrate responses to these on-going changes is rare. During 2009, 2010 and 2011, 34 peat-dominated catchments in three geologically distinct acid-sensitive regions of Ireland were sampled for macroinvertebrates (6 occasions) and chemistry (3 seasons) to assess the effects of reduced sulphate and nitrate deposition in an ecoregion with historically low acidic deposition. Streams drained moorland catchments without forest, catchments with 20%-50% (low) and catchments with forest cover and > 50% (high) forest cover. Results indicate ecological improvements have occurred in many forested catchments when compared with findings in the early 1990s, especially on metamorphic and igneous geologies. However, episodically low pH (< 5.7) and high inorganic aluminium concentrations (> 150 mu g l(-1)), associated with storm-flow events, resulted in periods of ecological degradation. Nevertheless, the reductions in ecological health appeared seasonal, associated with antecedent hydrochemistry and climate. Interestingly, acid-sensitive Baetidae were present in the majority of forested streams in Ireland, owing to the recent improvements in water quality. However, caution must be advised as there are still many hydrochemical and ecological uncertainties in peat-soil forested catchments, owing to the high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, climate change and changes to catchment management.

AB Biochar can be an effective sorbent material for removal of nutrients from water due to its high specific surface area, porous structure, and high cation and anion exchange capacity. The aim of this study was to test a biochar reactor and to evaluate its efficiency in runoff water purification and consecutive nutrient recycling in clear-cut peatland forests. The goodness of the method was tested in a meso-scale (water volume thousands of liters) reactor experiment by circulating runoff water through wood biochar-filled columns and by determining water nutrient concentrations in the column inlet and outlet. The pseudo-first and second order kinetic models were fitted to the experimental data and the adsorption rate (K-dd) and maximum adsorption capacity (Q(max)) of the biochar reactor were quantified. The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) decreased by 58% during the 8-week experiment; the majority of TN adsorption occurred within the first 3 days. In addition, NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations decreased below the detection limit in 5 days after the beginning of the experiment. The maximum adsorption capacity of the biochar reactor varied between 0.03-0.04 mg g(-1) biochar for NH4-N, and was equal to 0.02 mg g(-1) biochar for TN. The results demonstrated that the biochar reactor was not able to adsorb TN when the water TN concentration was below 0.4 mg L-1. These results suggest that a biochar reactor can be a useful and effective method for runoff water purification in clear-cut forests and further development and testing is warranted. Unlike traditional water protection methods in peatland forestry, the biochar reactor can effectively remove NO3-N from water. This makes the biochar reactor a promising water protection tool to be tested in sites where there is the risk of a high rate of nutrient export after forest harvesting or drainage.

AB The article outlines progress in Finnish forest research since Lauri Ilvessalo presented his review in 1927. Some fields of research which already possessed a firm basis 70 years ago are still found to be important. A number of studies had proved the suitability of Cajander's system of forest types for forest site classification; later research has mainly confirmed the validity of its use in Finnish conditions. The National Forest Inventory first carried out in the early 1920s has resulted in a continuous monitoring of forest resources. Data are now available for a wide range of forest and environmental applications. Research has also been an essential tool in helping Finnish forestry to meet new challenges. For example, the drainage of peatland forests and improved silviculture have resulted in great increase in forest production, while advances in forest technology have made efficient and environmentally friendly timber harvesting possible in new and sometimes difficult circumstances.

AB We studied concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the eutrophic Temmesjoki River and Estuary in the Liminganlahti Bay in 2003-2004 and evaluated the atmospheric fluxes of the gases based on measured concentrations, wind speeds and water current velocities. The Temmesjoki River was a source of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere, whereas the Liminganlahti Bay was a minor source of CH4 and a minor source or a sink of CO2 and N2O. The results show that the fluxes of greenhouse gases in river ecosystems are highly related to the land use in its catchment areas. The most upstream river site, surrounded by forests and drained peatlands, released significant amounts of CO2 and CH4, with average fluxes of 5,400 mg CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) and 66 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1), and concentrations of 210 mu M and 345 nM, respectively, but N2O concentrations, at an average of 17 nM, were close to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration. The downstream river sites surrounded by agricultural soils released significant amounts of N2O (with an average emission of 650 mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1) and concentration of 22 nM), whereas the CO2 and CH4 concentrations were low compared to the upstream site (55 mu M and 350 nM). In boreal regions, rivers are partly ice-covered in wintertime (approximately 5 months). A large part of the gases, i.e. 58% of CO2, 55% of CH4 and 36% of N2O emissions, were found to be released during wintertime from unfrozen parts of the river.

AB In July 2010, several hundred forest and peat fires broke out across central Russia during its hottest summer on record. Here, we analyze these wildfires using observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH) total columns are presented for the year 2010. Maximum total columns were found to be one order (for CO and HCOOH) and two orders (for NH3) of magnitude larger than typical background values. The temporal evolution of NH3 and HCOOH enhancement ratios relative to CO are presented. Evidence of secondary formation of HCOOH is found, with enhancement ratios exceeding reported emission ratios in fresh plumes. We estimate the total emitted masses for the period July-August 2010 over the center of western Russia; they are 19-33 Tg (CO), 0.7-2.6 Tg (NH3) and 0.9-3.9 Tg (HCOOH). For NH3 and HCOOH, these quantities are comparable to what is emitted in the course of a whole year by all extratropical forest fires.

AB The paper presents some results of the study on aerosol variability in the period from 2003 to 2011 over the Eastern Europe region, with latitude ranging from 40 degrees N to 60 degrees N and longitude from 20 degrees E to 50 degrees E. The analysis was based on the POLDER/PARASOL and POLDER-2/ADEOS satellites and AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) ground-based sun photometer observations. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of the studied area is characterized by values (referenced to 870 nm wavelength) ranging from 0.05 to 0.2, except for in the period of July-August 2010 with strong forest and peat wildfires when the AOT typical values range from 0.3 to 0.5 according to both retrievals. The analysis of seasonal dynamics of aerosol loading has revealed two AOT high value peaks. The spring peak observed in April-May is the result of solitary transportation of Saharan dust in the atmosphere over Eastern Europe, infrequent agricultural fires, transportation of sea salt aerosols by southern winds to Ukraine and Moldova from the Black and Azov seas. The autumn peak in August-September is associated with forest and peat wildfires, considerable transportation of Saharan dust and the presence of soil dust aerosols due to harvesting activity. The maximum values of AOT are observed in May 2006 (0.1-0.15), April 2009 (0.07-0.15) and August 2010 (0.2-0.5). Furthermore, the study has identified a distinct pattern of anthropogenic aerosols over the industrial areas, especially in central Ukraine and eastern Belarus as well as Moscow region in Russia.
   The comparison of the AOT derived by standard algorithm POLDER/PARASOL with those recomputed from AERONET inversions for fine mode particles with radius < 0.3 mu m was performed over several AERONET sites. The correlation coefficients for the POLDER/AERONET AOT retrieval comparisons are equal: 0.78 for Moscow site, 0.76 -Minsk, 0.86 -Belsk, 0.81 -Moldova (period 2005-2009), 0.93 - Kyiv and 0.63 for Sevastopol sites (2008-2009). The deviations are explained by the spatial inhomogeneity of the surface polarization that has a stronger effect on aerosol retrieval for clear atmospheric conditions with low aerosol loading when surface impact on satellite observations is more pronounced. In addition, the preliminary analysis of the detailed aerosol properties derived by a new generation PARASOL algorithm was evaluated. The comparison of AOT and single scattering albedo retrieved from the POLDER/PARASOL observations over Kyiv with the closest AERONET retrievals within 30 min of satellite overpass time and with a cloudless day shows acceptable agreement of the aerosol dynamics. The correspondence of those data is observed even for extreme AOT440 value 1.14, which was caused by the forest and peat fires in August 2010.

AB Lichens are often given insufficient consideration in nature conservation, even though they are highly threatened. Here, we analyze the lichen flora of Germany with an emphasis on their occurrence in habitat groups. We distinguished the following habitat groups: high mountain range above the tree line, open rock habitats in highlands, coasts, waters, peatlands, forests (summarized to natural landscape), semi-cultivated land, cultivated land and settlement area (summarized to cultivated landscape). The occurrence and threat status of lichen species were analyzed with respect to their habitats, substrates and distribution.
   The main habitat of 75 % of the lichen species in Germany is in natural landscapes. The number of lichens in forests is high (656 species = 32 % of the lichen flora) and open rock habitats in mountainous regions are also important for lichens (454 species = 22 % of the lichen flora, without alpine vegetation).
   The proportion of extinct and threatened lichen species in forests (56 % of 656 species) is much higher than the proportion of extinct and threatened higher plants in forests (14 % of 851 species). In dry semi-cultivated land, the threat status of both groups is high (lichens: 52 % of 288 species, higher plants: 42 % of 696 species are extinct or endangered). In alpine vegetation, similar numbers of lichens of and higher plants occur, but the proportion of extinct and threatened lichens (29 % of 294 species) is higher than those of higher plants (11 % of 302 species). In contrast to higher plants, various substrate types and special habitat sites and structures are important for lichens. We found a high threat status of epiphytic and terricolous lichens, with the proportion of extinct and threatened lichens at about 60 % in each case.
   Among the endangered lichens of the distribution type V (med-temp. subatl; 67 % of 251 species are extinct or endangered), there are many species dependent on old-growth forests and with limited dispersal ability. The high proportion of threatened lichen species of distribution type I (temp/mo-alp-arkt) in Germany (46 % of 459 species) is likely a product of multiple factors, including atmospheric emissions, land use change and climate change. Due to their specific properties, habitat requirements and threats against them, lichens of both natural and cultural landscapes need more attention in nature conservation work.

AB Rapid encroachment on woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) habitat by resource extraction industries toil, gas, forestry, and peat) is occurring throughout northern Alberta, Canada. The effect of this human development on the movement and distribution of threatened woodland caribou remains poorly understood. We captured and fitted 36 woodland caribou with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. These yielded 43,415 locations during the 12-month study period. We tested the hypothesis that woodland caribou use areas adjacent to wellsites, roads, and seismic lines as often as thc) use areas away fi om these developments. We analyzed caribou locations, controlling for vegetation cover classes to remove confounding effects of habitat, and grouped to examine seasonal variation in distribution. Caribou avoided human developments: the level of avoidance appeared to be related to the level of human activity in the stud) area. We recorded maximum avoidance distances of 1,000 m (wells) and 250 m (roads and seismic lines). By extrapolating avoidance distances to the entire study area, we calculated that 22-48% of our study area would receive reduced use by caribou. Avoidance effects were highest during late winter and calving and lowest during summer, possibly as a result of lower traffic levels then. We propose management strategies to balance caribou conservation with resource extraction in northern Alberta.

AB Atmospheric nutrients have recently gained considerable attention as a significant additional source of new nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading to the ocean. The effect of atmospheric macro nutrients on marine productivity depends on the biological availability of both inorganic and organic N and P forms. During October 2006, the regional smoke haze episodes in Southeast Asia (SEA) that resulted from uncontrolled forest and peat fires in Sumatra and Borneo blanketed large parts of the region. In this work, we determined the chemical composition of nutrients in aerosols and rainwater during hazy and non-hazy days to assess their impacts on aquatic ecosystem in SEA for the first time. We compared atmospheric dry and wet deposition of N and P species in aerosol and rainwater in Singapore between hazy and non-hazy days. Air mass back trajectories showed that large-scale forest and peat fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan were a significant source of atmospheric nutrients to aquatic environments in Singapore and SEA region on hazy days. It was observed that the average concentrations of nutrients increased approximately by a factor of 3 to 8 on hazy days when compared with non-hazy days. The estimated mean dry and wet atmospheric fluxes (mg/m(2)/day) of total nitrogen (TN) were 12.72 +/- 2.12 and 2.49 +/- 1.29 during non-hazy days and 132.86 +/- 38.39 and 29.43 +/- 10.75 during hazy days; the uncertainty estimates are represented as 1 standard deviation (1 sigma) here and throughout the text. The estimated mean dry and wet deposition fluxes (mg/m2/day) of total phosphorous (TP) were 0.82 +/- 0.23 and 0.13 +/- 0.03 for non-hazy days and 7.89 +/- 0.80 and 1.56 +/- 0.65 for hazy days. The occurrences of higher concentrations of nutrients from atmospheric deposition during smoke haze episodes may have adverse consequences on receiving aquatic ecosystems with cascading impacts on water quality.

TI Impact of wildfires on SO2 detoxification mechanisms in leaves of oak

AB Frequency and intensity of wildfire occurrences are dramatically increasing worldwide due to global climate change, having a devastating effect on the entire ecosystem including plants. Moreover, distribution of fire-smoke can influence the natural environment over very long distances, i.e. hundreds of kilometres. Dry plant matter contains 0.1-0.9% (w/w) sulphur, which is mainly released during combustion into the atmosphere as sulphur dioxide (SO2) resulting in local concentrations of up to 3000 nL L-1. SO2 is a highly hazardous gas, which enters plants mostly via the stomata. Toxic sulphite is formed inside the leaves due to conversion of SO2. Plants as sessile organisms cannot escape from threats, why they evolved an impressive diversity of molecular defence mechanisms. In the present study, two recent wildfires in Germany were evaluated to analyse the effect of SO2 released into the atmosphere on deciduous trees: the Meppen peat fire in 2018 and the forest fire close to Luebtheen in 2019. Collected leaf material from beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus robur) was examined with respect to detoxification of sulphur surplus due to the exposure to elevated SO2. An induced stress reaction in both species was indicated by a 1.5-fold increase in oxidized glutathione. In beech leaves, the enzymatic activities of the sulphite detoxification enzymes sulphite oxidase and apoplastic peroxidases were increased 5-fold and a trend of sulphate accumulation was observed. In contrast, oaks did not regulate these enzymes during smoke exposure, however, the constitutive activity is 10-fold and 3-fold higher than in beech. These results show for the first time sulphite detoxification strategies of trees in situ after natural smoke exposure. Beech and oak trees survived short-term SO2 fumigation due to exclusion of toxic gases and different oxidative detoxification strategies. Beeches use efficient upregulation of oxidative sulphite detoxification enzymes, while oaks hold a constitutively high enzyme-pool available. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrothermal processes are key components of permafrost dynamics and hydrological and carbon cycles in northern forest ecosystems. A forest hydrology model. ForHyM, was used to evaluate these processes by determining how the depth and duration of frost penetration into the soil would vary daily over the course of several decades. This was done for chosen upland/wetland conditions within the Mackenzie Plain south of Fort Simpson, where permafrost is currently sporadic to discontinuous. The model calculations were done using daily weather records from November 1963 to 2010, starting with a hypothetical no-frost condition within the soil and subsoil. Model performance was evaluated by comparing modeled and measured temperatures at different soil depths (upland and peat plateau modelling, R-2 = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). It was found that well-drained upland forests within the general area would experience deep and complete freeze thaw cycles each year. In contrast, poorly drained wetlands would develop gradually deepening permafrost that would at first stabilize in depth over the course of 10 to 20 y, with thaw depth limited to <1 m each year. However, recent increases in recorded air temperature (more so in winter than in summer) would destabilize the pennafrost layer, and this would especially occur in areas with insufficient surface insulation by local peat, moss, forest litter, and snow accumulations. These estimates are consistent with (i) reported thawing depths and the widening encroachment of collapse scars towards the poorly drained portions of the South Mackenzie Plain.

AB Forests with high above-ground biomass (AGB), including those growing on peat swamps, have historically not been thought suitable for biomass mapping and change detection using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, by integrating L-band (lambda = 0.23 m) SAR from the ALOS and lidar from the ICESat Earth-Observing satellites with 56 field plots, we were able to create a forest biomass and change map for a 10.7 Mha section of eastern Sumatra that still contains high AGB peat swamp forest. Using a time series of SAR data we estimated changes in both forest area and AGB. We estimate that there was 274 +/- 68 Tg AGB remaining in natural forest (>= 20m height) in the study area in 2007, with this stock reducing by approximately 11.4% over the subsequent 3 years. A total of 137.4 kha of the study area was deforested between 2007 and 2010, an average rate of 3.8% yr(-1).
   The ability to attribute forest loss to different initial biomass values allows for far more effective monitoring and baseline modelling for avoided deforestation projects than traditional, optical-based remote sensing. Furthermore, given SAR's ability to penetrate the smoke and cloud which normally obscure land cover change in this region, SAR-based forest monitoring can be relied on to provide frequent imagery. This study demonstrates that, even at L-band, which typically saturates at medium biomass levels (ca. 150 Mg ha(-1)), in conjunction with lidar data, it is possible to make reliable estimates of not just the area but also the carbon emissions resulting from land use change.

AB The Akatore Fault comprises the onshore leading edge of the Otago reverse fault-fold belt, part of the outboard zone of Australia-Pacific plate continental collision in the South Island. We examine stratigraphic and sedimentologic evidence of late Holocene reverse faulting along the Akatore Fault, and use radiocarbon dating to constrain fault rupture events and associated uplift of the Akatore fault block. Two fault rupture events are recorded in swamps on the downthrown, upstream side of the fault, as forest and/or peat horizons buried by silt, dated at post-3800 yr BP and 1150-1000 yr BP. The latest event coincides with the timing of uplift of a 3 m marine terrace on the coast, and the uplift of a second (6 m) is tentatively correlated to the penultimate event. The terrace height data, together with the amount of offset of alluvial gravels resting on the fluvial strath surface at the blocked swamp sites, suggests an average of 3 m of throw per uplift event. Distribution of throw along the fault suggests that the last event was not symmetrical about the centre of the scarp in the manner of the long-term throw. Offset of the third highest marine terrace, dated at 80 ka, can be wholly accounted for by the Holocene events, suggesting a period of quiescence between 80 000 and 3800 yr BP.

AB We study the water vapor (WV) content over European Russia (ER) during the period of forest and peatbog fires in July-August 2010 using total column water vapor observations from MODIS instruments (both Aqua and Terra platforms) as well as aerological data and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. It is found that the spatial distribution of total column water vapor (TCWV) over ER in this period was anomalous, with the WV excess in the north of the territory and its deficit in the south of ER. The relationship between WV variations, atmospheric dynamics and the fire situation is analyzed. Along with the processes of the WV advection and evaporation we evaluate the contribution of pyrogenic emission of WV in spatial-temporal evolution of WV over ER during wildfires. The changes of water vapor at different heights in the troposphere and stratosphere are investigated. The results of a comparative analysis of WV contents during the periods of summertime atmospheric blockings in 1972 and 2010 are also presented. The near-infrared total-column precipitable water MODIS products (L3) are validated by upper-air radiosonde data.

AB Five species of slow lorises were once considered to comprise a single strongly polymorphic species, Nycticebus coucang, ranging throughout South and Southeast Asia. The cryptic nature of these nocturnal primates has led to a lack of understanding of their distribution patterns and abundance. In short surveys, often few if any lorises are detected, meaning that the few available density estimates are from long-term studies. Based on new research in Sebangau National Park, Borneo, and compilation of survey data from other areas, we provide the first comparative abundance estimates for all five slow loris species: N. coucang occurred in significantly higher abundances (median encounter rate 0.80/km: n = 15), than N. bengalensis (0.26/km; n = 12), or N. javanicus (0.11/km: n = 2), N. menagensis (0.02/km: n = 3), and N. pygmaeus (0.13/km: n = 4). Abundance estimates in Sebangau (0.19/km) did not increase with increasing survey effort, but for all species and studies combined, study duration was positively correlated with abundance estimates. We did not find a relation between abundance and body mass, nor between abundance and latitude. Long-term studies are more likely to be conducted at sites where the species of interest is particularly plentiful. The data suggest that slow lorises occur at low abundances throughout much of their range, and some in larger social groups than previously assumed. We recommend taking into account the species' heterogeneous distribution (potentially requiring larger survey effort), their social structure, the use of red lights as opposed to white lights whilst surveying, and to make use of their vocalisations when surveying slow lorises.

AB Mineral soil topography is difficult to describe in boreal regions because of the thick overlying organic layer despite its presumed importance in determining where and at what rate an organic layer will accumulate (paludification). The overall purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between mineral soil topography and OLT at the landscape scale. More specifically, these relationships can be used to map the distribution and spatial variability of paludification across the landscape, thereby exploring the potential to discriminate between the two commonly known paludification types (permanent and reversible). Seven topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, mean curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature and topographic wetness index) were generated from a digital elevation model that we developed for the mineral soil surface (MS-DEM). OLT data were collected from field measurements across the landscape by manual probing and values varied from 5 to 150 cm. The MS-DEM was generated by subtracting OLT field values from the corresponding LiDAR-derived elevation values. Most correlations between OLT and individual predictor variables were weak and illustrated that OLT and its landscape-scale distribution cannot be explained by simple bivariate relationships. Consequently, two regression tree-based models were developed using: (1) only the seven mineral soil topographic variables, and (2) all predictor variables (mineral soil topography and surficial deposits). Mineral soil slope was the most important variable for both models and corresponded to the first level of splitting the dataset into homogenous landscape units in terms of organic layer thickness. Surficial deposit, topographic wetness index (TWI) and aspect were also related to OLT and proved to be contributing to the development of the two models.
   Model 1 explained 034 of the OLT variability and offer simple models with few landscape units that are easy to interpret. Model 1 splitting rules allowed the combination of different maps (slope, TWI and aspect) for producing a landscape units map, on which OLT was determined and related to increasing paludification categories. A good overall accuracy of 74% was achieved for this map. Model 2 was the best model in terms of estimate quality (R-adj(2) = 0.52). Both models were successful in discriminating highly paludified landscape units. Except for one landscape unit that was assigned to permanent paludification type, both models were unable to further subdivide more landscape units into reversible and permanent paludification, suggesting that both of these types interact within the same landscape unit. This study demonstrated that the combination of topographic information from remotely sensed LiDAR data and field OLT measurement data has the potential to be useful for defining both promising and vulnerable areas for forest management.

AB Extensive portions of the southern Everglades are characterized by series of elongated, raised peat ridges and tree islands oriented parallel to the predominant flow direction, separated by intervening sloughs. Tall herbs or woody species are associated with higher elevations and shorter emergent or floating species are associated with lower elevations. The organic soils in this "Ridge-and-Slough" landscape have been stable over millennia in many locations, but degrade over decades under altered hydrologic conditions. We examined soil, pore water, and leaf phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) distributions in six Ridge and Slough communities in Shark Slough, Everglades National Park. We found P enrichment to increase and N to decrease monotonically along a gradient from the most persistently flooded sloughs to rarely flooded ridge environments, with the most dramatic change associated with the transition from marsh to forest. Leaf N:P ratios indicated that the marsh communities were strongly P-limited, while data from several forest types suggested either N-limitation or co-limitation by N and P. Ground water stage in forests exhibited a daytime decrease and partial nighttime recovery during periods of surface exposure. The recovery phase suggested re-supply from adjacent flooded marshes or the underlying aquifer, and a strong hydrologic connection between ridge and slough. We therefore developed a simple steady-state model to explore a mechanism by which a phosphorus conveyor belt driven by both evapotranspiration and the regional flow gradient can contribute to the characteristic Ridge and Slough pattern. The model demonstrated that evapotranspiration sinks at higher elevations can draw in low concentration marsh waters, raising local soil and water P concentrations. Focusing of flow and nutrients at the evapotranspiration zone is not strong enough to overcome the regional gradient entirely, allowing the nutrient to spread downstream and creating an elongated concentration plume in the direction of flow. Our analyses suggest that autogenic processes involving the effects of initially small differences in topography, via their interactions with hydrology and nutrient availability, can produce persistent physiographic patterns in the organic sediments of the Everglades.

AB Bioindicators could act as early warning indicators of environmental changes, ecosystem stress or taxonomic diversity. Pseudoscorpions have rarely been used as bioindicators, due to lack of information about their ecology, habitat selection, niche preferences and requirements, especially in southern Nothofagus forests. We studied the distribution and abundance of a pseudoscorpion species, Neochelanops michaelseni (Simon 1902), in different vegetation types (Nothofagus antarctica and N. pumilio forests, grasslands and peatlands) and examined how this species responded to different forest uses (harvesting and silvopastoral management), to explore its utility as a bioindicator. The study was conducted on long-term plots located at two ranches in Tierra del Fuego, using pit-fall traps during one summer. Neochelanops michaelseni abundance was higher in Nothofagus forests than in open ecosystems, which could be attributed to their affinity for litter and coarse woody debris. In N. pumilio forests, the pseudoscorpions were sensitive to harvesting, with similar abundances in harvested forests (aggregated and dispersed retentions) and grasslands. In N. antarctica forests, differences were not detected among unmanaged and silvopastoral managed forests, probably due to higher understory plant growth, and lesser diminishing of litter and debris by thinning than by harvesting. We conclude that the pseudoscorpion, N. michaelseni, can be a good bioindicator for ecosystem conservation and for evaluating recovery rate in the ecological conditions of impacted Nothofagus forests, and that management practice intensities should be regulated to create more suitable habitats for pseudoscorpion diversity conservation.

AB Pollen analysis was carried our on peat profiles from small forest hollows at four sires in southern Sweden in order to investigate the establishment of Fagus sylvatica at the stand-scale. Viewed on a continental scale the migration pattern of Fagus can be correlated with climatic change, but at finer scales such a correlation is weaker. Ar the stand-scale there are factors other than climate that are crucial for the establishment of Fagus (e.g., disturbance, seed dispersal, human activities). The establishment of Fagus does not show any regional coherence in southern Sweden, and this may imply that climate was not the limiting factor for its establishment. Fagus seeds are highly dependent on ground disturbance for successful establishment. A semi-open cultural landscape may be optimal for Fagus establishment, as cultural activities may create conditions particularly suitable for its regeneration. At two of the studied sites cultural activities probably created conditions that favoured the establishment of Fagus at 400 and 900 BP respectively. At the other sires the local forest stands were relatively unaffected by cultural activities prior to the establishment of Fagus at 950 BP and 1450 BP respectively, where, fires (natural?) or slight human influence were effective. The present-day distribution of Fagus in southern Sweden suggests migration with a discontinuous front and outlying populations, and this model probably applies to its past distribution. This type of migration means that the landscape becomes filled in by dispersal from outlying stands. The timing of stand-scale establishment is then largely influenced by site-specific factors and chance. Fagus may still be migrating northwards in Sweden. It grows well in its outlying area, and it seems that present-day land use, not climate, is the limiting factor for the local expansion of Fagus. The northern distribution limits of Fagus probably still represent an active front, and outlying stands act as 'infection centres'.

AB Context Although there is a need to develop a spatially explicit methodological approach that addresses the social importance of cultural ecosystem services for regional planning, few studies have analysed the spatial distribution on the cultural ecosystem services based on social perceptions.
   Objective The main objective of this study was to identify cultural ecosystem service hot-spots, and factors that characterize such hot-spots and define the spatial associations between cultural ecosystem services in Southern Patagonia (Argentina).
   Methods The study was carried out in Southern Patagonia (243.9 thousand km 2) located between 46 degrees and 55 degrees SL with the Andes mountains on the western fringe and the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern fringe of the study area. The study region has a range of different vegetation types (grasslands, shrub-lands, peat-lands and forests) though the cold arid steppe is the main vegetation type. We used geo-tagged digital images that local people and visitors posted in the Panoramio web platform to identify hot-spots of four cultural ecosystem services (aesthetic value, existence value, recreation and local identity) and relate these hot-spots with social and biophysical landscape features.
   Results Aesthetic value was the main cultural service tagged by people, followed by the existence value for biodiversity conservation, followed by local identity and then recreational activity. The spatial distribution of these cultural ecosystem services are associated with different social and biophysical characteristics, such as the presence of water bodies, vegetation types, marine and terrestrial fauna, protected areas, urbanization, accessibility and tourism offer. The most important factors are the presence of water in Santa Cruz and tourism offer in Tierra del Fuego.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that this methodology is useful for assessing cultural ecosystem services at the regional scale, especially in areas with low data availability and field accessibility, such as Southern Patagonia. We also identify new research challenges that can be addressed in cultural ecosystem services research through the use of this method.

AB Litter quality and environmental effects on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) fine woody debris (FWD) decomposition were examined in three forestry-drained peatlands representing different site types along a climatic gradient from the north boreal (Northern Finland) to south (Southern Finland) and hemiboreal (Central Estonia) conditions. Decomposition (percent mass loss) of FWD with diameter <= 10 mm (twigs) and FWD with diameter > 10 mm (branches) was measured using the litter bag method over 1-4-year periods. Overall, decomposition rates increased from north to south, the rate constants (k values) varying from 0.128 to 0.188 year(-1) and from 0.066 to 0.127 year(-1) for twigs and branches, respectively. On average, twigs had lost 34%, 19% and 19%, and branches 25%, 17% and 11% of their initial mass after 2 years of decomposition at the hemiboreal, south boreal and north boreal sites, respectively. After 4 years at the south boreal site the values were 48% for twigs and 42% for branches. Based on earlier studies, we suggest that the decomposition rates that we determined may be used for estimating Scots pine FWD decomposition in the boreal zone, also in upland forests. Explanatory models accounted for 50.4% and 71.2% of the total variation in FWD decomposition rates when the first two and all years were considered, respectively. The variables most related to FWD decomposition included the initial ash, water extractives and Klason lignin content of litter, and cumulative site precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration. Simulations of inputs and decomposition of Scots pine FWD and needle litter in south boreal conditions over a 60-year period showed that 72 g m(-2) of organic matter from FWD vs. 365 g m(-2) from needles accumulated in the forest floor. The annual inputs varied from 5.7 to 15.6 g m(-2) and from 92 to 152 g m(-2) for FWD and needles, respectively. Each thinning caused an increase in FWD inputs, Up to 510 g m(-2), while the needle inputs did not change dramatically. Because the annual FWD inputs were lowered following the thinnings, the overall effect of thinnings on C accumulation from FWD was slightly negative. The contribution of FWD to soil C accumulation, relative to needle litter, seems to be rather minor in boreal Scots pine forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study employed image enhancement for LANDSAT TM and ALOS imagery to monitor the changing status of coastal resources from 2001 to 2011, object-based classification of high-resolution THEOS imagery to extract fish cage culture sites and interpolation methods to determine marine environmental quality in 2011 in the northern part of Phu Quoc Island. There were five classes in the study site: natural forest, Melaleuca forest, agriculture, peat and built-up areas. Agricultural land and Melaleuca forest changing into built-up areas constituted approximately 51.13% of the total area changing. The benthic seagrass habitat increased dramatically from 2001 to the end of 2010. Besides, marine culture has been concerned to cage culture which is one of the sources directly affecting aquatic life and water quality in coastal environment. Cage culture locations were detected using high-resolution imagery as THEOS data for image fusion and Object-based Image Analysis methods. Water quality criteria including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined by interpolation method, and the spatial distribution of these parameters showed a concentration in the study area in the range from 0.17 to 0.49 mg/L, 0.012 to 0.073 mg/L and 0.26 to 1.046 g/L, respectively.

AB Conservation benefits from understanding how adaptability and threat interact to determine a taxon's vulnerability. Recognizing how interactions with humans have shaped taxa such as the critically endangered orangutan (Pongo spp.) offers insights into this relationship. Orangutans are viewed as icons of wild nature, and most efforts to prevent their extinction have focused on protecting minimally disturbed habitat, with limited success. We synthesize fossil, archeological, genetic, and behavioral evidence to demonstrate that at least 70,000 years of human influence have shaped orangutan distribution, abundance, and ecology and will likely continue to do so in the future. Our findings indicate that orangutans are vulnerable to hunting but appear flexible in response to some other human activities. This highlights the need for a multifaceted, landscape-level approach to orangutan conservation that leverages sound policy and cooperation among government, private sector, and community stakeholders to prevent hunting, mitigate human-orangutan conflict, and preserve and reconnect remaining natural forests. Broad cooperation can be encouraged through incentives and strategies that focus on the common interests and concerns of different stakeholders. Orangutans provide an illustrative example of how acknowledging the long and pervasive influence of humans can improve strategies to preserve biodiversity in the Anthropocene.

AB Episodic surface water acidification is common in many regions worldwide; the driving processes are dependent on a variety of physicochemical and climatic characteristics, and acid deposition pressures, which have changed significantly over the last two decades. This study provided a unique opportunity to re-examine the drivers of acidity in an environment of low anthropogenic input. In three geologically distinct acid-sensitive regions of Ireland during 2009-2010, 34 headwater streams were evaluated in peat-dominated catchments draining moorlands without forest, 20-50% (low) forest cover and >50% (high) forest cover. Results indicated episodic acidity/alkalinity loss in headwater streams, despite significant reductions in acid deposition. Both the differences in pH between base and storm-flow (Delta pH) and the number of pH events <= 5.5 were higher in forested streams. Dissolved organic carbon and inorganic aluminium concentrations were also higher in forested catchments. The primary driver of acidity was strong organic anions, which generally increased with increasing forest cover. Base-cation dilution was also prominent in west and southern regions, while surprisingly chlorine anion acidity from sea-salts had little or no influence on stream acidity. The contributions of excess non-marine sulphate (xSO(4)) and nitrate (NO3) to storm-water were low, with no observed increases in xSO(4) with increasing forest cover, although contributions of NO3 were higher in forested catchments in the east. The results suggest that episodic acidification in Ireland is primarily driven by organic acids. However in peat dominant catchments, plantation forest, climate change and/or reductions in xSO(4) appear to also be having an effect on stream pH from increased DOC, with some forested streams previously unaffected by deposition now showing low pH (<5.5) during storm-flow. As quantified from this study, observed changes in stream acidification in Ireland may provide a better understanding of future chemical responses to declining acid deposition and climate change elsewhere.

AB This study investigates the growth of forest stands (m(3)ha(-1)a(-1)) and its temporal variation during the five decades of the period 1961-2010 as measured in the national forest inventories by the Finnish Forest Research Institute, in three regions, comprising the southern half of Finland. This growth was explained by sum of the effective temperatures and winter maximum soil frost depth; the correlation coefficient between the measured and modelled growths for the regions and decades studied being 0.97. It was also shown that the regional differences in soil frost depth are related to the differences between the temperature sum in the air and that in the upper soil layer during the growing season. Further, the residuals of the main test were analyzed for secondary factors. The temporal and regional variation could be accounted for by the relatively low growth in the peatland-forests created by the extensive drainage measures of 1961 1980, the response of the growth-rate to May+June precipitation, and the extensive application of fertilizers in 1968 1980. The regional differences and temporal changes in climate are also reflected in the understorey vegetation.

AB Current emissions inventories of black carbon aerosol, an important component of PM2.5 and a powerful climate altering species, are highly uncertain in both space and time. One of the major and hardest to constrain sources of black carbon is fire, which comes from a combination of forest, vegetation, agricultural, and peat sources. Therefore, quantifying this source more precisely in both space and time is essential. While there is a growing body of work on this topic, the best estimations generally underestimate measurements by integer factors. In this work, 12 years of measurements from 2000 through 2012 of AOD from the MISR satellite and AOD and AAOD from the AERONET network, are used to evaluate the aerosol climatology from Southeast Asian fires. First, the fires in Southeast Asia are uniquely characterized in both space and time to reveal two major burning regions: one with a regular inter-annual and intra-annual distribution, and the other with an irregular inter-annual and somewhat variable intra-annual distribution. These patterns correspond well with regional and local measurements of both composition and meteorology. Using these newly developed relationships, a new temporally and spatially varying set of black carbon emissions is developed. Finally, the best fits with the various measurements yield an annual average value for black carbon emissions due to fires bounded by the range 0.36-0.54 Tg yr(-1), with the amount in the year of the greatest fires being bounded by the range 1.2-1.8 Tg yr(-1). These magnitudes are significantly higher and differently distributed in space and time when compared with current inventories, and therefore are expected to have a significant impact on regional particulate loadings and the global climate system.

AB It is uncommon to collect long-term coordinated hydrometeorological and hydrological data in northern circumpolar regions. However, such datasets can be very valuable for engineering design, improving environmental prediction tools or detecting change. This dataset documents physiographic, hydrometeorological and hydrological conditions in the Baker Creek Research Watershed from 2003 to 2016. Baker Creek drains water from 155 km(2) of subarctic Canadian Shield terrain in Canada's Northwest Territories. half-hourly hydrometeorological data were collected each year, at least from April to October, from representative locations, including exposed Precambrian bedrock ridges, peatlands, open black spruce forest and lakes. Hydrometeorological data include radiation fluxes, rainfall, temperature, humidity, winds, barometric pressure and turbulent energy fluxes. Terrestrial sites were monitored for ground temperature and soil moisture. Spring maximum snowpack water equivalent, depth and density data are included. Daily streamflow data are available for a series of nested watersheds ranging in size from 9 to 128 km(2). These data are unique in this remote region and provide scientific and engineering communities with an opportunity to advance understanding of geophysical processes and improve infrastructure resiliency. The data described here are available at: https://doi.org/10.20383/101.026.

AB In the temperate climate of northeast Germany, a trade-off exists between water use in agricultural crop production and groundwater recharge which is important for urban water supply, irrigation, forestry and peat protection. The APSIM-Nwheat model was used to analyze the impact of climate change scenarios on deep drainage (DD), the water loss below the maximum root zone as the main source of groundwater recharge, and wheat production for two main soil types. A linear and a nonlinear climate scenario were used in this study: The linear scenario for 2001-2050 was based on a simple linearly modified historical climate record from 1951 to 2000. The nonlinear scenario used the same 1951-2000 historical climate record but combined it nonlinearly with a Global Circulation Model climate scenario for 2001-2050. Simulation results showed different distributions of deep drainage and grain yield with the linear and nonlinear scenarios, but no difference in the 50-year averages. Hence, a linear manipulation of climate records can be as effective for climate change impact studies on deep drainage and grain yield as nonlinearly manipulated climate data, if long-term average changes are of main interest. The simulation results indicated that a trade-off between deep drainage and grain yields can be potentially controlled through N management. However, such control mechanism was more effective under current climate conditions than under future climate and on a better water-holding silt soil compared to a poorer water-holding loamy sand. It is suggested that areas with poor water-holding soils should be managed extensively for groundwater recharge harvesting while better water-holding soils should be used for high input grain production.

AB An important asset for the management of wild ungulates is recognizing the spatial distribution of forage quality across heterogeneous landscapes. To do so typically requires knowledge of which plant species are eaten, in what abundance they are eaten, and what their nutritional quality might be. Acquiring such data, however, may be difficult and time consuming. Here, we are proposing a rapid and cost-effective forage quality monitoring tool that combines near infrared (NIR) spectra of fecal samples and easily obtained data on plant community composition. Our approach rests on the premise that NIR spectra of fecal samples collected within low population density exclosures reflect the optimal forage quality of a given landscape. Forage quality can thus be based on the Mahalanobis distance of fecal spectral scans across the landscape relative to fecal spectral scans inside exclosures (referred to as DISTEX). The Gi* spatial autocorrelation statistic can then be applied among neighboring DISTEX values to detect and map "hot spots" and "cold spots" of nutritional quality over the landscape. We tested our approach in a heterogeneous boreal landscape on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations over the landscape have ranged from 20 to 50 individuals/km(2) for at least 80 years, resulting in a loss of most palatable and nutritious plant species. Our results suggest that hot spots of forage quality occur when old-growth balsam fir stands comprise >39.8% of 300 ha neighborhoods, whereas cold spots occur in laggs (i.e., transition zones from forest to peatland). In terms of ground-level indicator plant species, the presence of Canada bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) was highly correlated with hot spots, whereas tamarack (Larix laricina) was highly correlated with cold spots. Mean DISTEX values were positively and significantly correlated with the neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin contents of feces. While our approach would need more independent field trials before it is fully validated, its low cost and ease of execution should make it a valuable tool for advancing both the basic and applied ecology of large herbivores.

LA English
DT Article
AB Embankment and subsequent reclamation of coastal salt marshes in The Netherlands started about 1000 years ago. Thousands of km2 of salt marshes have been reclaimed since that time. In about the same period, reclamation of inland peat moors and swamp forests by improving drainage started, again resulting in the reclamation of thousands of kM2    mainly in the center of the present-day Netherlands. A few centuries later, another technology was applied to pump dry lakes to gain new agricultural land at the former lake bottom. The embankment and reclamation of wetlands culminated in the 20th century Zuiderzee and Delta projects. However, since the 1960s opposition to the loss of wetlands gradually mounted and finally resulted in changing the nature of some major projects under way and the abandonment of several other projects. It is likely that wetland reclamation in The Netherlands is a thing of the past. On the contrary, land once reclaimed is changed into wetlands again for nature conservation.

DT Article
DE Spiraea tomentosa; alien species; invasive shrub
AB The steeplebush is a shrub growing naturally in North America. In Europe this species has been cultivated as an ornamental plant since the 18th century. It has been observed in spontaneously developing secondary localities in such countries as Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany. In Poland there are three regions in which Spiraea tomentosa is known to be a permanently established anthropophyte: Puszcza Drawska, Bory Niemodlinskie and Bory Dolnoslaskie forests. The greatest number of localities of this shrub can be found in the extensive area of the latter, where its expansion has caused significant changes in the natural environment and problems in woodland management. Therefore a research was carried out to find what conditions made the steeplebush ready for invasion and what types of plant communities were especially susceptible to it. The information about the distribution of S. tomentosa in the Bory Dolnoslaskie Forest (SW Poland) was collected during field observations in the years 2011-2014. We also verified and used the results of a survey made in 2011 in three forest districts located in the study area: Ruszow, Wegliniec and Wymiarki. The analysis concerned the frequency of the steeplebush in the forest environment in terms of the forest habitat type, species composition, and stand growth stage as well as in non-forest environments like meadows, peatland, margins of drainage ditches, etc. Phytocoenoses in the habitats of humid mixed coniferous forests and humid coniferous forests with mature tree stands dominated by birches or alders were found to be forest communities the most susceptible to colonisation by S. tomentosa. Especially susceptible to steeplebush invasion were also forest cultures on those habitats. Much fewer steeplebush localities were recorded on fresh and mixed coniferous forests as well as fresh broadleaved forests. In a non-forest environments the steeplebush was mostly noted on margins of drainage ditches. The extensive system of such man-made environmental structures in the Bory Dolnoslaskie Forest was found to be the most important factor favouring the expansion of S. tomentosa. Thus, the invasion of the discussed species is primarily determined by a large proportion of humid habitats in a single compact woodland complex connected by a dense network of drainage ditches.

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB Protected Areas in Borneo retain some of the best examples of biodiversity and are the last refuge for wildlife conservation in tropical rainforests. Therefore, understanding the species richness and composition in increasingly fragmented Protected Areas are crucial in wildlife monitoring and management. The recent road construction splitting the oldest wildlife sanctuary in Sarawak has warranted further investigation on the species distribution. Camera trap survey in Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), western Borneo resulted in 20 medium- to large-bodied mammals from 775 independent photos with 2001 camera trap nights from surveys done in 2013-2014 and 2019. SWS records the Endangered Nasalis larvatus and Cynogale bennettii in the current survey. Under the Sarawak Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998, Nasalis larvatus was the only recorded species considered to be Totally Protected while 12 other species are listed as Protected and the remaining species were not listed. The most frequently recorded species were Tragulus spp. (n = 147 in 2013-2014 and n = 166 in 2019) followed by Macaca fascicularis in 2013-2014 with n = 109, and Sus barbatus (n = 93 in 2019). A similar species richness (n = 13) was recorded both near (< 1000 m) and further away from the road (> 1000 m). However, the mean species richness was higher further away from the road (> 1000 m). Herpestes brachyurus, Hemigalus derbyanus, and Echinosorex gymnura were only recorded near the road while Cynogale bennettii, Hystrix brachyura and Nasalis larvatus were only recorded further away from the road. Through the bipartite network analysis, the majority of the medium- to large-bodied mammals are distributed in the mixed dipterocarp forests. Species that have habitats within proximity to the road have a higher risk of mortality due to roadkill and other anthropogenic pressure. Encroachment is an issue in Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary and calls for immediate action; stricter enforcement, regular wide-coverage patrols along the river, and on the road to prevent illegal logging, commercial planting, and hunting.

AB Baker Creek drains water from subarctic Canadian Shield terrain comprised of a mix of exposed Precambrian bedrock, lakes, open black spruce forest and peat filled depressions. Research in the catchment has focused on hydrological processes at the hillslope and catchment scales. Streamflow is gauged from several diverse sub-catchments ranging in size from 9 to 155 km(2). The period of record (2003-2019) of streamflow from these sub-catchments extends from 12 to 17 years, and these data are the focus of this note. Such data are unique in this remote region. 2003-2019 was a period that included both historic wet and dry conditions. Observations during such a diversity of conditions are helping to improve understanding of how stream networks that drain this landscape expand and contract in response to short and long hydroclimatic cycles. These data from a distinctly cold and dry region of low relief, thin soils, exposed bedrock and permafrost are a valuable contribution to the global diversity of research catchment data.

AB Much is known about the biology and ecology of the plants that comprised the forest ecosystems during the Carboniferous and Early Permian. However, a broad understanding of the interrelatedness between the plants and other organisms living in these forests has been slow to develop. The tree fern Psaronius (Marattiales), an important element in many Pennsylvanian and Early Permian peat-forming forest ecosystems, gained mechanical stability from a massive root mantle. Thin sections of a permineralized Psaronius root mantle from the Manebach Formation (Asselian, Lower Permian/Cisuralian) near Ilmenau, Germany, show a diverse assemblage of predominantly intracellular fungi in all root tissues. Especially interesting is a fungus that produces prominent, boot shaped swellings close to where it passes through host cell walls and what appear to be physiological interfaces comprised of short, densely clustered hyphal branches within the host cells. Other fungal remains occur in the form of chytrid-like sporangia, several types of basidiomycete hyphae with simple, medallion, and ampulliform clamp connections, and tenuous mycelia resembling present-day 'fine endophytes.' This fungal assemblage represents one of the best preserved Carboniferous-Early Permian fungal communities documented to date. It strengthens the hypothesis that plant-fungus associations were highly diverse and complex in late Paleozoic forests, likely because many plants in these ecosystems were long-lived and complex in morphology and internal organization, and thus provided multiple contact sites and ecologically distinct microhabitats for fungi.

AB Protected areas in Thailand were first established 40 years ago. The total area of existing protected areas covers 18.2% of the country's land area and the Class 1 Watershed, another form of protection, encompasses 18.1%. The government of Thailand intends to increase protected area systems to 25% of the country in 2006 and 30% in 2016. There are always questions arising about how much is enough protected areas to effectively protect biodiversity. The objective of this article is to assess the representation of ecosystems in the protected area network. This article also recommends which underrepresented ecosystems should be added to fill the gaps in representativeness. The research applies a gap analysis and a comparison index to assess the representation of ecosystems within the protected area network. The spatial analyses were applied to measure three aspects of representativeness, namely forest type, altitude, and natural land system. The analyses indicate that the existing protected area system covers 24.4% of the country's land area, nearly meeting the 25% target proposed by the National Forest Policy; and 83.8% of these areas are under forest cover. Most protected areas are situated in high altitudes, where biological diversity is less than in lowlands. Mangrove forest and riparian floodplain are extremely underrepresented in the existing system. Peat swamp forest, dry dipterocarp forest, and beach forest are relatively well represented. In addition, these five ecosystems are threatened by human pressures and natural disasters; therefore, they should be targeted as high priorities for the selection of new reserves. Future research should incorporate aquatic and marine ecosystems, as well as animal distributions, which were not included in this research due to data unavailabilities.

AB Increasing atmospheric CO2 is likely to produce chronic changes in global climate, as it may have done in the geologic past. Future CO2-induced changes in temperature and precipitation distribution changes could equal or exceed the changes which have occurred over the past 160,000 years and have affected the global carbon cycle. We consider ocean and terrestrial processes that could involve large changes in carbon fluxes (> 2 Pg C.yr-1) or changes in storage in large carbon pools (> 200 Pg C) resulting from CO2-induced climate changes. These include (1) air-sea exchange of CO2 in response to changes in temperature and salinity; (2) climate-induced changes in ocean circulation; (3) changes in oceanic new production and regeneration of organic debris caused directly by climate change; (4) altered oceanic nutrient supply needed to support new production due to climate-induced alteration of ocean circulation and river discharge; (5) CaCO3 compensation in sea water; (6) altered river nutrient flux and effects on coastal organic matter production and sediment accumulation; (7) seasonal balance between GPP and decomposition-respiration in terrestrial ecosystems in response to changes in temperature and precipitation; (8) successional processes in terrestrial ecosystems and formation of new plant associations in response to climatic change; (9) effects on soil nutrient availability, which amplifies ecosystem responses to climate change; (10) and responses of northern forests, tundra, and peatlands which have, until recently, been a sink for CO2. The potential effect of these processes on the rate of atmospheric CO2 concentration changes are estimated where possible, but not much quantitative information at a global scale is known, so uncertainty in these estimates is high. Each of these secondary feedbacks, however, has the potential of changing atmospheric CO2 concentration in magnitude similar to the effects of the direct human processes (fossil fuel burning and land clearing) responsible for the concern about global warming in the first place. It is therefore urgent that these uncertainties be resolved. Lines of research to accomplish this are suggested.

AB SE Poland - the Carpathian foreland and the northern part of the Carpathian Mountains - is a marginal, easternmost part of the area settled by Magdalenian people. Several sites of this culture were investigated in this area by archaeologists and naturalists during the last decades. Based on the results of those studies, landscape of the surroundings of three Magdalenian camps (within direct penetration range) was reconstructed in detail.
   GIS spatial analysis was used for 2D and 3D visualization of topographic surface features, both primary (slope and aspect) and secondary ones. The latter (viewshed and insolation) were calculated applying algorithms, based on DEMs (Digital elevation model) and other variables. On the relief maps of the sites' surroundings there were schematically presented the extent of the main types of plant communities (tundra, steppe, meadow, mixed forest, aquatic and peatland vegetation) at the time of settlement. All mentioned communities occurred near each of the investigated sites but in different proportions depending on the site age and altitude.
   Attractiveness of the studied sites for Magdalenian hunters resulted among others from: good topoclimatic location resulting in favourable insolation of the sites, location in the leeward sides of high relief elements protecting them from the westerly winds. Moreover, a vast view over the surrounding areas enabled hunters to observe migrating animal herds and set traps, especially in the widenings of the valleys closed at both ends by narrowings. Rich dwarf or meadow steppe and patches of dwarf tundra occurring in the valleys, were good pasturage for herbivorous animals hunted by Magdalenian people.

AB Photogrammetric aerial film image archives are scanned into digital form in many countries. These data sets offer an interesting source of information for scientists from different disciplines. The objective of this investigation was to contribute to the automation of a generation of 3D environmental model time series when using small-scale airborne image archives, especially in forested scenes. Furthermore, we investigated the usability of dense digital surface models (DSMs) generated using these data sets as well as the uncertainty propagation of the DSMs. A key element in the automation is georeferencing. It is obvious that for images captured years apart, it is essential to find ground reference locations that have changed as little as possible. We studied a 68-year-long aerial image time series in a Finnish Karelian forestland. The quality of candidate ground locations was evaluated by comparing digital DSMs created from the images to an airborne laser scanning (ALS)-originated reference DSM. The quality statistics of DSMs were consistent with the expectations; the estimated median root mean squared error for height varied between 0.3 and 2 m, indicating a photogrammetric modelling error of 0.1 parts per thousand with respect to flying height for data sets collected since the 1980s, and 0.2 parts per thousand for older data sets. The results show that of the studied land cover classes, "peatland without trees" changed the least over time and is one of the most promising candidates to serve as a location for automatic ground control measurement. Our results also highlight some potential challenges in the process as well as possible solutions. Our results indicate that using modern photogrammetric techniques, it is possible to reconstruct 3D environmental model time series using photogrammetric image archives in a highly automated way.

AB Water from 24 Swedish and Finnish rivers running to the Gulf of Bothnia (comprising the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay) was sampled on five occasions in 1991-93, and analysed for concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), humic substances and metals (Fe, Al, Cu, Zn). in general, TOC is higher in the Finnish rivers, which drain forest and peatlands, than in the Swedish rivers, which drain vast mountainous and forested areas. The pH is slightly lower in the Finnish rivers. Humic substances comprise approximately 80% of the total amount of organic matter. Calculations of the specific transport of organic matter (i.e. the total transport per catchment area) showed that the average release from the Finnish catchments is more than twice the release 14 om the Swedish catchments. Fe and Al exhibit the same concentration pattern as TOC. To estimate the humic fraction of some metals (Fe, Cu and Zn), a speciation study, utilizing a weak anion-exchange resin, was performed on water from rivers with different hydrochemical properties. The humic fractions of Fe, Cu and Zn were 20-40, 40-60 and <10%, respectively, of the total metal content. The total load to the Gulf of Bothnia of humic substances and Fe, Cu and Zn associated with the humic matter was calculated. It was found that the discharge of humic substances to Bothnian Bay originates primarily from the Finnish rivers, and the largest amounts contributed to the Bothnian Sea come from the Swedish rivers.

AB The bryophyte vegetation of 3 pairs of unmanaged and managed forest stands, representing Oxalis drained peatland, Aegopodium and Oxalis forest site type, were compared. The total number of bryophyte species in unmanaged stands was 74 and that in managed stands 54. Out of the 20 species occurring only in unmanaged forests, 9 grow on decaying wood, and 3 on trunks or bases of big trees; 13 of them were hepatics. In unmanaged forests 11 hemerophobic species were recorded altogether. Although the difference in substrate and species diversity between unmanaged and managed stands is not statistically significant, in unmanaged forests more substrates characteristic for an old-growth stand are available, and the percentage of species preferring dryer habitats or prolonged humidity is a bit higher than in managed forests; the percentage of species associated with better illuminated habitats is higher in managed forests. Analysis of classification structure of the bryophyte layer synusia shows that the number of societies is also higher in unmanaged forests. This is associated with more numerous microhabitats; the average light and humidity indices calculated for every society, confirm this conclusion. The large discrepancy in bryophyte layer classification structure in old-growth and managed forests of the same forest site type is manifested not so much by species content in synusia as by their abundance proportions. The larger diversity of classification units in unmanaged forests is also seen at the synusia facies level; four of nine facies are confined exclusively to unmanaged stands. This is a strong argument for the informativeness of bryophyte layer classification structure for purposes of indication and monitoring as well.

AB This study is devoted to estimation of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions during the wildfires of the anomalously hot 2010 summer in the central part of the Russian Plain. CO emissions from the forest wildfires have been estimated with use of the Active Fires (AF) (MODIS MCD14ML) and Burned Areas (BA) (MODIS MCD45) methods for AVHRR/UDM, Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC 2000), GlobCover, and MCD12Q1 vegetation maps. A comparison of the vegetation maps and investigation of forest structure dynamics for the period from 2005 to 2009 have been carried out. It is shown that the major uncertainties during the estimation of CO in decreasing order are the following: distinctions in emission-calculation methods, differences in the vegetation maps used, differences in satellite data from Terra and Aqua, and the insufficient registration of forest structure dynamics. For additional comparison of estimations obtained by an independent method with the use of orbital (MOPITT, AIRS, and IASI) and ground-based (Moscow and Zvenigorod) spectroscopic measurements of CO content were presented.

AB Polyporous fungi, a morphologically delineated group of Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota), are considered well studied in Europe and used as model group in ecological studies and for conservation. Such broad interest, including widespread sampling and DNA based taxonomic revisions, is rapidly transforming our basic understanding of polypore diversity and natural history. We integrated over 40,000 historical and modern records of polypores in Estonia (hemiboreal Europe), revealing 227 species, and including Polyporus submelanopus and P. ulleungus as novelties for Europe. Taxonomic and conservation problems were distinguished for 13 unresolved subgroups. The estimated species pool exceeds 260 species in Estonia, including at least 20 likely undescribed species (here documented as distinct DNA lineages related to accepted species in, e.g., Ceriporia, Coltricia, Physisporinus, Sidera and Sistotrema). Four broad ecological patterns are described: (1) polypore assemblage organization in natural forests follows major soil and tree-composition gradients; (2) landscape-scale polypore diversity homogenizes due to draining of peatland forests and reduction of nemoral broad-leaved trees (wooded meadows and parks buffer the latter); (3) species having parasitic or brown-rot life-strategies are more substrate-specific; and (4) assemblage differences among woody substrates reveal habitat management priorities. Our update reveals extensive overlap of polypore biota throughout North Europe. We estimate that in Estonia, the biota experienced ca. 3-5% species turnover during the twentieth century, but exotic species remain rare and have not attained key functions in natural ecosystems. We encourage new regional syntheses on long studied fungal groups to obtain landscape-scale understanding of species pools, and for elaborating fungal indicators for biodiversity assessments.

AB Recently in humid tropical Asia, human activities have begun to extend toward the coastal lowland areas where widespread peat swamps are distributed. Draining peat swamp areas for agricultural uses creates a high risk of sulfuric acidification. The research site in this paper was a strand plain comprising beach ridges, swales on inter-ridges, and peaty backswamps in southeast Thailand. Thus, the actual and potential acid sulfate soil in the peaty backswamps is a major problem there, but sandy podzols on older beach ridges are also considered an agricultural problem soil. To establish an agricultural landscape plan encompassing the whole of the strand plain, we studied the land characteristics associated with the landforms and soils, their spatial variability related to landscape evolution, and the status of present plant resources in terms of biomass and species diversity for local farmers on peaty backswamps and beach ridges. We found that all spatial attributes of the two soils, such as the locations, profiles, and chemical and physical properties, were closely related to the geomorphic formation process or chronosequence: the landward or older backswamp has ripe clay and the seaward or younger one partly has unripe clay; the degree of spodic horizon development with ortstein is highest in the most landward beach-ridge system and decreases seaward; and the profile positions of the spodic horizons were related to the fluctuations of marine sand sediments, as revealed in a fine-scale survey. Finding these spatial regularities is useful for predicting land characteristics in areas outside of detailed research sites, reducing time and cost as well as forming the basis of landscape planning. Plant resources presently utilized by local farmers on the strand plain are Melaleuca cajuputi forests on both the peaty backswamps and the beach ridges, and home gardens of tropical fruit trees around settlements. Ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass of M. cajuputi was not significantly different among soil types in the strand plain, but the growth rate and potential biomass of the species appears to be highest in thick, water-saturated peaty backswamps with acid sulfate soils. By comparing the species composition of home gardens in different areas, we found that oil the beach ridges, although the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass for several types of fruit trees appears lower, a great number of species particular to the shrub layer are maintained. Based on the spatial variability of land characteristics and the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass, we identified separate land units and suggested future land-management and land-use systems appropriate to each unit.

AB Mercury (Hg) is commonly extracted from solid phase samples using aqua regia for total Hg (tHg) analysis. However, uncertainties exist regarding the complete extraction of Hg by aqua regia, especially from carbonaceous materials. To investigate whether aqua regia can completely extract Hg from biochars, batch-style experiments were carried out to evaluate extraction efficiency of aqua regia with respect to Hg-loaded biochar and to characterize the residual Hg speciation and spatial distribution. Different types of biochars (raw, FeCl3-modified, and FeSO4-modified, prepared at different temperatures) were reacted with Hg-spiked solution before the digestion experiments. Adsorption analyses indicate the biochars were successfully loaded with Hg and that the Hg content was higher in biochars pyrolyzed at higher temperature (900 versus 300 or 600 degrees C). The results of digestion experiments indicate Hg could not be completely extracted from the biochars tested, with a greater percentage of residual Hg in biochars pyrolyzed at 600 (60 +/- 15%) and 900 (75 +/- 22%) than 300 degrees C (7 +/- 2%). Furthermore, the fraction of residual Hg in FeSO4-modified biochars after aqua regia digestion was significantly lower than in FeCl3-modified and unmodified biochars. Confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence imaging (CMXRFI) showed residual Hg in biochars is concentrated on surfaces prior to digestion, but more homogeneously distributed after digestion, which indicates Hg on biochar surface is more easily digested. Hg extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra modelling showed residual Hg in biochars mainly exists as Hg(II)-Cl. These results indicate extra caution should be paid for tHg determinations using aqua regia digestion method in soil (especially in forest), sediment, and peat samples containing black carbon, activated carbon, or biochar.

AB Smoke-haze episodes, caused by uncontrolled peat and forest fires, occur almost every year in the South-East Asian region with increased concentrations of PM2.5 (airborne particulate matter (PM) with diameter <= 2.5 mu m). Particulate-bound trace elements (TrElems), especially carcinogenic and toxic elements, were measured during smoke haze as well as non-haze periods in 2014 as they are considered to be indicators of potential health effects. The bioaccessibilities of 13 TrElems were investigated using two types of simulated lung fluids (SLFs), Gamble's solution and artificial lysosomal fluid CALF), instead of the commonly used leaching agent (water). The dissolution kinetics was also examined for these TrElems. Many TrElems showed higher solubility in SLFs, and were more soluble in ALF compared to the Gamble's solution. Cu, Mn and Cd were observed to be the most soluble trace elements in ALF, while in Gamble's solution the most soluble trace elements were Cu, Mn and Zn. The dissolution rates were highly variable among the elements. Health risk assessment was conducted based on the measured concentrations of TrElems and their corresponding toxicities for three possible scenarios involving interactions between carcinogenic and toxic TrElems and SLFs, using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) human health risk assessment model. The cumulative cancer risks exceeded the acceptable level (1 in a million i.e. 1 x 10(-6)). However, the estimation of health quotient (HQ) indicated no significant chronic toxic health effects. The risk assessment results revealed that the assessment of bioaccessibility of particulate-bound TrElems using water as the leaching agent may underestimate the health risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of the present paper is to determine the social structure of a guanaco population (Lama guanicoe Muller, 1776) and its interaction with the habitat in the north coast of Mitre Peninsula, Tierra del Fuego, Argentine. This is a forested region and has a low level of disturbance by human activity. Furthermore, a revision through the different techniques to determine sex relationships (SR) was carried out, which is a parameter of vital importance for the future management and exploitation of the Fuegian guanaco populations. Terrestrial census was made, in which data on structure of each social group, their dimension, male distribution in each group, size and composition of the social group, rate numbers of female and breeding in the family groups were obtained. The following proportions were determined: breeding/female, breeding/adult, and female/adult. 40.8% of all guanacos were together in family groups, 50.5% in male groups, and 8.7% were solitary males. The average size of the family groups was 6 members, and that of the male groups was 7.5 members. The breeding/female proportion was 0.4, the number of breeding per family group was 1.8 and the number of female was 4.6. Differences were found between the populations in areas with ''barren plain-peat'' vegetation, with few trees, of Policarpo Bay (36% of members were met in family groups, 58% in male groups, and 6% were solitary males; and the following proportions were found: breeding/female 0.36, female/adult 0.24, and breeding/family groups 1.5) and in forested areas of Thetis Bay (45% of the members were in family groups, 51% in male groups, and 4% were solitary males; the proportions were the following: breeding/female 0.46, female/adult 0.31 and breeding/family group 3).

AB In 1978 the World Wide Fund for Nature in Finland, and the Finnish Museum of Natural History, established a "Margaritiferaworking group". During the last 18 years Margaritifera populations have been checked in more than 60 rivers in different parts of Finland and in some rivers in Russian Karelia and Estonia. Altogether we have inventoried about 2000 km of underwater research transects. The best method of restoring the freshwater pearl mussel population is the protection of the breeding population. Altogether eleven Margaritifera rivers belong to the new Finnish Natura 2000-network. In 1995 the Ministry of Environment gave financial values to every protected animal and plant species in Finland (confiscation value). The confiscation value of a single M. margaritifera specimen in Finland is 3500 FIM (about pound 500). In the last decades the main threat to Margaritifera has been the drainage of peat lands and wet forest. One method to prevent the flow of silt into a mussel river has been to stop the ditching short of the river but dig pools for silt deposition. In restoring the old timber floating rivers to ones suitable for salmon, a so called soft technique, has been developed in Finland. By using this technique it has also been possible to prepare the river bed for freshwater pearl mussels. Glochidiosis can have a severe impact on trout in fish farms such that new installations must not be located in downstream proximity of important mussel populations. The farming of rainbow trout in natural rivers leads to the partial reduction of the native brown trout and consequently to the loss of Margaritifera glochidia as they cannot encyst on the gills of the rainbow trout. In some Margaritifera rivers where density of salmonid fish is low, the host fish population has been increased up to 0.5-1 specimens/m(2). The restocking of freshwater pearl mussel populations by transplantation has been the last choice of conservation measures in Finland. After 16 years a success rate of over 90% has been achieved, where mussels have been transferred to other parts of the same river, but only 50% or less in cases where mussels have been transferred from one river to another It has also been very important to encourage research on all aspects of the biology and geographical distribution of the freshwater pearl mussel, and to promote co-ordination of survey and research programmes at national and international levels.

AB Riau Province in central Sumatra, with its peatland, lowland, and montane forest habitats, was once a stronghold for Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) populations. Today, Riau may have one of the highest deforestation rates in the world and wildlife populations are dwindling, with natural forest now comprising approximately only 18% of the province, mostly contained within protected areas. Agriculture (acacia, rubber, and oil palm) makes up the majority of Riau's land cover and deforestation for the creation of new plantations is rampant. Natural forest and tigers still remain in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and Rimbang Baling Wildlife Reserve, which remain connected to tiger populations in montane forest on the western edge of Sumatra. In this study, using freely available Landsat imagery and a maximum likelihood classification algorithm, we create land cover maps for central Sumatra from 2002 to 2016. We then use current land cover, elevation, and slope variables to predict changes from forest to plantation from 2016 to 2050 at five year intervals using a multilayer perceptron neural network. Finally, we compare connectivity based on a 100 km distance threshold (based on potential tiger dispersal) across the landscape and across years. Land cover maps had 80-90% accuracy, and we predict forest in Tesso Nilo and the western edge of the study area to be lost by 2050 given current rates of deforestation. Our connectivity analysis shows that Tesso Nilo and the area between Rimbang Baling and Bukit Tigapuluh are important components for maintaining connectivity throughout the study area. Focusing conservation and rehabilitation efforts on forests close to plantations in flat areas, including Tesso Nilo, is necessary to maintain forests and increase connectivity in Riau to ensure future habitat connectivity for survival of tigers and Sumatra's other diverse endemic species.

   dendroecology; tree mortality
AB Tree-ring analysis was used to relate the pattern of eastern larch (Larix laricina) growth to insect defoliation over the last three centuries in boreal Quebec. Four sampling sites were selected along a moisture gradient, from a well-drained site to a forested peatland near Lake Bienville, in an area where larch is currently recovering from a recent outbreak of the larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii), a notoriously recurrent defoliator of eastern larch. In the two dry sites, the eastern larch tree-ring series clearly showed eight periods of defoliation-induced growth suppression since 1782. Growth depressions were not as consistent in the more humid sites, especially at the turn of the century (i.e. between 1883 and 1911), when only one infestation was clearly expressed among three successive ones at the dry sites. Time series filtering indicated sharp synchrony of defoliation events among sites. Radial and apical growth during infestations correlated in a complex way, with radial growth being most severely suppressed at the apex and at the root collar. Defoliation of larch caused significant tree mortality in the dry sites. Mortality was directly related to defoliation for a significant fraction of the dead trees sampled. There was a variation in the number of years of suppressed growth without recovery prior to death, as well as in the number of severe infestations that were successfully overcome, before the final assault. The age structure of the extant larch population at one of the dry sites indicated a lack of recruitment over the last century. Our study suggests that larch sawfly outbreaks had a considerable long-term impact on the forest structure. In the absence of fires, the long-term effect may be a gradual substitution of the mixed black spruce-eastern larch forest by a monospecific black spruce forest.

AB Aims Canopy height is a key driver of forest biodiversity and carbon cycling. Accurate estimates of canopy height are needed for assessing mechanisms relating to ecological patterns and processes of tree height limitations. At global scales forest canopy height patterns are largely controlled by climate, while local variation at fine scales is due to differences in disturbance history and local patterns in environmental conditions. The relative effect of local environmental drivers on canopy height is poorly understood partly due to gaps in data on canopy height and methods for examining limiting factors. Here, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data on vegetation structure of boreal forests to examine the effects of environmental factors on potential maximum forest canopy height.
   Methods Relationships between maximum canopy height from ALS measures and environmental variables were examined to assess factors limiting tree height. Specifically, we used quantile regression at the 0.90 quantile to relate maximum canopy height with environmental characteristics of climate (i.e. mean annual temperature [MAT] and mean annual precipitation), terrain (i.e. slope) and depth-to-water (DTW) across a 33000 km(2) multiple use boreal forest landscape in northeast Alberta, Canada.
   Important Findings Maximum canopy height was positively associated with MAT, terrain slope and terrain-derived DTW, collectively explaining 33.2% of the variation in heights. The strongest explanatory variable was DTW explaining 26% of canopy height variation with peatland forests having naturally shorter maximum canopy heights, but also more sites currently at their maximum potential height. In contrast, the most productive forests (i.e. mesic to xeric upland forests) had the fewest sites at their potential maximum height, illustrating the effects of long-term forest management, wildfires and general anthropogenic footprints on reducing the extent and abundance of older, taller forest habitat in Alberta's boreal forest.

AB This study was focussed on regeneration of Norway spruce (Picea abies)-dominated forests on fertile, drained peatlands located along a north-south gradient in Sweden. Naturally established seedlings of mainly spruce and pubescent birch were inventoried with respect to numbers and height, and planted (large, bare-root) spruce seedlings in 10-year-old shelterwoods and clearcuts with respect to survival, damage and height development. Two shelterwood densities were studied, 140 and 200 trees ha(-1). The planting treatment also included site preparation (mounding in shelterwoods, mounding and no mounding in clearcuts). The planted seedlings and the natural regeneration were inventoried 9 and 11 growing seasons after cut, respectively.
   Large numbers of naturally established spruce and birch (Betula sp.) seedlings were obtained without soil preparation in the shelterwoods. The height development of these spruce seedlings was, however, much slower than that of the planted shelterwood seedlings, indicating 2-3 times longer regeneration period (up to 20 years) for the natural regeneration alternative. In the clearcuts, only birch seedlings established naturally. In all the study areas, planting in mounds was equally or more successful (survival, height, damage) in shelterwoods than in clearcuts. Planting without mounding in the clearcuts was nor successful (low survival rate and height, extensive damage). In general, the number of naturally established seedlings in shelterwoods, and the survival rate of planted seedlings in clearcuts and shelterwoods, were much lower in the study areas in central Sweden than in the areas in the north and south. The results from the study suggest that shelterwood methods (by natural establishment or planting) used in highly productive spruce forests yield acceptable or desirable levels of regeneration.

AB The hydrological cycle has significant effects on the terrestrial carbon (C) balance through its controls on photosynthesis and C decomposition. A detailed representation of the water cycle in terrestrial C cycle models is essential for reliable estimates of C budgets. However, it is challenging to accurately describe the spatial and temporal variations of soil water, especially for regional and global applications. Vertical and horizontal movements of soil water should be included. To constrain the hydrology-related uncertainty in modelling the regional C balance, a three-dimensional hydrological module was incorporated into the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon-budget model (InTEC V3.0). We also added an explicit parameterization of wetlands. The inclusion of the hydrological module considerably improved the model's ability to Simulate C content and balances in different ecosystems. Compared with measurements at five flux-tower sites, the model captured 85% and 82% of the variations in volumetric soil moisture content in the 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depths during the growing season and 84% of the interannual variability in the measured C balance. The simulations showed that lateral subsurface water redistribution is a necessary mechanism for simulating water table depth for both poorly drained forest and peatland sites. Nationally, soil C content and their spatial variability are significantly related to drainage class. Poorly drained areas are important C sinks at the regional scale, however, their soil C content and balances are difficult to model and may have been inadequately represented in previous C cycle models. The InTEC V3.0 model predicted an annual net C uptake by Canada's forests and wetlands for the period 1901-1998 of 111.9 Tg C yr(-1), which is 41.4 Tg C yr(-1) larger than our previous estimate (InTEC V2.0). The increase in the net C uptake occurred mainly in poorly drained regions and resulted from the inclusion of a separate wetland parameterization and a detailed hydrologic module with lateral flow in InTEC V3.0.

AB Effective conservation demands more accurate and reliable methods of survey and monitoring of populations. Surveys of gibbon populations have relied mostly on mapping of groups in "listening areas" using acoustical point-count data. Traditional methods of estimating density in have usually used counts of gibbon groups within fixed-radius areas or areas bounded by terrain barriers to sound transmission, and have not accounted for possible decline in detectability with distance. In this study we sampled the eastern hoolock gibbon (Hoolock leucogenys) population in Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Myanmar, using two methods: the traditional point-count method with fixed-radius listening areas, and a newer method using point-transect Distance analysis from a sample point established in the center of each listening point array. The basic data were obtained by triangulating on singing groups from four LPs for 4 days, in 10 randomly selected sample areas within the sanctuary. The point transect method gave an average density of 3.13 groups km(-2), higher than the estimates of group density within fixed-radius areas without correction for detectability. A new method of analysis of singing probability per day (p[1]) gave an estimate of 0.547. Htamanthi WS is an important conservation area containing an estimated 7000 (95% confidence interval: 5000-10,000) hoolock groups. Surveys at Htamanthi WS and locations in the Hukaung Valley suggest that the extensive evergreen forests in northern Myanmar have the capacity to support 2-4 (average about 3) groups of hoolock gibbons per km(2), but most forests in its range have yet to be surveyed.

AB This work is a part of an effort to maximize the operational safety of a 50 MWth circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boiler located in Perstorp, Sweden, co-firing animal waste, peat, waste wood, forest residues, and industrial sludge. An increase in the CFB boiler availability reduces the use of expensive fossil fuel (oil) in backup boilers during operational problems of the CFB boiler. The work includes a thorough mapping and analysis of the failure and preventive maintenance statistics, together with elemental analysis of boiler ash and deposits, flue gas, and fuel fractions. Correlations between boiler parameters and boiler availability are sought, and recommendations regarding boiler design and operation are made. An explicit description of the boiler is made to allow for the use of presented material as future reference material. It was observed that the failure frequency is especially high where (1) rapid chloride-rich windward deposit buildup is combined with (2) high construction material temperature and (3) windward soot blowing. In areas where one of these factors was absent, a more moderate material loss could be seen. The flue gas average elemental composition can be regarded as close to constant as it flows through the series of heat exchangers. Thus, the significant differences in deposit buildup of different flue gas cross-sections cannot be a result of changed average flue gas composition. The areas of the steam tubes suffering from rapid material loss are also exposed to high deposit rates. Downstream of a well-defined temperature threshold in the secondary superheater, neither material loss nor substantial deposit buildup could be seen. Tube deposits are dominated by Na, S, Ca, K, and P, but only Na, K, and S are enriched in the windward tube deposits relative to the fly ash bulk composition. The temperature of the flue gas is the major parameter governing the rate of deposit buildup in the boiler heat exchangers. Of the fuel nitrogen, 95 wt % leaves the process as N-2(g). Fuel mix ash content analysis via a separate ashing of different fuel fractions by heating to 550 degrees C does not reflect the ash content of the fuel mix correctly. The soot blowing angle of attack on the deposits should be regarded in areas with rapid deposit growth when boilers and soot blowers are designed to allow for efficient tube cleaning. The use of heterogeneous fuel in the boiler creates strong variations in fuel, flue gas, and particle composition and makes it increasingly important to have online measurements to be able to understand and control the furnace chemistry. The filter ash in the flue gas baghouse filter effectively sorbs HCl(g) and NH3(g) from the flue gas already without the addition of sorbents. Online flue gas measurement to control the furnace chemistry must therefore be installed upstream of the filter to enable accurate control. Also, a significantly larger filtration area can be installed in the baghouse filters with a slight increase in cost, to allow for efficient use of the ash as free of cost sorbent and lowered emission levels. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the flue gas deposits shows that no pieces of ground bone, sand particles, or other relatively large flue gas particles contribute directly to the deposit buildup. White crystals rich in N and Cl, most likely ammonium chloride, precipitate downstream of the flue gas filter.
   The precipitation interferes with the dust emission measurement and forces a reduced usage of waste-derived fuels because of the exceedance of environmental limits. More expensive forest fuels are used to replace waste-derived fuels, resulting in a higher fuel cost.

ID DIVERSITY HOTSPOTS
AB Dipterocarpaceae is the dominant tree family in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. Borneo (and Sarawak) is the centre of diversity for the dipterocarps. Identification of hotspots is important for forest and biodiversity conservation efforts. Species Occurrence Models (SOMs) were generated for all 247 species of dipterocarps recorded in Sarawak using herbarium occurrence data and based on the best model selected. The species occurrence density map for each genus and category (endemic and non endemic) was generated by overlaying the SOMs of all species in each genus or category. The species occurrence density maps were analyzed with land cover map from Landsat 7-EMT+ images and protected forest areas for identifying hotspots for conservation in Sarawak. Overlaying the SOM maps revealed that areas in central Sarawak and the southwest region (northwest Borneo around Kuching) are the main hotspots of dipterocarp diversity in Sarawak while the coastal lowland areas in the lower Rejang and Baram River which are mainly peat swamp forest are poorer in species occurrence density. In terms of endemism, as with dipterocarp diversity, the mixed diptercarp forest of central Sarawak is also the most important hotspot. Gap analysis revealed that most protected forest areas are in southwest Sarawak (Bako, Kubah, Tanjung Datu and Gunung Gading National Parks) and in the northern part of Sarawak (Niah, Lambir Hills and Mt Mulu National Parks). This leaves the hotspot in the central part of Sarawak least protected. Protected areas only cover between 2 and 4% of the total areas for the different hotspots (75% species density) while majority of the hotspots that are still forested are outside the protected areas.

AB The estimates of above-ground forest biomass (AGB) in Northern Eurasia are highly uncertain, despite the global importance of AGE for ecosystem services and its role as carbon stores. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of ALOS/PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), for the estimation of AGB in the range of 10-190 tons (dry matter)/ha in mixed and deciduous forests at the southern edge of the boreal region in Western Siberia. Various regression models were tested to determine the relationship between forest biomass derived from field measurements and radar backscatter. The best results were obtained using HV-polarized backscatter with the Water Cloud model, giving estimation errors in terms of root mean square errors (RMSE) between 25% and 32% of the mean biomass, and coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.35 and 0.49 for the whole range of SAR backscatter used in the analysis. The method displayed a higher prediction accuracy with RMSE of 15%, and the R-2 between 0.55 and 0.72 when restricted to SAR backscatter (sigma(0)) < - 12.6 dB where the model was clearly defined. The SAR-based estimates offer a potential of rapid, high resolution and low cost mapping of the lower biomass woody vegetation (sparse or young forests on shallow peat) in Siberia, the area where more accurate national or large scale forest inventories hardly exist.

AB Spatial distribution of plants in early successional stands provides an indication of future plant community structure and population dynamics. Determining the factors driving plant interactions and their demographic relationships at stand initiation is critical to gain a better understanding of plants' responses to competition and limited resource conditions. Reclaimed ecosystems are ideal for studying such community mechanisms because they are completely reconstructed ecosystems with known community filters such as soil type, propagule composition, and the presence of both planted and naturally establishing trees. The current study explored the spatial patterns and competition-facilitation mechanisms in deciduous and evergreen trees in two oil sands reclaimed sites with different reclamation age (2-year old and 5-year old) and cover soils (wetland peat origin PMM; and forest floor origin - FFMM) in Alberta, Canada, and compared this with a naturally-disturbed site at 5 years since fire. Spatial point pattern analysis was performed using pair correlation function g(r), mark correlation function k(mm)(r), and bivariate g-function. Intraspecific competition in deciduous seedlings was stronger in the 5-year old reclaimed site than in the 2-year old site. Spatial patterns in deciduous seedlings on PMM were aggregated at 1-3 m scale similar to the natural site, whereas seedlings on FFMM sites had aggregated patterns at greater than 5 m scale. Planted conifers had regular pattern at 1-2 in scale in the 2-year old sites which reflects the plantation spacing, but showed a random pattern in the 5-year old sites indicating the effect of random mortality. Bivariate spatial analysis indicated a significant repulsion between deciduous and coniferous seedling at 1 m in the 2-year old PMM site and a significant attraction in the 5-year old FFMM site suggesting that the mechanism of competition-facilitation between trees is different in different cover soils. Density dependent thinning was only observed in the 2-year old PMM and natural sites; however, a gradual increase in nearest neighbour distances with increasing seedling size in all the reclaimed sites suggests that density dependent thinning has started.

TI Assessment of Above-Ground Biomass of Borneo Forests through a New
   Data-Fusion Approach Combining Two Pan-Tropical Biomass Maps

ID CARBON-DENSITY; STOCKS
AB This study investigates how two existing pan-tropical above-ground biomass (AGB) maps (Saatchi 2011, Baccini 2012) can be combined to derive forest ecosystem specific carbon estimates. Several data-fusion models which combine these AGB maps according to their local correlations with independent datasets such as the spectral bands of SPOT VEGETATION imagery are analyzed. Indeed these spectral bands convey information about vegetation type and structure which can be related to biomass values. Our study area is the island of Borneo. The data-fusion models are evaluated against a reference AGB map available for two forest concessions in Sabah. The highest accuracy was achieved by a model which combines the AGB maps according to the mean of the local correlation coefficients calculated over different kernel sizes. Combining the resulting AGB map with a new Borneo land cover map (whose overall accuracy has been estimated at 86.5%) leads to average AGB estimates of 279.8 t/ha and 233.1 t/ha for forests and degraded forests respectively. Lowland dipterocarp and mangrove forests have the highest and lowest AGB values (305.8 t/ha and 136.5 t/ha respectively). The AGB of all natural forests amounts to 10.8 Gt mainly stemming from lowland dipterocarp (66.4%), upper dipterocarp (10.9%) and peat swamp forests (10.2%). Degraded forests account for another 2.1 Gt of AGB. One main advantage of our approach is that, once the best fitting data-fusion model is selected, no further AGB reference dataset is required for implementing the data-fusion process. Furthermore, the local harmonization of AGB datasets leads to more spatially precise maps. This approach can easily be extended to other areas in Southeast Asia which are dominated by lowland dipterocarp forest, and can be repeated when newer or more accurate AGB maps become available.

AB Soil denitrification is considered the most unconstrained process in the global N cycle due to uncertain in situ N-2 flux measurements, particularly in natural and semi-natural terrestrial ecosystems. N-15 tracer approaches can provide in situ measurements of both N-2 and N2O simultaneously, but their use has been limited to fertilized agroecosystems due to the need for large N-15 additions in order to detect N-15(2) production against the high atmospheric N-2. For N-15-N-2 analyses, we have used an "in-house" laboratory designed and manufactured N-2 preparation instrument which can be interfaced to any commercial continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS). The N-2 prep unit has gas purification steps and a copper-based reduction furnace, and allows the analysis of small gas injection volumes (4 mu L) for N-15-N-2 analysis. For the analysis of N2O, an automated Tracegas Preconcentrator (Isoprime Ltd) coupled to an IRMS was used to measure the N-15-N2O (4 mL gas injection volume). Consequently, the coefficient of variation for the determination of isotope ratios for N-2 in air and in standard N2O (0.5 ppm) was better than 0.5 %. The N-15 gas-flux method was adapted for application in natural and semi-natural land use types (peatlands, forests, and grasslands) by lowering the N-15 tracer application rate to 0.04-0.5 kg N-15 ha(-1). The minimum detectable flux rates were 4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) and 0.2 ng N m(-2) h(-1) for the N-2 and N2O fluxes respectively. Total denitrification rates measured by the acetylene inhibition technique in the same land use types correlated (r = 0.58) with the denitrification rates measured under the N-15 gas-flux method, but were underestimated by a factor of 4, and this was partially attributed to the incomplete inhibition of N2O reduction to N-2, under a relatively high soil moisture content, and/or the catalytic NO decomposition in the presence of acetylene. Even though relatively robust for in situ denitrification measurements, methodological uncertainties still exist in the estimation of N-2 and N2O fluxes with the N-15 gas-flux method due to issues related to non-homogenous distribution of the added tracer and subsoil gas diffusion using open-bottom chambers, particularly during longer incubation duration. Despite these uncertainties, the N-15 gas-flux method constitutes a more reliable field technique for large-scale quantification of N-2 and N2O fluxes in natural terrestrial ecosystems, thus significantly improving our ability to constrain ecosystem N budgets.

AB Afforestation has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the often high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils with high organic matter content. However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes after afforestation can be considerable, depending predominantly on site drainage and nutrient availability. Studies on the full GHG budget of afforested organic soils are scarce and hampered by the uncertainties associated with methodology. In this study we determined the GHG budget of a spruce-dominated forest on a drained organic soil with an agricultural history. Two different approaches for determining the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were applied, for the year 2008, one direct (eddy covariance) and the other indirect (analyzing the different components of the GHG budget), so that uncertainties in each method could be evaluated. The annual tree production in 2008 was 8.3 +/- 3.9 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) due to the high levels of soil nutrients, the favorable climatic conditions and the fact that the forest was probably in its phase of maximum C assimilation or shortly past it. The N2O fluxes were determined by the closed-chamber technique and amounted to 0.9 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). According to the direct measurements from the eddy covariance technique, the site acts as a minor GHG sink of -1.2 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). This contrasts with the NEE estimate derived from the indirect approach which suggests that the site is a net GHG emitter of 0.6 +/- 4.5 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). Irrespective of the approach applied, the soil CO2 effluxes counter large amounts of the C sequestration by trees. Due to accumulated uncertainties involved in the indirect approach, the direct approach is considered the more reliable tool. As the rate of C sequestration will likely decrease with forest age, the site will probably become a GHG source once again as the trees do not compensate for the soil C and N losses. Also forests in younger age stages have been shown to have lower C assimilation rates; thus, the overall GHG sink potential of this afforested nutrient-rich organic soil is probably limited to the short period of maximum C assimilation.

AB In an attempt to determine to what extent the impact of recent climate changes that occurred east of Hudson Bay, including important reduction of areas in permafrost, had on the coastal marine environment, a series of shallow cores were extracted from the seabed off the mouth of the Sheldrake River, in Nastapoka Sound. A total of 25 cores were taken in April 2009 from the ice cover. A preliminary seafloor map was first done to help in the selection of the coring sites. Nastapoka Sound has a complex subaqueous relief, formed of asymmetric ridges and deep basins. After preliminary sedimentological analyses, six of the cores were selected for physical and chronological analyses (C-14, Pb-210, and Cs-137 dating); among them, three were selected for elemental (C, N, OC/TN) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) analyses to identify sedimentary organic matter sources. Sedimentation processes are complex and are primarily driven by bottom currents. This is confirmed by the absence of a clay fraction in several cores, some erosion surfaces in a few cores, and the presence of comet-like mark features on the seafloor. The highest sedimentation rates are found near the coast of the province of Quebec and Gillies Island and the lowest ones occur in the deep depocenters. Isotopic and elemental analyses reveal that Nastapoka Sound is an area of mixing between marine and terrestrial inputs and can be compared to an estuarine system similar to nearby Lac Guillaume-Delisle. Those conditions altogether make it difficult to extract a perfectly clear signal of climate change in the recent sediment record. However, the downcore application of a simple two end-member mixing model to measured delta C-13 values strongly suggests that the fraction of sedimentary organic matter from terrestrial sources increased by 30% since about the middle of the Little Ice Age. This trend accelerated at the end of the 20th century. Rapid permafrost decay in adjacent river catchments is likely one source for this terrestrial carbon. However, it cannot be distinguished from other potential sources that are also related to environmental changes such as increase in primary productivity both on land, where peatlands, shrubs, and forest are expanding, and at sea, where sea ice cover duration is diminishing.

AB We present an integrated record of environmental change from Lake Omapere, Northland, New Zealand, based on palaeolimnological analysis of a 7-m-long core and eight adjunct cores spanning part of the last 80 calendar (cal.) ka. The chronology was developed using tephrochronology, palaeomagnetism and radiocarbon dating together with climato- and palyno-stratigraphy. Two of 14 tephra layers in the cores provide markers for correlating the record with other New Zealand climato-stratigraphic sequences, deep-sea cores and the global marine isotope record. Pollen, diatom, palaeomagnetic, sedimentologic and pigment analyses show that Lake Omapere, currently similar to 2 m deep, has had a discontinuous history. Occupying a shallow basin perched partly within old basalt lavas, the initial (alkaline) lake formed towards the end of MIS 5a at ca. 80 cal. ka, presumably because of blockage of local drainage of a swampy alluvial floodplain, inundating peat deposits and forest trees, including kauri (Agathis australis). The lake filled rapidly to a level similar to 1-2 m above that at present. Such filling was probably unrelated to climate but a subsequent phase of variable but generally failing lake levels and increasing dystrophy may have been climatically controlled, commencing during MIS 4 and culminating in periods early in MIS 3 when the lake became swampy or dry. Conditions of non-deposition (or non-preservation) obtained for most of the period after ca. 55 cal. ka (Rotoehu Ash) until formation of the modem lake approximately 600-700 cal. years ago or soon after, as indicated by the presence of Tephra-1, identified in part as Kaharoa Tephra (AD 1314), near the top of the core. The modem lake originated possibly through damming of the western outlet as a consequence of accelerated erosion accompanying earliest Polynesian deforestation, an interpretation supported by Maori oral tradition.
   The pollen record indicates that beech Nothofagus (presumably N. truncata) was much more common in Northland during the Last Glacial, and that for this region the relative abundance of Nothofagus vs. Agathis pollen serves as a better indicator of cooler versus warmer intervals during the Quaternary than the ratio of tree to non-tree pollen. However, it seems likely that moisture balance was a more critical factor than temperature in vegetation composition and distribution, particularly during the LGM, and the long periods of hiatus may also be linked to a drier climate than present. Correlation coefficients between the pollen curves confirm that several tree species (Halocarpus bidwillii, H. biformis and Phyllocladus alpinus), previously palynologically concealed within generic taxonomic groups, occurred about two degrees latitude further north and at a much lower altitude than their current limits during cooler or drier phases of the Last Glacial. A temperature depression in Northland of 4 degreesC at various times during the Last Glacial is inferred from these range expansions. Nevertheless, the persistence of widespread forest cover suggests that the late Pleistocene climate of Northland was less severe than for most of the rest of New Zealand and strengthens the argument for a heightened temperature gradient across northern New Zealand during the Last Glacial.

AB Woodlands represent highly significant carbon sinks globally, though could lose this function under future climatic change. Effective large-scale monitoring of these woodlands has a critical role to play in mitigating for, and adapting to, climate change. Mediterranean woodlands have low carbon densities, but represent important global carbon stocks due to their extensiveness and are particularly vulnerable because the region is predicted to become much hotter and drier over the coming century. Airborne lidar is already recognized as an excellent approach for high-fidelity carbon mapping, but few studies have used multi-temporal lidar surveys to measure carbon fluxes in forests and none have worked with Mediterranean woodlands. We use a multi-temporal (5-year interval) airborne lidar data set for a region of central Spain to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) and carbon dynamics in typical mixed broadleaved and/or coniferous Mediterranean woodlands. Field calibration of the lidar data enabled the generation of grid-based maps of AGB for 2006 and 2011, and the resulting AGB change was estimated. There was a close agreement between the lidar-based AGB growth estimate (1.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and those derived from two independent sources: the Spanish National Forest Inventory, and a tree-ring based analysis (1.19 and 1.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). We parameterised a simple simulator of forest dynamics using the lidar carbon flux measurements, and used it to explore four scenarios of fire occurrence. Under undisturbed conditions (no fire) an accelerating accumulation of biomass and carbon is evident over the next 100 years with an average carbon sequestration rate of 1.95 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). This rate reduces by almost a third when fire probability is increased to 0.01 (fire return rate of 100 years), as has been predicted under climate change. Our work shows the power of multi-temporal lidar surveying to map woodland carbon fluxes and provide parameters for carbon dynamics models. Space deployment of lidar instruments in the near future could open the way for rolling out wide-scale forest carbon stock monitoring to inform management and governance responses to future environmental change.

AB A 3-year (1993-1995) study was conducted to describe both the spatial (within- and between-site) and temporal (monthly) patterns associated with canopy interception, throughfall, and net forest water along a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) topo-sequence situated in northwestern Ontario. This site array included (1) an upland, well-drained, mineral soil site; (2) a poorly drained, midslope, wet mineral site; and (3) a treed wetland on organic (peat) soil. Bulk precipitation (BP) and throughfall (TF) were collected, on an event basis (63 events, over 4800 samples analyzed), using standard collecting devices and analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), total phosphorus (TP), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). Comparison of BP and TF data suggested that an enrichment of K (190%), Mg (115%), and Ca (70%) occurred during canopy interactions. On the other hand, inorganic nitrogen (NH4+: -73%; NO3-: -47%), and to a lesser extent TP (-35%), rates declined. TKN, however, remained the same, suggesting that inorganic N reductions were offset by organic N inputs. Downward shifts in pH were also detected for TF (4.45-4.48), as compared with the pH of BP (4.52-4.80). Although all study sites received similar rainfall amounts, the more productive sites (i.e., carrying greater foliar mass, higher leaf area index) had lower TF volumes (i.e., higher interception rates) but higher macronutrient returns to the forest floor. This increase in macronutrient deposition was directly related to substantial increases in nutrient concentrations, which, in turn, suggested a greater degree of canopy interaction and (or) leaching on these sites. Throughfall pH, however, was not significantly different across the three study sites. With respect to temporal patterns, the major cations (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) demonstrated an increasing trend in concentration levels in TF as the season progressed to a maximum in October. TKN and TP concentrations, on the other hand, maintained relatively stable levels throughout the summer, peaking in September, but dropping substantially in October as metabolic processes slowed and the supply of these nutrients to the foliage was reduced. Even with the increase in base cation concentration, throughfall pH shifted downward to 4.3 or below by late fall.

AB The large western Irish lakes are natural salmonid lakes and a unique ecological resource. Lough Mask (82 km(2)) and Lough Conn (50 km(2)), Co. Mayo, are among the finest, natural, wild brown trout fisheries in Europe. Recently, however, threats have arisen to water quality in Lough Conn as a result of agricultural intensification. A doubling of phosphorus (P) inputs to Lough Conn for the period 1980 to 1990 caused a number of ecological changes such as an apparent increase in littoral algal production; while arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) have also disappeared from the lake over the same period of time. The changes in Lough Conn appear to represent an early phase in the eutrophication process. The western Irish lakes represent a super-sensitive ecological category requiring particularly strict catchment controls in order to protect the diversity of native flora and fauna including unusual glacial relict species and the unique genetic strains of fish which are present. Catchment management committees were established in order to study and reverse the perceived early-stage eutrophication problem in Lough Conn and in order to prevent the occurrence of similar problems in the case of Lough Mask. These committees have a sectoral basis covering: agriculture, local authority functions (sewage, rural septic tanks, planning and environmental control), forestry, peat harvesting and drainage works, as well as having representation from the fisheries boards and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Management of these relatively pristine lakes is perhaps a more difficult problem than that of cleaning up an obviously degraded resource. This is especially so since they are located in regions which are economically underdeveloped and where a real need exists to improve economic returns from farming, tourism and industry in the catchments. The importance of developing a sustainable, ecologically-based management strategy which will maintain existing high quality lakes into the next century with their irreplaceable genetic and ecological resources intact cannot be over-emphasised. The challenge is to devise refined management strategies which will eliminate nutrient wastage to waters and yet allow an appropriate level of sustainable development in the area. The management of Lough Conn and Lough Mask is described in some detail concentrating in particular on the efforts to reduce phosphorus loss from agriculture in the catchment but also emphasising the importance of a multi-sectoral approach to phosphorus load reduction.

AB The riparian zone is the interface between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and forms the ecotone where the two ecosystems intersect. Areas of the riparian zone utilised for the protection of water quality are common today, and are either left undisturbed or managed to intercept or modify impacts from adjacent land uses. In Ireland, aquatic buffer zones (ABZs) are used to protect streams from the potential impacts of commercially managed conifer forests and associated high impact forestry operations. In 1991, the Forest Service (currently of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) introduced the requirement for ABZs to be put in place on all streams identified on Ordinance Survey maps at either afforestation or restocking after clearfell. The width of the ABZs range from 10-25 m depending on the slope of the river bank in combination with the susceptibility of the soils to erode. Current practice is to leave the ABZ undisturbed allowing for natural colonization by a mix of species and establishment of various habitat types. This study describes the habitats and vegetation composition of 86 naturally vegetated riparian zones (65 ABZs in commercial conifer forests and 21 control sites) on six soil types, with a view to informing their optimum management. Across all sites, 392 taxa, within 32 habitat types were identified. The most common habitats were wet grasslands and scrub. Little variation was noted between the structure and composition of plant communities in ABZs (on afforested and clearfell 82 replanted) and control sites within a soil type. The communities did differ across soil types between the mineral and peaty soils, which were independent of the forest type. Within a soil type, ABZs are maintaining similar habitat and species diversity to that found on control sites indicating that current forest management practices are not impacting plant diversity in the ABZs. It is noted that tree species are not a feature of the riparian zone on peat soils and thus tree planting is not recommended as a management option unless used to control water temperatures. There is scope for tree planting on mineral soils, as control sites contained woodland habitats which were absent from the ABZs of clearfell and replanted sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and energy balance are examined to investigate the functional responses of a mature mangrove forest to a disturbance generated by Hurricane Wilma on October 24,2005 in the Florida Everglades. At the EC site, high winds from the hurricane caused nearly 100% defoliation in the upper canopy and widespread tree mortality. Soil temperatures down to 50 cm increased, and air temperature lapse rates within the forest canopy switched from statically stable to statically unstable conditions following the disturbance. Unstable conditions allowed more efficient transport of water vapor and CO2 from the surface up to the upper canopy layer. Significant increases in latent heat fluxes (LE) and nighttime net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were also observed and sensible heat fluxes (H) as a proportion of net radiation decreased significantly in response to the disturbance. Many of these impacts persisted through much of the study period through 2009. However, local albedo and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) data (the Enhanced Vegetation Index) indicated a substantial proportion of active leaf area recovered before the EC measurements began 1 year after the storm. Observed changes in the vertical distribution and the degree of clumping in newly emerged leaves may have affected the energy balance. Direct comparisons of daytime NEE values from before the storm and after our measurements resumed did not show substantial or consistent differences that could be attributed to the disturbance. Regression analyses on seasonal time scales were required to differentiate the storm's impact on monthly average daytime NEE from the changes caused by interannual variability in other environmental drivers. The effects of the storm were apparent on annual time scales, and CO2 uptake remained approximately 250g C m(-2) yr(-1) lower in 2009 compared to the average annual values measured in 2004-2005. Dry season CO2 uptake was relatively more affected by the disturbance than wet season values. Complex leaf regeneration dynamics on damaged trees during ecosystem recovery are hypothesized to lead to the variable dry versus wet season impacts on daytime NEE. In contrast, nighttime CO2 release (i.e., nighttime respiration) was consistently and significantly greater, possibly as a result of the enhanced decomposition of litter and coarse woody debris generated by the storm, and this effect was most apparent in the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. The largest pre- and post-storm differences in NEE coincided roughly with the delayed peak in cumulative mortality of stems in 2007-2008. Across the hurricane-impacted region, cumulative tree mortality rates were also closely correlated with declines in peat surface elevation. Mangrove forest-atmosphere interactions are interpreted with respect to the damage and recovery of stand dynamics and soil accretion processes following the hurricane. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Factors controlling the levels and forms of trace metals in streams, and transport from watersheds into streams, are poorly understood. We determined levels of filtrable (<0.4 mu m) and particulate Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in rivers draining two contrasting watersheds in eastern Wisconsin. Both are developed on glaciated terrain, but the North Branch Milwaukee watershed (agricultural) is characterized by gently sloping uplands with thick silt loam soils, while the Wolf River (forested) has peat loam soils on hilly terrain. Watershed differences resulted in higher mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations under baseflow conditions in the Wolf River (7 mg l(-1)) than in the Milwaukee River (4 mg l(-1)), but higher suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels in the Milwaukee (18 vs. 2 mg l(-1)). Mean filtrable trace metal concentrations (ng l(-1)) under baseflow conditions were similar in the Milwaukee and Wolf rivers (Al = 4.0 and 5.8; Cd = 4.2 and 3.2; Cu = 660 and 200; Pb = 56 and 53; Zn = 340 and 240), but particulate metal levels (ng l(-1)) were higher in the Milwaukee (Al = 230 vs. 16; Cd = 14 vs. 0.8; Cu = 736 vs. 90; Pb = 750 vs. 30; Zn = 2290 vs. 180). Filtrable metal concentrations exhibited low variability (relative standard deviation) under baseflow (Milwaukee: 5-20% Cu, Pb, Zn; 20-40% Al, Cd-Wolf: 10-35% Cu, Pb, Zn; 30-60% Al, Cd), while variability in particulate metal concentrations was somewhat higher (18-73%). During events (spring melt, storms), concentrations increased 1- to 5-fold for filtrable metals and 1- to 17-fold for particulate metals. Differences between watersheds and within-watershed responses to events were related in part to SPM (particulate metals) and DOC (filtrable metals) levels in the rivers and their associated influences on metal partitioning. In the Milwaukee River (higher SPM and lower DOG), particulate metal phases were more dominant (range among the five metals in mean % particulate = 47-98% vs. 24-74% for the Wolf. Partitioning (K-d) to SPM followed the order Pb > Zn > Cd > Cu, whereas relationships to DOC indicated essentially the reverse order for metal binding to DOG. SPM was a good predictor of particulate metal levels, especially in the Milwaukee River (> 94% of variance in particulate Cd, Pb, and Zn was accounted for, vs. 44-69% in Wolf River). While DOC was able to account for a significant portion of the variation in certain filtrable metal levels (r(2) = 0.52-0.65), other metals showed poorer correlations, probably due to variability in the composition of DOC and SPM and to variability in the forms of metal (aqueous complexes, colloid-bound) in the filtrable fraction.

AB The variation in species composition of trees greater-than-or-equal-to 7.6 cm gbh in thirty-eight plots (mostly c. 0.2 ha in extent) from physiognomically-defined kerangas forest were re-analyzed by principal components analysis ordination (species centering and standardization by sample norm). Analyses were performed separately on basal area abundances, on the densities of trees in three size classes (greater-than-or-equal-to 7.6, greater-than-or-equal-to 30.5 and greater-than-or-equal-to 61.0 cm gbh) and on the density of small and large trees (7.6- < 30.5 and 30.5- < 61.0 cm gbh). A total of 636 taxa were reduced to 381 for analysis, removing those of very low density and plot frequency.
   Three groups of plots were identified: forest at low elevation, and generally coastal, on deep humus podzols; forest at intermediate elevation on mostly red-yellow podzols with affinities to dipterocarp forest; and forest at high elevation on mostly peaty podzols. The first group was divisible into five subgroups along a drainage gradient, while the more poorly drained plots showing affinities to peat-swamp forest. Forty to eighty of the taxa, depending on the criteria for selection, were sufficient to define a stable, reduced spatial structure of the data matrix. Two subgroups, both coastal on deep podzols, represent the extreme form of kerangas forest per se. A comparison of Agathis borneensis- and Shorea albida-dominated plots revealed few other associated and differentiating taxa.
   Patterns were clearest from analyses of basal area data and of densities of all and small trees. Ordinations and grouping of plots for small, but not large, tree densities were similar to those for basal area. Different species were differentiated on the basis of the abundance measure, leading to group (tabular) definition of associations in a dual manner. A new system of summarization is presented which combines basal area, density and frequency in a graded hierarchical approach.
   The association between vegetation and soil type was difficult to unravel because of the limited environmental space sampled. Soil type was confounded with elevation, rainfall and geographical location. A major factor is clay content probably affecting nutrient status and water holding properties. 'Modal analysis' of small tree densities showed clearest patterns in this respect. There were no patterns at the family or genus level, nor in leaf size spectra within kerangas.
   Problems in the treatment, analysis and summarization of tropical forest data sets are discussed. These problems centre on the scale and intensity of field sampling and the advantages of measuring small trees leading to a dual basal area and density approach. All published studies, including this one, within kerangas forest have used inadequate sampling for the purposes of revealing species changes with respect to soil type and composition.

TI Resin Productivity of Pine after Partial Logging on the Hydrotechnical
   Reclamation Site

AB Integrated use of coniferous forest resources is a natural necessity of sustainable environment conservancy. Hydrological forest reclamation systems in coniferous boreal forests imply the development of specific management regime including silvicultural tending and partial logging. Spectrum broadening of products obtained in forest land exploitation should be achieved by the means of lifetime and minor use. Production of pine turpentine (sap) allows to obtain valuable forest chemical raw materials for the number of industries. Influence of forest drainage and partial logging on resin productivity is one of the insufficiently provided research issues in forestry. On the example of Sokol'skiy District of Vologda Region, the influence of location of pine trees (towards the channels of regulating network and forest belts), left for completion of growing after partial logging, on the pine sap exudation under closed tapping was studied. It was established that the drainage system channels in the felling site area were in satisfactory condition from 1972 till 2015. The highest resin productivity of pine forests was observed in July and the lowest in August. One of the forest belts had the highest resin productivity in the center and at the edge of the swath in 2013 and 2015; and in the channel area in 2013 and 2014. Resin productivity at the felling site is 1.4 times higher than in the control area (under the drainage conditions). This proves the positive effect from selective tree cutting in logging for resin exudation from the part of trees remained after tapping. Three years of studies have shown that the variability of resin exudation at the edge of the swath is 9 % less than in the center of the swath. No apparent fluctuations have been found in the channel and interchannel areas of the drained belt. The study has proved that soil and air temperature, and valuation diameter of sample trees involved into tapping can affect the resin exudation. A significant correlation with the temperature of underlying surface was registered in July and August and with the soil temperature in July. The air temperature at the level of resin blaze location of the sample trees affects the resin exudation mostly in June. It turned out that the correlation between resin exudation and valuation diameter of trees is stronger in the channel area and at the edge of swath than in the center of interchannel area. Probably, it depends on the microclimate and hydrological features after draining and partial logging that results in more comfortable conditions for growth (higher illumination). The turpentine production in drained pine forests requires carrying out partial cuttings of moderate intensity by reserves and intensive tapping at the edges of belts (logging area) left for completion of growing. In drained pine forests on peat soils, tapping with greater intensity should be carried out in the channel areas (along the drainage channels).

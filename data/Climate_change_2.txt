AB Conservation and restoration of fens and fen meadows often aim to reduce soil nutrients, mainly nitrogen (N) andphosphorus (P). The biogeochemistry of P has received much attention as P-enrichment is expected to negatively impact on species diversity in wetlands. It is known that N, sulphur (S) and hydrological conditions affect the biogeochemistry of P, yet their interactive effects on P-dynamics are largely unknown. Additionally, in Europe, climate change has been predicted to lead to increases in summer drought. We performed a greenhouse experiment to elucidate the interactive effects of N, S and a single drought event on the P-availability for Phalaris arundinacea. Additionally, the response of plant phosphatase activity to these factors was measured over the two year experimental period. In contrast to results from earlier experiments, our treatments hardly affected soil P-availability. This may be explained by the higher pH in our soils, hampering the formation of Fe-P or Fe-Al complexes. Addition of S, however, decreased the plants N:P ratio, indicating an effect of S on the N:P stoichiometry and an effect on the plant's P-demand. Phosphatase activity increased significantly after addition of S, but was not affected by the addition of N or a single drought event. Root phosphatase activity was also positively related to plant tissue N and P concentrations, plant N and P uptake, and plant aboveground biomass, suggesting that the phosphatase enzyme influences P-biogeochemistry. Our results demonstrated that it is difficult to predict the effects of wetland restoration, since the involved mechanisms are not fully understood. Short-term and long-term effects on root phosphatase activity may differ considerably. Additionally, the addition of S can lead to unexpected effects on the biogeochemistry of P. Our results showed that natural resource managers should be careful when restoring degraded fens or preventing desiccation of fen ecosystems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Emissions from thaw ponds largely offset the carbon sink of northern

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAKES; MIRES; GASES; CH4; CO2
AB Northern regions have received considerable attention not only because the effects of climate change are amplified at high latitudes but also because this region holds vast amounts of carbon (C) stored in permafrost. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to warming temperatures and increased permafrost thaw and the breakdown and release of soil C in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The majority of research has focused on quantifying and upscaling the effects of thaw on CO2 and CH4 emissions from terrestrial systems. However, small ponds formed in permafrost wetlands following thawing have been recognized as hotspots for C emissions. Here, we examined the importance of small ponds for C fluxes in two permafrost wetland ecosystems in northern Sweden. Detailed flux estimates of thaw ponds during the growing season show that ponds emit, on average (+/- SD), 279 +/- 415 and 7 +/- 11 mmol C m(-2) d(-2) of CO2 and CH4, respectively. Importantly, addition of pond emissions to the total C budget of the wetland decreases the C sink by -39%. Our results emphasize the need for integrated research linking C cycling on land and in water in order to make correct assessments of contemporary C balances.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine wetland located in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, at 3200 m elevation were measured during 1996-1998. Respiration, net CO2 flux, and CH4 flux were measured using the closed chamber method during snow-free periods and using gas diffusion calculations during snow-covered periods. The ranges of measured flux were 1.2-526 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (respiration), -1056-100 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (net CO2 exchange), and 0.1-36.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (a positive value represents efflux to the atmosphere). Respiration and CH4 emission were significantly correlated with 5 cm soil temperature. Annual respiration and CH4 emission were modeled by applying the flux-temperature relationships to a continuous soil temperature record during 1996-1998. Gross photosynthesis was modeled using a hyperbolic equation relating gross photosynthesis, photon flux density, and soil temperature. Modeled annual flux estimates indicate that the wetland was a net source of carbon gas to the atmosphere each of the three years: 8.9 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1996, 9.5 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1997, and 9.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1998. This contrasts with the long-term carbon accumulation of similar to0.7 mol m(-2) yr(-1) determined from C analyses of a peat core collected from the wetland.

AB Climate change is expected to influence the viability of populations both directly and indirectly, via species interactions. The effects of large-scale climate change are also likely to interact with local habitat conditions. Management actions designed to preserve threatened species therefore need to adapt both to the prevailing climate and local conditions. Yet, few studies have separated the direct and indirect effects of climatic variables on the viability of local populations and discussed the implications for optimal management. We used 30years of demographic data to estimate the simultaneous effects of management practice and among-year variation in four climatic variables on individual survival, growth and fecundity in one coastal and one inland population of the perennial orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica in Norway. Current management, mowing, is expected to reduce competitive interactions. Statistical models of how climate and management practice influenced vital rates were incorporated into matrix population models to quantify effects on population growth rate. Effects of climate differed between mown and control plots in both populations. In particular, population growth rate increased more strongly with summer temperature in mown plots than in control plots. Population growth rate declined with spring temperature in the inland population, and with precipitation in the coastal population, and the decline was stronger in control plots in both populations. These results illustrate that both direct and indirect effects of climate change are important for population viability and that net effects depend both on local abiotic conditions and on biotic conditions in terms of management practice and intensity of competition. The results also show that effects of management practices influencing competitive interactions can strongly depend on climatic factors. We conclude that interactions between climate and management should be considered to reliably predict future population viability and optimize conservation actions.

AB Turnover rates of soil carbon for 20 soil types typical for a 3.7 million km(2) area of European Russia were estimated based on C-14 data. The rates are corrected for bomb radiocarbon which strongly affects the topsoil C-14 balance. The approach is applied for carbon stored in the organic and mineral layers of the upper 1 m of the soil profile. The turnover rates carbon in the upper 20 cm are relatively high for forest soils (0.16-0.78% yearmediate for tundra soils (0.25% year(-1)), and low for grassland soils (0.02-0.08% year(-1)) with the exception of southern Chernozems (0.32% year(-1)). In the soil layer of 20-100 cm depth, the turnover rates were much lower for all soil types (0.01-0.06% year(-1)) except for peat bog soils of the southern taiga (0.14% year(-1)). Combined with a map of soil type distribution and a dataset of several hundred soil carbon profiles, the method provides annual fluxes for the slowest components of soil carbon assuming that the latter is in equilibrium with climate and vegetation cover. The estimated carbon flux from the soil is highest for forest soils (12-147 gC/(m(2) year)), intermediate for tundra soils (33 gC/(m(2) year)), and lowest for grassland soils (1-26 gC/(m(2) year)). The approach does not distinguish active and recalcitrant carbon fractions and this explains the low turnover rates in the top layer. Since changes in soil types will follow changes in climate and land cover, we suggest that pedogenesis is an important factor influencing the future dynamics of soil carbon fluxes. Up to now, both the effect of soil type changes and the clear evidence from C-14 measurements that most soil organic carbon has a millennial time scale, are basically neglected in the global carbon cycle models used for projections of atmospheric CO2 in 21st century and beyond.

AB Paleoenvironmental records from Patagonia reveal the importance of latitude, longitude and elevation in shaping the response of vegetation to climate change. We examined the vegetation, fire and watershed history from two sites at lat. 44 degrees S, as inferred from pollen, charcoal and lithologic data. These reconstructions were compared with independent paleoenvironmental records to better understand ecosystem dynamics along the southeastern Andes (lat. 41-50 degrees S). Our results show that at lat. 44 degrees S, late-glacial heath-steppe was colonized by trees at similar to 14,200 cal yr BP and forests became more closed at 11,500 cal yr BP. Differences in forest cover between the two sites were likely due to elevation-dependent disparities in humidity and fire. North of lat. 44 degrees S, increasing precipitation favored initial forest development at 16,500 cal yr BP, while dry conditions restricted tree expansion in the south until 7000 cal yr BP. The time-transgressive pattern is attributed to a gradual southward shift in the Southern Westerlies resulting from deglaciation and increasing annual insoltion. Present-day vegetation developed at all latitudes during the middle to late Holocene, when the core of the Southern Westerlies reached its modern position (50 degrees S). Asynchronous forest expansions north and south of lat. 45 degrees S between 5000 and 3000 cal yr BP are ascribed to centennial cycles of contraction and expansion of the Southern Westerlies, which led to seasonal variations in precipitation at the core and northern border of the wind belt. Synchronous oscillations in tree abundance along the eastern Andes prevailed during the last 3000 years. Decreased forest cover at all latitudes between 2500 and 1500 cal yr BP is concurrent with La Nina-like conditions and high solar irradiance. These climate drivers likely decreased effective moisture and favored fires at all latitudes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Widespread permafrost decay is currently occurring in the northern hemisphere. In subarctic Quebec, most permafrost mounds are located in peatlands in the form of palsas and peat plateaus. The formation and degradation of these periglacial landforms are influenced by several regional and local factors including air temperature, depth of snow cover, and peat insulation. Mineral palsas are another type of permafrost landforms found along river shores in subarctic Canada. Due to their peculiar position near or in the river floodplain, the dynamics of these palsas are influenced by water level fluctuations. This study examines palsa dynamics along a subarctic river, the Boniface River, in northern Quebec. Mapping of palsas and thermokarst ponds over a 44-year period, i.e., from 1957 (from aerial photographs) to 2001 (from field surveys) was used to evaluate changes in the distribution and area covered by permafrost landforms. Also the decay of 14 palsas was assessed using the mortality dates of black spruce trees as determined by tree-ring analysis. Between 1957 and 2001 the area occupied by palsas decreased by 23% whereas 76% of the present-day thermokarst area formed since 1957. No new palsas developed during this period. For the 14 palsas studied, degradation began at the end of the 19th century and accelerated during the 20th century. Palsa degradation was closely related to distance from the river channel. Palsas located in the river floodplain were the most affected by thawing and showed a 48% reduction in area. Degradation was less severe for palsas located 1 to 15 m from the river margin, which experienced a 19% reduction in area. The spatiotemporal distribution of palsas suggests that changes in water level are among the most important factors influencing the dynamics of riparian palsas, particularly for those palsas directly in contact with the river water.

AB Climate change projections show that temperature and precipitation increases can alter the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and high latitude landscapes, including their freshwaters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, but the impact of catchment productivity on DOC release to subarctic waters remains poorly known, especially at regional scales. We test the hypothesis that increased terrestrial productivity, as indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), generates higher stream DOC concentrations in the Stordalen catchment in subarctic Sweden. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the degree to which other generic catchment properties (elevation, slope) explain DOC concentration, and whether or not land cover variables representing the local vegetation type (e.g., mire, forest) need to be included to obtain adequate predictive models for DOC delivered into rivers. We show that the land cover type, especially the proportion of mire, played a dominant role in the catchment's release of DOC, while NDVI, slope, and elevation were supporting predictor variables. The NDVI as a single predictor showed weak and inconsistent relationships to DOC concentrations in recipient waters, yet NDVI was a significant positive regulator of DOC in multiple regression models that included land cover variables. Our study illustrates that vegetation type exerts primary control in DOC regulation in Stordalen, while productivity (NDVI) is of secondary importance. Thus, predictive multiple linear regression models for DOC can be utilized combining these different types of explanatory variables.

AB Wetlands are the world's largest natural source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The strong sensitivity of methane emissions to environmental factors such as soil temperature and moisture has led to concerns about potential positive feedbacks to climate change. This risk is particularly relevant at high latitudes, which have experienced pronounced warming and where thawing permafrost could potentially liberate large amounts of labile carbon over the next 100 years. However, global models disagree as to the magnitude and spatial distribution of emissions, due to uncertainties in wetland area and emissions per unit area and a scarcity of in situ observations. Recent intensive field campaigns across the West Siberian Lowland (WSL) make this an ideal region over which to assess the performance of large-scale process-based wetland models in a high-latitude environment. Here we present the results of a follow-up to the Wetland and Wetland CH4 Intercomparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP), focused on the West Siberian Lowland (WETCHIMP-WSL). We assessed 21 models and 5 inversions over this domain in terms of total CH4 emissions, simulated wetland areas, and CH4 fluxes per unit wetland area and compared these results to an intensive in situ CH4 flux data set, several wetland maps, and two satellite surface water products. We found that (a) despite the large scatter of individual estimates, 12-year mean estimates of annual total emissions over the WSL from forward models (5.34 +/- 0.54 TgCH(4) yr(-1)), inversions (6.06 +/- 1.22 TgCH(4) yr(-1)), and in situ observations (3.91 +/- 1.29 TgCH(4) yr(-1)) largely agreed; (b) forward models using surface water products alone to estimate wetland areas suffered from severe biases in CH4 emissions; (c) the interannual time series of models that lacked either soil thermal physics appropriate to the high latitudes or realistic emissions from unsaturated peatlands tended to be dominated by a single environmental driver (inundation or air temperature), unlike those of inversions and more sophisticated forward models; (d) differences in biogeochemical schemes across models had relatively smaller influence over performance; and (e) multiyear or multidecade observational records are crucial for evaluating models' responses to long-term climate change.

AB Given the current scenario of increasing global temperatures, it is valuable to assess the potential influence of changing climate on pollution distribution and deposition. In this study we use long-term sediment records from three lakes (spanning ca. 1000, 4800, and 8000 years, respectively) from the Greenland west coast to assess recent and long-term variations in mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb), including stable Pb isotopes (Pb-206 and Pb-207), in terms of pollution and climate influences. The temporal trends in sediment deposited from about the mid-19th century and forward are in general agreement with the history of industrial emissions at lower latitudes. Therefore, in recent sediment a possible influence from changing climate is difficult to assess. However, by using deeper sediment layers we show that changes in Greenland climate caused changes in the lake influx of material from regional aeolian activity, which resulted in large fluctuations in Hg and Pb concentrations and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios. The aeolian material is primarily derived from glacio-fluvial material with low Hg and Pb concentrations and a different isotopic composition. For one of the lakes, the fluctuations in Hg concentrations (10 to 70 ng g(-1)) prior to the 19th century are equal to the anthropogenic increase in the uppermost layers, suggesting that when studying recent concentrations and time trends of pollution in relatively low-contaminated areas such as the Arctic, the early natural fluctuations must be considered.

AB Wetlands are especially at risk from climate change because of their intermediate landscape position (i.e., transition between upland and aquatic environments), where small changes in precipitation and/or evapotranspiration can have substantial impacts on wetland hydrology. Because hydrology is the primary factor influencing wetland structure and function, the important ecosystem services that wetlands provide may be altered or lost as a result of climate change. While a great deal of uncertainty is associated with the projected impacts of climate change on wetlands, hydrologic models and downscaled climate model projections provide tools to reduce this uncertainty. DRAINMOD is one such process-based hydrologic model that has been successfully adapted to simulate the daily water level fluctuations in natural wetlands. The objective of this project was to determine the range of possible impacts of climate change on the hydrologic regimes of non-riverine, non-tidal Coastal Plain wetlands in North Carolina. DRAINMOD models were calibrated and validated for two minimally disturbed, natural wetland sites using observed water table and local weather data. Two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were evaluated: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Nine models were selected from an ensemble of 32 climate models to represent the range of possible changes in mean precipitation and temperature. Downscaled climate projections were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Simulations were run from 1986 to 2099, and results were evaluated by comparing the projected mean water table levels between the base period (1986-2015) and two future evaluation periods: 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. The model simulation results indicated that the projected mean water table level may decline by as much as 25 to 84 cm by the end of this century (2070-2099) for the RCP8.5 scenario and may decline by 4 to 61 cm for the RCP4.5 scenario. In Coastal Plain wetlands, declines in water tables can lead to the subsidence of organic soils, which can lead to the loss of stored carbon and increased risk of peat fires. Lower mean water levels can also lead to shifts in vegetation community composition and loss of habitat functions for wetland-dependent fauna. These results provide an overview of the potential impacts of climate change on North Carolina wetlands, and they provide a range of scenarios to inform and guide possible changes to water management strategies in wetland ecosystems that can be implemented now to limit the loss of ecosystem services over the long term.

AB Climate is an important driver of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in boreal catchments characterized by networks of streams within forest-wetland landscape mosaics. In this paper, we assess how climate change may affect stream DOC concentrations ([DOC]) and export from boreal forest streams with a multi-model ensemble approach. First, we apply an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) to project soil temperatures and stream-flows. These data are then used to drive two biogeochemical models of surface water DOC: (1) The Integrated Catchment model for Carbon (INCA-C), a detailed process-based model of DOC operating at the catchment scale, and (2) The Riparian Integration Model (RIM), a simple dynamic hillslope scale model of stream [DOC]. All RCMs project a consistent increase in temperature and precipitation as well as a shift in spring runoff peaks from May to April. However, they present a considerable range of possible future runoff conditions with an ensemble median increase of 31 % between current and future (2061-2090) conditions. Both biogeochemical models perform well in describing the dynamics of present-day stream [DOC] and fluxes, but disagree in their future projections. Here, we assess possible futures in three boreal catchments representative of forest, mire and mixed landscape elements. INCA-C projects a wider range of stream [DOC] due to its temperature sensitivity, whereas RIM gives consistently larger inter-annual variation and a wider range of exports due to its sensitivity to hydrological variations. The uncertainties associated with modeling complex processes that control future DOC dynamics in boreal and temperate catchments are still the main limitation to our understanding of DOC mechanisms under changing climate conditions. Novel, currently overlooked or unknown drivers may appear that will present new challenges to modelling DOC in the future.

AB Rising sea levels and temperature will be dominant drivers of coastal Everglades' foundation communities (i.e., mangrove forests, seagrass/macroalgae, and coral reefs) by 2060 based on a climate change scenario of +1.5 A degrees C temperature, +1.5 foot (46 cm) in sea level, +/- 10 % in precipitation and 490 ppm CO2. Current mangrove forest soil elevation change in South Florida ranges from 0.9 to 2.5 mm year(-1) and would have to increase twofold to fourfold in order to accommodate a 2060 sea level rise rate. No evidence is available to indicate that coastal mangroves from South Florida and the wider Caribbean can keep pace with a rapid rate of sea level rise. Thus, particles and nutrients from destabilized coastlines could be mobilized and impact benthic habitats of southern Florida. Uncertainties in regional geomorphology and coastal current changes under higher sea levels make this prediction tentative without further research. The 2060 higher temperature scenario would compromise Florida's coral reefs that are already degraded. We suggest that a new paradigm is needed for resource management under climate change that manages coastlines for resilience to marine transgression and promotes active ecosystem management. In the case of the Everglades, greater freshwater flows could maximize mangrove peat accumulation, stabilize coastlines, and limit saltwater intrusion, while specific coral species may require propagation. Further, we suggest that regional climate drivers and oceanographic processes be incorporated into Everglades and South Florida management plans, as they are likely to impact coastal ecosystems, interior freshwater wetlands and urban coastlines over the next few decades.

AB Climate change and nitrogen (N) deposition are among the most important drivers of biodiversity change at a global scale. Although commonly considered separately in applied research, conservation, and policy development, both empirical evidence and modelling studies indicate that these two stressors may act synergistically and trigger a more pronounced biodiversity loss than each of them alone. Interactive effects thus need to be considered in biodiversity conservation. In this study, we propose a new method for jointly assessing risk from both stressors to habitats by combining climate envelope modelling and the evaluation of exceedance of empirical critical loads for eutrophication through N deposition. Based on this approach we can calculate a combined risk metric, which is the scaled exceedance of the N critical load and climatic thresholds in the three-dimensional space of N deposition, temperature, and water limitation. We use a habitat map to project this risk metric for 34 EUNIS habitat types across Austria. Resulting risk maps indicated that about 16 % of the area of these natural and semi-natural habitat types is currently at risk from either N exceedance, drought or warming. Using combinations of future climatic (RCP2.5 and RCP8.5) and N deposition (business as usual, current legislation and maximum feasible reduction) scenarios, we predict that the area at risk might increase to up to 19% until 2050, with risk from N-deposition decreasing and risk from climate change increasing. Combined impacts of both stressors affect only up to 2% of the entire evaluated area, but are much more frequent in particular habitat types such as oligotrophic bogs and subalpine to alpine grasslands. We conclude that this method provides a useful screening procedure to identify and compare areas and habitats under combined risk from both stressors and to thus support prioritization and decision making in biodiversity conservation.

AB Pollen and charcoal from East Sooke Fen, Pixie Lake, and Whyac Lake were used to reconstruct the post glacial vegetation, climate, and fire-disturbance history across a precipitation gradient on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. An open Pinus woodland covered the landscape in the early late-glacial interval. Fires were absent under a cool and dry climate. Closed mixed conifer forests of Pinus, Picea, Abies, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg., and Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carriere replaced the Pinus biogeochron in the late late-glacial interval. Fires became more common even though climate was cool and moist. Open Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco forests expanded westward during the warm dry early Holocene, though closed Picea and Tsuga heterophylla forests grew in the wettest part of the area at Whyac Lake. Modern precipitation gradients likely originated at this time. Fires occurred in forested ecosystems, although East Sooke Fen at the driest end of the gradient experienced less fire. The middle and late Holocene was characterized by increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature, respectively. Quercus garryana Dougl. stands spread westward during the mid-Holocene. Extant closed Tsuga heterophylla and Cupressaceae (Thuja plicata Donn. ex D. Don) forests arose in the wetter part of the gradient, whereas Pseudotsuga forests occupied drier eastern areas. During this interval, fires were rare in wet western regions but apparently more common in dry eastern regions.

AB This study proposes a new method to detect changes of altitudinal distribution limit of a plant species based on the stomatal analysis of fossilized leaves. We use the Holocene fossil leaves ofFagus crenata(Japanese beech), a dominant deciduous tree in the cool temperate zone, from different horizons in a peat bog in Mt. Kurikoma, north Japan. Results of palaeo-CO(2)concentration reconstructed from the stomatal analysis indicate palaeo-CO(2)fluctuation between 317 and 352 ppmv during the Middle-Late Holocene, which was more variable and higher than Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. This result is possibly influenced by the oceanic CO(2)uptake, which increased with the strengthening of the Tsushima Warm Current during the Middle Holocene. The stomatal index (SI) variation range of fossilFagus crenataleaves in the Middle Holocene was higher than that of the modern population at a given altitude, indicating transportation of leaves from an altitude higher than the site of fossil deposition. A decreasing trend of the SI variation range between 5000 and 2500 cal. a BP can possibly be attributed to the downward shift of the upper distribution limit ofFagus crenatafrom an altitude higher than or similar to the present limit to the area surrounding the fossil deposition site. This downward shift of the upper distribution limit ofFagus crenatawas simultaneous with temperature and humidity decreases and correlated with the decreasing East Asian Summer Monsoon intensity and a cooling event around 4000 cal. a BP.

AB Understanding large-scale drivers of animal breeding densities and demography has a range of important uses, including informing conservation management. Given the threat of climate change, the importance of developing a process-based understanding of variation in animal populations is increased to inform adaptive management. For a climate-change sensitive species, the European Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, we use novel field-collected data on large-scale spatial variation in prey abundance and vegetation structure to understand drivers of breeding abundance and breeding success, and inform potential management responses. The abundance of the key prey, crane flies (Tipulidae), increased with altitude (a surrogate for temperature) and peat depth (a surrogate for soil moisture). Golden plover breeding densities were highest where vegetation was shortest, probably reflecting greater prey accessibility. In contrast, breeding success was not strongly related to vegetation height, but positively correlated with both crane fly abundance and daily minimum temperatures. When combined to model the number of likely successful pairs in any 1 year, the magnitude of vegetation height effect far exceeded that of crane fly abundance. Thus, for golden plover and other shorebirds sharing similar habitats, management to optimize breeding habitat (grazing or burning to promote short vegetation) may differ from management to promote breeding success (drain blocking to increase soil moisture and prey abundance). Adaptive management in the face of climate change should therefore include appropriate vegetation management, as well as maximizing prey abundance. More broadly, as the drivers of breeding density and demographic parameters may differ, we advocate that conservation practitioners collect not just information on species' distributions but also underpinning demographic processes when using science to inform management.

AB Multiple and rapid environmental changes in the Arctic have major consequences for the entire ecosystem. Soil water chemistry is one component with important implications for understanding climate feedbacks, plant growth, microbial turnover and net greenhouse gas emissions. Here we assess the contrasting growing season soil water chemistry in a Low arctic Greenlandic mesic tundra heath and a fen, which have been subjected to factorial treatments of summer warming using open top chambers (OTCs), snow addition using snow fences, which increase soil temperature in late winter, and shrub removal mimicking herbivory attack. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and plant nutrients, including NO3-, NH4+, PO42+ and total dissolved N were measured during multiple growing seasons (2013-2016) to quantify the treatment effects on nutrient availability in two dominating, but contrasting, vegetation types.
   Ambient nutrient concentrations in the mesic tundra heath decreased throughout the growing season and increased during senescence, while concentrations were highest during peak growing season in the fen. The content of NH4+ and DOC were highest in the fen, whereas NO3- was highest in the mesic tundra heath. The fen had no seasonal pattern.
   Summer warming in the mesic tundra heath did not change the availability of nutrients, but in combination with shrub removal, both NO3- and DOC concentrations increased, likely due to reduced plant uptake. Shrub removal alone increased NO3- in one growing season, and, combined with snow addition, increased DOC. Significant effects of shrub removal were mostly found in 2016. Snow addition combined with summer warming increased DOC and total N concentrations and highlights the potential loss of dissolved C from the ecosystem.
   In the fen, shrub removal alone and combined with summer warming decreased DOC. Snow addition alone and in combination with summer warming similarly decreased DOC.
   In the mesic tundra heath, shrub removal caused higher soil water contents in all years. In the dry and warm 2016, it meant <10% soil water content in controls and 15-20% in shrub removal plots during the peak growing season, which may have relieved soil moisture limitation on mineralization rates in the latter.
   We conclude that soil water chemistry is vegetation-specific, and that treatment effects are surprisingly limited when comparing multiple years with contrasting precipitation patterns. Herbivory may have larger impact in very dry, warm summers and, together with extreme weather events, exert similar or larger effects than four years of temperature manipulations. The effects of summer warming or increased winter snow depend on ecosystem type and moisture status of the soil. The combination of multi-year and multi-site studies therefore seem important for understanding future biogeochemical dynamics in Arctic landscapes.

AB The vegetation of the Parinacota Province (18 degrees 12 ' S, 69 degrees 08 ' W) is studied using the Zurich-Montpellier school of phytosociology methods. The study area is located in a mountainous high andean environment, between 3200 and 5300 in of elevation, under the influence of tropical xeric to pluviseasonal bioclimates, with summer rainfall. Sixty-six phytosociological releves were performed in the field and were analyzed by tabular comparison using additional already published releves.
   Four phytosociological classes include all zonal vegetation of the study area: Para-strephio lepidophyllae-Fabianetea densae, supratropical, orotropical and cryoro-tropical dwarf-scrubs and grasslands; Polylepidetea tarapacano-besseri, orotropical Polylepis forests; Anthochloo lepidulae-Dielsiochloetea floribundae, cryorotropical vegetation of rocky and solifluxional soils. Supratropical desert scrubs of the alliance Ambrosio artemisioldis-Atriplicion imbricatae, are included in the new order Atriplicetalia imbricatae of the class Opuntietea sphaericae. Azonal vegetation is included into the classes Plantagini rigidae-Distichietea muscoldis (high andean mires and bogs), Potamogetonetea (submerged vegetation) and Lemnetea minoris (floating plant communities).
   Fourteen associations were recognized, five of which are new (Oreocereo Ieucotrichi-Ambrosietum artemisioidis, Lophopappeturn tarapacani, Diplostephio meyenii-Fabianetum ramulosae, Wernerio aretioidis-Parastrephietum lucidae and Senecioni zoellneri-Azorelletum compactae) and one is proposed as provisional (Deyeuxio curvulae-Wernerietum incisae). One new alliance (Diplostephio meyenii-Fabianion ramulosae) and one provisional alliance (Senecionion zoellneri-scorzoneraefolii) are described, discussing their syntaxonomy on the basis of 1115 releves already published for the involved classes, including the releves published here. Four vegetation belts were recognized according to the altitudinal variation of the vegetation physiognomy, floristic composition and bioclimate. Climatic influences of the temperature and humidity on the altitudinal zonation of vegetation belts are discussed in the context of tropical high Andes.
   Two main floristic elements can be distinguished in the Parinacota Province: Pacific Desert and Puna. The first one is the more important component at low altitude, decreasing its participation in higher elevation habitats, where the second becomes dominant. The origin of these elements is discussed on the basis of paleoecological data: the Pacific Desert element seems to be mainly associated to the development of aridity in the western slope of the Andes since the Miocene, while the Puna element appears to be originated due to the raise of the Andes during the Plio-Pletstocene. The phytogeographical affinities of the Parinacota Province with the Mediterranean Andes and the Paramo are also discussed.

AB The number of dominant vegetation types (wet prairies, sawgrass flats, ridges and sloughs, sloughs, and tree islands) historically and currently found in the Everglades, FL, USA, as with other wetlands with standing water, appears to be primarily a function of the magnitude of interannual water-level fluctuations. Analyses of 40 years of water-depth data were used to estimate the magnitude of contemporary (baseline) water-level fluctuations in undisturbed ridge and slough landscapes. Baseline interannual water-level fluctuations above the soil surface were at least 1.5 m. Predicted changes in interannual water-level fluctuations in 2060 were examined for seven climate change scenarios. When rainfall is predicted to increase by 10 %, the wettest scenario, the interannual range of water-level fluctuation increases to 1.8 m above the soil surface in sloughs. When rainfall is predicted to decrease by 10 % and temperatures to increase by 1.5 A degrees C, the driest scenario, the range of interannual range of water-level fluctuations is predicted to decrease to 1.2 m above the soil surface in sloughs. A change of 25-30 cm in interannual water-level fluctuations is needed to change the number of vegetation types in a wetland. This suggests that the two most extreme climate change scenarios could have a significant impact on the overall structure of wetland vegetation, i.e., the number of vegetation types or zones, found in the Everglades.

AB This presents the longest, consistent records of dissolved organic carbon in rivers ever published. This study presents long-term records of organic matter as indicated by water colour that were constructed for three catchments in Northern England for as far back as 1962. Observations show that there have been large increases in DOC concentrations over the period of study with in one case a doubling of the concentration over a period of 29 years. However, in one of the catchments no significant change was observed over a 31-year period. All catchments show common inter-annual control on carbon release in response to droughts, but no step increases in DOC concentrations were observed in response to such perturbations with pre-drought levels being restored within a period 3-4 years. Observed increasing trends do not correlate with changes in river discharge, pH, alkalinity or rainfall, but do coincide with increasing average summer temperatures in the region. The times series of DOC concentration over the period of the record appears stationary, but the distribution of daily values suggests a change in sources of colour over the increasing trend. The evidence supports a view that increases in carbon release are in equilibrium with temperature increases accentuated by land-use factors.

AB Previous studies of thermokarst lakes have drawn attention to the potential for accumulation of CH4 under the ice and its subsequent release in spring; however, such observations have not been available for thermokarst waters in carbon-rich peatlands. Here we undertook a winter profiling of five black-water lakes located on eroding permafrost peatlands in subarctic Quebec for comparison with summer profiles and used a 2-year data set of automated water temperature, conductivity, and oxygen measurements to evaluate how the annual mixing dynamics may affect the venting of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. All of the sampled lakes contained large amounts of dissolved CH4 under their winter ice cover. These sub-ice concentrations were up to 5 orders of magnitude above air equilibrium (i.e., the expected concentration in lake water equilibrated with the atmosphere), resulting in calculated emission rates at ice breakup that would be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than midsummer averages. The amount of CO2 dissolved in the water column was reduced in winter, and the estimated ratio of potential diffusive CO2 to CH4 emission in spring was half the measured summer ratio, suggesting a seasonal shift in methanogenesis and bacterial activity. All surface lake ice contained bubbles of CH4 and CO2, but this amounted to <5% of the total amount of the dissolved CH4 and CO2 in the corresponding lake water column. The continuous logging records suggested that lake morphometry may play a role in controlling the timing and extent of CH4 and CO2 release from the water column to the atmosphere.

AB High-latitude warming has led to radical changes in abiotic conditions influencing forest growth. In the North American boreal forest, widespread declines in forest productivity (particularly in western regions) and changing climate-growth relationships have been documented. Previous studies have proposed that this decline can be attributed to drought stress as increasing temperatures may cause evapotranspirative demand to exceed available moisture. We used tree ring studies to document growth dynamics of black spruce, one of the most dominant boreal tree species, in a boreal peatland experiencing rapid permafrost thaw. We specifically look at how changing permafrost conditions influence growth. Growth of black spruce at this site has declined steadily since the mid-1900s and exhibited a shift from positive responses to temperature pre-1970 to predominantly negative responses in recent decades, despite precipitation increasing over time at this site. Our results show that there is no apparent effect of landscape position or rate of lateral permafrost thaw on growth trends of black spruce, despite gradients in soil moisture and active layer thickness across the mosaic of wetlands and drier permafrost plateaus at this site. However, this does not imply no effect of permafrost thaw on growth; our results support growing evidence that vertical permafrost thaw (i.e., active layer thickening) is causing drought stress in these slow-growing, shallow-rooted trees. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate permafrost as a driver of within-site variability in growth-climate responses, and we provide insight into the widespread growth declines and divergence of climate-growth relationships in high-latitude forests.

However, over longer time periods, there were pronounced oscillations of TOC concentrations, similar to patterns of long-term changes of river discharge regime. On a yearly basis, there was a positive correlation between parameters of organic matter concentration and discharge in all selected rivers (r (S) = 0.540-0.803; P < 0.01). The impact of discharge on concentrations of organic matter could be masked by other factors, such as changes in precipitation, biological processes, soil types or land use.

AB Mediterranean rear-edge populations of Betula, located at the southwestern Eurasian margin of the distribution range, represent unique reservoirs of genetic diversity. However, increasing densities of wild ungulates, enhanced dryness, and wildfires threaten their future persistence. A historical perspective on the past responses of these relict populations to changing herbivory, fire occurrence and climatic conditions may contribute to assessing their future responses under comparable scenarios. We have reconstructed vegetation and disturbance (grazing, fire) history in the Cabaneros National Park (central-southern Spain) using the paleoecological records of two small mires. We particularly focused on the historical range of variation in disturbance regimes, and the dynamics of rear-edge Betula populations and herbivore densities. Changes in water availability, probably related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and land-use history have played a crucial role in vegetation shifts. Our data suggest that heathlands (mainly Erica arborea and E. scoparia) and Quercus woodlands dominated during dry phases while Sphagnum bogs and Betula stands expanded during wet periods. Betula populations survived past moderately dry periods but were unable to cope with enhanced land use, particularly increasing livestock raising since 1,100-900 cal. yr BP (850-1,050 CE), and eventually underwent local extinction. High herbivore densities not only contributed to the Betula demise but also caused the retreat of Sphagnum bogs. Ungulate densities further rose at 200-100 cal. yr BP (1750-1850 CE) associated with the historically documented intensification of land use around the Ecclesiastical Confiscation. However, herbivory reached truly unprecedented values only during the last decades, following rural depopulation and subsequent promotion of big game hunting. For the first time in temperate and Mediterranean Europe, we have used the abundances of fossil dung fungal spores to assess quantitatively that current high herbivore densities exceed the historical range of variation. In contrast, present fire activity lies within the range of variation of the last millennia, with fires (mainly human-set) mostly occurring during dry periods. Our paleodata highlight the need of controlling the densities of wild ungulates to preserve ecosystem composition and functioning. We also urge to restore Betula populations in suitable habitats where they mostly disappeared because of excessive human activities.

AB At the Prince Edward Islands, temperatures have increased by approximately 1 degrees C over the past 40 years, accompanied by a decline in precipitation. This ha's led to a reduction in the peat moisture content of mires and higher growing season ''warmth''. The temperature- and moisture-sensitive sedge, Uncinia compacta R. Pr. (Cyperaceae), has consequently increased its aerial cover on Prince Edward Island, but harvesting of seeds by feral house mice (up to 100% removed) has prevented this from happening on Marion Island. Such extensive use of resources suggests that prey switching may be taking place at Marion Island. Seat analyses revealed that mice are not only eating ectemnorhinine weevils to a greater extent than found in previous studies of populations at Marion Island, but that they also prefer larger weevils (+/- 6 mm). A decrease in body size of preferred weevil prey species [Bothrometopus randi Jeannel and Ectemnorhinus similis C.O. Waterhouse (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)] has taken place on Marion Island (1986-1992), but not on Prince Edward Island. This appears to be a result of increased predation on weevils. In addition, adults of the prey species, E. similis are relatively more abundant on Prince Edward Island than adults of the smaller congener E. marioni Jeannel, and could not be found on Marion Island in the late austral summer of 1991. These results not only provide support for previous hypotheses of the effect of global warming on mouse-plant-invertebrate interactions on the Prince Edward Islands, but also provide limited evidence for the first recorded case of predator-mediated speciation. They also show that the interaction of human-induced changes operating at different scales may have profound consequences for local systems.

AB High resolution pollen stratigraphy from three peat cores located within 20 km of Lateglacial moraines in south Westland, New Zealand provide detailed records of climate change during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT). The pollen record shows the replacement of grassland by shrubland prior to ca 15,300 C-14 yr BP (18,300 cal. yr BP) followed by the progressive development of broadleaf shrubland and scattered forest prior to ca 12,000 C-14 yr BP (14,400 cal. yr BP). Local vegetation changes around the time of the Younger Dryas chronozone (11-10ka C-14 BP) are evident, but are not necessarily a result of regional climate cooling. Vegetation changes between ca 12,000 and 10,000 C-14 yr BP (14,400 and 11,400 cal. yr BP) indicate a period of increased precipitation. Tall podocarp forest, similar to that of the contemporary forest, was well established by ca 10,000 C-14 yr BP (11,400 cal. yr BP). A period of increased westerly circulation over southern New Zealand is considered to be the most likely mechanism for causing the increased precipitation between ca 12,000 and 10,000 C-14 yr BP (14,300 and 11,400 cal. yr BP). Increased precipitation would also provide a mechanism for initiating LGIT ice advance in the area. Data from these records show some support for global climate change models that propose inter-hemispheric linkage, but may be more supportive of a climate change model that incorporates an increased westerly circulation over southern New Zealand during the LGIT.

AB Soil organic carbon (C) plays a critical role in supporting the productive capacity of soils and their ability to provide a wide range of ecologically important functions including the storage of atmospherically derived carbon dioxide (CO2). The present paper collates available information on Scottish soil C stocks and C losses and reviews the potential pressures on terrestrial C, which may threaten future C stocks. Past, present and possible future land use, land management practices and land use changes (LUCs) including forestry, agriculture, nitrogen (N) additions, elevated CO2 and climate change for Scotland are discussed and evaluated in relation to the anthropogenic pressures on soil C.
   The review deduces that current available data show little suggestion of significant changes in C stocks of Scottish soils, although this may be due to a lack of long-term trend data. However, it can be concluded that there are many pressures, such as climate change, intensity of land use practices, scale of LUC, soil erosion and pollution, which may pose significant threats to the future of Scottish soil C if these factors are not taken into consideration in future land management decisions. In particular, this is due to the land area covered by vulnerable peats and highly organic soils in Scotland compared with other areas in the UK. It is therefore imperative that soil C stocks for different land use, management practices and LUCs are monitored in more detail to provide further insight into the potential changes in sequestered C and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions, as advised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

AB Context Warmer weather caused by climate change poses increasingly serious threats to the persistence of many species, but animals can modify behavior to mitigate at least some of the threats posed by warmer temperatures. Identifying and characterizing how animals modify behavior to avoid the negative consequences of acute heat will be crucial for understanding how animals will respond to warmer temperatures in the future. Objectives We studied the extent to which moose (Alces alces), a species known to be sensitive to heat, mitigates heat on hot summer days via multiple different behaviors: (1) reduced movement, (2) increased visitation to shade, (3) increased visitation to water, or (4) a combination of these behaviors. Methods We used GPS telemetry and a step-selection function to analyze movement and habitat selection by moose in northeastern Minnesota, USA. Results Moose reduced movement, used areas of the landscape with more shade, and traveled nearer to mixed forests and bogs during periods of heat. Moose used shade far more than water to ameliorate heat, and the most pronounced changes in behavior occurred between 15 and 20 degrees C. Conclusions Research characterizing the behaviors animals use to facilitate thermoregulation will aid conservation of heat-sensitive species in a warming world. The modeling framework presented in this study is a promising method for evaluating the influence of temperature on movement and habitat selection.

AB Understanding temporal variations in soil organic matter (SOM) is important because SOM improves soil, sustains soil productivity, and sequesters carbon. The Tibetan Plateau plays a critical role in climate change at both regional and global scales. Thus, the main objective of this study was to investigate temporal variations in SOM content in Tibetan soils as an important indicator of climate change. SOM content data were obtained from soil surveys conducted in the 1980s and resampled in the 2000s. In this study, SOM content data from the A horizon of the soil profile were compared over time, and a paired t-test was conducted to verify differences between the two datasets. The results reveal that SUM content in the A horizon decreased significantly. To determine the causes of SOM content decreases in the A horizon, soil samples were grouped into ten soil types, four land-use types, and seven physiogeographical units. SUM content in four soil types (felty soils, cambisols in the World Reference Base (WRB) for soil resources; cold calcic soils, cambisols in the WRB; bog soils, gleysols in the WRB; and meadow soils, umbric gleysols/haplic phaeozem in the WRB), pasture, and broad valleys and basins of the south Tibetan zone of montane shrubby steppe decreased significantly in the A horizon. Based on the analysis of some known realities, this change should be attributed to pasture degradation resulting from overgrazing and climate warming. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sedimentary plant waxes and their hydrogen and carbon (delta H-2 and delta C-13) isotopes are important proxies for past hydrologic and vegetation change. However sedimentary waxes accumulate from diverse sources, integrating uncertainties from: (i) variable isotope fractionation among plant species, and (ii) unresolved processes controlling the transport of waxes from plants to sediments. We address these uncertainties by comparing the molecular and isotopic composition of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids in recent bog sediments with all major plant species growing in the catchment of Browns Lake Bog (BLB) in Ohio, USA. There are two distinct plant assemblages at BLB, including a forest dominated by trees and a bog shoreline composed of shrubs, woody groundcover, herbs and graminoids. n-Alkane concentrations in trees were 10-300 times higher than in shoreline plants, while n-alkanoic acid concentrations were generally lower and comparable across all species. The overall range of wax delta H-2 values among individual plants (77 parts per thousand for n-C-29 alkane and 84 parts per thousand for n-C-28 alkanoic acid) was likely driven by interspecies differences in biosynthetic delta H-2 fractionation as well as source water differences between forest and shoreline plants. A considerably smaller range of delta H-2(wax) values in the bog sediments (9 parts per thousand for n-C-29 alkane and 11 parts per thousand for n-C-28 alkanoic acid) suggests that sediments are either biased toward specific plants, or that signal averaging processes during or after deposition are constant. The combined delta H-2 and delta C-13 signatures of plant sources and sediments indicate a sediment bias mainly toward trees, with contributions from woody shrubs and groundcover growing in the bog shoreline. Within trees and woody shrubs, we observed delta H-2(wax)-delta C-13(wax) relationships of opposite sign for n-C-29 alkane and n-C-28 alkanoic acid, which we speculate may reflect contrasting seasonal timing of synthesis and plant metabolic status between compound classes. The net apparent delta H-2 fractionation between precipitation and wax (epsilon(app)) was approximately 30 parts per thousand larger for n-alkanes (-133 parts per thousand) than for n-alkanoic acids (-103 parts per thousand), both at the plant level and in sediments. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of sediments in a hydrologically closed basin to woody plants growing in the associated catchment and can guide epsilon(app) estimates for sedimentary records from similar depositional settings.

AB A ca. 4000a decadal-resolution climate proxy record of the mean grain-size from a lake (or mash) sediment at the southern margin of the Tarim Basin, correlates visually with the atmospheric C-14 record from tree ring (residual Delta(14)C, solar proxy) and the GISP2 ice core delta(18)O record (temperature proxy). In general, Delta(14)C maxima (solar minima) are coincident with cold (wet) periods in the study area and cold periods in the Greenland ice core. Power spectrum analysis revealed statistically significant periodicities of 196a, 121a, 97a, 62a, 45a and 33-30a, which are similar to those principal solar-oscillation periods as inferred from the atmospheric radiocarbon and other proxy records. Possible solar forcing is addressed to be the main driving forcing of climate change in the southern margin of Tarim Basin.

AB Nearly 1000 Norwegian lakes in catchments with low human activity were surveyed. By covering a wide range of nitrogen (N) deposition (0.1-2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) along a latitudinal and climatic gradient, we clearly demonstrate how nitrogen (N) deposition, climate, and a few key catchment properties, notably the terrestrial vegetation density and the fraction of bogs, together serve as major predictors of concentrations and ratios of carbon, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silicate (Si) in downstream lakes. Inorganic N in lakes was positively correlated with N deposition, while organic N was closely associated with allochthonous dissolved organic carbon. The ratio of NO3 to total N as well as NO3 to total P and NO3 to SiO2 were highly variable, and most of this variability was explained by N deposition; terrestrial vegetation density, as inferred from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; temperature; runoff; and the fraction of bogs in the catchment. Climate-induced changes in element concentrations and elemental ratios could profoundly affect the lake metabolism and community composition. By linking these data with downscaled climate change predictions we may also predict future shifts in element export and element ratios in various lakes with reasonable accuracy.

AB Shifts in vegetation phenology are a key example of the biological effects of climate change(1-3). However, there is substantial uncertainty about whether these temperature-driven trends will continue, or whether other factors-for example, photoperiod-will become more important as warming exceeds the bounds of historical variability(4,5). Here we use phenological transition dates derived from digital repeat(5) photography(6) to show that experimental whole-ecosystem warming treatments(7) of up to +9 degrees C linearly correlate with a delayed autumn green-down and advanced spring green-up of the dominant woody species in a boreal Picea-Sphagnum bog. Results were confirmed by direct observation of both vegetative and reproductive phenology of these and other bog plant species, and by multiple years of observations. There was little evidence that the observed responses were constrained by photoperiod. Our results indicate a likely extension of the period of vegetation activity by 1-2 weeks under a 'CO2 stabilization' climate scenario (+2.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C), and 3-6 weeks under a 'high-CO2 emission' scenario (+5.9 +/- 1.1 degrees C), by the end of the twenty-first century. We also observed severe tissue mortality in the warmest enclosures after a severe spring frost event. Failure to cue to photoperiod resulted in precocious green-up and a premature loss of frost hardiness(8), which suggests that vulnerability to spring frost damage will increase in a warmer world(9,10). Vegetation strategies that have evolved to balance tradeoffs associated with phenological temperature tracking may be optimal under historical climates, but these strategies may not be optimized for future climate regimes. These in situ experimental results are of particular importance because boreal forests have both a circumpolar distribution and a key role in the global carbon cycle(11).

AB Fire is one of the main causes of environmental and ecosystem change. Geospatial data, derived from satellite images and surveying observations, are a useful tool in managing land use and land cover changes. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria-based geographical information system (GIS) for fire risk assessment and fire potential mapping in a peat swamp forest at Hua Sai district, Thailand. Fifty-five fire points in peat swamp areas were reported from 2012 to 2016. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and GIS methods were used synergistically to analyze the following contributing factors: elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, distance from river, distance from settlement and land use. The results of the present study indicate that the predicted fire risk areas from the methodology proposed are found to be in agreement with recorded past fire events. The fire risk map produced can be used for planning and management of wildland fire events in the future. GIS multi-criteria-based models have been developed in the context of fire prognosis; however, most of them attribute weights from simple pair-wise comparisons; we showcase that the integration of AHP provides accurate results for this study area in Thailand.

AB Spring phenophases such as the beginning of leaf unfolding, measured in the Irish gardens of the International Phenological Garden (IPG) network, indicate an earlier spring occurrence hence a longer growing season. However, these measurements are limited to selected species of trees at a few point locations in the southern half of the country. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology, based on satellite remote sensing, to measure the vegetation start of season (SOS) across the whole island of Ireland on an annual basis, complementary to existing ground-based methods.
   The SOS metric was extracted for each year in a 7-year time series of 10-day composited, 1.2 km reduced resolution MERIS Global Vegetation Index (MGVI) data from 2003 to 2009, based on curve fitting, using the time series analysis software, TIMESAT. Spatio-temporal variability in the SOS was detected across the island on an annual basis and highlighted in a series of anomaly images showing variation from the 7-year mean SOS. The 2006 SOS was late across the island while there were strong geographical gradients to the SOS anomalies in 2009 when it occurred later in the south and earlier in the north. There was a mix of early and late anomaly values throughout the country in the other years.
   Qualitatively, the spatial patterns in the timing of the SOS were related to the distribution of landcover types as indicated by the CORINE Land Cover map (CLC). Three statistically separable groups of CLC classes were derived from differences in the SOS, namely agricultural and forest land cover types, peat bogs, and natural and semi-natural vegetation types. These groups demonstrated that vegetation in cultivated areas like pastures has a significantly earlier SOS than in areas of unmanaged vegetation such as peat bogs. An initial climate analysis indicated that an anomalously cold winter and spring in 2005/2006 delayed the 2006 SOS countrywide; while a cold winter followed by a mild spring in 2009 caused considerable spatial variability in the 2009 SOS across the country, ranging from later SOS in the south to early SOS in the north.
   This study has demonstrated the utility of 10-day MGVI composites for derivation of an SOS metric which can be used as an indicator of spatial variability in vegetation seasonality and has highlighted how SOS varies according to landcover type. The availability of longer time series in the future will allow more focused studies on the sensitivity of the SOS metric to changes in climate as well as short term weather events.

AB In animals with long generation times, evolution of physiological and morphological traits may not be fast enough to keep up with rapid climate warming, but thermoregulatory behaviour can possibly serve as an important buffer mitigating warming effects. In this study, we investigated if the cold-adapted Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (Vrolik, 1829)) used cool bed sites as a thermoregulatory behaviour in the summer. We recorded habitat variables and ground temperature at 371 bed sites with random "control" sites 10 and 100 m distant. Using case-control logistic regression, we found that reindeer selected bed sites on cool substrates (snow and mire), as well as cold, dry ground on days with warm ambient temperatures, while they avoided such sites on cold days. Selection of both cool substrates and cool ground did not depend on age or sex. The study was conducted in an environment where neither predatory threat nor insect harassment influenced bed site selection. Our findings suggest that the thermal landscape is important for habitat selection of cold-adapted Arctic ungulates in summer. Thus, behavioural strategies may be important to mitigate effects of climate change, at least in the short term.

AB Archaeal populations are abundant in cold and temperate environments, but little is known about their potential response to climate change-induced temperature changes. The effects of temperature on archaeal communities in unamended slurries of weakly acidic peat from Spitsbergen were studied using a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A high relative abundance of active archaeall cells (11-12% of total count) was seen at low temperatures (1 and 5 degrees C), and this community was dominated by Group 1.3b Crenarchaeota and the euryarchaeal clusters rice cluster V (RC-V), and Lake Dagow sediment (LIDS). Increasing temperature reduced the diversity and relative abundance of these clusters. The methanogenic community in the slurries was diverse and included representatives of Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta. The overall relative abundance and diversity of the methanogenic archaea increased with increasing temperature, in accordance with a strong stimulation of methane production rates. However, DGGE profiling showed that the structure of this community changed with temperature and time. While the relative abundance of some populations was affected directly by temperature, the relative abundance of other populations was controlled by indirect effects or did not respond to temperature.

AB A two-step procedure is described for the synthesis of a carbon material with a similar composition and properties as peat. The produced hydrochar is made suitable for agricultural applications by removing plant growing inhibitory substances. Wet household waste such as fruit peel, coffee grounds, inedible vegetable parts, or wet lignocellulosic material in general, are treated in presence of water at 215 degrees C and 21 bar in an autoclave, i.e., by hydrothermal carbonization. All these leftovers have a considerable water content of up to 90 weight % (wt%). Adding water extends the procedure to drier materials such as nutshells or even garden prunings and compostable polymers, i.e., the plastic bag for collection of the leftovers.
   Usually, the resulting carbon material, called hydrochar, produces a negative effect on plant growth when added to soil. It is supposed that this effect is caused by adsorbed phytotoxic compounds. A simple post-treatment under inert atmosphere (absence of oxygen) at 275 degrees C removes these substances. Therefore, the raw hydrochar is placed on a glass frit of a vertical tubular quartz reactor. A nitrogen gas flow is applied in down-flow direction. The tube is heated to the desired temperature by means of a heating mantle for up to one hour.
   The success of the thermal treatment is easily quantified by thermogravimetry (TG), carried out in air. A weight loss is determined when the temperature of 275 degrees C is reached, since volatile content is desorbed. Its amount is reduced in the final material, in comparison to the untreated hydrochar.
   The two-step treatment converts household leftovers, including compostable bags employed for their collection, into a carbon material that may serve as plant growth promoter and, at the same time, as a carbon sink for climate change mitigation.

AB Sporopollen analysis on a 346 cm peat record at Dahu, Jiangxi, chronologically constrained by 16 AMS C-14 datings, provides an opportunity to reconstruct the vegetation evolution stages responding to climate change in South China since the last glacial maximum. The result shows that during 18330-15630 cal a B.P., broad-leaved forest dominated the area, corresponding to mild, cool and fairly humid climate. At the interval of 15630-11600 cal a B.P., several evergreen broad-leaved species appeared within the broad-leaved forest, indicating moderate and humid condition. During early Holocene, broad-leaved evergreen forest community was constructed as Castanopsis/Lithorcarpus principally developed, suggesting a warm and humid scenario until 6000 cal a B. P. Since 6000 cal a B. P., abrupt forest deterioration happened with an contemporary increase of fern and herb communities, representing a turnover to relatively cool and dry condition and as well, possible impact from human activities. Meanwhile, several relatively cool and dry events can be identified in the sporopollen record, they can be correlated to the North Atlantic Heinrich event, YD and Holocene millennial-scale oscillations, implying that the low latitude climate was coupled with high latitude influences. Moreover, the variations of temperature and humidity since LGM at Dahu were much smaller when compared with the records in north monsoonal China.

AB Previous studies have shown that the oxygen isotope ratio (delta(18)O) of plant cellulose can serve as a sensitive proxy indicator of past climate, but its application has mainly been restricted to tree-rings. Here we present a 6000-year high-resolution delta(18)O record of peat plant cellulose from northeastern China. The delta(18)O Variation is interpreted as reflecting changes in regional surface air temperature. The climate events inferred from the isotope data agree well with archaeological and historic evidence. The record shows a striking correspondence of climate events to nearly all of the apparent solar activity changes characterized by the atmospheric radiocarbon in tree-rings over the past 6000 years. Spectral analysis of the delta(18)O record reveals the periodicities of around 86, 93, 101, 110, 127, 132, 140, 155, 207, 245, 311, 590, 820 and 1046 years, which are similar to those detected in the solar excursions. We consider these observations as further evidence for a close relationship between solar activity and climate variations on timescales of decades to centuries. Our results also have implications for distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic contributions to future climate change.

AB Results are presented of an inter-basin comparison of cold-season (October-April/March) river flow characteristics for 17 undisturbed catchments in Siberia for the period 1980-1998. Flow and recession metrics for each basin and mean annual cold-season catchment-averaged drainage depth, Q(cold) (mm), were analyzed with various basin attributes in an attempt to detect potential controls of recession behavior. There is a marked behavioral distinction between basins on non-continuous (n = 6) permafrost coverage (discontinuous/sporadic/isolated) and those on continuous (n = 11) permafrost. The first group is characterized by slow recession, relatively high discharge in April before spring freshet, and high values for Q(cold) up to about 80 mm, which corresponds to more than 10% of total annual rainfall. Although positive correlations with several catchment attributes (annual precipitation regime; peat land fraction) are found, higher abundance of through-taliks and greater active layer depth (ALD) are presumed to be the most likely controls of the distinctive hydrological behavior of catchments containing non-continuous permafrost. Within the group of catchments on continuous permafrost, characteristics of cold-season flow vary conspicuously as some rivers exhibit very fast recession and cessation of flow for 3-4 months, while others show strongly reduced, but continuous discharge throughout the cold season. Our analysis shows that lake area fraction, peatland fraction and morphological metrics may play a role in favoring prolonged cold-season flow in this group. Whether prolonged cold-season flow in areas of continuous permafrost also signals contributions to river flow from intra- and/or sub-permafrost groundwater remains an intriguing but so far unresolved question.

AB This study considers long-term records of the nature of water colour and coincident water quality and quantity in order to test hypotheses about increases in release of dissolved organic carbon from peat soils across the northern hemisphere. The study focuses upon the treatment ratio, e. the ratio of the amount of coagulant dose required to the water colour of the incoming water, and compares this ratio to possible explanatory variables: pH, conductivity, water temperature, river flow and alkalinity. The study shows that:
   (i) The annual average increase in treatment ratio is just less than 6.5% over a six year period.
   (ii) There is a long-term increase in the treatment ratio that is independent of changes in riverflow, pH, conductivity, water temperature and alkalinity and so a real change in DOC composition is occurring.
   (iii) There is a seasonal cycle in treatment ratio that is also independent of the available water and climate variables.
   (iv) The upward trend in treatment ratio is declining with time over the study period.
   The observed trends in DOC composition are consistent with an explanation of increasing DOC concentration and flux based upon changes in flow and temperature but is not consistent with present explanations based upon changes in atmospheric deposition or upon drought unless the effect of the drought are short-lived (1-2 years).

AB Surface water inundation in the Arctic-Boreal region is dynamic and strongly influences land-atmosphere water, energy and carbon (CO2, CH4) fluxes, and potential feedbacks to climate change. Here we report on recent (2003-2010) surface inundation patterns across the Arctic-Boreal region (>= 50 degrees N) and within major permafrost (PF) zones detected using satellite passive microwave remote sensing retrievals of daily fractional open water (Fw) cover from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E). The AMSR-E Fw (25-km resolution) maps reflect strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water variability and compare favorably (0.71 <= R-2 <= 0.84) with alternative, static Fw maps derived from finer scale (30-m to 250-m resolution) Landsat, MODIS and SRTM radar (MOD44W) data. The AMSR-E retrievals show dynamic seasonal and annual variability in surface inundation that is unresolved in the static Fw maps. The AMSR-E Fw record also corresponds strongly (0.71 <= R <= 0.87) with regional wet/dry cycles inferred from basin discharge records. An AMSR-E algorithm sensitivity analysis shows a conservative estimate of Fw retrieval uncertainty (RMSE) within +/- 4.1% for effective resolution of regional inundation patterns and seasonal to annual variability. A regional trend analysis of the 8-year AMSR-E record shows no significant Arctic-Boreal region wide Fw trend for the period, and instead reveals contrasting inundation changes within different PF zones. Widespread Fw wetting is detected within continuous (92% of grid cells with significant trend; p<0.1) and discontinuous (82%) PF zones, while sporadic/isolated PF areas show widespread (71%) Fw drying trends. These results are consistent with previous studies showing evidence of contrasting regional inundation patterns linked to PF degradation and associated changes to surface hydrology under recent climate warming.

AB Changes in permafrost distribution in the southern discontinuous zone were evaluated by repeating a 1964 survey through part of the Alaska Highway corridor (56 degrees N-61 degrees N) in northwest Canada. A total of 55 sites from the original survey in northern British Columbia and southern Yukon were located using archival maps and photographs. Probing for frozen ground, manual excavations, air and ground temperature monitoring, borehole drilling and geophysical techniques were used to gather information on present-day permafrost and climatic conditions. Mean annual air temperatures have increased by 1.5-2.0 degrees C since the mid-1970s and significant degradation of permafrost has occurred. Almost half of the permafrost sites along the entire transect which exhibited permafrost in 1964 do so no longer. This change is especially evident in the south where two-thirds of the formerly permafrost sites have thawed and the limit of permafrost appears to have shifted northward. The permafrost that persists is patchy, generally less than 15 m thick, has mean annual surface temperatures >0 degrees C, mean ground temperatures between 0.5 and 0 degrees C, is in peat or beneath a thick organic mat, and appears to have a thicker active layer than in 1964. Its persistence may relate to the latent heat requirements of thawing permafrost or to the large thermal offset of organic soils. The study demonstrates that degradation of permafrost has occurred in the margins of its distribution in the last few decades, a trend that is expected to continue as the climate warms.

AB Water plays a key role in the functioning of wetlands and a shortage or contamination of it leads to changes in habitat conditions and degradation of ecosystems. This article scrutinizes the impact of climate change on the hydrological characteristics of floods (maximum flow, duration, volume) in the River Biebrza wetlands (North-East Poland). We analysed the trends in duration and volume of flood and maximum discharges in the historical period 1970-2000 and predicted these for the future periods 2020-2050 and 2070-2100, respectively. Next we assessed the impact on the wetland ecosystems. The basis of our assessments consists of statistical analyses of hydrographs and calculations by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model and considering nine bias-corrected climate models. The results indicate that both volume and duration of winter floods will keep increasing continuously under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The reduction in peak annual floods is expected to decline slightly in both scenarios. On the other hand, the analysis of trends in mean and standard deviation revealed negligible tendencies in the datasets for summer and winter hydrological seasons within the three time frames analysed (1970-2000; 2020-2050; 2070-2100). We foresee several future implications for the floodplain ecosystems. Shifts in transversal ecosystem zonation parallel to the river will likely take place with more highly productive flood tolerant vegetation types. Nutrient availability and algal blooms during spring inundations will likely increase. Slowdown of organic matter turnover later in summer will lead to a higher peat accumulation rate. Logistical problems with summer mowing and removal of bushes in winter may enhance shrub encroachment.

AB An integrated pollen-analytical and geochemical study is presented from Qinngua Kangilleq, southwest Greenland. This site was formerly one of the largest farms in the Eastern Settlement of Norse Greenland. The study is the first to determine what link, if any, exists between Norse landnam (early settlement), vegetation change, soil erosion, climate change and peat geochemistry. The data suggest that fluxes in lithogenic elements supplied to a peat column by terrestrial sources and atmospheric deposition were coupled to the pattern of local Norse settlement beginning similar to cal. AD 1020. A severe phase of soil erosion is indicated which is coincident with the landnam horizon. This may represent proxy evidence for the stripping of turf for the construction of turf-and-stone buildings at the farm. Radiocarbon dates suggest the presence of a hiatus in the sediment column spanning similar to cal. AD 1380-1950. Following the recommencement of sediment accumulation, the geochemical data indicate a critical change in site conditions which may be consistent with the well-known change in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that started between c. AD 1400 and 1420. Bromine (Br) and chlorine (Cl) concentrations are demonstrably higher in the sediments dating to the 20th century relative to the pre-15th century deposits. Rising halogen concentrations at Qinngua appear to be correlated with increased levels of Na+ (sea salt sodium) precipitation in the GISP2 ice core which earlier studies have interpreted as indicative of increased North Atlantic storminess.

AB Pollen samples from peat sediments on the south bank of the Heilongjiang River in northern Northeast China (NE China) were analyzed to reconstruct the historical response of vegetation to climate change since 7800 cal yr BP. Vegetation was found to have experienced five successions from cold-temperate mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest to forest-steppe, steppe-woodland, steppe, and finally meadow-woodland. From 7800 to 7300 cal yr BP, the study area was warmer than present, and Betula, Larix, and Picea-dominated mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests thrived. Two cooling events at 7300 cal yr BP and 4500 cal yr BP led to a decrease in Betula and other broadleaved forests, whereas herbs of Poaceae expanded, leading to forest-steppe and then steppe-woodland environments. After 2500 cal yr BP, reduced temperatures and a decrease in evaporation rates are likely to have resulted in permafrost expansion and surface ponding, with meadow and isolated coniferous forests developing a resistance to the cold-wet environment. The Holocene warm period in NE China (7800-7300 cal yr BP) could have resulted in a strengthening of precipitation in northernmost NE China and encouraged the development of broadleaved forests.

AB Hydrological cycle changes that occur due to a changing environment is a hot topic in the field of hydrological science. It is of great practical significance to study the response mechanism of hydrological process change for future water resources planning and management. In this study, the effects of climate and watershed characteristic change on the streamflow in a typical tributary of the Yellow River (the Fen River watershed) are studied based on the Budyko hypothesis. The results show that: the sensitivity coefficients of streamflow to precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and the watershed characteristic coefficient were 0.1809, -0.0551, and -27.0882, respectively. This meant that a 1 mm decrease in the precipitation would induce a 0.1809 mm decrease in the streamflow. Additionally, a 1 mm decrease in the potential evapotranspiration would induce a 0.0551 mm increase in the streamflow, and an increase of 1 in the watershed characteristic coefficient would induce a 27.0882 mm decrease in the streamflow. The streamflow of the Fen River watershed showed a significant decreasing trend during the reference period (1951-1977). In addition, the streamflow of the change period (1978-2010) decreased 26.87 mm; and this was primarily caused by watershed characteristic change which accounted for 92.27%, while climate change only accounted for 6.50%.

AB Evaluating the response of soil organic matter decomposition to warming and changes in rainfall is critical to assess the likelihood of proposed positive feedbacks from the terrestrial to the atmospheric system. The response of soil respiration and extracellular activities (EEAs) to long-term warming and recurrent summer drought was studied in a wet shrubland ecosystem in Wales (UK), after 13 years of climate change simulation in a whole-ecosystem experiment. Over a year soil respiration, temperature and moisture was monitored in the field. During the summer season, coinciding with maximum soil respiration rates, soil inorganic N and P, microbial biomass and the extracellular activities (EEAs) of a selection of enzymes involved in C, N and P cycling were analysed. Based on previous field measurements of C and N mineralization, we expected a stronger response of C-cycling EEAs, in comparison to N-cycling EEAs, to drought and warming, and a greater sensitivity of C-cycling EEAs to drought than to warming. Drought had a clear impact on soil respiration during the summer season. However, the availability of inorganic N or P was not significantly affected by the treatments. Microbial biomass and C: N ratio also remained unchanged. In contrast to one of our hypothesis, C-cycling EEAs measured under non-optimal conditions that simulated soil environment in the field (pH of 4.1 and with a temperature incubation of 10 degrees C) showed no significant differences due to long-term warming and recurring drought treatments. Possibly, this assay approach may have obscured treatment effects on the soil enzyme pool. Our results highlight the need for developing methods for the in-situ analysis of EEAs to determine rates of reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In contrast to the situation in plants inhabiting most of the world's ecosystems, mycorrhizal fungi are usually absent from roots of the only two native vascular plant species of maritime Antarctica, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous d-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.

AB A large reservoir of organic carbon is stored in the permafrost region. Therefore, understanding the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from rivers in the permafrost zone is important in the context of climate change. This study investigated the dynamics of DOC export from the wetlands of the Kandu River catchment located in a cold temperate region in northeast China during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012. Our findings indicated that subsurface flow was the primary runoff pathway that transports DOC from wetland soil to stream discharge. The organic-mineral soil structure resulted in substantial differences in water sources, as well as in DOC resources, between the flood and base flow volume during the growing seasons. The active layer depth is key, as it affects runoff generation and the DOC concentration and chemical characteristics of stream discharge. The DOC flux from our study area was estimated to be up to 1039.66 t during the growing season, which represents more than one third of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in wetlands. Given the expected increase in air temperature and precipitation, our results indicate that there will be an increase in the total DOC flux for the study region in the future as a result of increased DOC concentration.

AB Appropriate management of contemporary environments requires knowledge of their long-term history. We use palaeoecological data to explore how contemporary forest-steppe environments have been shaped by climate change and human impacts through the Holocene using the western Mid-Russian Upland as a case-study. Our paper presents new reconstructions of Mid- and Late Holocene climate, vegetation dynamics and local environmental change based on pollen, plant macrofossil and testate amoeba records from a site at Selikhovo (Mid-Russian Upland, Russia). Eutrophic fen vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis developed around 6800 cal year BP and has been resilient to episodes of local burning and variable input of mineral material through the Holocene. New and previously-published data show that the boundary between broadleaf forest and steppe occupied a similar position to present during the period 7000-4800 cal year BP, despite a warmer and drier climate, but shifted to the south following climate cooling and an increase in precipitation from 4800-2500 cal year BP. A subsequent decline in woodland cover was caused by both climate change and human impacts, with human activity becoming increasingly significant over the last two millennia. Prior to major human disturbance (about 1700 cal year BP) the landscape was dominated by mixed broadleaf-pine forests with some spruce covering about 60 % of the study area. Our results emphasize the variability of steppe-forest habitats over long time periods and the need to consider human impacts and climate change when setting targets for habitat conservation.

AB Open-top chamber (OTC) climate change simulation was used to predict the potential effects of climate change on biogeochemistry, including: 1) soil decomposition of three litter types (trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Miller) BSP), and Sphagnum); 2) soil nutrient supply rates, and; 3) soil acidity. We assessed the effects of OTCs on these biogeochemical factors in the presence or absence of Sphagnum moss substrate at post-fire and logging sites, in the transitional mixedwood-boreal zone of northwestern Quebec. Higher air temperatures and cooler, drier soils created by the OTC treatment resulted in lower decomposition rates and a higher C:N ratio of aspen litter, and lower Ca concentrations of the Sphagnum litter after 14 months of incubation, as well as lower K concentrations of spruce litter after 24 month incubation. There were no effects of the OTC treatment on decomposition rates for Sphagnum and spruce litter. The nutrient supply rates of Ca and Mg were consistently lower in the OTCs. The supply rates of N were significantly higher in the control plots at the logging site than at any other combination of the OTC treatment and disturbance site. Soil pH was lower in the OTCs by the end of the growing seasons in 2006 and 2007. The results suggest that the impact of climatic changes, as simulated by the OTC treatment, on the soil system of mixedwood-boreal post-disturbance sites is likely to affect biogeochemical processes such as nutrient supply rates and the soil pH, but the effects on decomposition may be minimal.

AB The Hindu-Kush Himalaya region extends over 4 million km(2) across the eight countries. Knowingly, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is considered the principal altitudinal permafrost constituent on earth and is deemed as the third 'pole'. Among which, the Zoige wetlands are located in the northeastern boundary of QTP, wrapping a total area of 6180 km(2) with an average altitude of 3500 m. This entire region is the hotspot for methane emission since the last decade. Given the importance of methane emission, many studies have focused on the effect of environmental fluctuations on the overall methane profile and, more recently on the methanogenic community structure. The current review summarizes recent advancements of the methanogenic community and methane profile and outlines a framework for better understanding of the microbial ecology of the Zoige wetlands, China. Moreover, as microorganisms are indispensable to biogeochemical cycles, especially for methane, they are believed to be the best indicators to identify the condition of wetlands. Hence, we suggest that, underpinning the microbial profile could help understand the status of a wetland. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A radiocarbon approach was used to investigate the roles of temperature and soil fauna activity in the turnover of 'old' non-labile carbon in a peatland ecosystem. We investigated the impacts of enchytraeids on carbon turnover in two different soil layers, with different incorporation of the 'bomb' peak, when incubated at two different temperatures. Results showed that, in agreement with previous studies, warmer temperatures promoted reproduction rates of enchytraeids, with the top layer supporting higher animal densities and biomass. With independence of the animal treatment, soil respiration in the top 5 cm was four times higher than in the deeper layer suggesting that decomposition was greater in the upper layer, with the response being greater at the highest temperature treatment. Furthermore, independent of temperature, the presence of enchytraeids in the top layer significantly enhanced the release of non-labile C as DOC. Similarly, at the bottom layer, 'older' C sources were mobilised in response to warming and a greater amount of pre-bomb carbon was released into the soil solution at 20 degrees C when the worms were present. A strong positive link between the ages of the C assimilated by the animals and released through mineralization suggests an important role of soil biology in the mobilisation of the older C pools in soils and should be taken into account in developing global C models to predict the response of soil C dynamics to climate change.

   SLOPE
AB Many of the physical and biological processes that characterize arctic ecosystems are unique to high latitudes, and their sensitivities to climate change are poorly understood. Stratigraphic records of land-surface processes and vegetation change in the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska reveal how tundra landscapes responded to climatic changes between 13,000 and 8000 C-14 yr BP. Peat deposition began and shrub vegetation became widespread ca. 12,500 C-14 yr BP, probably in response to the advent of warmer and wetter climate. Increased slope erosion caused rapid alluviation in valleys, and Populus trees spread northward along braided floodplains before 11,000 C-14 yr BP. Lake levels fell and streams incised their floodplains during the Younger Dryas (YD) (11,000-10,000 C-14 yr BP). A hiatus in records of Populus suggest that its geographic range contracted, and pollen records of other species suggest a cooler and drier climate during this interval. Basal peats dating to the YD are rare, suggesting that rates of paludification slowed. Immediately after 10,000 C-14 yr BP, lake levels rose, streams aggraded rapidly again, intense solifluction occurred, and Populus re-invaded the area. Moist acidic tundra vegetation was widespread by 8500 C-14 yr BP along with wet, organic-rich soils. Most of these landscape-scale effects of climatic change involved changes in moisture. Although low temperature is the most conspicuous feature of arctic climate, shifts in effective moisture may be the proximate cause for many of the impacts that climate change has in arctic regions.

AB Climate change and human activities interact to affect the vegetation landscape. We examined the interaction of these drivers using multiproxy records, including data on pollen, charcoal, phytoliths, total nitrogen, total organic carbon, and loss-on-ignition, from a 268-cm sediment profile in Xinjiang, China. By combining these data with information gained from 214 samples of surface pollen assemblages in north Xinjiang, we were able to reconstruct the late Holocene climate using a weighted averaging partial least squares regression model. Our results suggested that the typical desert vegetation of the region changed to Artemisia desert at 2400 cal. a BP, and returned to desert after 900 cal. a BP. A warm-dry and cold-humid climate pattern existed during the past 4000years. The climate was characterized by obvious fluctuation prior to 2400 cal. a BP, after which it became wetter and colder with little fluctuation. The temperature maximum in our reconstruction occurred around 700 cal. a BP. The macrocharcoal particles reached their highest levels at c. 3500 cal. a BP, and again at 700 cal. a BP, suggesting increases in human activities at these times. An increased amount of anthropogenic plant pollen also appeared in sediment over the past 50years. Large numbers of Thelypteris spores and Phragmites phytoliths in the surface pollen samples from modern desert vegetation also reflect recent human activities. Therefore, our data provide evidence that both climate and human activities are important drivers of changes in regional vegetation.

AB Mine reclamation in the Athabasca oil sands region Canada, is required by law where companies must reconstruct disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and lakes that existed in the Boreal landscape prior to mining. Winter is a major hydrological factor in this region as snow covers the landscape for 5-6 months and is similar to 25% of the annual precipitation, yet few studies have explored the influence of winter processes on the hydrology of constructed watersheds. One year (2017-2018) of intensive snow hydrology measurements are supplemented with 6 years (2013-2018) of meteorological measurements from the constructed Sandhill Fen watershed to: (a) understand snow accumulation and redistribution, snowmelt timing, rate, and partitioning, (b) apply a physically based model for simulating winter processes on hillslopes, and (c) evaluate the impact of soil prescriptions and climate change projections on winter processes in reclaimed systems. The 2017-2018 snow season was between November and April and snow water equivalent (SWE) ranged between 40 and 140 mm. Snow distribution was primarily influenced by topography with little influence of snow trapping from developing vegetation. Snow accumulation was most variable on hillslopes and redistribution was driven by slope position, with SWE greatest at the base of slopes and decreased toward crests. Snowmelt on hillslopes was controlled by slope aspect, as snow declined rapidly on west and south-facing slopes, compared with east and north-facing slopes. Unlike results previously reported on constructed uplands, snowmelt runoff from uplands was much less (similar to 30%), highlighting the influence of different construction materials. Model simulations indicate that antecedent soil moisture and soil temperature have a large influence on partitioning snowmelt over a range of observed conditions. Under a warmer and wetter climate, average annual peak SWE, and snow season duration could decline up to 52% and up to 61 days, respectively, while snowmelt runoff ceases completely under the warmest scenarios. Results suggest considerable future variability in snowmelt runoff from hillslopes, yet soil properties can be used to enhance vertical or lateral flows.

AB We present a high-resolution (sub-decadal to centennial), multi-proxy reconstruction of aeolian input and changes in palaeohydrological conditions based on a 13000 Yr record from Neor Lake's peripheral peat in NW Iran. Variations in relative abundances of refractory (Al, Zr, Ti, and Si), redox sensitive (Fe) and mobile (K and Rb) elements, total organic carbon (TOC), delta C-13(TOC), compound-specific leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (delta D), carbon accumulation rates and dust fluxes presented here fill a large gap in the existing terrestrial paleoclimate records from the interior of West Asia. Our results suggest that a transition occurred from dry and dusty conditions during the Younger Dryas (YD) to a relatively wetter period with higher carbon accumulation rates and low aeolian input during the early Holocene (9000-6000 Yr BP). This period was followed by relatively drier and dustier conditions during middle to late Holocene, which is consistent with orbital changes in insolation that affected much of the northern hemisphere. Numerous episodes of high aeolian input spanning a few decades to millennia are prevalent during the middle to late Holocene. Wavelet analysis of variations in Ti abundances as a proxy for aeolian input revealed notable periodicities at 230, 320, and 470 years with significant periodicities centered around 820, 1550, and 3110 years over the last 13000 years. Comparison with palaeoclimate archives from West Asia, the North Atlantic and African lakes point to a teleconnection between North Atlantic climate and the interior of West Asia during the last glacial termination and the Holocene epoch.
   We further assess the potential role of abrupt climate change on early human societies by comparing our record of palaeoclimate variability with historical, geological and archaeological archives from this region. The terrestrial record from this study confirms previous evidence from marine sediments of the Arabian Sea that suggested climate change influenced the termination of the Akkadian empire. In addition, nearly all observed episodes of enhanced dust deposition during the middle to late Holocene coincided with times of drought, famine, and power transitions across the Iranian Plateau, Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean region. These findings indicate that while socio-economic factors are traditionally considered to shape ancient human societies in this region, the influence of abrupt climate change should not be underestimated.

   FOREST; MODEL; SPRUCE; SOIL; DEFORESTATION
AB The intuitive and logical answer to the question of how the tundra-taiga interface will react to global warming is that it should move north and this is mirrored by many models of potential treeline migration. Northward movement may be the eventual outcome if climatic warming persists over centuries or millennia. However, closer examination of the tundra-taiga interface across its circumpolar extent reveals a more complex situation. The regional climatic history of the tundra-taiga interface is highly varied, and consequently it is to be expected that the forest tundra boundary zone will respond differently to climate change depending on local variations in climate, evolutionary history, soil development, and hydrology. Investigations reveal considerable stability at present in the position of the treeline and while there may be a long-term advance northwards there are oceanic regions where climatic warming may result in a retreat southwards due to increased bog development. Reinforcing this trend is an increasing human impact, particularly in the forest tundra of Russia, which forces the limit of the forested areas southwards. Local variations will therefore require continued observation and research, as they will be of considerable importance economically as well as for ecology and conservation.

AB Magellanic Sub-Antarctic streams run through steep, low-altitude mountainous gradients characterized by a topography that supports a mosaic of evergreen, mixed, and deciduous forests, peat lands, and scrublands. Here, the macroinvertebrate fauna and their ecological interactions are poorly known. This study linked the distribution, community composition, and functional feeding structure of benthic macroinvertebrates with physicochemical and thermal patterns along the altitudinal gradient of a Magellanic Sub-Antarctic watershed. Invertebrates were collected during the austral summers of 2008, 2009, and 2010 at five different altitudes. Our results indicate that benthic macroinvertebrate community distributions are predominantly affected by temperature and certain species show distribution restrictions through the altitudinal gradient studied. Temperature profiles indicate that this Sub-Antarctic watershed is characterized by a sharp thermal gradient, in which cumulative degree-days (A degrees C) per year sharply increase through a relatively short altitudinal gradient (0-600 m above sea level). With the results from this study, we can now study thermal tolerances of altitude-restricted species or project changes in their distributions and voltinism patterns according to climate change scenarios. Ecosystems at higher latitudes and altitudes are experiencing some of the fastest rates of warming on the planet, and Magellanic Sub-Antarctic watersheds could be considered as "sentinel systems," providing early warning of wider scale change.

AB Understanding how archaeal communities are affected by water-table drawdown is essential for predicting soil functional responses to future climate change and the consequences of the responses on the soil carbon cycle.
   We investigated the effect of water-table drawdown, warming, drought, and combinations thereof on archaeal communities using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and quantitative PCR.
   Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured Rice Cluster II (RC-II), and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected. Water-table drawdown and drought exhibited significant effects on the archaeal communities. When the water table was at or above 10 cm, the archaeal abundance at 10 cm remained high (approximately 10(9) cells per gram dry soil), whereas the archaeal abundance at 10 cm was reduced to approximately 10(8) cells per gram dry soil where the water table was lowered to 20 cm or below. When the water table kept constant, warming caused a significant reduction in the archaeal abundance, whereas drought only caused a decrease in archaeal abundance when the water table was higher than -20 cm.
   Results suggest that changes in water table may directly impact archaeal community abundance and assemblage which can in turn influence methane emissions, potentially on a large scale. Our results also indicate that archaeal communities response to water-table drawdowns that are dependent on the initial ecohydrology.

AB Insects are particularly vulnerable to rapid environmental changes, which are disproportionally affecting high latitudes. Increased temperature could influence insect species differentially and reshape assemblages over time. We quantified temporal assemblage turnover of Arctic Diptera (flies) in the Muscidae, one of the most diverse and abundant families of Arctic insects, using time series data from Zackenberg, north-east Greenland. We measured temporal patterns of abundance, diversity, and composition of muscid assemblages in wet fen, mesic and arid heath habitats from yearly collections spanning 1996-2014 and tested their relationship to climate. A total of 18 385 individuals representing 16 species of muscid flies were identified. A significant decrease of 80% of total muscid abundance was observed during the study period. Species richness declined in each habitat type but this trend was not significant across habitats. The number of common and abundant species also decreased significantly over time across habitats revealing a temporal modification of species evenness. Significant temporal changes in composition observed in the wet fen and across habitats were mainly driven by a change in relative abundance of certain species rather than by species replacement. Shift in composition in each habitat and decline in muscid abundance across habitats were associated with summer temperature, which has significantly increased over the study period. However, relationships between temperature and muscid abundance at the species level were noticeable for a few species only. Significant directional change in composition was documented in the wet fen but no biotic homogenization across habitats was observed. As one of the few studies of species-level changes in abundance, diversity and composition of an insect taxon in the Arctic over the past two decades, our study shows that habitat types may modulate insect species responses to recent climate change and that contrasting species responses can alter species assemblages within a few decades.

AB Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in permafrost terrain and the production of greenhouse gases is a key factor for understanding climate change-carbon feedbacks. Previous studies have shown that SOM decomposition is mostly controlled by soil temperature, soil moisture, and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N). However, focus has generally been on site-specific processes and little is known about variations in the controls on SOM decomposition across Arctic sites. For assessing SOM decomposition, we retrieved 241 samples from 101 soil profiles across three contrasting Arctic regions and incubated them in the laboratory under aerobic conditions. We assessed soil carbon losses (C-loss) five times during a 1year incubation. The incubated material consisted of near-surface active layer (AL(NS)), subsurface active layer (AL(SS)), peat, and permafrost samples. Samples were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, water content, C-13, N-15, and dry bulk density (DBD). While no significant differences were observed between total AL(SS) and permafrost C-loss over 1year incubation (2.32.4% and 2.51.5% C-loss, respectively), AL(NS) samples showed higher C-loss (7.94.2%). DBD was the best explanatory parameter for active layer C-loss across sites. Additionally, results of permafrost samples show that C:N ratio can be used to characterize initial C-loss between sites. This data set on the influence of abiotic parameter on microbial SOM decomposition can improve model simulations of Arctic soil CO2 production by providing representative mean values of CO2 production rates and identifying standard parameters or proxies for upscaling potential CO2 production from site to regional scales.

AB Wetland methane (CH4) emissions are the largest natural source in the global CH4 budget, contributing to roughly one third of total natural and anthropogenic emissions. As the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere after CO2, CH4 is strongly associated with climate feedbacks. However, due to the paucity of data, wetland CH4 feedbacks were not fully assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The degree to which future expansion of wetlands and CH4 emissions will evolve and consequently drive climate feedbacks is thus a question of major concern. Here we present an ensemble estimate of wetland CH4 emissions driven by 38 general circulation models for the 21st century. We find that climate change-induced increases in boreal wetland extent and temperature-driven increases in tropical CH4 emissions will dominate anthropogenic CH4 emissions by 38 to 56% toward the end of the 21st century under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6). Depending on scenarios, wetland CH4 feedbacks translate to an increase in additional global mean radiative forcing of 0.04W.m(-2) to 0.19W.m(-2) by the end of the 21st century. Under the "worst-case" RCP8.5 scenario, with no climate mitigation, boreal CH4 emissions are enhanced by 18.05 Tg to 41.69 Tg, due to thawing of inundated areas during the cold season (December to May) and rising temperature, while tropical CH4 emissions accelerate with a total increment of 48.36 Tg to 87.37 Tg by 2099. Our results suggest that climate mitigation policies must consider mitigation of wetland CH4 feedbacks to maintain average global warming below 2 degrees C.

AB In this study we investigate pollen and oxygen isotopes of moss cellulose from the peat bog 'Durres Maar' in the Eifel low mountain range, Germany (450 m a.s.l.) to quantitatively infer mid-Holocene climate change for the period between similar to 7000 and 3800 cal. BP. Pollen was analysed on the same samples from which Sphagnum leaves were isolated to extract cellulose for the determination of its oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18(Sphagnum)). To quantitatively estimate January and July temperature and annual precipitation from the pollen data, we applied a probabilistic indicator taxa method ('pdf-method'). The pollen-based reconstructions indicate July temperatures similar to 1 degrees C higher around 6000 cal. BP than after similar to 5500 cal. BP, which is consistent with a similar to 1% decrease in delta O-18(Sphagnum) during the same period. While the pollen-based climate reconstructions indicate little variability in summer temperature after similar to 5500 cal. BP, winter temperature shows several pronounced cold excursions of similar to 2-4 degrees C in this period, which was likely accompanied by changes in precipitation patterns. Test reconstructions leaving out specific taxa indicate that not only larger climate trends, but also relatively small-scale climate variability can robustly be reconstructed with the pdf-method. This is of particular importance for reliable reconstructions of climate variability not only during the Holocene, but also in former interglacials, for which archives are rare and pollen is often the only suitable proxy in terrestrial records. The stable isotope values agree with the reconstructions based on pollen for the time between similar to 4500 and 3500 cal. BP, but not for the period before 4500 cal. BP. We explain this difference by atmospheric circulation patterns being different in the mid and late Holocene, respectively.

AB Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are recognized as biodiversity hotspots, being, apart many negative human impacts, highly threatened also by ongoing climate warming. Clitellata (Annelida) are dominant invertebrates of permanent fauna in spring habitats, representing a heterogeneous group including both specialized cold-stenothermic and ubiquitous eurythermic species. Therefore, they seem to be a good model group to compare the effects of local springwater temperature (recorded in situ by data loggers) and mesoclimate (i.e., local) air temperature. By the analysis of clitellate assemblages at 41 isolated Western Carpathian spring fens, we found that their species composition was significantly driven by mesoclimate air temperature and springwater temperature independently of other important environmental variables (i.e., water mineralization, oxygen content, and total organic carbon). The effect of various environment-related and temperature-related variables on the number of clitellate species was analyzed separately for two categories, that is, substrate dwellers (endobenthic species) and surface-active (epibenthic) species. The decrease of the number of species with the increasing amount of inorganic particles <500 mu m in substrate was observed in the substrate dwellers. Mesoclimate air temperature had no significant effect on the number of species of substrate dwellers. However, water temperature, specifically its daily fluctuation, turned out to have a strong effect. Only the sites with no or moderate fluctuation were inhabited by cold-stenotherm spring specialists and cold-water species. In contrast, no significant response to any temperature parameter was found for the number of surface-active species, which was driven only by other environmental variables. Our results suggest that climatically induced increase in temperature fluctuation of spring waters can result in notable reduction of cold-adapted clitellate species (mainly the family Lumbriculidae) at the expense of eurythermic species. Such a scenario predicts compositional changes leading to clitellate assemblages with a dominance of generalist and semi-aquatic species.

AB Two long records of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in river water were examined by a detailed time series analysis in order to shed light on the mechanisms generating observed increases in DOC concentrations across the UK. The records date back as far as 1962 and come from catchments 589 and 818 km(2) in area. The DOC records were compared with others taken simultaneously for flow, pH, alkalinity, air temperature and rainfall, and in one of the catchments also for turbidity and conductivity. All records were examined by the seasonal Kendall test; frequency distributions of daily DOC measurements were examined; annual cycles were calculated, Autoregressive and impulse functions were derived for DOC against flow records. The time series analysis shows that: (i) DOC trends cannot be readily explained by trends in flow, pH, alkalinity, turbidity or conductivity; (ii) there is a significant increase in carbon flux from these catchments; (iii) maximum and minimum components of the annual distribution of daily readings both show increases in DOC, implying that DOC flux is increasing for differing hydrological pathways; (iv) increases in DOC concentrations coincide with increases in temperature, though the biggest increases in temperature are in the winter months when such increases might be expected to have less effect on DOC production; (v) change in trend, and therefore flux, was observed to occur after a severe drought in 1976. The study suggests that there are real, significant increases in carbon loss from upland peat catchments and that climate is a major driver, especially a severe drought. Severe drought triggering changes in the DOC flux might be attributed to enzymic latch mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Changes in atmospheric deposition have been proposed as one possible explanation of the widespread increase in DOC concentration observed in many Northern Hemisphere catchments. This study uses detailed, long-term, monthly monitoring records of pH, conductivity SO(4), and DOC in precipitation, soil water, and runoff chemistry from an upland peat-covered catchment in northern England. By deriving impulse transfer functions this study explores whether changes in deposition lead to significant changes in the occurrence of each component in the soil and runoff water; especially significant changes in DOC. The study shows that (1) impulses in the deposition of acidity have no significant effect upon pH or DOC in soil water or runoff. (2) DOC in soil water and runoff is responsive to impulses in SO(4) and conductivity, but only when those impulses are changes in soil water chemistry and not when they are in atmospheric deposition. (3) The effects of changes in SO(4) and/or conductivity can easily be overemphasized if memory effects are not accounted for, and their effect is limited to only 1 or 2 months after a severe drought. This study can support the view that changes in ionic strength can result in changes in DOC concentration in soil water or runoff, but the system studied is unresponsive to changes in atmospheric deposition. Impulses in soil water SO(4) do not lead to increases in DOC concentrations, and so this mechanism does not provide an explanation for DOC increases.

AB Aim Scale dependence of patterns and processes remains one of the major unresolved problems in ecology. The responses of ecosystems to environmental stressors are reported to be strongly scale dependent, but projections of the effects of climate change on species' distributions are still restricted to particular scales and knowledge about scale dependence is lacking. Here we propose that the scale dependence of those species' niche dimensions related to climate change is strongly related to the strength of climatic cross-scale links. More specifically, we hypothesize that the strong cross-scale links between micro-and macroclimatic conditions are related to high cross-scale similarity (low scale dependence) of species' realized temperature niches and, thus, species' spatial distributions.
   Location This study covers seven orders of magnitude of spatial scale, ranging from local-scale (below a metre) and regional-scale (kilometre) investigations in central European wetland ecosystems to continental-scale (thousands of kilometres) studies of species' distributions.
   Methods We combined data on the spatial occurrence of species (vegetation records at local and regional scales, digitized distribution maps at the continental scale) with information about the corresponding temperature regime of vascular plant species occurring in environmentally stable wetland ecosystems characterized by strong cross-scale links between micro-and macroclimatic conditions.
   Results We observed high cross-scale similarity of the characteristics of species temperature niches across seven orders of magnitude of spatial scale. However, the importance of temperature as an abiotic driver decreased nonlinearly with decreasing scale, suggesting greater importance of additional (biotic) drivers of species' occurrence at small spatial scales.
   Main conclusions We report high cross-scale similarity of realized temperature niches for species inhabiting ecosystems where small-scale environmental noise is low and cross-scale links between micro-and macroclimatic conditions are strong. By highlighting a strong relationship between abiotic and biotic cross-scale similarity, our results will help to improve niche-based species distribution modelling, one of the major assessment tools for determining the ecological effects of climate change.

AB When considering past human-environment relationships in Ireland, we rarely contemplate the potentially detrimental effects of drought on populations. The summer of 2018 drew attention, however, to some of the ways in which reduced precipitation can impact on societies, even in an oceanic setting such as Ireland. Here, we examine ways in which we can identify the past occurrence of droughts through palaeoenvironmental records. We focus on three time intervals (c. 6200 BC, 3200 BC and 900 BC) for which there is evidence for centennial-scale droughts-drought phases-and consider the available archaeological and palynological records to evaluate whether the droughts may have triggered economic responses or population collapses. We find little evidence to confirm that any of these events undermined the subsistence base to the extent of triggering population collapse. We briefly explore alternative mechanisms by which the drought phases might have impacted upon human perception of their environment.

AB Respiration rate of soils manured by seabirds and seals on sub-Antarctic Marion Island (47degreesS, 38degrees'E) is considerably higher than that of unmanured soils, and the main objective of this study was to determine whether this is caused by an enhanced supply of inorganic nutrients (N and P) or organic C substrates, or both. The effect of soil moisture content was also investigated. Soils from five habitats were studied: Mesic fellfield, Dry mire, Closed fernbrake, Coastal herbfield and Cotula herbfield. The latter two are strongly influenced by manuring. Respiration rate increased with soil moisture content up to full water holding capacity, and the response of respiration to moisture increased strongly with temperature (especially above 10degreesC). Respiration Q(10) increased with soil moisture content. Glucose addition markedly stimulated soil respiration rate in all the soils, despite the fact that they all possessed substantial concentrations of organic C, a wide range of N and P concentrations and a 2-fold variation in C:N ratio. This suggests that the primary factor limiting soil respiration on the island is the supply of labile carbon substrate. Soil N and P status is also important, since adding glucose with N and/or P to soils with low N and P concentrations resulted in a significantly greater stimulation of respiration rate than adding glucose alone. In fact, for the Mesic fellfield and Dry mire soils (especially poor in N and P) adding N and P stimulated respiration rate even without added glucose. For soils with adequate endogenous concentrations of N and P (the Coastal herbfield and Cotula herbfield soils), adding further N and P did not stimulate respiration, and adding N and P with glucose did not enhance respiration more than adding glucose alone. It is proposed that manuring results in a whole syndrome of consequences for soil respiration rate, including increased litter input and root exudation due to higher primary production, higher quality of litter and soil organic matter, larger, more active and more diverse soil microbial populations and larger numbers of microbivores that stimulate microbial activity and turnover.

AB Understanding how plant species respond to climate change is one of the great challenges in biodiversity conservation and sustainable ecosystem planning. Current studies of the impact of climate change on plants are biased to tracheophytes, i.e. vascular-plants. Only a few studies have been carried out on bryophytes despite the fact that they are ecologically equally important groups of embryophytes with their origins predating contemporary vascular-plants. Bryophytes fundamentally differ from vascular plants in their small size and utilization of a poikilohydric strategy for water and nutrients; their survival and reproduction are highly dependent on their external environment. Thus, the results from studies of tracheophytes cannot be generalized on bryophytes. In this review, we synthesize information about the influence of environmental factors on bryophytes to understand their relation to climate, especially to temperature on a global scale. We discuss a range of critical topics, including the responses of photosynthetic activities to temperature changes, and the consequences of temperature change on the interactions between bryophytes and vascular-plants, as well as on peatland ecosystems. As many species thrive in relatively low temperatures, with a low potential for short-term thermal acclimation to higher temperature in a hydrated state, elevated temperatures may shorten the time of metabolic activity, and increase desiccation intensity. This can bring significant physiological pressure on the survival of poikilohydric bryophytes. As a consequence of global warming, significant losses in bryophyte diversity can be expected, particularly in areas harbouring large number of species such as boreal forests of higher latitudes, alpine biomes and higher altitudes on tropical mountains. Furthermore, the decline of bryophyte diversity will ultimately lead to an alteration of ecosystem structure and function, nutrient cycling, and carbon balance. Further exploration of bryophyte ecophysiology in the changing environment, particularly the acclimation potential of photosynthesis and its biochemical and enzyme level basis to predicted changes in temperature will provide new knowledge that will assist bryophyte conservation.

AB The mobilisation of energy from allocthonous carbon by heterotrophic bacterioplankton can be proportionally more important than autotrophic production in humic lakes. Moreover, increasing levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in many aquatic systems linked to increases in precipitation, which in turn may be related to changing climate, mean that this heterotrophic component of the food web may play an increasing role in the overall transfer and production of energy, particularly within peatland catchments. While such catchments are common in the temperate northwest Atlantic regions of Europe, studies describing the seasonal dynamics of the heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and autotrophic components of their aquatic food webs are rare. In this study, the biomass of these pelagic components was enumerated over 1 year in 2 oligotrophic lakes, both situated in peatland catchments in the west of Ireland but with contrasting DOC concentrations. Bacterial biomass dominated the pelagic food web of the more humic lake, Lough Feeagh, while autotrophic phytoplankton biomass was greatest in the clearwater lake, Lough Guitane. The biomass of potentially mixotrophic flagellates was also slightly larger in the Lough Guitane, while phagotrophic ciliate biomass was comparable between the 2 lakes. An extreme precipitation event led to a significant increase in bacterial biomass while simultaneously depressing autotrophic production for several months in the humic lake. Extreme precipitation in the clearwater lake also depressed autotrophic production but did not give rise to significant increases in bacterial biomass. This quantification of autotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic components provides a vital first step in understanding how pelagic communities contribute to net ecosystem productivity, and thus how Irish peatland lakes may be affected by projected climate changes.

AB The boreal biome exchanges large amounts of carbon (C) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) with the atmosphere and thus significantly affects the global climate. A managed boreal landscape consists of various sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) across forests, mires, lakes, and streams. Due to the spatial heterogeneity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net landscape carbon balance (NLCB). In this study, we compiled terrestrial and aquatic fluxes of CO2, CH4, DOC, DIC, and harvested C obtained from tall-tower eddy covariance measurements, stream monitoring, and remote sensing of biomass stocks for an entire boreal catchment (68 km(2)) in Sweden to estimate the NLCB across the land-water-atmosphere continuum. Our results showed that this managed boreal forest landscape was a net C sink (NLCB = 39 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with the landscape-atmosphere CO2 exchange being the dominant component, followed by the C export via harvest and streams. Accounting for the global warming potential of CH4, the landscape was a GHG sink of 237 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1), thus providing a climate-cooling effect. The CH4 flux contribution to the annual GHG budget increased from 0.6% during spring to 3.2% during winter. The aquatic C loss was most significant during spring contributing 8% to the annual NLCB. We further found that abiotic controls (e.g., air temperature and incoming radiation) regulated the temporal variability of the NLCB whereas land cover types (e.g., mire vs. forest) and management practices (e.g., clear-cutting) determined their spatial variability. Our study advocates the need for integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes at the landscape scale based on tall-tower eddy covariance measurements combined with biomass stock and stream monitoring to develop a holistic understanding of the NLCB of managed boreal forest landscapes and to better evaluate their potential for mitigating climate change.

AB The surface energy balance of a high-elevation groundwater-fed wetland (High Creek Fen) in central Colorado was measured from 9 June 2000 through 18 January 2005. In agreement with observations and predictions for decreased winter snow cover in the region, the low snow cover in 2001-2002 allowed for an examination of the impact of winter drought on the wetland. During years with an average snowpack, summer evaporation far exceeded precipitation. Despite near-normal summer precipitation following a winter drought, the summertime surface energy balance was affected with decreased latent heat fluxes and increased sensible heat fluxes. The leaf area index and the fraction of photosynthetic radiation absorbed were reduced following the winter drought. A shift in the primary controls on evaporation occurred as the surface's response to vapor pressure deficits and soil moisture increased following the winter drought. The earlier snowmelt coupled with earlier increase in soil temperature and moisture following winter drought did not increase evaporation, since vegetation was not yet developed, and evaporation from soil water was low during the early spring period.

AB The present area of European wetlands is only a fraction of their area before the start of large-scale human colonization of Europe. Many European wetlands have been exploited and managed for various purposes. Large wetland areas have been drained and reclaimed mainly for agriculture and establishment of human settlements. These threats to European wetlands persist. The main responses of European wetlands to ongoing climate change will vary according to wetland type and geographical location. Sea level rise will probably be the decisive factor affecting coastal wetlands, especially along the Atlantic coast. In the boreal part of Europe, increased temperatures will probably lead to increased annual evapotranspiration and lower organic matter accumulation in soil. The role of vast boreal wetlands as carbon sinks may thus be suppressed. In central and western Europe, the risk of floods may support the political will for ecosystem-unfriendly flood defence measures, which may threaten the hydrology of existing wetlands. Southern Europe will probably suffer most from water shortage, which may strengthen the competition for water resources between agriculture, industry and settlements on the one hand and nature conservancy, including wetland conservation, on the other.

AB (1) Sphagnum is an important genus of bryophytes holding 10-15 % of the terrestrial carbon stock. With climate change a drier surface may increase the abundance of vascular plants on peatlands, so shading of Sphagnum may increase. Here we describe growth cabinet experiments to reveal the effects of shading on interactions among mixtures of three species: S. capillifolium, S. palustre (hummock species), and S. fallax (a hollow species). We measured the six traits: growth in length, growth as increase in dry mass, side-shoot production, nitrogen and carbon proportion of the capitulum dry mass, and C:N ratio in the capitulum.
   (2) Shading had no effect on biomass production or side-shoot production but increased height increment in all three species. It also increased the C and N proportions of total dry mass but decreased C: N ratio in the capitula.
   (3) Neighbours of a different species reduced biomass and side-shoot production in the two hummock species but had no effect on the hollow species.
   (4) All three species showed interaction between shading and neighbour in two or more plant traits. S. fallax showed competitive advantage over S. palustre in no-shading treatments and over S. capillifolium in moderate shading treatments. In addition, under deep shading, S. fallax showed a competitive advantage over both hummock species. A clear competitive hierarchy S. fallax>S. capillifolium>S. palustre emerged which was consistent with the hierarchy of side-shoot production.
   (5) The results suggest that all the species appear to tolerate deep shade (for a few months at least). In a shaded environment, especially under deeply shaded conditions, S. fallax retains its dominance in hollow habitats (if water availability is guaranteed) by virtue of its advantage in side-shoot production.
   (6) If shading increases then the abundance of different Sphagnum species is likely to change.

AB Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

AB [ 1] In the biomass, soils, and peatlands of Siberia, boreal Russia holds one of the largest pools of terrestrial carbon. Because Siberia is located where some of the largest temperature increases are expected to occur under current climate change scenarios, stored carbon has the potential to be released with associated changes in fire regimes. Our concentration is on estimating a wide range of current and potential emissions from Siberia on the basis of three modeled scenarios. An area burned product of Siberia is introduced, which spans from 1998 through 2002. Emissions models are spatially explicit; therefore area burned is extracted from associated ecoregions for each year. Carbon consumption estimates are presented for 23 unique ecoregions across Siberia, which range from 3.4 to 75.4 t C ha(-1) for three classes of severity. Total direct carbon emissions range from the traditional scenario estimate of 116 Tg C in 1999 (6.9 M ha burned) to the extreme scenario estimate of 520 Tg C in 2002 (11.2 M ha burned), which are equivalent to 5 and 20%, respectively, of total global carbon emissions from forest and grassland burning. Our results suggest that disparities in the amount of carbon stored in unique ecosystems and the severity of fire events can affect total direct carbon emissions by as much as 50%. Additionally, in extreme fire years, total direct carbon emissions can be 37 - 41% greater than in normal fire years, owing to increased soil organic matter consumption. Mean standard scenario estimates of CO2 ( 555 - 1031 Tg), CO ( 43 - 80 Tg), CH4 (2.4 - 4.5 Tg), TNMHC (2.2 - 4.1 Tg), and carbonaceous aerosols (4.6 - 8.6 Tg) represent 10, 15, 19, 12 and 26%, respectively, of the global estimates from forest and grassland burning. Accounting for smoldering combustion in soils and peatlands results in increases in CO, CH4, and TNMHC and decreases in CO2 emitted from fire events.

AB Since the Middle Ages the Dutch have reclaimed many lakes and parts of the sea, creating polders. Drainage is required to use the land: for the inhabitants, for agriculture and for nature. Traditionally drainage was by gravity: through open (and later pipe) drains excess rainfall was transferred into open collector drains, from where the water was pumped out to a river, lake or the sea. Since the 1950s, land use has been changing towards a more diverse and intensive agriculture, more attention for nature, recreation and continuing urbanization. On top of this, the climate is changing: significant increases in precipitation, both average and extreme. Until recently, the solution to more excess water was to increase pump capacity. Yet the combined problems of climate change, sea level rise, subsidence and urbanization require more structural changes in water management. Drainage systems have to be modified to enable the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each agricultural plot. A new approach of 'retention, storage and controlled removal' is being used to develop climate adaptation scenarios for the three hydro-ecological zones in the Netherlands, i.e.: (1) the man-made polder areas with marine clay soils along the North Sea coast and the former Zuider Sea; (2) the low-lying peat lands in the west and north; and (3) the sandy and loamy soils areas in the centre, south and east. New approaches for tailor-made drainage solutions following this strategy are being tested in various pilot areas in the three zones. Although the research is still ongoing, this paper presents the lessons learned to date related to the challenges, risks and limitations associated with the introduction of these new drainage strategies for coping with climate change in the Netherlands.

AB We reconstructed quantified palaeoclimate changes within two Japanese pollen profiles spanning the Last Termination (LT; 18-10 cal. ka) in an attempt to better understand past monsoon activity. The reconstructed winter climate at the Tashiro mire, which is strongly influenced by the Siberian air mass, showed a weak and a short-lived cooling event at 11.8-10.6 cal. ka. This event spans part of the Younger Dryas (YD) cooling event in the North Atlantic region, suggesting the latter influenced the Siberian high-pressure system. In contrast, the summer climate at the Komado mire, which is more influenced by the Pacific air mass, experienced a strong and a prolonged cooling event at 15.5-13.0 cal. ka. The latter event is broadly synchronous with the Antarctica Cold Reversal (ACR) event, and suggests that the Pacific high-pressure system weakened during this period. The pattern of climate change across East Asia shows that the YD event did not extend beyond the East Asian monsoon front, while the ACR event strongly affected the Pacific high-pressure system during the LT. We suggest the East Asian monsoon front is an important geo-climatic boundary between YD-like and ACR-like deglacial climate changes. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peatlands, soils and the ocean floor are well-recognized as sites of organic carbonaccumulation andrepresentimportant global carbon sinks(1,2). Although the annual burial of organic carbon in lakes and reservoirs exceeds that of ocean sediments(3), these inland waters are components of the global carbon cycle that receive only limited attention(4-6). Of the organic carbon that is being deposited onto the sediments, a certain proportion will be mineralized and the remainder will be buried over geological timescales. Here we assess the relationship between sediment organic carbon mineralization and temperature in a cross-system survey of boreal lakes in Sweden, and with input froma compilation of published data from awide range of lakes that differ with respect to climate, productivity and organic carbon source. We find that the mineralization of organic carbon in lake sediments exhibits a strongly positive relationship with temperature, which suggests that warmer water temperatures lead to more mineralization and less organic carbon burial. Assuming that future organic carbon delivery to the lake sediments will be similar to that under present-day conditions, we estimate that temperature increases following the latest scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7) could result in a 4-27 per cent (0.9-6.4 Tg Cyr(-1)) decrease in annual organic carbon burial in boreal lakes.

AB Phytolith analyses of playa-fill sediments from Morgan Playa yield strong evidence for Holocene vegetation and climate change. Morgan Playa is located in the Rolling Plains of Garza County, north-central Texas. Backhoe excavation of the small (about 3.2 hectares) basin exposed 250 cm of Holocene age sediments. A strongly developed Early Holocene paleosol occurs at the base (205-250 cm) of the profile. Dark gray-brown, clayey playa sediments compose the upper 205 cm. A single bulk radiocarbon sample from 170-180 cm dating to 6840+/-140 yrs BP (Beta-48207) provides limited chronological control. Compositional changes in grass phytolith assemblages are used to define four bio-stratigraphic zones. Phytolith assemblages from the lowest zone, correlated with a paleosol, represent a mired grass prairie. Climatic estimates derived from this zone suggest an annual temperature near present levels but significantly greater (+100 mm) annual precipitation than today. A transitional zone (145-205 cm) shows increase in warm-season short grasses (grama and buffalo grasses) and Aristida (three-awn). This change is associated with increasing aridity during the Middle Holocene. Warm-season short-grass phytoliths dominate the bulk of the profile (15-145 cm). Climatic estimates for this zone include both lower annual precipitation (-50 mm) and significantly higher (+3 degrees C) annual temperatures than today. Reduction in short-grass phytolith percentages and an increase in phytolith percentages from cool-season grasses characterize the upper 15 cm of deposit. It is unclear whether this upper zone is the result of climate change or historic land use. The Morgan Playa record demonstrates the utility of phytolith analysis for inferring paleoclimatic change in a region where pollen analysis is unfruitful and unreliable.

AB A review of stratigraphic, radiocarbon, pollen, and aerial photographic data on the Swan Coastal Plain, south-western Australia, allows interpretation of long-term changes in climate and its effects on wetlands during the Holocene, whereas monitoring wetland hydrology and vegetation provides a measure of shorter-term changes. The information provides models for basin wetland response to changing climate. Drying climates shift wetlands to drier conditions, turning lakes into seasonally inundated or waterlogged basins, or resulting in an overall loss of wetlands, and favours more saline conditions, and development of carbonate deposits. Wetter conditions results in more frequent inundation, shifting damplands to sumplands or lakes, and resulting in fresher water conditions, and development of peat and/or organic matter enriched deposits. Examples of wetland basin responses to climate change across the Swan Coastal Plain show differential responses depending on setting, spatial distribution, hydrology, hydrochemistry and geochemistry, different temporal frameworks, and biological resilience.

AB The ability to forecast ecological carbon cycling is imperative to land management in a world where past carbon fluxes are no longer a clear guide in the Anthropocene. However, carbon-flux forecasting has not been practiced routinely like numerical weather prediction. This study explored (1) the relative contributions of model forcing data and parameters to uncertainty in forecasting flux- versus pool-based carbon cycle variables and (2) the time points when temperature and CO2 treatments may cause statistically detectable differences in those variables. We developed an online forecasting workflow (Ecological Platform for Assimilation of Data (EcoPAD)), which facilitates iterative data-model integration. EcoPAD automates data transfer from sensor networks, data assimilation, and ecological forecasting. We used the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Experiments data collected from 2011 to 2014 to constrain the parameters in the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, forecast carbon cycle responses to elevated CO2 and a gradient of warming from 2015 to 2024, and specify uncertainties in the model output. Our results showed that data assimilation substantially reduces forecasting uncertainties. Interestingly, we found that the stochasticity of future external forcing contributed more to the uncertainty of forecasting future dynamics of C flux-related variables than model parameters. However, the parameter uncertainty primarily contributes to the uncertainty in forecasting C pool-related response variables. Given the uncertainties in forecasting carbon fluxes and pools, our analysis showed that statistically different responses of fast-turnover pools to various CO2 and warming treatments were observed sooner than slow-turnover pools. Our study has identified the sources of uncertainties in model prediction and thus leads to improve ecological carbon cycling forecasts in the future.

AB Instrumental records of temperature and hydrological regimes in East Africa evidence frequent droughts with dramatic effects on population and ecosystems. Sources of these climatic variations remain largely unconstrained, partly because of a paucity of Late Holocene records. Here, we present a multi-proxy analysis of a 4-m continuous sediment core collected in the Kyambangunguru crater marsh, in southwest Tanzania, covering the last 4000 yrs (cal. BP). We used microscopic (macro-remains, microfossils, palynofacies, pollen), elemental (carbon, nitrogen contents), molecular (br GDGTs, n-alkanes) and compound-specific isotopic (delta H-2 n-alkanes) investigations to reconstruct the environmental history of the marsh. The multi proxy record reveals that, 2500 years ago, the marsh underwent a major ecological transition from a lake to a peatland. Temperature and hydrological reconstructions evidence warmer and drier conditions between 2200 and 860 cal. BP, which probably triggered the establishment of a perennial peatland. This study is one of the first combined temperature and precipitation record of Late Holocene in the region and highlights changes in the spatial distribution of the East African climate regimes. Several cold periods are observed, between 3300 and 2000 cal. BP and since 630 cal. BP, the latter corresponding to the Little Ice Age. Moreover, wetter conditions are reported during the Medieval Climate Anomaly in contrast to other north-eastern African records suggesting that Tanzania is located at the transition between two hydro-climatic zones (north-eastern versus southern Africa) and has experienced variable contributions of these two zones over the last millennium.

AB The study aimed to understand the inter-annual variations of methane (CH4) emissions from an open fen on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) from 2005 to 2007. The weighted mean CH4 emission rate was 8.37 +/- 11.32 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) during the summers from 2005 to 2007, falling in the range of CH4 fluxes reported by other studies, with significant inter-annual and spatial variations. The CH4 emissions of the year of 2006 (2.11 +/- 3.48 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were 82% lower than the mean value of the years 2005 and 2007 (13.91 +/- 17.80 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 9.44 +/- 14.32 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively), responding to the inter-annual changes of standing water depths during the growing season of the three years. Significant drawdown of standing water depth is believed to cause such significant reduction in CH4 emissions from wetlands in the year 2006, probably through changing the methanogen composition and decreasing its community size as well as activating methanotrophs to enhance CH4 oxidation. Our results are helpful to understand the inter-annual variations of CH4 emission and provide a more reasonable regional budget of CH4 emission from wetlands on the QTP and even for world-wide natural wetlands under climate change.

AB Extreme weather events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity as climate change continues. Heterotrophic bacteria play a critical role in lake ecosystems, yet little research has been done to determine how they are affected by such extremes. The purpose of this study was to use high-throughput sequencing to explore the bacterial community composition of a humic oligotrophic lake on the North Atlantic Irish coast and to assess the impacts on composition dynamics related to extreme weather events. Samples for sequencing were collected from Lough Feeagh on a fortnightly basis from April to November 2018. Filtration was used to separate free-living and particle-associated bacterial communities and amplicon sequencing was performed for the 16S rRNA V4 region. Two named storms, six high discharge events, and one drought period occurred during the sampling period. These events had variable, context-dependent effects on bacterial communities in Lough Feeagh. The particle-associated community was found to be more likely to respond to physical changes, such as mixing, while the free-living population responded to changes in nutrient and carbon concentrations. Generally, however, the high stability of the bacterial community observed in Lough Feeagh suggests that the bacterial community is relatively resilient to extreme weather events.

AB Soils consume about 40 Tg methane from the atmosphere annually. Thus, soils contribute significantly to the atmospheric methane budget. However, responses of atmospheric methane consumption to climate change are uncertain. Predicting these responses requires an understanding of the effect on methane consumption of specific variables (temperature and soil water content) as well as interactions among parameters (methane, ammonium, water content). Key considerations involve the limitations of diffusive transport and controls of methane diffusivity; limitation of methanotrophic activity by water stress; relatively slow growth rates of methane-oxidizing bacteria on atmospheric methane; ammonium toxicity, interactions among these parameters may be particularly important, and lead to responses contrary to those predicted from changes in temperature and water content alone. Results from a number of analyses indicate that atmospheric methane consumption is especially sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, which typically decrease activity. Continued increases in wet and dry ammonium deposition are likely to exacerbate inhibition resulting from changes in land use. Changes in hydrological regimes could further decrease activity if dry periods increase water stress at soil depths currently colonized by methanotrophs. Future trends in the soil methane sink are likely to lead to enhanced accumulation of atmospheric methane.

AB Catchment storage sustains ecologically important low flows in headwater systems. Understanding the factors controlling storage is essential in analysis of catchment vulnerability to global change. We calculated catchment storage and storage sensitivity of streamflow for 61 boreal headwater catchments in Finland. We also explored the connection between computed storage indices and low flow conditions. The relationships between selected climate, snow, and catchment characteristics and calculated storage properties and low flows were investigated, in order to assess the importance of different factors that render catchments vulnerable to climate and environmental change. We found that the most sensitive areas to climate change were located in the southern boreal coastal zone, with fine-grained soils and agricultural areas. In contrast, catchments in the middle and northern boreal zone, with till and peatland soils and higher snow water equivalent values, were less sensitive under current conditions. In addition, we found a threshold at a snow to precipitation ratio of 0.35. Above that threshold, summer low flows were generally sensitive to changes in snow conditions, whereas below that threshold catchment characteristics gained importance and the sensitivity was more directly related to changes in temperature and timing of rainfall. These findings suggest that a warming climate will have pronounced impacts on hydrology and catchment sensitivity related to snow quantity and snow cover duration in certain snow to precipitation ratio zones. Moreover, land use activities had an impact on storage properties in agricultural and drained peatland areas, resulting in a negative effect on low flows.

AB East Shield (3658 m) and Barcroft Gate (3697 m) Meadows in the White Mountains of California on the Inyo National Forest were selected for a pilot baseline monitoring study over five-year intervals to determine potential effects of future climate change on the meadows. Stated as a hypothesis: given the natural range of temporal variability of meadow vegetation, a significant portion of that variability is attributed to the effects of climatic variation. The study is associated with the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments Project (GLORIA) hosted by the University of California White Mountain Research Station. Both meadows are sedge-rush-grass wet meadows, or fens, which are sustained by surface water in the form of streams and springs. A comprehensive plant list was compiled and the plant species of each meadow were sampled by a point intercept method along two randomly placed transects. The occurrence of all species at predetermined one-meter interval sample points along the transects were recorded, percent occurrence was calculated, and descriptive statistics were done. The monitoring objective is to detect a 20% biologically meaningful change in the vegetation over time with 90% confidence, and accept a 10% chance of a false change error (Type 1 error). Monitoring is planned to be done in conjunction with tracking change in precipitation and temperature. Three indicators of possible climate change were chosen. One indicator is increase in the abundance of those species whose upper range is at or below meadow elevations. The rationale for this indicator is based the 2007 IPCC report estimation that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will increase global temperature with a best estimate of +3.0 degrees C. Assuming that the present general lapse rate of -6.32 degrees C per kilometer for the White Mountains will persist, a 3.0 degrees C increase may result in an equivalent elevation of the meadows of about +475 m. Published elevation ranges indicate that most recorded species are not likely to be affected by the estimated temperature increase. Second and third indicators are a shift in cover from wet meadow to dry meadow species, and the presence and increase of shrub species resulting from postulated reduced precipitation with drying of meadows and encroachment by surrounding shrubs (sagebrush and rabbitbrush). This monitoring study has the potential to detect long-term responses of vegetation to climate change, and reduce uncertainties and confirm or correct the expected consequences of temperature change.

AB The anhydrosugars, levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan, are regarded as suitable molecular indicators of natural biomass combustion. Here, we evaluate summed anhydrosugars (SAS) as a paleofire indicator in a 6000 year-long fossil core from Agios Floros fen, Peloponnese, Greece, by analyzing charcoal fragments in parallel, throughout the sediment sequence. Modern surface soil samples from the same region were analysed for the presence of SAS, confirming the biomarker as an indicator of recent fire activity. The highest SAS concentrations in the fossil core were found in sections representing periods of wet conditions, both on local and regional scales and regionally widespread arboreal vegetation. Low amounts, or the absence, of SAS in the fossil core were associated with periods of dryness, regional dominance of non-arboreal vegetation and the presence of a fen rather than a lake ecosystem at the site. Micro-charcoal fragments were generally more abundant under these conditions. This suggests that SAS yield and deposition may vary with fuel availability and fire behavior, which in turn is affected by climate, local moisture and vegetation type. Forest fires result in more SAS compared to grass fires. SAS yield is also favored by low-temperature fires sustained under wet climate conditions. Preservation of SAS is likely to be compromised in the only seasonally wet fen ecosystem under the dry and warm Mediterranean climate conditions. The moist and shallow conditions in the wetland during hot summer months probably promote oxidation and biodegradation of the labile SAS molecules, compared to the more robust charcoal fragments. Thus, a multiproxy approach using several proxies, both for fire, hydro climate and vegetation change is preferred when aiming to reconstruct past biomass burning from wetland ecosystems in a Mediterranean environment. The micro-charcoal record from Agios Floros reveals significant fire activity between 4400 and 2800 cal yr BP. This partly overlaps the Bronze Age period, associated with intense human environmental interaction and climate change in this area of Peloponnese, Greece. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB We designed artificial neural networks to model daily total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (N-tot) and total phosphorus (P-tot) concentrations in streamwater and used the simulated concentrations to predict future fluxes under scenarios of climate change. The streams drain two forested catchments located in southern and eastern Finland. In the period 1990-2000, observed TOC, N-tot and P-tot concentrations were in the range 2-60 mg C L-1, 0.1-1.4 mg N L-1 and 1-60 mu g P L-1 with mean discharge per unit area in the range of 10-15 L s(-1) km(-2) for the three streams.
   Artificial neural networks consisting of 13 input variables, 1 hidden layer with 7 nodes and 1 output variable each were trained with the backpropagation algorithm to estimate the concentration of TOC, N-tot and P-tot in streamwater. Daily air temperature, precipitation and runoff observations were included in the input variables as well as catchment characteristics such as catchment area and the area of lakes and peatland within the catchment. The networks performed well in comparison with the alternative method, i.e. flow-weighted average concentrations. Artificial neural networks are a useful method for creating blackbox models of streamwater quality in cases where the involved processes are too complex to simulate directly.
   Projected changes in monthly temperature and precipitation under a changing climate were used to generate daily temperature and precipitation series for the 2050s. Daily runoff values for this hypothetical year were produced with an operational runoff model. Carbon and nitrogen loads were calculated for the 2050s using the neural network models of TOC, N-tot and P-tot concentrations. The low change scenario resulted in annual fluxes close to present fluxes, while the high change scenario gave an increase of approximately 26% of annual TOC, N-tot and P-tot fluxes.

AB The role of climatic change in the social transition in NE China during the Bronze Age is poorly understood due to the lack of reliable climate proxy records. Here we report a 3600-yr-long climate record based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether distributions in the Jinchuan peat core, Northeastern (NE) China. Our record shows a persistent cooling between ca.3.5-3.0 ka, which coincides with the societal transition from a settled to a mobile lifestyle. Comparing existing records suggests that this event represents a hemispherical-scale cooling probably driven by the prolonged El Nino conditions. The low temperatures caused unfavorable conditions for the agriculture-based society during the Lower Xiajiadian period and thus drove people to flee southward into the North China and Central China Plains, leading to a culturally desolated area that was gradually occupied by pastoralists in about 250 years. Our results highlight the need to consider the interplay of climatic dynamics with social upheaval in understanding the evolution of prehistorical civilization in NE Asia.

AB Microbial communities living in Sphagnum are known to constitute early indicators of ecosystem disturbances, but little is known about their response ( including their trophic relationships) to climate change. A microcosm experiment was designed to test the effects of a temperature gradient ( 15, 20, and 25 degrees C) on microbial communities including different trophic groups ( primary producers, decomposers, and unicellular predators) in Sphagnum segments (0-3 cm and 3-6 cm of the capitulum). Relationships between microbial communities and abiotic factors ( pH, conductivity, temperature, and polyphenols) were also studied. The density and the biomass of testate amoebae in Sphagnum upper segments increased and their community structure changed in heated treatments. The biomass of testate amoebae was linked to the biomass of bacteria and to the total biomass of other groups added and, thus, suggests that indirect effects on the food web structure occurred. Redundancy analysis revealed that microbial assemblages differed strongly in Sphagnum upper segments along a temperature gradient in relation to abiotic factors. The sensitivity of these assemblages made them interesting indicators of climate change. Phenolic compounds represented an important explicative factor in microbial assemblages and outlined the potential direct and ( or) indirect effects of phenolics on microbial communities.

AB Studies with application of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon have been performed on calcareous tufa, groundwater and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the spring mire cupola in Wardzy. This study was focused on the verification of the a priori hypothesis that the analysed calcareous tufa is a chemical deposit and on the attempt to supplement an earlier scenario of environmental changes in the Subboreal with oscillations of water temperature. The constructed model of chemical and isotope balance, and delta C-13 determinations in DIC, allowed for calculating ratios of stable isotopes of carbon in particular speciations and in gaseous CO2. The obtained results coupled with delta C-13 values in calcite indicate that this mineral precipitated from the solution chemically (without the contribution of living organisms). Additionally, it was possible to reconstruct the temperature range at which the calcareous tufa was formed. The reconstructed scenario of changes in the thermal conditions was refined based on delta O-18 determinations in groundwater and calcite. Accordingly, the oldest calcareous tufa, with an age of about 5500 cal years BP, was formed in cool climate conditions (with average annual temperatures by about 3 degrees C lower than presently). The formation of younger series of the calcareous tufa took place between 4400-2900 cal years BP and represents a much warmer period with two distinct cooler episodes at 3900 and 3000 cal years BP, respectively. The course of the obtained temperature curves correlates well with the GISP2 curve and curves obtained for other sites in Northern, and Central Europe.

AB Aim
   To examine the effect of climate change on the occurrence and distribution of Pipistrellus nathusii (Nathusius' pipistrelle) in the United Kingdom (UK).
   Location
   We modelled habitat and climatic associations of P. nathusii in the UK and applied this model to the species' historical range in continental Europe.
   Methods
   A binomial logistic regression model was constructed relating the occurrence of P. nathusii to climate and habitat characteristics using historical species occurrence records (1940-2006) and CORINE land cover data. This model was applied to historical and projected climate data to examine changes in suitable range (1940-2080) of this species. We tested the predictive ability of the model with known records in the UK after 2006 and applied the model to the species' known range in Europe.
   Results
   The distribution of P. nathusii was related positively to the area of water bodies, woodland and small areas of urbanization, and negatively related to the area of peat/heathland. Species records were associated with higher minimum temperatures, low seasonal variation in temperature and intermediate rainfall. We found that suitable areas have existed in the UK since the 1940s and that these have expanded. The model had high predictive power when applied to new records after 2006, with a correct classification rate of 70%, estimated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Based on climate projections, our model suggests a potential twofold increase in the area suitable for P. nathusii in the UK by 2050. The single most influential climate variable contributing to range increase was the projected increase in minimum temperature. When applied to Europe, the model predictions had best predictive capability of known records in western areas of the species' range, where P. nathusii is present during the winter.
   Main conclusions
   We show that a mobile, migratory species has adapted its range in response to recent climate change on a continental scale. We believe this may be the first study to demonstrate a case of range change linked to contemporary climate change in a mammal species in Europe.

AB Environmental changes due to global climatic changes will be a major issue for Canada during the 21st century. The effects of new climactic conditions are still difficult to assess. Global Circulation Models (GCM) simulate the effects of increased greenhouse gases on climate, but will need to be supplemented by Regional Climate Models (RCM) since their scale is not quite appropriate. Field controls such as instrumental climate records and glacier mass balance studies help refine model predictions. On a countrywide scale CCM's predict increased temperatures, but these are quite variable on a regional scale. Volume and distribution of wafer will be modified and increased aridity could be critical in some Prairie areas. Extreme events, which are not taken into account by GCMs, could be more frequent, with serious negative effects. Biomes will shift northward and the forest industry will have to adapt its practices quickly. These changes will also affect carbon cycles, due to increased decoy of forest biomass and also drying out of bogs. Warming trends will be even more accute in northern areas, and will provoke permafrost degradation, development of thermokarsts and soil instability. A sea-level rise is anticipated, which will make the coasts of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia vulnerable to submersion risks. Agriculture will have to adapt to an increased length of growing season, but also to dry spells, much more accute during summer time. The importance of climate change and its impacts on environment are still not well known, which hinders adaptive measures, but some economic sectors cannot really wait for an absolute certainty and must react now, which is the case of the forestry industry. Finally, social issues cannot be ignored. What will be the reaction of the population in the case where government promotes adaptation measures? How will the Canadian population welcome economic/environmental refugees coming from poor countries, which will be more affected than will Canada by climate change, with expected drops in food

AB Combined effects of co-occurring global climate changes on ecosystem responses are generally poorly understood. Here, we present results from a 2-year field experiment in a Carex fen ecosystem on the southernmost tip of South America, where we examined the effects of solar ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-315 nm) and warming on above- and belowground plant production, C : N ratios, decomposition rates and earthworm population sizes. Solar UVB radiation was manipulated using transparent plastic filter films to create a near-ambient (90% of ambient UVB) or a reduced solar UVB treatment (15% of ambient UVB). The warming treatment was imposed passively by wrapping the same filter material around the plots resulting in a mean air and soil temperature increase of about 1.2 degrees C. Aboveground plant production was not affected by warming, and marginally reduced at near-ambient UVB only in the second season. Aboveground plant biomass also tended to have a lower C : N ratio under near-ambient UVB and was differently affected at the two temperatures (marginal UVB x temperature interaction). Leaf decomposition of one dominant sedge species (Carex curta) tended to be faster at near-ambient UVB than at reduced UVB. Leaf decomposition of a codominant species (Carex decidua) was significantly faster at near-ambient UVB; root decomposition of this species tended to be lower at increased temperature and interacted with UVB. We found, for the first time in a field experiment that epigeic earthworm density and biomass was 36% decreased by warming but remained unaffected by UVB radiation. Our results show that present-day solar UVB radiation and modest warming can adversely affect ecosystem functioning and engineers of this fen. However, results on plant biomass production also showed that treatment manipulations of co-occurring global change factors can be overridden by the local climatic situation in a given study year.

AB To tackle the symptoms of eutrophication in the open Baltic Sea and Finnish coastal waters, Finland has agreed to reduce both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) inputs. Due to large investments in treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters, TP loads started to decrease already in the mid-1970s and the respective TN loads in the mid-1990s. During the last two decades, much effort has been spent in decreasing the load originating from diffuse sources. Trend analyses in 1995-2016 showed that, despite various mitigation measures, riverine nutrient export has not substantially decreased, and especially the export from rivers draining agricultural lands remains high. In some areas TN concentrations and export were increasing and we found evidence that it was linked to ditching of peatlands. Several factors connected to climate/weather (e.g. temperature and precipitation) have counteracted the mitigation measures, and therefore Finland will not achieve the nutrient reduction targets by 2021.

AB Increasing DOC concentrations in rivers of boreal and sub-boreal regions have been a widely observed phenomena. However, individual studies have been limited in time and space and this has limited the ability to test hypotheses of the explanation of the observed increases. This study examines 315 records from across Britain all of which are at least 10 years in length up to 2002, but with some records extending back to 1975 and combines these with results from 198 sites from a previous study. The study covers catchment areas up to 9948 km(2). The results show that:
   (i) Of the 315 records analysed, 216 showed a significant increase but 55 showed a significant decrease. This is the first time that significant long-term decreases in DOC concentration have been documented for British rivers. Trends in DOC concentration ranged from -5.7% to 16% annual percentage change.
   (ii) Although increasing trends are predominantly in catchments with peat covered headwaters, some peat catchment also show significant decreases.
   (iii) Some sites which show significant decreases over 10-year time periods exhibit significant increases over longer term records (23 years).
   (iv) Regional trends in DOC concentration cannot be explained by spatial or temporal trends in atmospheric deposition of acidity, oxides of N, and non-marine S. Further, trends in DOC concentrations do not appear to correlate with the occurrence of droughts.
   The study concludes that there is tong-term increases in DOC are not ubiquitous for all organic soils across the UK and that even where long-term increases are apparent these trends are overprinted by changes in river flow. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing temperatures and changes in the intensity and frequency of precipitations may impact the ability of tropical high-elevation Andean ecosystems (Paramos) to store and retain carbon (C). We, therefore, examined how warming and fluctuations in soil moisture could influence soil CO2 emissions from heterotrophic respiration (RH, the result of microbial respiration), of two Paramos of contrasting climatic regimes within their area of distribution. We here show high sensitivity of both RH and Q(10) under warmer and fluctuating moisture conditions. Together with the high rates of C-normalized RH compared to other soil C-rich ecosystems from higher latitudes (2 mu mol gC(-1) h(-1) versus 0,4 itmol gC(-1) h(-1), respectively) our results evidenced how soil heterotrophic-derived CO2 emissions could potentially increase under expected climate scenarios, eventually altering the capacity of soil Paramos to sequester C.

AB In order to study the effects of climate changes on soil organisms and processes, a transplantation experiment was undertaken. Eighteen soil blocks from an ombrotrophic mire (Stordalenmyren) at Abisko in northern Sweden were transplanted to nine sites in Sweden, from Umea in the north to Alnarp in the south. The study was part of the EC-project DEGREE (Diversity effects in grassland ecosystems of Europe). The development of populations of nematodes, tardigrades and rotifers was followed in a monthly sampling programme. Microbial biomass and inorganic nitrogen were determined by other partners in the project. Some effects could be related to climatic conditions at the transplantation sites and the most clear influence was found at open sites with great fluctuations in temperature and moisture. The parameters most clearly influenced were amount of mineralized nitrogen, numbers of bacterial feeding nematodes belonging to the Rhabditida, and numbers of tardigrades. These components had a fairly large coefficient of variation (CV = 0.9-1.2). Microbial biomass as indicated by the CFE and Egosterol methods varied less (CV = 0.3). The Shannon index, Evenness and Maturity index varied very little (CV = 0.1). In most changing parameters the effect was most clearly seen during the autumn. The fluctuations of microorganisms, nematodes, tardigrades and inorganic nitrogen could indicate a food web interaction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changing environmental and geomorphological conditions are resulting in vegetation change in ice-wedge polygons in Arctic tundra. However, we do not yet know how microscale vegetation patterns relate to individual environmental and geomorphological parameters. This work aims at examining these relations in polygonal terrain. We analysed composition and cover of vascular plant taxa and surface height, active layer depth, soil temperature, carbon and nitrogen content, pH and electrical conductivity in four polygon mires located on the Yukon coast. We found that vascular plant species composition and cover correlates best with relative surface height. Ridges of low-centred polygons and raised centres of high-centred polygons support the growth of mesic and wetland species (e.g., Betula glandulosa, Salix pulchra, S. reticulata, Rubus chamaemorus, various ericaceous dwarf shrubs, Eriophorum vaginatum, Poa arctica). Wetland and aquatic plant species (e.g., E. angustifolium, Carex aquatilis, C. chordorrhiza, Pedicularis sudetica) grow in low-lying centres of polygons and in troughs between polygons. We also found a relationship between vascular plant species composition and substrate characteristics such as pH, electrical conductivity and total organic carbon, although the individual influence of these parameters could not be determined because of their correlation with relative surface height. Our findings stress the regulatory role of microtopography and substrate in vegetation dynamics of polygonal terrain. Ongoing warming in this region will lead to changes to polygonal terrain through permafrost degradation and subsequent conversion of low-centred into high-centred polygons. Our results indicate that shrubs, particularly Betula glandulosa and heath species, have the potential to expand most.

AB The mid-Pliocene is a valuable time interval for investigating equilibrium climate at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations because atmospheric CO2 concentrations are thought to have been comparable to the current day and yet the climate and distribution of ecosystems were quite different. One intriguing, but not fully understood, feature of the early to mid-Pliocene climate is the amplified Arctic temperature response and its impact on Arctic ecosystems. Only the most recent models appear to correctly estimate the degree of warming in the Pliocene Arctic and validation of the currently proposed feedbacks is limited by scarce terrestrial records of climate and environment. Here we reconstruct the summer temperature and fire regime from a subfossil fen-peat deposit on west-central Ellesmere Island, Canada, that has been chronologically constrained using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating to 3.9 + 1.5/ - 0.5 Ma.
   The estimate for average mean summer temperature is 15.4 +/- 0.8 degrees C using specific bacterial membrane lipids, i.e., branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers. This is above the proposed threshold that predicts a substantial increase in wildfire in the modern high latitudes. Macro-charcoal present in all samples from this Pliocene section with notably higher charcoal concentration in the upper part of the sequence. This change in charcoal was synchronous with a change in vegetation that included an increase in abundance of fire-promoting Pinus and Picea. Paleo-vegetation reconstructions are consistent with warm summer temperatures, relatively low summer precipitation and an incidence of fire comparable to fire-adapted boreal forests of North America and central Siberia.
   To our knowledge, this site provides the northernmost evidence of fire during the Pliocene. It suggests that ecosystem productivity was greater than in the present day, providing fuel for wildfires, and that the climate was conducive to the ignition of fire during this period. The results reveal that interactions between paleo-vegetation and paleoclimate were mediated by fire in the High Arctic during the Pliocene, even though CO2 concentrations were similar to modern values.

AB In this overview (introductory article to a special issue including 14 papers), we consider all main types of natural and artificial inland freshwater habitas (fwh). For each type, we identify the main biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics, sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs); unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid, floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes); threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh); endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications, overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for biodiversity conservation. Effective conservation solutions are dependent on an understanding of connectivity between different freshwater ecosystems (including related terrestrial, coastal and marine systems).

AB Research on permafrost carbon has dramatically increased in the past few years. A new estimate of 1672 Pg C of belowground organic carbon in the northern circumpolar permafrost region more than doubles the previous value and highlights the potential role of permafrost carbon in the Earth System. Uncertainties in this new estimate remain due to relatively few available pedon data for certain geographic sectors and the deeper cryoturbated soil horizons, and the large polygon size in the soil maps used for upscaling. The large permafrost carbon pool is not equally distributed across the landscape: peat deposits, cryoturbated soils and the loess-like deposits of the yedoma complex contain disproportionately large amounts of soil organic matter, often exhibiting a low degree of decomposition. Recent findings in Alaska and northern Sweden provide strong evidence that the deeper soil carbon in permafrost terrain is starting to be released, supporting previous reports from Siberia. The permafrost carbon pool is not yet fully integrated in climate and ecosystem models and an important objective should be to define typical pedons appropriate for model setups. The thawing permafrost carbon feedback needs to be included in model projections of future climate change. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an essential role in climate change and air pollution by modulating tropospheric oxidation capacity and providing precursors for ozone and aerosol formation. Arctic permafrost buries large quantities of frozen soil carbon, which could be released as VOCs with permafrost thawing or collapsing as a consequence of global warming. However, due to the lack of reported studies in this field and the limited capability of the conventional measurement techniques, it is poorly understood how much VOCs could be emitted from thawing permafrost and the chemical speciation of the released VOCs. Here we apply a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF) in laboratory incubations for the first time to examine the release of VOCs from thawing permafrost peatland soils sampled from Finnish Lapland. The warming-induced rapid VOC emissions from the thawing soils were mainly attributed to the direct release of old, trapped gases from the permafrost. The average VOC fluxes from thawing permafrost were four times as high as those from the active layer (the top layer of soil in permafrost terrain). The emissions of less volatile compounds, i.e. sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, increased substantially with rising temperatures. Results in this study demonstrate the potential for substantive VOC releases from thawing permafrost. We anticipate that future global warming could stimulate VOC emissions from the Arctic permafrost, which may significantly influence the Arctic atmospheric chemistry and climate change.

AB CryoGRID 1.0 provides an equilibrium model of permafrost distribution in Norway at a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The approach was forced with gridded data on daily air temperature and snow cover. Ground thermal properties for different bedrock types and sediment covers were derived from surveys and geological maps to yield distributions of thermal conductivity, heat capacity and water content. The distribution of blockfields was derived from satellite images adapting a newly developed classification scheme. The model was evaluated using measured ground surface and ground temperatures, yielding a realistic description of the permafrost distribution in mainland Norway. The model results show that permafrost underlies sites mainly with exposed bedrock or covered by coarse-grained sediments, such as blockfields and coarse tills. In northern Norway, palsa mires are abundant and organic material and vegetation strongly influence the ground thermal regime. Modelling suggests that permafrost in equilibrium with the 19812010 climate presently underlies between 6.1 per cent and 6.4 per cent of the total area of mainland Norway, an area significantly smaller than that modelled for the Little Ice Age climate (14%). CryoGRID 1.0 was subsequently forced using output from a regional climate model for the 20712100 period, which suggests that severe permafrost degradation will occur, leaving permafrost beneath an area of just 0.2 per cent of mainland Norway.

AB Sediment lithology, pollen, and plant-macrofossil data from the Paynter Site, southern Ontario, revealed three wetland developmental stages during the past 11000 years: (i) a Carex, Eupatorium, and Eleocharis dominated marsh with some Larix, Abies, and Picea (ca. 11000-8300 cal years BP); (ii) a Verbena hastata and Mentha arvensis marsh (ca. 8300-7460 cal years BP); and (iii) a white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) swamp (7460 cal years BP to present). There were no significant successional changes in the initial diverse marsh (stage 1) for about 2700 years; its high taxon richness was maintained by fluctuating water levels. The succession from marsh to swamp at 7460 cal years BP was caused by mid-Holocene warm and dry climate, which corresponded with cedar expansion elsewhere in Ontario. The swamp peat record was interrupted at ca. 6400 cal years BP by declining water levels, culminating in a dry period, as indicated by a sandy layer, rare macrofossils, and a low sediment-accumulation rate (0.012 cm/year). The reappearance of cedar swamp macrofossils since 3200 cal years BP corresponded with the recovery of water levels owing to a more humid late Holocene climate and flooding from isostatic tilt. Human disturbance such as damming and logging caused the development of historical cedar and thicket swamps with abundant Alnus rugosa and weedy taxa. This sequence of wetland development did not match the present vegetational gradients from Carex-Typha herb marsh, through Myrica-Decodon shrub marsh and Alnus-Fraxinus thicket, to Thuja swamp. At this site, the wetland development was mainly influenced by allogenic factors such as water levels and climate rather than autogenic factors.

AB Numerical simulations of groundwater flow and heat transport are used to provide insight into the interaction between shallow groundwater flow and thermal dynamics related to permafrost thaw and thaw settlement at the Iqaluit Airport taxiway, Nunavut, Canada. A conceptual model is first developed for the site and a corresponding two-dimensional numerical model is calibrated to the observed ground temperatures. Future climate-warming impacts on the thermal regime and flow system are then simulated based on climate scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under climate warming, surface snow cover is identified as the leading factor affecting permafrost degradation, including its role in increasing the sensitivity of permafrost degradation to changes in various hydrogeological factors. In this case, advective heat transport plays a relatively minor, but non-negligible, role compared to conductive heat transport, due to the significant extent of low-permeability soil close to surface. Conductive heat transport, which is strongly affected by the surface snow layer, controls the release of unfrozen water and the depth of the active layer as well as the magnitude of thaw settlement and frost heave. Under the warmest climate-warming scenario with an average annual temperature increase of 3.23 A degrees C for the period of 2011-2100, the simulations suggest that the maximum depth of the active layer will increase from 2 m in 2012 to 8.8 m in 2100 and, over the same time period, thaw settlement along the airport taxiway will increase from 0.11 m to at least 0.17 m.

AB We used a biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), to study the net methane (CH4) fluxes between Alaskan ecosystems and the atmosphere. We estimated that the current net emissions of CH4 (emissions minus consumption) from Alaskan soils are; similar to 3 Tg CH4/yr. Wet tundra ecosystems are responsible for 75% of the region's net emissions, while dry tundra and upland boreal forests are responsible for 50% and 45% of total consumption over the region, respectively. In response to climate change over the 21st century, our simulations indicated that CH4 emissions from wet soils would be enhanced more than consumption by dry soils of tundra and boreal forests. As a consequence, we projected that net CH4 emissions will almost double by the end of the century in response to high-latitude warming and associated climate changes. When we placed these CH4 emissions in the context of the projected carbon budget (carbon dioxide [CO2] and CH4) for Alaska at the end of the 21st century, we estimated that Alaska will be a net source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere of 69 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr, that is, a balance between net methane emissions of 131 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr and carbon sequestration of 17 Tg C/yr (62 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr).

AB P>Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from arctic ecosystems are important in view of their role in global atmospheric chemistry and unknown feedbacks to global warming. These cold ecosystems are hotspots of climate warming, which will be more severe here than averaged over the globe. We assess the effects of climatic warming on non-methane BVOC emissions from a subarctic heath.
   We performed ecosystem-based chamber measurements and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of the BVOCs collected on adsorbent over two growing seasons at a wet subarctic tundra heath hosting a long-term warming and mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) litter addition experiment.
   The relatively low emissions of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were doubled in response to an air temperature increment of only 1.9-2.5 degrees C, while litter addition had a minor influence. BVOC emissions were seasonal, and warming combined with litter addition triggered emissions of specific compounds.
   The unexpectedly high rate of release of BVOCs measured in this conservative warming scenario is far above the estimates produced by the current models, which underlines the importance of a focus on BVOC emissions during climate change. The observed changes have implications for ecological interactions and feedback effects on climate change via impacts on aerosol formation and indirect greenhouse effects.

AB Natural moisture limitation during summer drought can constitute a stress for microbial communities in soil. Given globally predicted increases in drought frequency, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of the effects of drought events on soil microbial processes. Using a long-term field-scale drought manipulation experiment at Clocaenog, Wales, UK, we analysed fungal community dynamics, using internal transcribed spacer-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), over a 1-year period in the 6th year of drought manipulation. Ambient seasonality was found to be the dominant factor driving variation in fungal community dynamics. The summer drought manipulation resulted in a significant decline in the abundance of dominant fungal species, both independently of, and in interaction with, this seasonal variation. Furthermore, soil moisture was significantly correlated with the changes in fungal diversity over the drought manipulation period. While the relationship between species diversity and functional diversity remains equivocal, phenol oxidase activity was decreased by the summer drought conditions and there was a significant correlation with the decline of DGGE band richness among the most dominant fungal species during the drought season. Climatically driven events such as droughts may have significant implications for fungal community diversity and therefore, have the potential to interfere with crucial ecosystem processes, such as organic matter decomposition.

AB Climate changes affect the abundance, geographic extent, and floral composition of vegetation, which are reflected in the pollen rain. Sediment cores taken from lakes and peat bogs can be analysed for their pollen content. The fossil pollen records provide information on the temporal changes in climate and palaeo-environments. Although the complexity of the variables influencing vegetation distribution requires a multi -dimensional approach, only a few research projects have used GIS to analyse pollen data. This paper presents a new approach to palynological data analysis by combining GIS and spatial modelling. Eastern Colombia was chosen as a study area owing to the migration of the forest-savanna boundary since the last glacial maximum, and the availability of pollen records. Logistic regression has been used to identify the climatic variables that determine the distribution of savanna and forest in eastern Colombia. These variables were used to create a predictive land-cover model, which was subsequently implemented into a GIS to perform spatial analysis on the results. The palynological data from the study area were incorporated into the GIS. Reconstructed maps of past vegetation distribution by interpolation showed a new approach of regional multi-site data synthesis related to climatic parameters. The logistic regression model resulted in a map with 85.7% predictive accuracy, which is considered useful for the reconstruction of future and past land-cover distributions. The suitability of palynological GIS application depends on the number of pollen sites, the distribution of the pollen sites over the area of interest, and the degree of overlap of the age ranges of the pollen records.

AB Reconstructing climates of the past relies on a variety of evidence from a large number of sites to capture the varied features of climate and the spatial heterogeneity of climate change. This review summarizes available information from diverse Holocene paleoenvironmental records across eastern Beringia (Alaska, westernmost Canada and adjacent seas), and it quantifies the primary trends of temperature- and moisture-sensitive records based in part on midges, pollen, and biogeochemical indicators (compiled in the recently published Arctic Holocene database, and updated here to v2.1). The composite time series from these proxy records are compared with new summaries of mountain-glacier and lake-level fluctuations, terrestrial water-isotope records, sea-ice and sea-surface-temperature analyses, and peatland and thaw-lake initiation frequencies to clarify multi-centennial- to millennial-scale trends in Holocene climate change. To focus the synthesis, the paleo data are used to frame specific questions that can be addressed with simulations by Earth system models to investigate the causes and dynamics of past and future climate change. This systematic review shows that, during the early Holocene (11.7-8.2 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), rather than a prominent thermal maximum as suggested previously, temperatures were highly variable, at times both higher and lower than present (approximate mid-20th-century average), with no clear spatial pattern. Composited pollen, midge and other proxy records average out the variability and show the overall lowest summer and mean-annual temperatures across the study region during the earliest Holocene, followed by warming over the early Holocene. The sparse data available on early Holocene glaciation show that glaciers in southern Alaska were as extensive then as they were during the late Holocene. Early Holocene lake levels were low in interior Alaska, but moisture indicators show pronounced differences across the region. The highest frequency of both peatland and thaw-lake initiation ages also occurred during the early Holocene. During the middle Holocene (8.2-4.2 ka), glaciers retreated as the regional average temperature increased to a maximum between 7 and 5 ka, as reflected in most proxy types. Following the middle Holocene thermal maximum, temperatures decreased starting between 4 and 3 ka, signaling the onset of Neoglacial cooling. Glaciers in the Brooks and Alaska Ranges advanced to their maximum Holocene extent as lakes generally rose to modern levels. Temperature differences for averaged 500-year time steps typically ranged by 1-2 degrees C for individual records in the Arctic Holocene database, with a transition to a cooler late Holocene that was neither abrupt nor spatially coherent. The longest and highest-resolution terrestrial water isotope records previously interpreted to represent changes in the Aleutian low-pressure system around this time are here shown to be largely contradictory. Furthermore, there are too few records with sufficient resolution to identify sub-centennial-scale climate anomalies, such as the 8.2 ka event. The review concludes by suggesting some priorities for future paleoclimate research in the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability in dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]), natural organic matter (-NOM) weight average molecular weight and absorptivity at 280 nm (epsilon(280), an estimator of aromaticity) at McDonalds Branch, a first-order stream that is a fen wetland. When ground-water discharge to the stream was predominant, the [DOC], M-w and were all relatively low. When soil pore water represented an important contribution to streamflow, not only was the [DOC] higher, but also the M-w and Hence, the contribution of soil pore water relative to ground water controlled not only the concentration but also the average physicochemical characteristics of the NOM. Combined field and laboratory experiments suggested that preferential adsorption of higher M-w more aromatic NOM components to mineral surfaces, most likely within the lower soil horizons, resulted in a lower M-w more aliphatic ground-water NOM pool, This process ultimately affected surface water as ground water discharged to the lower reaches of the stream. Within the stream, higher molecular weight, more aromatic components were susceptible to photo-aggregation and photo-degradation, in the presence of Fe. Results from this small watershed study provide insight into climatic effects on surface-water NOM characteristics in a small freshwater fen. Low flow periods resulted in lower M-w more aliphatic NOM derived primarily from ground-water discharge to the stream, whereas higher flow periods resulted in a higher M-w (by 150-500 Da, i.e., increased by as much as 25%), more aromatic downstream surface-water NOM pool, Hence, during future summer drought periods, as suggested by climate-change models for much of North America, surface-water NOM likely will be lower molecular weight, more aliphatic, and more hydrophilic with lesser metal binding and hydrophobic organic carbon (HOC) uptake abilities [Environ. Sci, Technol, 34 (2000) 1103]. along with decreased ability to attenuate UV radiation. Because NOM plays an important role in attenuating UV radiation, research on climate-induced effects on aquatic ecosystems needs to consider not only decreases in NOM concentration and photochemistry but also hydrology-induced changes to the NOM physicochemical characteristics.

AB We report a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction since 6,650 cal. bp from the Lago San Martin area, from a peat-bog sequence, Mallin Paisano Desconocido, located at 48A degrees 58'S, 72A degrees 14'W. Between 6,650 and 4,500 cal. bp we can infer a shrub steppe dominated by Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae associated with other shrubs under relatively dry conditions, through an intensification of the westerly wind belt and a steepening in the west-east precipitation gradient. From 4,500 to 3,000 cal. bp a shrub-grass steppe development suggests a slight increase in moisture conditions although the environmental conditions remain dry. From 3,000 cal. bp a grass steppe represented by Poaceae and subordinate herbs developed, suggesting an increase in moisture availability and weaker westerly flow precipitation. The last 400 cal. bp were characterized by a change from grass to shrubby communities which could be related to the beginning of the Little Ice Age, whereas the last century shows signals of anthropic impact. The palaeoenvironmental interpretation from the Lago San Martin basin is based on moisture availability variations in relation to precipitation pattern changes of westerly origin. These trends are consistent with interpretations of records from the Andean and extra-Andean areas. The comparison with other sequences allows us to interpret the palaeoenvironmental changes in the Lago San Martin area and to integrate these variations within a regional framework, interpreting them in relation to southern past climatic changes. At a regional scale, the records show an increase in westerly intensity during the mid-Holocene, whereas weaker westerly flows are postulated for the late Holocene.

AB We quantified seasonal CO2 assimilation capacities for seven dominant vascular species in a wet boreal forest peatland then applied data to a land surface model parametrized to the site (ELM-SPRUCE) to test if seasonality in photosynthetic parameters results in differences in simulated plant responses to elevated CO2 and temperature. We collected seasonal leaf-level gas exchange, nutrient content and stand allometric data from the field-layer community (i.e., Maianthemum trifolium (L.) Sloboda), understory shrubs (Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron and Judd, Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench., Kalmia polifolia Wangenh. and Vaccinium angustifolium Alton.) and overstory trees (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P. and Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch). We found significant interspecific seasonal differences in specific leaf area, nitrogen content (by area; N-a) and photosynthetic parameters (i.e., maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax25 degrees C), electron transport (J(max25 degrees C)) and dark respiration (R-d25 degrees C)), but minimal correlation between foliar N-a and V-cmax25 degrees C, J(max25 degrees C) or R-d25 degrees C, which illustrates that nitrogen alone is not a good correlate for physiological processes such as Rubisco activity that can change seasonally in this system. ELM-SPRUCE was sensitive to the introduction of observed interspecific seasonality in V-cmax25 degrees C, J(max25 degrees C) and R-d25 degrees C, leading to simulated enhancement of net primary production (NPP) using seasonally dynamic parameters as compared with use of static parameters. This pattern was particularly pronounced under simulations with higher temperature and elevated CO2, suggesting a key hypothesis to address with future empirical or observational studies as climate changes. Inclusion of species-specific seasonal photosynthetic parameters should improve estimates of boreal ecosystem-level NPP, especially if impacts of seasonal physiological ontogeny can be separated from seasonal thermal acclimation.

AB In the winter-spring of 2001, South Florida experienced one of the worst droughts in its recorded history. Out of a myriad of ecological concerns identified during this time, the potential for catastrophic peat fire and negative impacts to wading bird reproduction emerged as critical issues. Water managers attempted to strike a balance between the environment and protection of water supplies for agriculture and urban interests. It became evident, however, that a broad-scale, integrated way to portray and prioritise ecological stress was lacking in the Florida Everglades, despite this being considered a necessary tool for addressing issues of environmental protection. In order to provide a framework for evaluating various water management operations using real-time information, we developed GIS-based indices of peat-fire risk and wading bird habitat suitability. These indices, based on real physical, chemical, and biological data, describe two ecological conditions that help define the physical and biological integrity of the Everglades. In addition to providing continuous, updated assessments throughout the drought period, we incorporated predictive models of water levels to evaluate how various water management alternatives might exacerbate or alleviate ecological stress during this time.

AB Varve counts with AMS C-14, Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of sediments (0-900 cm) from Erlongwan Maar Lake, NE China were used to establish a high-resolution chronology series for the late Quaternary. Dry density, total organic carbon (TOC) content, total nitrogen (TN) content, TOC/TN ratios and stable organic carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) ratios were continuously analyzed on this sediment profile. On the basis of lithological characters, sporo-pollen assemblages and geochemical analyses, we identified 6 climate stages within the last 14 ka BP. The time before the Holocene (14-11.4 ka BP) represents a higher-order oscillation climatic transitional period (I). The entire Holocene climate development (from 11.4 ka BP to present) exhibited an increasing temperature trend, although there were cold and warm alternations (II-VI). The periods included were: II (11.4-9.05 ka BP) warm-wet stage, III (9.05-7.4 ka BP) cold and warm fluctuation stage, IV (7.4-4.2 ka BP) smoothly warming climate stage, V (4.2-1.67 ka BP) climate optimum stage, and VI (from 1.67 ka BP to present) cool and drier stage. Each climate stage began with a warming event and ended with an abrupt cooling event. This climate change cycle had unequal time spaces that were progressively shorter over time. Several abrupt climate shifts occurred at about 9.4-9.05, 8.5-8.2, 7.8-7.4, 4.6-4.2, 3.7-3.25, 2-1.67 and 0.3-0.03 ka BP. Thus, it can be seen that the climate has been warming since 1920 AD, which indicates a new climate stage.

   SEDIMENTS; PETROLOGY; ORIGIN; REFLECTANCE; TEMPERATURE
AB Qualitative and quantitative coal petrological analyses have been undertaken on the laminated lignite at the base of the Cobham Lignite Bed, from Scalers Hill, Kent, England. The maximum negative carbon isotope excursion, which marks the beginning of the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), occurs near the top of the laminated lignite. The lignite contains inertinite, a petrographic term used to describe charcoal. The laminated lignite has inertinite-rich and inertinite-poor layers indicative of episodic fires and post-fire erosion. Charcoal clasts are derived from living or recently senesced plants and are dominated by the leaf stalks of herbaceous ferns and wood fragments from flowering plants. The charcoal assemblage reflects a low-diversity flora, possibly adapted to disturbance by fire, derived from a source vegetation subjected to seasonal surface wildfires. The environmental conditions leading up to and across the onset of the PETM are, therefore, interpreted as incorporating a persistent fire regime with episodic wildfires followed by rainfall and runoff events. Abundant charcoal indicates near-modern oxygen levels whereas the absence of charred peat in this area calls into question previous suggestions that burning of Palaeocene peats might have contributed to the short-lived negative carbon isotope excursion at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary.

AB Ireland provides a unique setting for the study of past climates, as its climate is dominated by westerly airflow from the North Atlantic and readily responsive to changes in North Atlantic circulation patterns. Although there has been substantial research on Ireland's past environments, quantitative palaeolimnological research, especially chironomid-based research, has been lacking. In order to further develop chironomid-based palaeolimnological investigations, a calibration set was constructed to determine the dominant environmental controls on modern chironomids in western Ireland. Chironomid subfossils were collected from surface sediments of 50 lakes. The lakes were characterised with 36 environmental variables, including physical attributes, lake water characteristics, lake sediment characteristics and land cover within each catchment. In this exploratory study, no specific environmental variable was targeted and lakes were chosen to span gradients of latitude, elevation, depth and trophic status. Redundancy analysis showed that six environmental variables-mean July air temperature, lake depth, dissolved organic carbon, and percentage catchment land cover of agriculture, peat bog and scrubland-captured a large and statistically significant portion of the variance in the chironomid data. July temperature and agricultural land cover were the most dominant environmental variables, with July temperature proving the most suitable for inference model development. A classical weighted-averaging model was developed to estimate July air temperature, with a coefficient of determination (r (jack) (2) ) of 0.60 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.57 A degrees C. Results suggest that summer temperature is the dominant influence on chironomid distribution across a wide variety of lake types, and the relatively small RMSEP should allow for more accurate reconstructions of Ireland's relatively subdued Holocene temperature fluctuations.

AB Measuring and modelling the efflux of greenhouse gases from soils is crucial for gauging ecosystem responses to climate and land-use change, and potential contributions and feedbacks to gas emissions. Upland soils with high amounts of organic matter can produce large effluxes of CH4 and potentially N2O, and therefore understanding the sensitivity of such fluxes to changes in climate (e.g. temperature) is of importance. Here we consider the role of shallow podzols in the temperature response of CH4 and N2O efflux using a simple laboratory incubation. Such soils have a shallow peat layer overlain by coarse organic matter, and by splitting and incubating these layers across a 1-30 degrees C temperature ramp, we observed a significant negative temperature response for both gases, and a gas-dependent effect on the presence of a between-layer difference. Given these observations, there is a need to consider the temperature sensitivity of near surface layers as distinct, and to recognise the potential for shallow podzols to have a strong source sink transition across temperature ranges.

AB Little is known about the terrestrial response of high-latitude Scandinavian vegetation to the warmer than-present climate of the late Pliocene (Piacenzian, 3.60-2.58 Ma). In order to assess Piacenzian terrestrial climate variability, we present the first high-resolution reconstruction of vegetation and climate change in northern Norway between 3.6 and 3.14 Ma. The reconstructions are derived from pollen assemblages in the marine sediments of ODP Hole 642B, Norwegian Sea (67 N). The palynological assemblages provide a unique record of latitudinal and altitudinal shifting of the forest boundaries, with vegetation alternating between cool temperate forest during warmer than -present intervals and boreal forest similar to today during cooler intervals. The northern boundary of the nemoral to boreonemoral forest zone was displaced at least 4-8 further north, and warmest-month temperatures were 614.5 C higher than at present during warm phases. Warm climatic conditions persisted during the earliest Piacenzian (ca. 3.6-3.47 Ma) with diverse cool temperate nemoral to boreonemoral forests growing in the lowlands of the Scandinavian mountains A distinct cooling event at ca. 3.47 Ma resulted in a southward shift of vegetation zones, leading to the predominance of boreal forest and the development of open, low alpine environments. The cooling culminated around 3.3 Ma, coinciding with Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2. Warmer climate conditions returned after ca. 3.29 Ma, with higher climate variability indicated by the repeated expansion of forests and peatlands during warmer and cooler periods, respectively. Climate progres- sively cooled after 3.18 Ma, resembling climatic conditions during MIS M2. A high variability of Norwegian vegetation and climate changes during the Piacenzian is superimposed on a long-term cooling trend. This cooling was accompanied by an expansion of Sphagnum peatlands that potentially contributed to the decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the end of the Piacenzian warm period and facilitated ice growth through positive vegetation snow albedo feedbacks. Correlations with other Northern Hemisphere vegetation records suggest hemisphere -wide effects of climate cooling.

AB To reconcile observations of decomposition rates, carbon inventories, and net primary production (NPP), we estimated long-term averages for C exchange in boreal forests near Thompson, Manitoba. Soil drainage as defined by water table, moss cover, and permafrost dynamics, is the dominant control on direct fire emissions. In upland forests, an average of about 10-30% of annual NPP was likely consumed by fire over the past 6500 years since these landforms and ecosystems were established. This longterm, average fire emission is much larger than has been accounted for in global C cycle models and may forecast an increase in fire activity for this region. While over decadal to century times these boreal forests may be acting as slight net sinks for C from the atmosphere to land, periods of drought and severe fire activity may result in net sources of C from these systems.

AB This paper focuses on palaeoenvironmental conditions and climate variability during the Upper Late Pleistocene (c. 28,000-11,700 cal BP) in SW Europe (Iberian Peninsula) and their influence on human settlement patterns. All the palaeoenvironmental and archaeological sequences available for this period are analysed, together with a new palaeoenvironmental study related to a key deposit: Verdeospesoa mire (northern Iberian Peninsula). The multiproxy analysis (pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, magnetic susceptibility, organic content and macrocharcoal) of this sequence, with the support of six Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates, shows the climatic variability of that period, with some dry/cold and humid/temperate episodes. While in vast regions of central and northern Europe very few archaeological sites of this age are known, in the Iberian Peninsula no occupation gaps have been detected in all this period, supporting the idea of SW Europe as a glacial refugium for human groups during the worst periods of the Upper Late Pleistocene.

AB As global temperatures rise, large amounts of carbon sequestered in permafrost are becoming available for microbial degradation. Accurate prediction of carbon gas emissions from thawing permafrost is limited by our understanding of these microbial communities. Here we use metagenomic sequencing of 214 samples from a permafrost thaw gradient to recover 1,529 metagenome-assembled genomes, including many from phyla with poor genomic representation. These genomes reflect the diversity of this complex ecosystem, with genus-level representatives for more than sixty per cent of the community. Meta-omic analysis revealed key populations involved in the degradation of organic matter, including bacteria whose genomes encode a previously undescribed fungal pathway for xylose degradation. Microbial and geochemical data highlight lineages that correlate with the production of greenhouse gases and indicate novel syntrophic relationships. Our findings link changing biogeochemistry to specific microbial lineages involved in carbon processing, and provide key information for predicting the effects of climate change on permafrost systems.

   HISTORY
AB Wildfire activity in early Paleogene greenhouse conditions can be used as an analogue to gauge the effect of future warming trends on wildfire in the current climate system. Inertinite (fossil charcoal in coal) from 11 autochthonous early Paleogene lignite seams from the Schoningen mine (Germany) was quantified using macerations, in situ pillars and industry standard crushed samples. A new three transect method was developed to quantify in situ charcoal. The combination of in situ pillars and crushed samples accounts for temporal and spatial variation in charcoal through a stratigraphically oriented pillar, whilst maintaining comparability with industry standards and previous work. Charcoal occurs as a range of randomly distributed particle sizes, indicating that fires were burning locally in the Schoningen peat-forming environment and in the surrounding areas, but according to petrological data, not in an episodic or periodic pattern. Although charcoal abundance is low (relative to previous high fire worlds such as the Cretaceous), three quantitative and semi-quantitative methods show increased wildfire activity (relative to the modern world) in the warmest parts of the early Paleogene. As atmospheric oxygen levels stabilised to modem values and precipitation and humidity became the main control on wildfire, increased rainfall followed by drier intervals would have created an environment rich in dry fuel in which wildfires could easily propagate if humidity was low enough. In the later part of the Early Eocene (Ypresian) charcoal abundance fell to levels similar to those found in modern peats. This indicates that the transition to the modern low fire world occurred within the Early Eocene, earlier than previous records suggest. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Peat wetlands have widely been considered the carbon storage warehouse of the world and contribute to mitigating the global greenhouse effect. Nevertheless, this stored carbon and other greenhouse gasses are slowly being released into the atmosphere as the world's average temperature rises, leading to an even faster rise in temperature. CO2 management in the Zoige Wetland of the Tibetan Plateau, the largest alpine peat wetland in the world, was estimated as a focal ecosystem service. Knowing landscape changes as the combined expression of social, economic, and natural factors, we firstly analyzed the effects of landscape change on CO2 emissions during 1980-2005 with a comprehensive consideration of the area and the corresponding emission rate of both water-covered areas and non-water-covered areas. A comparison with baseline emission data showed enhanced eco-environment protection of the Zoige Wetland helped reduce emissions of CO2 during 1990-2000 and 2005. Then we developed a principal component analysis method to analyze how CO2 emissions were influenced by human-social factors and natural factors, showing human-social factors cause most of the natural CO2 emissions in the Zoige Wetland. Finally we accounted the ecosystem service valuation of CO2 management by using a mandatory CO2 trade price in China. It indicated that CO2 reductions in 2005 were valued at 588.90 x 10(4) CNY (95.8 x 10(4) USD), and it needed about 20 years for the Zoige Wetland ecosystem to recover after disturbance.

AB Negative carbon-isotope excursions have been comprehensively studied in the stratigraphic record but the discussion of causal mechanisms has largely overlooked the potential role of biomass burning. The carbon-isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of vegetation, soil organic matter and peat are significantly lower than atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and thereby provide a source of low C-13 CO2 when combusted. In this study, the potential role of biomass burning to generate negative carbon isotope excursions associated with greenhouse climates is modeled. Results indicate that major peat combustion sustained for 1000 yr increases atmospheric CO2 from 2.5x present atmospheric levels (PAL) to 4.6x PAL, and yields a pronounced negative delta C-13 excursion in the atmosphere (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand), vegetation (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand) and the surface ocean (similar to 1.2 parts per thousand), but not for the deep ocean (similar to 0.9 parts per thousand). Release Of CO2 initiates a short-term warming of the atmosphere (up to 14.4 degrees C, with a duration of 1628 yr), which is consistent with the magnitude and length of an observed Toarcian excursion event. These results indicate that peat combustion is a plausible mechanism for driving negative delta C-13 excursions in the rock record, even during times of elevated rho CO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Concern about depletion of fossil fuels, energy dependency and climate change have engendered the necessity to develop reliable, affordable and renewable energy sources like biomass fuels. A CFD model was developed to predict gaseous emissions from combustion of a Biomass Fuel (peat) and compared to diesel fuel in a furnace combustion chamber. The model was established based on the equations of mass, momentum, species and energy equations. Boundary conditions which included walls, axis, and mass flow inlet and pressure outlet were defined for each of the zones. According to the results, both of the fuels react immediately after the combustion begins. In this research, it was observed that oxygen mass fraction of the peat combustion process is higher than that of diesel fuel combustion in the furnace chamber because of more oxygen content in the molecular structure of biomass fuel. In fact, oxygen content in the molecular structure of biomass fuel increases the quantity of O-2 available in the reactants of which resulted in higher O-2 mass fraction of biomass fuel in the combustion chamber. Also, the gas temperature of diesel is higher than that of biomass fuel due to the higher heating values of diesel fuel and higher moisture content of biomass fuel. The results indicated NOx, carbon dioxide and soot emissions from combustion were lower than that of diesel combustion. But biomass combustion produces higher SO2 emissions than diesel fuel combustion. Besides, results showed that the quantity of emissions is closely related to combustion temperature, molecular structure and fuel characteristics.

AB Global change is disproportionately affecting cold environments (polar and high elevation regions), with potentially negative impacts on microbial diversity and functional processes. In most cold environments the combination of low temperatures, and physical stressors, such as katabatic wind episodes and limited water availability result in biotic systems, which are in trophic terms very simple and primarily driven by microbial communities. Metagenomic approaches have provided key insights on microbial communities in these systems and how they may adapt to stressors and contribute towards mediating crucial biogeochemical cycles. Here we review, the current knowledge regarding edaphic-based microbial diversity and functional processes in Antarctica, and the Artic. Such insights are crucial and help to establish a baseline for understanding the impact of climate change on Polar Regions.

AB The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the term palustrine wetland to describe vegetated wetlands traditionally identified as marsh, bog, fen, swamp, or wet meadow. Landsat TM imagery was combined with image texture and ancillary environmental data to model probabilities of palustrine wetland occurrence in Yellowstone National Park using classification trees. Model training and test locations were identified from National Wetlands inventory maps, and classification trees were built for seven years spanning a range of annual precipitation. At a coarse level, palustrine wetland was separated from upland. At a finer level, five palustrine wetland types were discriminated: aquatic bed (PAB), emergent (PEM), forested (PFO), scrub-shrub (PSS), and unconsolidated shore (PUS). TM-derived variables alone were relatively accurate at separating wetland from upland, but model error rates dropped incrementally as image texture, DEM-derived terrain variables, and other ancillary GIS layers were added. For classification trees making use of all available predictors, average overall test error rates were 7.8% for palustrine wetland/upland models and 17.0% for palustrine wetland type models, with consistent accuracies across years. However, models were prone to wetland over-prediction. While the predominant PEM class was classified with omission and commission error rates less than 14%, we had difficulty identifying the PAB and PSS classes. Ancillary vegetation information greatly improved PSS classification and moderately improved PFO discrimination. Association with geothermal areas distinguished PUS wetlands. Wetland over-prediction was exacerbated by class imbalance in likely combination with spatial and spectral limitations of the TM sensor. Wetland probability surfaces may be more informative than hard classification, and appear to respond to climate-driven wetland variability. The developed method is portable, relatively easy to implement, and should be applicable in other settings and over larger extents. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There are few palaeoenvironmental data from the Indo-Chinese peninsula that document environmental and climatic conditions prior to the Holocene. This study of pollen and spores from a small peat-swamp in north-east Thailand provides a record of vegetation change covering ca. 40,000 years B.P. (Before Present). These data indicate that the region supported a Fagaceous-Coniferous forest, similar to contemporary vegetation described from south-west China. Climatic conditions were cooler and probably drier than present day climates in Thailand. Levels of biomass burning are relatively high throughout this period. Tropical broad-leaf deciduous forest becomes dominant at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary with the fragmentation of Fagaceous-Coniferous forest in response to increased temperatures.

AB Region 2 comprises arctic and subarctic North America and is underlain by continuous or discontinuous permafrost. Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4 degrees C in summer and 9 degrees C in winter for a 2 x CO? scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of >1 degrees C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warning would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive, Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America.
   There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wetland loss and climate change are known to alter regional and global methane (CH4) budgets. Over the last six decades, an extensive area of marshland has been converted to cropland on the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China, and a significant increase in air temperature has also been observed there, while the impacts on regional CH4 budgets remain uncertain. Through model simulation, we estimated the changes in CH4 emissions associated with the conversion of marshland to cropland and climate change in this area. Model simulations indicated a significant reduction of 1.1 Tg yr(-1) (0.7-1.8 Tg yr(-1)) from the 1950s to the 2000s in regional CH4 emissions. The cumulative reduction of CH4 from 1960 to 2009 was estimated to be similar to 36 Tg (24-57 Tg) relative to the 1950s, and marshland conversion and the climate contributed 86% and 14% of this change, respectively. Interannual variation in precipitation (linear trend with P > 0.2) contributed to yearly fluctuations in CH4 emissions, but the relatively lower amount of precipitation over the period 1960-2009 (47mmyr(-1) lower on average than in the 1950s) contributed similar to 91% of the reduction in the areaweighted CH4 flux. Global warming at a rate of 0.3 degrees per decade (P < 0.001) has increased CH4 emissions significantly since the 1990s. Relative to the mean of the 1950s, the warming-induced increase in the CH4 flux has averaged 19 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the last two decades. In the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 scenarios of the fifth IPCC assessment report (AR5), the CH4 fluxes are predicted to increase by 36 %, 52 %, 78% and 95 %, respectively, by the 2080s compared to 1961-1990 in response to climate warming and wetting.

AB Oxygen isotope palaeoclimate records, preserved in moss tissue cellulose, are complicated by environmental influences on the relationships between source water inputs and evaporative conditions. We carried out stable isotope analyses of precipitation collected from the maritime Antarctic and cellulose extracted from co-located Chorisodontium aciphyllum dominated moss peat bank deposits accumulated since 1870 A. D. Analyses of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of summer precipitation on Signy Island (60.7 degrees S, 45.6 degrees W) established a local meteoric water line (LMWL) similar to both the global MWL and other LMWLs, and almost identical to the HadAM3 isotope-enabled global circulation model output. The oxygen isotopic composition of cellulose (delta O-18(C)) revealed little temporal variation between four moss peat banks on Signy Island since 1870. However, delta O-18(C) followed two patterns with Sites A and D consistently 3 parts per thousand enriched relative to delta O-18(C) values from Sites B and C. The growing moss surfaces at Sites A and D are likely to have been hydrated by isotopically heavier summer precipitation, whilst at Sites B and C, the moss banks are regularly saturated by the isotopically depleted snow melt streams. Laboratory experiments revealed that evaporative enrichment of C. aciphyllum moss leaf water by 5 parts per thousand occurred rapidly following saturation (ecologically equivalent to post-rainfall or snow melt periods). In addition to the recognized source water-cellulose fractionation extent of 27 +/- 3 parts per thousand, such a shift would account for the 32 parts per thousand difference measured between delta O-18 of Signy Island precipitation and cellulose.

AB The Little River (LR) in southern Georgia, U.S., has experienced lengthening droughts since monitoring began in 1972. We evaluated the impacts of drought on riverine carbon cycling using a 9year data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) coupled with laboratory experiments in the LR, as well as long-term data sets in three additional rivers within the Suwannee River basin. Longer drought periods reduced downstream DOC export but also led to higher DOC concentrations in the following hydroperiod. Within a hydroperiod, DOC concentration was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with river discharge but also negatively correlated with total discharge during the previous hydroperiod. Among hydroperiods, DOC concentration was more strongly correlated with antecedent hydrological conditions than with current hydrological conditions across broad spatial scales: in three additional rivers within the Suwannee River basin (Alapaha, Withlacoochee, and Okapilco) and in headwater and downstream reaches of the LR. Microbial DOC consumption and CO2 production were elevated when DOC concentration was high. Despite dramatic hydrologic changes, DOC composition appeared stable, with optical analyses suggesting that LR DOC is primarily composed of three terrestrial humic-like fluorescence groups. If the current climatic trend of intensifying droughts, elevated temperatures and decreased discharge continue, our results suggest the net effect may be for a more localized riverine carbon cycle with reduced downstream transport of DOC, but higher local mineralization rates due to elevated DOC concentrations.

AB Coastal wetlands, well recognized for their ecosystem services, have faced many threats throughout the USA and elsewhere. While managers require good information on the net impact of these combined stressors on wetlands, little such information exists. We conducted a 4-month mesocosm study to analyze the multiple stressor effects of precipitation changes, sea level rise, and eutrophication on the salt marsh plant Spartina alterniflora. Pots containing plants in an organic soil matrix were positioned in tanks and received Narragansett Bay (RI, USA) water. The study simulated three precipitation levels (ambient daily rain, biweekly storm, and drought), three levels of tidal inundations (high (15 cm below mean high water (MHW)), mean (MHW), and low (15 cm above MHW)), and two nutrient enrichment levels (unenriched and nutrient-enriched bay water). Our results demonstrate that storm and drought stressors led to significantly less above- and belowground biomass than those in ambient rain conditions. Plants that were flooded at high inundation had less belowground biomass, fine roots, and shoots. Nutrients had no detectable effect on aboveground biomass, but the enriched pots had higher stem counts and more fine roots than unenriched pots, in addition to greater CO2 emission rates; however, the unenriched pots had significantly more coarse roots and rhizomes, which help to build peat in organogenic marshes. These results suggest that multiple stressors of altered precipitation, sea level rise, and nutrient enrichment would lead to reduced marsh sustainability.

AB PALADYN is presented; it is a new comprehensive and computationally efficient land surface-vegetation-carbon cycle model designed to be used in Earth system models of intermediate complexity for long-term simulations and paleoclimate studies.
   The model treats in a consistent manner the interaction between atmosphere, terrestrial vegetation and soil through the fluxes of energy, water and carbon. Energy, water and carbon are conserved. PALADYN explicitly treats permafrost, both in physical processes and as an important carbon pool. It distinguishes nine surface types: five different vegetation types, bare soil, land ice, lake and ocean shelf. Including the ocean shelf allows the treatment of continuous changes in sea level and shelf area associated with glacial cycles. Over each surface type, the model solves the surface energy balance and computes the fluxes of sensible, latent and ground heat and upward shortwave and longwave radiation. The model includes a single snow layer.
   Vegetation and bare soil share a single soil column. The soil is vertically discretized into five layers where prognostic equations for temperature, water and carbon are consistently solved. Phase changes of water in the soil are explicitly considered. A surface hydrology module computes precipitation interception by vegetation, surface runoff and soil infiltration. The soil water equation is based on Darcy's law. Given soil water content, the wetland fraction is computed based on a topographic index. The temperature profile is also computed in the upper part of ice sheets and in the ocean shelf soil.
   Photosynthesis is computed using a light use efficiency model. Carbon assimilation by vegetation is coupled to the transpiration of water through stomatal conductance. PALADYN includes a dynamic vegetation module with five plant functional types competing for the grid cell share with their respective net primary productivity.
   PALADYN distinguishes between mineral soil carbon, peat carbon, buried carbon and shelf carbon. Each soil carbon type has its own soil carbon pools generally represented by a litter, a fast and a slow carbon pool in each soil layer. Carbon can be redistributed between the layers by vertical diffusion and advection. For the vegetated macro surface type, decomposition is a function of soil temperature and soil moisture. Carbon in permanently frozen layers is assigned a long turnover time which effectively locks carbon in permafrost. Carbon buried below ice sheets and on flooded ocean shelves is treated differently. The model also includes a dynamic peat module.
   PALADYN includes carbon isotopes C-13 and C-14, which are tracked through all carbon pools. Isotopic discrimination is modelled only during photosynthesis.
   A simple methane module is implemented to represent methane emissions from anaerobic carbon decomposition in wetlands (including peatlands) and flooded ocean shelf.
   The model description is accompanied by a thorough model evaluation in offline mode for the present day and the historical period.

AB The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. This impacts Arctic species both directly, through increased temperatures, and indirectly, through structural changes in their habitats. Species are expected to exhibit idiosyncratic responses to structural change, which calls for detailed investigations at the species and community level. Here, we investigate how arthropod assemblages of spiders and beetles respond to variation in habitat structure at small spatial scales. We sampled transitions in shrub dominance and soil moisture between three different habitats (fen, dwarf shrub heath, and tall shrub tundra) at three different sites along a fjord gradient in southwest Greenland, using yellow pitfall cups. We identified 2,547 individuals belonging to 47 species. We used species richness estimation, indicator species analysis and latent variable modeling to examine differences in arthropod community structure in response to habitat variation at local (within site) and regional scales (between sites). We estimated species responses to the environment by fitting species-specific generalized linear models with environmental covariates. Species assemblages were segregated at the habitat and site level. Each habitat hosted significant indicator species, and species richness and diversity were significantly lower in fen habitats. Assemblage patterns were significantly linked to changes in soil moisture and vegetation height, as well as geographic location. We show that meter-scale variation among habitats affects arthropod community structure, supporting the notion that the Arctic tundra is a heterogeneous environment. To gain sufficient insight into temporal biodiversity change, we require studies of species distributions detailing species habitat preferences.

AB We reconstructed the late Holocene vegetation of the Nain region (northern Labrador, northeastern Canada) in order to assess the influence of climate and historic land use on past shifts in forest composition. Chronostratigraphy was used in combination with macrofossil and pollen data from monoliths sampled from four peatlands. Paleoecological reconstructions produced a vegetation history spanning 4900 years for the Nain region that is largely concordant with other studies in Labrador. An initial open forest tundra phase was followed by an increase in tree cover at around 2800 cal yr BP. Paludification began similar to 200 cal yr BP. A decline in Picea and its subsequent disappearance from most of the sites occurred similar to 170 cal yr BP (AD 1780) in a period of relatively mild conditions during the Little Ice Age. This event was followed by the establishment of Larix laricina in the region. Local anthropogenic factors are likely responsible for these later developments, as they were not observed in other regional studies. The period around AD 1780 corresponds to the establishment of the Moravian missionaries on the Labrador coast, which increased the need for fuel and lumber. We conclude that changes in land use are reflected in the patterns of vegetation and hydrological change at the study sites. (C) 2016 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Due to rising temperatures worldwide many areas are threatened with increasing numbers of fire occurrence. Poland is among these areas and is projected to experience over the next century an increase in both heat stress and wildfire activity with the potential to turn its fire-resistant forests into fire-prone forests. This paper aims to provide an introduction to the conditions favourable to fire occurrence in Poland, summarising the research on sedimentary charcoal analysis and reviewing fire reconstructions based on natural archives from Poland. Here, natural wildfires occurred at the beginning of the Holocene but, due to changes in climate (wetter summers) and vegetation after 6550 BC, the main trigger of fire occurrence became human activity, mainly as a result of forest clearance for agrarian purposes. However, there is evidence that prolonged droughts also triggered wildfires. Over recent decades, according to existing data, arson (44.85%) and negligence (34.43%) have been the most common causes of fire occurrence in Poland.

AB Questions Which environmental variables are most important in determining plant species composition in subarctic springs? Do observed patterns differ between typical wetland and general matrix-derived species? Location Helocrenic (seepage) springs, Northern Norway. Methods We sampled 49 helocrenic spring sites, measuring environmental variables (water temperature, water pH, electrical conductivity, discharge volume, geographic position) and recording all species present. We performed a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA) to determine the relative importance of water quality, spatial, and climatic variables for patterns in species composition and to compare the differences in these patterns between wetland and matrix-derived species. Results We found that climatic and water quality variables were almost equally important in determining species composition in subarctic springs, with climatic variables explaining 26.62% of variation in species composition and water quality variables explaining 26.14%. Spatial variables explained the least variation (21.53%). When looking at the variables individually, altitude (10.93%) and mean summer temperature (9.25%) explained the most variation. The trend was the same for matrix-derived species and wetland species, with climatic variables explaining the most variation (matrix-derived: 27.26%; wetland: 24.42%), followed by water quality (matrix-derived: 26.40%; wetland: 24.13%) and spatial variables (matrix-derived: 24.87%; wetland: 16.27%). The main difference between matrix-derived species and typical wetland species was that the spatial variables explained less variation for wetland species. Conclusions The close relationship of species composition (total vegetation as well as separated into wetland and matrix-derived species) with climatic and water quality conditions indicates a sensitivity of subarctic springs to future climate change. In combination with altitude, which was found to be the most important individual variable, it is likely that the future distribution of spring species tracking climate change will be limited by the occurrence of suitable spring habitats, especially at high altitudes.

AB The potential impacts of interactions of multiple climate change factors in soil ecosystems have received little attention. Most studies have addressed effects of single factors such as increased temperature Or atmospheric CO2 but little is known about how such environmental factors will interact. In the present study we investigate the effects of in situ exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, increased temperatures and prolonged drought episodes on field communities of Enchytraeidae (Oligochaeta) in a dry heathland (Brandbjerg, Denmark). Increased CO2 had a positive effect on enchytraeid biomass, whereas drought significantly reduced it. Elevated temperature did not result in any detectable effects. No interactions between the three factors were observed. Interestingly, the positive effect of increased CO2 and the negative effect of drought were cancelled out when applied in combination. Thus, in the combined drought and CO2 treatment, and when additionally combined with increased temperature, the total biomass of enchytraeids was similar to those in the ambient plots. The positive effect of increased CO2 seemed to be influenced by season, as the response was most pronounced during summer, and less so in autumn. The impact of the drought was more consistent, with enchytraeids reduced at all sampling occasions. Moreover, the negative effect of drought seemed to depend on the inter-annual variability of precipitation. The year with a dry summer and autumn (2006) showed a stronger impact of drought on the enchytraeids, compared to the year with a wet summer and autumn (2007). Our study emphasises the importance of multi-factorial experimental design as a means to investigate effects of climatic changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Elemental (C, N, Pb) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) measurements of cored sediment from a small bog in northern New Mexico reveal changes in climate during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Abrupt increases in Pb concentration and delta C-13 values ca. 14 420 cal. YBP indicate significant runoff to the shallow lake that existed at that time. Weathering and transport of local volcanic rocks resulted in the delivery of Pb-bearing minerals to the basin, while a C-13-enriched terrestrial vegetation source increased the delta C-13 values of the sedimentary material. Wet conditions developed over a 300 a period and lasted for a few hundred years. The Younger Dryas period (ca. 12 700-11 500 cal. YBP) caused a reduction in terrestrial productivity reflected in decreasing C/N values, delta N-15 values consistently greater than 0 parts per thousand and low organic content. By contrast, aquatic productivity increased during the second half of this period, evidenced by increasing delta C-13 values at the time of highest abundance of algae. Dry conditions ca. 8000-6 000 cal. YBP were characterised by low organic carbon content and high Pb concentrations, the latter suggesting enhanced erosion and aeolian transport of volcanic rock. The range in delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values in the sedimentary record fall within the range of modern plants, except during the periods of runoff and drought. The sedimentary record provides evidence of natural climate variability in northern New Mexico, including short- (multi-centennial) and long-(millennial) term episodes during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.

AB We review the main effects of sea level rise, salinity changes, and human disturbances on mangrove forest dynamics. The effects of these drivers on mangrove communities are evaluated at centennial time scales in the light of six palynological records from the Colombian Caribbean. Despite the accelerated rates of sea level rise, increases in sea surface and air temperatures, and decreases in precipitation of the last two centuries, mangroves have shown an increasing representation in pollen records at continental and marine locations of the region. In continental settings, such expansions have been related to the offsetting of sea levels by the increasing loads of fluvial sediments since 1850 AD, and by increases in autochthonous peat accumulation in San Andres Island. Losses of mangrove cover in the past have been related to coastal erosion, regional droughts, and salinity increases. Such processes have commonly caused mangrove die-off or changes in forest species composition. When the substrate has become more saline, or sand sedimentation has increased significantly, the composition of mangrove communities has switched towards the dominance of Avicennia germinans at expenses of Rhizophora mangle. Resprout capacity of damaged stems of Avicennia germinans seems to have been the trait that has allowed this species to increase after strong and prolonged droughts, and occurrence of strong winds, tropical storms, and hurricanes. Human disturbances are represented either by the expansion of Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia germinans and decreases of Rhizophora mangle, or by mangrove replacement by herbaceous vegetation (grasses or crops), especially the fern Acrostichum aureum. Around 1850 AD, mangroves and beach vegetation were replaced by coconut plantations in San Andres Island, and in the Cispata bay swampy areas were covered with rice crops. Although after 1900 AD these crops were abandoned because of a marine incursion, Laguncularia racemosa has prevailed so far indicating pervasive anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Understanding how species abundances vary in space and time is a central theme in ecology, yet there are few long-term field studies of terrestrial invertebrate abundances and the determinants of their dynamics. This is particularly relevant in the context of rapid climate change occurring in the Arctic. Arthropods can serve as strong indicators of ecosystem change due to their sensitivity to increasing temperatures and other environmental variables. We used spider samples collected by pitfall trapping from three different habitats (fen, mesic and arid heath) in High-Arctic Greenland to assess changes in individual species abundances over an 18-year period (1996-2014). We calculated annual abundances of each species using a conventional method and compared this to a technique that corrected for the influence of short-term weather variation on arthropod activity. The latter method used the area under the curve of a fitted generalized additive model to measure annual change in abundance of each species. Abundances calculated using each of the two methods did not differ greatly over time nor in direction of climate effects, suggesting that short-term weather-driven activity does not influence interpretation of long-term trends. We used model selection to determine which climatic variables and/or previous years' abundance best explained annual variation in species abundances over this period. We identified and used 28 566 adult spiders that comprised eight species. Most notably, the abundances of some species (Collinsia thulensis and Erigone psychrophila) have declined during this 18-year period, in response to rising temperatures and snow depth dynamics, which affected snowmelt timing and moisture availability. No species increased in abundance through the study period. Since some species showed no trend in abundance through time and climatic effects were habitat-specific, continued climate change may also affect local species interactions. Long-term monitoring programmes are an extremely valuable means through which to generate empirical data about changes in populations and communities; this is especially pertinent in the Arctic, where climate change is occurring at a rapid rate.

AB We measured the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange with the eddy covariance (EC) method through three winters above a cultivated peat soil. During the first winter, the soil was ploughed, while for the next two winters it was grass-covered. On a weekly timescale, the emission was controlled by the soil temperature, whereas the vegetation had no clear impact. The deeper soil temperatures better correlated with the CO2 efflux, especially in frozen soil. The correlation with the air temperature was poor. After a mid-winter snowmelt, decreased CO2 efflux rates were temporarily detected, probably resulting from a lowered diffusion of CO) from the soil air into the atmosphere. Moderate soil-thaw CO pulses were observed in the springs of 2001 and 2003. CO2 emission rates measured with the EC method were found to be significantly lower as compared to those measured with the chamber method. The cumulative CO, emission between December and mid-March ranged from 80 to 178 m(-2) during three winters, correlating positively with air and soil temperatures and the number of snow-free days during that period. The projected increase in the air temperature related to global warming would boost the wintertime CO) efflux at our site by 30-200% (35-114 g m(-2)), depending on the selected emission scenario.

AB Needles, wood and pollen of Larix, recorded in a peat deposit from Kotelny Island, northern Siberia, indicate the local occurrence of larch around 38 000 cal. a BP, which is during the Middle Pleniglacial (Greenland Inter-stadial 8) of the Weichselian last glacial period. The pollen record, dominated by Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Betula, Alnus, Salix and Artemisia, indicates steppe-tundra conditions with some shrubs and trees. The distribution of Larix species plays an important role in the reconstruction of climatic conditions during the Weichselian in Siberia. Nowadays Larix does not occur on Kotelny Island and in the present situation the temperature may not be the limiting factor for Larix, but instead the long, snowy winters and the moist tundra vegetation. Our data may contribute to a better understanding of Larix refugia and Weichselian climatic conditions in northern Siberia.

AB Questions Is there evidence for biotic homogenization of upland vegetation? Do the magnitude and nature of floristic and compositional change vary between vegetation types? What can be inferred about the drivers responsible for the observed changes? Location Upland heath, mire and grassland communities of the northwest Highlands of Scotland, UK. Methods We re-survey plots first described in a phytosociological study of 19561958 to assess the changes in plant species composition over the last 50 yr in five major upland vegetation types. Using a combination of multivariate analysis, dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and published data on species attributes; we quantify, characterize and link potential drivers of environmental change with the observed changes in species composition. Results Grassland and heath vegetation declined in species richness and variation in community composition, while mires showed little change. Previously distinct vegetation types became more similar in composition, characterized by the increased dominance of generalist upland graminoids and reduced dwarf-shrub, forb and lichen cover, although novel assemblages were not apparent. Species with an oceanic distribution increased at the expense of those with an arctic-montane distribution. Temperature, precipitation and acidity were found to be potentially important in explaining changes in species composition: species that had undergone the greatest increases had a preference for warmer, drier and more acidic conditions. Conclusions The vegetation of the northwest Scottish Highlands has undergone marked biotic homogenization over the last 50 yr, manifested through a loss of various aspects of diversity at the local, community and landscape scales. The magnitude of change varies between vegetation types, although the nature of change shows many similar characteristics. Analyses of species attributes suggest these changes are driven by climate warming and acidification, although over-grazing may also be important. This study highlights the importance of the link between the loss of plant diversity and homogenization at multiple scales, and demonstrates that boreal heath communities are particularly at risk from these processes.

AB Thermokarst ponds are widespread in arctic and subarctic regions, but little is known about their temporal evolution prior to human observations. This paper presents a pioneer biostratigraphic study conducted at a subarctic site with limnologically contrasted ponds located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, Canada. Fossil diatom and visible near infrared (VNIR) derivative spectral analyses were performed on short sediment cores, confirming the occurrence of three distinct stratigraphic facies as already inferred from an anterior sedimentological study: a lacustrine upper facies (UF) and a marine lower facies (LF), separated by an organic-rich/peat transitional zone (TZ). Diatoms were almost absent from LF, but increased significantly in both TZ and UF. Identified diatom taxa were mainly benthic species (e.g. genera Fragilaria, Pinnularia), and their down-core distribution appeared to be related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and possibly pH conditions. Diatom-inferred DOC showed a decreasing trend towards the surface (potentially associated with an increase in pH), inverse to the general trend in this region, suggesting the action of other mechanisms on DOC, such as exhaustion of external inputs from limited catchments and the role of discontinuous peat layers (former surfaces of permafrost mounds) during the initial stages of pond formation. These bryophilous substrates in aerophilic habitats probably controlled diatom community composition. The combination of diatom and VNIR data revealed similar trends between (i) opal (amorphous silica) and diatom abundances; (ii) eukaryotic/prokaryotic algae ratio and anoxia or hypoxia in bottom waters; and (iii) limonite (iron oxide) and redox conditions in surface sediments. These findings indicate that diatom community changes and pond limnological evolution in the recent past were controlled mainly by autogenic processes (e.g. local vegetation/soil development, peat accumulation and erosion), rather than by allogenic forcing mechanisms (e.g. precipitation and temperature, geochemical leaching of the surrounding glaciomarine sediments).

AB 1 To explore the role of edaphic controls in the response of arctic tundra to climate change, we analysed Holocene pollen records from lakes in northern Alaska located on glaciated surfaces with contrasting soil texture, topography and tundra communities. Using indicator taxa, pollen accumulation rates (PARs) and multivariate comparison of fossil and modern pollen assemblages, we reconstructed the vegetational changes at Upper Capsule Lake (Sagavanirktok surface) and Red Green Lake (Itkillik II surface) in response to increased effective moisture between the early and middle Holocene.
   2 In the Red Green record, low PARs and the continuous presence of taxa indicative of prostrate-shrub tundra (PST; Equisetum, Polypodiaceae, Thalictrum and Rosaceae) indicate that the vegetation resembled PST throughout the Holocene. During the warm, dry early Holocene (11 300-10 000 cal years BP), PST also occurred on Sagavanirktok surfaces, as evidenced by PST indicators (Bryidae, Polypodiaceae, Equisetum and Rosaceae) in this interval of the Upper Capsule record. However, PARs increased, suggesting increased vegetation cover, PST taxa declined and taxa indicative of dwarf-shrub tundra (DST; Rubus chamaemorus and Lycopodium annotinum) increased between 10 000 and 7500 cal years BP.
   3 We hypothesize that between the early and middle Holocene the fine-textured soils and smooth topography of Sagavanirktok surfaces led to increased soil moisture, greater vegetation cover, permafrost aggradation, anoxic and acidic soil conditions, slower decomposition and the development of a thick organic layer. In contrast, soil moisture remained low on the better-drained Itkillik II surface, and vegetational changes were minor.
   4 Landscape-scale substrate variations have an effect on how tundra responds to climate change, suggesting that the response of arctic ecosystems to future variability may be spatially heterogeneous.

AB This paper presents a history of the vegetation in Lake Purwin (NE Poland) and its catchment along with water level changes for the last 8600 cal. BP. The reconstructions are based on a high-resolution plant macroremains analysis and the stable isotope record in authigenic carbonates, a fine fraction that is precipitated within the epilimnion of the lake. The stable isotope records suggest that the lake had throughflow during the Holocene and that isotope data can therefore be used in palaeoclimatic reconstructions. The d delta O-18 values record the thermal maximum of the Holocene and the subsequent cooling of the upper Holocene. Water level changes and the history of the lake's productivity are both recorded in the delta C-13 values. A chronology is established using radiocarbon dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils. The vegetation and water levels in Lake Purwin reflect regional climate changes. The combination of the lithology along the sedimentary sequence, the results of the plant macroremains analysis and the isotope data allowed several alternating periods of high (8600-7300, 6500-5200, 4400-3500, and 3000 -950 cal. BP) and low (7300-6500, 5200-4400, 3500-3000 and 950 to -59 cal. BP) water stands to be distinguished in Lake Purwin. Low water levels are indicated by sediments that are enriched in coarse plant detritus, seeds of Rubus ideaus, fruits of Uritca dioica and more macroremains of Alnus glutinosa and rushes.

AB It is widely appreciated that management shapes the dynamics of many ecological systems, but ecologists rarely consider the reverse interaction, that is, the ecological influences on management decisions. Reciprocal feedback between management and ecology can cause complex system behaviour. Therefore, better predictions about how external policy-drivers or climate change will affect semi-natural ecosystems may be made when both the ecological and human dimensions are considered.
   We develop a spatially-explicit model of moorland vegetation dynamics and management decisions about sheep grazing and heather burning in the Peak District National Park, UK. Competition between dwarf shrubs, bracken and graminoids is mediated by grazing, dwarf shrub age (determined by burning rotation) and environmental gradients. Management decisions depend on vegetation cover in a model parameterized through interviews with upland managers.
   Current management regimes are designed to reverse historical dwarf shrub losses, and simulations suggest that this reversal should occur in the future. After equilibration, grazing densities fall and dwarf shrubs have expanded from their current distribution, mainly at the expense of graminoids. This causes more land to come under managed burning, but current intensities are maintained.
   Enforcing winter or summer grazing densities influences model vegetation cover and causes other aspects of the management strategy to adapt. For example, when summer grazing is banned, dwarf shrub cover increases and there is a shift towards grouse moor management.
   Simulations with warmer temperatures indicate that climate change may increase bracken invasion of the moorland and prevent re-vegetation of bare peat. This is associated with a reduction in managed burning that causes the dwarf shrub community to become dominated by the older, degenerate growth phase.
   Synthesis and applications. Our model suggests that current management paradigms could achieve their aim of restoring historically degraded moorland over the coming century, but that climate change may prevent this from occurring. One application of the model would be to try to design management paradigms that are robust to this. As such, models of coupled human-natural systems can provide a valuable tool for assessing the impacts of policy decisions and climate change on semi-natural ecosystems at landscape scales.

AB According to the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), emissions must be cut by 41-72% below 2010 levels by 2050 for a likely chance of containing the global mean temperature increase to 2 degrees C. The AFOLU sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) contributes roughly a quarter (similar to 10-12 Pg CO2 e yr(-1)) of the net anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation, fire, wood harvesting, and agricultural emissions including croplands, paddy rice, and livestock. In spite of the importance of this sector, it is unclear where the regions with hotspots of AFOLU emissions are and how uncertain these emissions are. Here we present a novel, spatially comparable dataset containing annual mean estimates of gross AFOLU emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O), associated uncertainties, and leading emission sources, in a spatially disaggregated manner (0.5 degrees) for the tropics for the period 2000-2005. Our data highlight the following: (i) the existence of AFOLU emissions hotspots on all continents, with particular importance of evergreen rainforest deforestation in Central and South America, fire in dry forests in Africa, and both peatland emissions and agriculture in Asia; (ii) a predominant contribution of forests and CO2 to the total AFOLU emissions (69 %) and to their uncertainties (98 %); (iii) higher gross fluxes from forests, which coincide with higher uncertainties, making agricultural hotspots appealing for effective mitigation action; and (iv) a lower contribution of non-CO2 agricultural emissions to the total gross emissions (ca. 25 %), with livestock (15.5 %) and rice (7 %) leading the emissions. Gross AFOLU tropical emissions of 8.0 (5.5-12.2) were in the range of other databases (8.4 and 8.0 Pg CO2 e yr(-1) in FAOSTAT and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) respectively), but we offer a spatially detailed benchmark for monitoring progress in reducing emissions from the land sector in the tropics. The location of the AFOLU hotspots of emissions and data on their associated uncertainties will assist national policy makers, investors, and other decision-makers who seek to understand the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector.

AB Numerous freshwater ecosystems, dense concentrations of humans along the eastern seaboard, extensive forests and a history of intensive land use distinguish the New England/Mid-Atlantic Region. Human population densities are forecast to increase in portions of the region at the same time that climate is expected to be changing. Consequently, the effects of humans and climatic change are likely to affect freshwater ecosystems within the region interactively. The general climate, at present, is humid continental, and the region receives abundant precipitation. Climatic projections for a 2 x CO2 atmosphere, however, suggest warmer and drier conditions for much of this region. Annual temperature increases ranging from 3-5 degrees C are projected, with the greatest increases occurring in autumn or winter. According to a water balance model, the projected increase in temperature will result in greater rates of evaporation and evapotranspiration. This could cause a 21 and 31% reduction in annual stream flow in the southern and northern sections of the region, respectively, with greatest reductions occurring in autumn and winter. The amount and duration of snow cover is also projected to decrease across the region, and summer convective thunderstorms are likely to decrease in frequency but increase in intensity.
   The dual effects of climate change and direct anthropogenic stress will most likely alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and, hence, the floral and faunal communities of the region's freshwater ecosystems. For example, the projected increase in evapotranspiration and evaporation could eliminate most bog ecosystems, and increases in water temperature may increase bioaccumulation, and possibly biomagnification, of organic and inorganic contaminants. Not all change may be adverse. For example, a decrease in runoff may reduce the intensity of ongoing estuarine eutrophication, and acidification of aquatic habitats during the spring snowmelt period may be ameliorated.
   Recommendations for future monitoring efforts include: (1) extending and improving data on the distribution, abundance and effect of anthropogenic stressors (non-point pollution) within the region; and (2) improving scientific knowledge regarding the contemporary distribution and abundance of aquatic species. Research recommendations include: (1) establishing a research centre(s) where field studies designed to understand interactions between freshwater ecosystems and climate change can be conducted; (2) projecting the future distribution, activities and direct effects of humans within the region; (3) developing mathematical analyses, experimental designs and aquatic indicators that distinguish between climatic and anthropogenic effects on aquatic systems; (4) developing and refining projections of climate variability such that the magnitude, frequency and seasonal timing of extreme events can be forecast; and (5) describing quantitatively the flux of materials (sediments, nutrients, metals) from watersheds characterized by a mosaic of land uses.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland surface waters in many northern hemisphere industrialised regions are at their highest in living memory, provoking debate over their "naturalness". Because of the implications for drinking water treatment and supply there is increasing interest in the potential for mitigation through local land management, and for forecasting the likely impact of environmental change. However, the dominant controls on DOC production remain unresolved, hindering the establishment of appropriate reference levels for specific locations. Here we demonstrate that spatial variation in long-term average DOC levels draining upland UK catchments is highly predictable using a simple multiple logistic regression model comprising variables representing wetland soil cover, rainfall, altitude, catchment sensitivity to acidification and current acid deposition. A negative relationship was observed between DOC concentration and altitude that, for catchments dominated by organo-mineral soils, is plausibly explained by the combined effects of changing net primary production and temperature-dependent decomposition. However, the magnitude of the altitude effect was considerably greater for catchments with a high proportion of wetland cover, suggesting that additional controls influence these sites such as impeded respiratory loss of carbon in wet soils and/or an increased susceptibility to water level drawdown at lower altitudes. The model suggests (1) that continuing reductions in sulphur deposition on acid sensitive organo-mineral soils, will drive further significant increases in DOC and, (2) given the differences in the magnitude of the observed altitude-DOC relationships, that DOC production from catchments with peat-dominated soils may be more sensitive to climate change than those dominated by mineral soils. However, given that mechanisms remain unclear, the latter warrants further investigation.

AB This paper presents the results of a high-resolution Late-glacial chironomid stratigraphy from Hawes Water, a small carbonate lake in northern Lancashire. The samples were from a core taken from the terrestrialised margin of the present lake, which represents an intermediate depth between the true littoral and the profundal. The chironomid assemblage showed a high degree of sensitivity to both broad-scale and short-term temperature changes. Comparison with an existing proxy temperature record (delta(18)O) for the site confirmed the presence of four temperature inversions within the Late-glacial Interstadial. A mean July air temperature inference model, derived from acid, soft-water lakes in Norway and Svalbard, was applied to the data. Despite the absence of carbonate lakes within the Norwegian training set, there was a close similarity between trends in estimated July air temperature and the delta(18)O trace, with a particularly strong correspondence in the periods of clay deposition. This suggests that this model is highly robust. The inferred maximum Interstadial temperature was 13.4 degreesC, dropping initially to 7.5 degreesC in the Loch Lomond Stadial. Temperatures reach a maximum of nearly 10 degreesC in this period, cool for a short period before rising rapidly to 13.2 degreesC at the start of the Holocene. These temperatures are similar to but slightly higher than those estimated for Whitrig Bog, southeast Scotland, and lower than those inferred from coleopteran-based models for sites in South Wales.

AB High-resolution records of greenhouse gas concentrations from the Law Dome Antarctic ice core show small fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 and CH4, including a 10 ppmv decrease in CO2 and a 50 ppbv increase in CH4 during the Little Ice Age. Explanations for the biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchanges that caused these fluctuations, and their impacts on global climate, are lacking. We produce here a wetland index derived from the North American Pollen Database and show that for most of the past two millennia, this index is negatively correlated (antiphase) with atmospheric CO2 levels measured in the Law Dome ice core. Our analysis indicates the potential for global wetlands to act as carbon sinks, contributing to small fluctuations in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and thereby influencing submillennial-scale climatic change. Although our wetland index-CO2 relationship is statistically significant, the relationship between our wetland index-CH4 curve is not, possibly due to the confounding influence of wildfires on CH4.

TI Patterns and trends in lake concentrations of dissolved organic carbon

   acidification
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE Dissolved organic carbon; Lakes; Acidity; Wetlands; Recovery
AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in lakes throughout North America and Europe over the last three decades. Recovery from acid deposition and climate change have both been postulated as the primary mechanisms for the increase in DOC. To provide a clearer insight into the mechanisms responsible for increasing DOC we evaluated changes in lake and peat porewater chemistry collected in an area of approximately 33,000 km(2) surrounding Sudbury, Ontario, a region undergoing dramatic recovery from acidic deposition. DOC concentrations varied considerably among the 44 lakes and over time (samples annually from 1981 to 2018), but the Sens Slope value showed a strong increase in lake DOC concentration over time, at 0.05 mg/L y-1 (p < 0.001) that was related to increasing pH [0.03 units y(-1), p < 0.001] and decreasing lake SO4 concentration [-0.24 mg/L y(-1); p< 0.001], but showed no relationshipwith temperature or precipitation. Similar strong relationships between DOC and pH(positive) and SO4 (negative) were observed in 18 peatlands sampled in the region. In a spatial analysis of 82 lakes sampled in 2018, concentrations of DOC in lakes were highest in flatter catchments with a greater wetland area, suggesting thatwetlands are amajor source of DOC in lakes. Optical properties of DOC obtained from extracts of wetland and upland soils at 6 catchments could be distinguished, primarily due to upland litter extracts having distinct optical properties from mineral soils or wetland soils. Optical properties of DOC in lakes however were inconsistent with those measured in soil extracts indicating that they are not useful for distinguishing DOC sources in these lakes. A predictivemodel was developed to explain DOC trends within Sudbury lakes using a stepwise linear regression combined with hierarchical partitioning to confirm themost influential processes on DOC. Almost 50% of the variability in DOC change in the 44 lakes was explained by the magnitude in lake pH change, catchment size and catchment sparse tree cover showing that recovery from acidic deposition is overwhelmingly responsible for increasing DOC in Sudbury lakes.

AB The Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), the world's largest permafrost peatland, is of importance for understanding the high-latitude carbon (C) cycle and its response to climate change. Warming temperatures increase permafrost thaw and production of greenhouse gases. Also, permafrost thaw leads to the formation of lakes which are hotspots for atmospheric C emissions. Although lakes occupy similar to 6% of WSL, lake C emissions from WSL remain poorly quantified. Here we show high C emissions from lakes across all permafrost zones of WSL. The C emissions were especially high in shoulder seasons and in colder permafrost-rich regions. The total C emission from permafrost-affected lakes of WSL equals similar to 12 +/- 2.6 Tg C yr(-1) and is 2-times greater than region's C export to the Arctic coast. The results show that C emission from WSL lakes is a significant component in the high-latitude C cycle, but also suggest that C emission may decrease with warming.

AB Based on previously published studies of elemental cycling in Everglades soils, we projected how soil biogeochemistry, specifically carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and mercury might respond to climate change scenarios projected for 2060 by the South Florida Water Management Model. Water budgets and stage hydrographs from this model with future scenarios of a 10 % increased or decreased rainfall, a 1.5 A degrees C rise in temperature and associated increase in evapotranspiration (ET) and a 0.5 m rise in sea level were used to predict resulting effects on soil biogeochemistry. Precipitation is a much stronger driver of soil biogeochemical processes than temperature, because of links among water cover, redox conditions, and organic carbon accumulation in soils. Under the 10 % reduced rainfall scenario, large portions of the Everglades will experience dry down, organic soil oxidation, and shifts in soil redox that may dramatically alter biogeochemical processes. Lowering organic soil surface elevation may make portions of the Everglades more vulnerable to sea level rise. The 10 % increased rainfall scenario, while potentially increasing phosphorus, sulfur, and mercury loading to the ecosystem, would maintain organic soil integrity and redox conditions conducive to normal wetland biogeochemical element cycling. Effects of increased ET will be similar to those of decreased precipitation. Temperature increases would have the effect of increasing microbial processes driving biogeochemical element cycling, but the effect would be much less than that of precipitation. The combined effects of decreased rainfall and increased ET suggest catastrophic losses in carbon- and organic-associated elements throughout the peat-based Everglades.

AB Interstadials during the last glacial show a rapid rise of the atmospheric methane concentration at the onset of climatic warming. This is explained by reaction of (northern) wetlands to climate change, or by catastrophic release of methane from sea floor methane clathrates. The wetland hypothesis usually assumes expansion of wetlands, which is a slow process and difficult to reconcile with the rapid rise of the atmospheric methane concentration. Here it is demonstrated by modeling that wetland methane fluxes may have reacted rapidly on climatic warming by its direct effect on methane production, without the assumption of wetland expansion. A bottom-up modeling of methane fluxes in northern Europe during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 is presented. This study combines paleodata on wetland ecology, climate model output, a process-based methane flux model, and GIS-based modeling of wetland areal distribution. The resulting methane flux during interstadials is twice as high as during stadials. This is attributed to higher bacterial metabolic rates, a longer frost-free period, and a higher ecosystem primary production providing more substrate for methanogenesis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.

AB In a long-term field trial we investigated the responses of enchytraeids to simulated future climatic conditions predicted for Denmark. At a semi-natural Danish heathland site we exposed 9.1 m(2) plots to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (510 ppm), extended summer drought and passive night-time warming. Treatments and all possible combinations of treatments were replicated 6 times. The enchytraeid community was assessed after 8 years of treatment. Atmospheric CO2 did not have any significant effect on the enchytraeid community even though root biomass was increased in plots with elevated CO2. The warming treatment had a modest effect on soil temperatures (0.3 degrees C at 5 cm depth) and did not have significant effect on abundance or biovolume of enchytraeids. However, the individual body size of Chamaedrilus chlorophilus (=Cognettia sphagnetorum partim.) was negatively correlated with soil temperature in spring 2013, perhaps indicating that warming stimulates fragmentation (reproduction) rates at this time of the year. Increased drought in May June 2012 did not have lasting effects on abundance or biomass 3 months after the termination of drought treatment. However, comparison with earlier assessments of enchytraeids in the CLIMAITE experiment shows that the severity of drought and the time elapsed since the last drought is the best predictor of the biovolume (or biomass) of enchytraeids. Moreover, species richness was significantly impacted by the average soil water content experienced by enchytraeids during the 8-year study. It seems, therefore, that the most important factor for enchytraeid abundance and species diversity in the projected future climate conditions is soil water content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Climate change could alter terrestrial ecosystems, which are important sources and sinks of the potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), in ways that either stimulate or decrease the magnitude and duration of global warming. Using manipulative field experiments, we assessed how N2O and CH4 soil fluxes responded to a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and to increased air temperature. Nitrous oxide and CH4 responses varied greatly among studied ecosystems. Elevated CO2 often stimulated N2O emissions in fertilized systems and CH4 emissions in wetlands, peatlands, and rice paddy fields; both effects were stronger in clayey soils than in sandy upland soils. Elevated temperature, however, impacted N2O and CH4 emissions inconsistently. Thus, the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on N2O and CH4 emissions may further enhance global warming, but it remains unclear whether increased temperature generates positive or negative feedbacks on these GHGs in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB We quantified the effects of the water table on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from microcosms in a freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. From July to September in 2005, CO2, CH4 and N2O emission rates were measured in an undisturbed natural marsh (in natural) and microcosms of three manipulated water table treatments: a reference, a high water table (HW) and a low water table (LW). The averages of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions were 360.2 mg m(-2) h(-1), 7.43 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 12.84 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively, close to those in reference (p < 0.05), averaging 394.5 mg m(-2) h(-1), 8.92 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 13.3 mu g m(-2) h(-1). This means microcosm installation had no significant effect on CO2 efflux. Averaged CO2 (p = 0.03) and CH4 (p = 0.001) emissions were significantly different across the treatments, but that of N2O emission (p = 0.36) was not. To quantify the effects of water table position, three typical classes of water table were considered, i.e. +2 to +14 cm, -11 to 0 cm and -28 to -11.3 cm (+, above the soil surface. -, below the soil surface). Mean CO2 and N2O emissions were lowest at the higher water table positions (+2 to +14 cm) and increased by 120% and 60% at the lower water table positions (-11 to 0 cm), respectively, and the corresponding CH4 emissions decreased by 75%. However, at lowest water table positions (-28 to -11.3 cm), little additional effects on gas emissions were not found. Our results suggested that there could be considerable changes of greenhouse emissions as a response of water drawdown due to wetland drainage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the mechanisms by which climate change will affect animal populations is vital for adaptive management. Many studies have described changes in the timing of biological events, which can produce phenological mismatch. Direct effects on prey abundance might also be important, but have rarely been studied. We examine the likely importance of variation in prey abundance in driving the demographics of a European golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) population at its southern range margin. Previous studies have correlated plover productivity with the abundance of their adult cranefly (Tipulidae) prey, and modelled the phenology of both plover breeding and cranefly emergence in relation to temperature. Our analyses demonstrate that abundance of adult craneflies is correlated with August temperature in the previous year. Correspondingly, changes in the golden plover population are negatively correlated with August temperature 2 years earlier. Predictions of annual productivity, based on temperature-mediated reductions in prey abundance, closely match observed trends. Modelled variation in annual productivity for a future scenario of increasing August temperatures predicts a significant risk of extinction of the golden plover population over the next 100 years, depending upon the magnitude of warming. Direct effects of climate warming upon cranefly populations may therefore cause northward range contractions of golden plovers, as predicted by climate envelope modelling. Craneflies are an important food source for many northern and upland birds, and our results are likely to have wide relevance to these other species. Research into the potential for habitat management to improve the resilience of cranefly populations to high temperature should be an urgent priority.

ID ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; ARCTIC TUNDRA; SINK; FLUX
AB About 30% of the carbon in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in northern wetlands and boreal forest regions. Prevailing cold and wet soil conditions have largely been responsible for this carbon accumulation. It has been suggested that a warmer and drier climate in these regions might increase the decomposition rate and, hence, release more CO2 to the atmosphere than at present. This study reports on the spatial variability and temperature dependence of the potential carbon release after incubating highly organic soils from the European Arctic and Siberia at different temperatures. We found that the decay potential, measured as CO2 production in laboratory experiments, differed strongly within and among sites, particularly at higher soil temperatures. Furthermore, both the decay potential and its temperature response decreased significantly with depth in the soil, presumably because the older soils at deeper layers contained higher proportions of recalcitrant carbon than the younger soil organic matter at the surface. These results have implications for global models of potential feedbacks on climate change inferred from changes in the carbon balance of northern wetlands and tundra. Firstly, because the decay potential of the organic matter varies locally as well as regionally, predictions of how the tundra carbon balance may change will be unreliable if these are based on measurements at a few sites only. Secondly, any increase in CO2 production may be transitional as both the carbon flux and its temperature sensitivity decrease when the most easily degradable organic material near the soil surface has decomposed. Consequently, it is crucial to account for transient responses and regional differences in the models of potential feedbacks on climate change from changed carbon cycling in northern terrestrial ecosystems.

AB The spatial distribution of agricultural grassland in England and Wales has been assessed using a land evaluation model applied to information describing soils, climate and topography on a 5 x 5 km grid. The model calculates land suitability for grassland from assessments of trafficability/poaching risk and yield class. The spatial distribution of agricultural grassland was modelled for a 30 year climatic baseline (1941-1970) and for incremental changes in temperature and proportional changes precipitation relative to that baseline.
   Model estimates for the current distribution of grassland suitability agree well with observed data of actual grassland distribution. The best suited land occurs in south west England, Wales, the Welsh borders and Cheshire with fragmented areas of well suited land in north west England and on the Fens and Humberhead levels.
   The climatic sensitivity analysis suggests that grassland production in England and Wales is resilient to small perturbations in mean temperature (up to 2 degrees C) and precipitation (+/-10%). The effect of increasing temperature by 1 degrees C is almost completely offset by precipitation increases of 10% resulting in little change to the distribution of grassland suitability. However, greater temperature changes (+4 degrees C) have a major influence on the ability of land to support intensively managed grassland because of increased drought stress. Results indicate that a change in the climate comparable with current best estimates for the future would benefit grassland on good quality land at higher altitudes.

AB Concerns have been raised about rising trends in surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in UK upland catchments over the past decades. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these trends, including changes in climate and declines in sulfate deposition across Europe. Drier summers and wetter winters are projected in the UK, and there is an increasing interest in whether the rising trends of DOC would be continued or stabilized. In this paper, the INCA (INtegrated CAtchment) water quality model was applied to the upland catchment of the River Severn at Plynlimon in Wales and used to simulate the effects of both climate and sulfate deposition on surface water DOC concentrations. We introduced new parameter sets of INCA to explain enzymatic latch effect in peatlands during droughts. The model was able to simulate recent past (1995-2013) rising trends in DOC in Plynlimon. Climatic projections were employed to estimate the future trends on DOC in the uplands and to consider potential impacts on catchment management. The model was run with climatic scenarios generated using the weather@home2 climate modeling platform and with sulfate deposition scenarios from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) for 1975-2100. The modeling results show that the rising DOC trends are likely to continue in the near future (2020-2049) and the level of DOC concentrations is projected to stabilize in the far future (2070-2099). However, in the far future, the seasonal patterns of DOC concentrations will change, with a post-drought DOC surge in autumn months.

AB We examine the carbon balance of North American wetlands by reviewing and synthesizing the published literature and soil databases. North American wetlands contain about 220 Pg C, most of which is in peat. They are a small to moderate carbon sink of about 49 Tg C yr(-1), although the uncertainty around this estimate is greater than 100%, with the largest unknown being the role of carbon sequestration by sedimentation in freshwater mineral-soil wetlands. We estimate that North American wetlands emit 9 Tg methane (CH4) yr(-1); however, the uncertainty of this estimate is also greater than 100%. With the exception of estuarine wetlands, CH4 emissions from wetlands may largely offset any positive benefits of carbon sequestration in soils and plants in terms of climate forcing. Historically, the destruction of wetlands through land-use changes has had the largest effects on the carbon fluxes and consequent radiative forcing of North American wetlands. The primary effects have been a reduction in their ability to sequester carbon (a small to moderate increase in radiative forcing), oxidation of their soil carbon reserves upon drainage (a small increase in radiative forcing), and reduction in CH4 emissions (a small to large decrease in radiative forcing). It is uncertain how global changes will affect the carbon pools and fluxes of North American wetlands. We will not be able to predict accurately the role of wetlands as potential positive or negative feedbacks to anthropogenic global change without knowing the integrative effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur on the carbon balance of North American wetlands.

AB Intense Asian summer monsoon rainfall responds to high boreal summer insolation and environmental feedbacks in the early and middle Holocene. However, it is unclear what role of the Asian summer monsoon strength might have played for the heterogeneous wetness pattern in northern China. Here, we report two wet periods in the early and middle Holocene by paleosol, lacustrine, and peat stratigraphies in the southeast Mu Us Desert, and that early-Holocene wetness records are common and seen in valleys and missing from valley walls while mid-Holocene wetness records are found everywhere in the region. The preliminary analysis of the stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of soil carbonate and organic carbon from a riverine dune-paleosol sequence in a river valley reveals that wet springs/falls with dry summers frequently prevailed in the early Holocene, while wet summers with dry springs/falls became predominant in the middle Holocene. Strong-wind and low-temperature springs and falls on valley walls and uplands cause eolian sedimentation faster than soil formation but weak-wind and warmer-soil temperature in valleys facilitate vegetation metabolism and thus soil formation. Warm summer rainfall with no strong northwesterly wind causes paleosol, lacustrine and peat formation either in valleys or on uplands. The early-Holocene heterogeneous and middle-Holocene uniform wetness records are indeed controlled by seasonal hydroclimate conditions but not a single factor of summer monsoon rainfall strength in the southeast Mu Us Desert.

AB Alpine wetlands in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a crucial role in the regional hydrological cycle due to their strong influence on surface ecohydrological processes; therefore, understanding how TP wetlands respond to climate change is essential for projecting their future condition and potential vulnerability. We investigated the hydrological responses of a large TP wetland complex to recent climate change, by combining multiple satellite observations and in-situ hydro-meteorological records. We found different responses of runoff production to regional warming trends among three basins with similar climate, topography and vegetation cover but different wetland proportions. The basin with larger wetland proportion (40.1%) had a lower mean runoff coefficient (0.173 +/- 0.006), and also showed increasingly lower runoff level (-3.9% year(-1), p = 0.002) than the two adjacent basins. The satellite-based observations showed an increasing trend of annual non-frozen period, especially in the wetland-dominated region (2.64 day.year(-1), p < 0.10), and a strong extension of vegetation growing-season (0.26-0.41 day.year(-1), p < 0.10). Relatively strong increasing trends in evapotranspiration (ET) (similar to 1.00 mm.year(-1), p < 0.01) and the vertical temperature gradient above ground surface (0.043 degrees C.year(-1), p < 0.05) in wetland-dominant areas were documented from satellite-based ET observations and weather station records. These results indicate recent surface drying and runoff reduction of alpine wetlands, and their potential vulnerability to degradation with continued climate warming.

AB Wetlands in mid-high latitude regions play a vital role in climate change, due to their high organic carbon density. Nonetheless, the stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions in these regions is largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to examine the changes in SOC and its fractions along a latitudinal gradient and to analyze the influencing factors in the southern margin of the permafrost region on the Eurasian continent. Topsoil (0-20 cm) was collected from five wetlands along a latitudinal gradient in Northeast China. We analyzed SOC and some labile fractions. Our results demonstrated that wetland SOC and its labile fractions concentration declined with decreasing latitude. The Permafrost regions had greater organic carbon content than the regions with seasonally frozen ground. The light fraction organic carbon and particulate organic carbon accounted for 5-83% and 21-32%, respectively, of the SOC and were particularly enriched in the permafrost region. Microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon showed a similar decreasing trend to that of SOC. At the same latitude, vegetation affected SOC stock and the dynamics of its labile fractions. Therefore, wetlands in mid-high latitudes contain a large carbon pool, and carbon stock varies with latitude. Although the labile fractions were higher in the permafrost region, their activities were lower, due to low temperature and poor nutrient status. Under global warming, the labile carbon pool may be mobilized and contribute to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, vegetation differences should be considered in obtaining an accurate carbon calculation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Paramo soils store high amounts of organic carbon. However, the effects of climate change and changes in land cover and use (LC/LU) in this high-elevation tropical ecosystem may cause a decrease in their carbon storage capacity. Therefore, better understanding of the factors influencing the Paramo soils' carbon storage and export is urgently needed. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the soil water of four LC/LU types (tussock grass, natural forest, pine plantations, and pasture) and the factors controlling its variability in the Quinuas Ecohydrological Observatory in south Ecuador. Weekly measurements of soil water DOC concentrations, meteorological variables, soil water content, and temperature from various depths and slope positions were monitored within the soils' organic and mineral horizons between October 2014 and January 2017. These data were used to generate regression trees and random forest statistical models to identify the factors controlling soil water DOC concentrations. From high to low concentrations, natural forest depict the highest DOC concentrations followed by pasture, tussock grass, and pine forest. For all LC/LU types, DOC concentrations increase with decreasing soil moisture. Our results also show that LC/LU is the most important predictor of soil water DOC concentrations, followed by sampling depth and soil moisture. Interestingly, atmospheric variables and antecedent evapotranspiration and precipitation conditions show only little influence on DOC concentrations during the monitoring period. Our findings provide unique information that can help improve the management of soil and water resources in the Paramo and other peat dominated ecosystems elsewhere.

AB Using the territory of the Orlovskoye Polesye National Park as a case study within the catchment basin of the Oka River (Mid-Russian Uplands, Oryol Region, Russia), we obtained palaeoecological data for studying response of forest landscapes within the forest-steppe ecotone to climate change and human impact through the Late Holocene. The paper presents reconstruction of environmental change on a local to regional scales based on plant macrofossil, spore-pollen and testate amoeba records from a peat core along with reconstruction of woodland coverage inferred from pollen data. Over the past 4000 years, the total woodland coverage has fluctuated insignificantly, ranging from 38 to 52%, while the structure of the forest has changed radically. Prior to 1500 cal. yr BP, both birch-pine and mixed temperate deciduous forests of oak, elm, ash and lime with Scots pine and well-developed shrub understory of hazel and alder grew in the region. The subsequent agricultural colonization of the territory led to a reduction of a broadleaved trees in forest stands since 1500 cal. yr BP. During the last few centuries, human activity largely associated with cutting/burning trees and farming favored the expansion of secondary forests dominated by birch. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Wetland soils are an important component of the Global Carbon Cycle because they store about 20-25% of the terrestrial soil organic carbon (SOC). Wetlands occupy about 6% of the global land surface and any change in their use or management has potentially dramatic consequences on greenhouse gases emissions. However, the capacity of wetland soils to store carbon (C) differs from place to place due to reasons still not well understood. The objective of this review was to evaluate the global variations in wetlands SOC content (SOCc) and to relate it to key soil and environmental factors such as soil texture, intensity of soil hydromorphy, metallic element content and climate. A comprehensive data analysis was performed using 122 soil profiles from 29 studies performed under temperate, humid, sub-humid, tropical and sub-arctic conditions. The results point to average SOCc of 53.5 +/- 15.8 g C kg(-1) with a maximum of 540 g C kg(-1). SOCc increased with increase in intensity of soil hydromorphy (r = - 0.52), Al (r = 0.19) and Fe content (r = 0.21), and decreased with soil pH (r = - 0.24). There was also a surprising tendency for intensity of soil hydromorphy, and thus SOCc, to decrease with increasing mean annual precipitation and soil clay content. These results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of soil hydromorphy in wetlands on organic C stabilization in the soils. However, further studies with additional information on soil bulk density to assess carbon C stocks, still need to be performed.

AB The genesis of mineral soil wetlands at the Boreal Plain - Prairie Ecozone interface is not well understood, given the transition to peatlands in this ecotone. Patterns of groundwater depth and hydraulic gradient were investigated in relation to soil development at a forested site at the Boreal Transition Ecoregion in central Alberta, Canada. Depressional and toe slope positions in each of four small catchments (up to 2 ha) oriented along a soil unit boundary were instrumented with wells and piezometers. Groundwater depth was measured manually or by sensor from 2012 to 2017. Groundwater at both slope positions fluctuated commonly 1.5 to 2 m annually and contributed to seasonal inundation in depressions. Direction of vertical hydraulic gradient reversed regularly, but was more commonly downward at toe slopes, indicating recharge dominance. An equal balance of upward and downward flow gradients in depressions was interpreted as flow-through. Lateral hydraulic gradients were commonly positive from toe to depression. Counts of subgroups for depressions were Orthic Humic Gleysol (3), Orthic Luvic Gleysol (2), Terric Mesisol (2), Orthic Gleysol (2) Terric Humisol (1) and Humic Luvic Gleysol (1). Counts of subgroups for toe slopes were Gleyed Dark Gray Chemozem (2), Gleyed Solonetzic Gray Luvisol (2), Gleyed Dark Gray Luvisol (2), Dark Gray Solodized Solonetz (1), Dark Gray Luvisol (1), Gray Solodized Solonetz (1), and Humic Luvic Gleysol (1). The infrequency of eluvial/illuvial soil features in depressions was consistent with their flow-through hydrology. The higher frequency of eluvial/illuvial soil features at toe slopes was also consistent with recharge hydrology. Soil carbonates were more abundant within the weakly saline soil unit. The seasonal hydrologic pattern in depressions included a period of rapid groundwater rise during snowmelt, a period of stability maintained by inputs of precipitation and toe slope flux, and a period of groundwater recession that was probably initiated when forest ET depleted upland soil moisture. Mineral wetlands with Gleysolic soils are found in locations of the landscape where soil saturation is too irregular to allow peatland formation. Mineral soil wetlands in this region may persist despite climate change because of the expected shift towards greater winter precipitation.

AB Food-caching animals can gain nutritional advantages by buffering seasonality in food availability, especially during times of scarcity. The wolverine (Gulo gulo) is a facultative predator that occupies environments of low productivity. As an adaptation to fluctuating food availability, wolverines cache perishable food in snow, boulders, and bogs for short- and long-term storage. We studied caching behavior of 38 GPS-collared wolverines in four study areas in Scandinavia. By investigating clusters of GPS locations, we identified a total of 303 food caches from 17 male and 21 female wolverines. Wolverines cached food all year around, from both scavenging and predation events, and spaced their caches widely within their home range. Wolverines cached food items on average 1.1 km from the food source and made between 1 and 6 caches per source. Wolverines cached closer to the source when scavenging carcasses killed by other large carnivores; this might be a strategy to optimize food gain when under pressure of interspecific competition. When caching, wolverines selected for steep and rugged terrain in unproductive habitat types or in forest, indicating a preference for less-exposed sites that can provide cold storage and/or protection against pilferage. The observed year-round investment in caching by wolverines underlines the importance of food predictability for survival and reproductive success in this species. Increasing temperatures as a consequence of climate change may provide new challenges for wolverines by negatively affecting the preservation of cached food and by increasing competition from pilferers that benefit from a warmer climate. It is however still not fully understood which consequences this may have for the demography and behavior of the wolverine.

SO BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO
LA English
DT Article
AB The Tablas de Daimiel National Park wetland developed in an area characterized by the cyclic nature of droughts, excessive aquifer exploitation and an evident aridification trend driven by climate change. The park and its surroundings have been exploited since prehistoric times and they are currently deeply anthropized to the point that both the physical survival of the wetland as well as its ecological function entirely depend on human action. A severe drought between 2006 and 2009 together with the drawdown of the water table caused the dry out of the system, reed overgrowth, disappearance of cut-sedge and sub-aquatic Chara spp. meadows and a smouldering peat fire. During this same period surface water, soil and groundwater were sampled for physical, hydrological and hydrochemical characterization. Upon drainage, the system functions as an artificial recharge system and becomes eutrophic showing large nutrient and salt content in soils and water. High water transmissivity capacities in the unsaturated zone and anthropic park management (soil compacted by heavy machinery, recirculation of low quality groundwater, reed reaping, water transfers, etc.) condition groundwater pollution. Increased knowledge of the physical-environment has allowed us to build a conceptual model of the surface water - groundwater interactions and to develop management tools to support the park management during a system dry out. Amongst these actions, we propose an unsaturated flow model for soil moisture simulation than can be used to predict critical soil water content for reed overgrowth or peat combustion risk.

AB The daily net ecosystem CO2 exchange, diurnal pattern of net CO2 exchange and ecosystem respiration of Cenchrus ciliaris grassland in semi-arid region were studied during July 2008-June 2009 using eddy covariance measurement. The active season during which daily net CO2 uptake was observed corresponded with the wet season which lasted for 7 months. High CO2 uptake was observed during September to December. Pulses in CO2 release occurred with the rewetting of the soil by summer rain events during dry period. The amplitude of daytime and nocturnal ecosystem CO2 exchange increase by many folds during the active season when compared with the dry season. Ecosystem respiration exhibits strong positive relationship with soil moisture (r(2) = 0.768) but negatively correlated with soil temperature (r(2) = 0.498). The seasonal changes in net ecosystem exchange and ecosystem respiration were strongly regulated by soil moisture, therefore, the phase of the net uptake and release of CO2 by the ecosystem depend on the balance between the wet season and the dry season.

AB Three sites provide records that address whether the Younger Dryas was manifest in Central America. Marine records from Barbados and the Cariaco Basin an discussed, as well as possible climatic forcing mechanisms. Sequences from montane La Chonta Bog, Costa Rica, and lowland Lake Quexil, Guatemala, record a temperature decline of 1.5-2.5 degrees C dated between 11,070-10,400 C-14 years BP and ca. 12,000-10,300 C-14 years BP, respectively. The record from Lake La Yeguada, Panama, does not include cooling, although significant reorganization of local a communities occurred during the Younger Dryas chronozone. Colder tropical SSTs throughout deglaciation contributed to sub-regional climatic variation, more intense monsoonal activity, and cooler air temperatures. However, the temperature reversals are not associated with the coldest tropical SSTs which occurred during meltwater pulses. The temperature reversals appear to be a response to extra-tropical conditions, presumably in the North Atlantic, which suggests that Younger Dryas cooling extended as far south as Costa Rica. In Panama, monsoonal conditions may have blocked cooler temperatures. Precipitation continued to increase throughout deglaciation due to strong forcing by seasonal solar insolation in Central America while desiccation events occurred to the north and south.

AB We present pollen and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta O-18, delta N-15) data from a similar to 4 in core (TNF-1) of primarily mangrove peat taken from Turneffe Atoll, Belize. Radiocarbon (accelerator mass spectrometry) dates show that the record represents ca. 5000 years of sediment accumulation. Vegetation composition varied between dominant mangroves (primarily Rhizophora mangle) and Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae, most likely Salicornia bigelovii. The pollen data, along with inferences from stable isotope analyses of bulk peat and fossil leaf fragments, indicate that marked environmental changes occurred at this location over the past ca. 5000 years. There was a transition between ca. 4100 and 2900 cal yr BP, from vegetation dominated by relatively tall mangroves (R. mangle) to one dominated by Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae and then Myrica, most likely wax myrtle (M. cerifera). These changes bracket a period centered at ca. 3500 calibrated years before present, where there is a peak in the delta O-18 of mangrove leaf fragments. This timing corresponds with other paleoenvironmental records of climate drying in Central America and increases the geographic and habitat scope (i.e., mangrove habitat) of records documenting these changes. Interpretations of shifts in mangrove habitat, however, require consideration of additional environmental influences, including changes in groundwater hydrology and relative inputs of seawater and freshwater (i.e., precipitation) during the Holocene.

AB Pinus wood remains some 7,400 years old are abundantly preserved near the base of eroding peat at Clashgour, west of Loch Tulla on Rannoch Moor in western Scotland. Measurements are presented of the orientations of root systems in 42 in situ stumps, the direction of fall in 27 fallen trunks and the orientation (where direction of fall cannot be defined) in 40 fallen trunks. There are statistically significant orientations in the root systems, which suggests that the root structure of the trees had responded to stress from westerly winds. However, despite this the orientations and directions of fall in tree trunks, also statistically significant, show that many trees were probably blown over by strong westerly winds. The data suggest that increased precipitation and accelerated paludification are less likely explanations for tree loss at this site than a sudden demise through wind-throw.

AB Water movement in hillslopes is determined by the subsurface characteristics that control flow paths connecting precipitation to stream flow. The hydrological response of hillslopes is notoriously non-linear and non-stationary; with the relative importance of vertical and lateral flow paths also depending on event characteristics and antecedent conditions. In northern boreal regions, climate change projections indicate that wetter and warmer winter conditions are likely to generate more extreme flood events. Here, we report a study from an upland catchment in northern Scotland where a monitoring year provided an opportunity to contextualise observations during the hillslope response to a winter rainfall event that locally caused the most extreme flooding for over 200 years. Monitoring the hillslope water table, soil moisture and isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and stream flow provided invaluable insight into hillslope-riparian coupling. Groundwater with a shallow water table ( < 0.05 m deep) in poorly drained valley bottom drift deposits maintained almost fully saturated and stream-connected peat soil profiles in riparian areas. In the wettest periods, the groundwater beneath the peat was artesian. On steeper hillslopes, soils were drier and the water table was generally deeper (0.5-1 m below ground level), though the profile could fully saturate and groundwater levels reach the surface during the wettest period. Groundwater in deeper wells typically showed an anti-clockwise hysteresis compared to stream flow, and peak levels typically lagged behind the stream by a few hours in the valley bottom and > 1 day in the upper hillslope. In contrast, shallower wells in the soil profiles in the riparian area showed a more responsive perched groundwater system with transmissivity feedback in the upper soil layers resulting in much more rapid responses which generally peaked before the stream and exhibited clockwise hysteresis. Analysis of stable isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and streamflow, indicated that groundwater was remarkably well mixed with limited fractionation effects, inferring precipitation on the upper, unconfined hillslopes was the dominant source of recharge - particularly during the winter. The study shows that groundwater plays two roles in generating stream flow: a constant baseflow supply to the stream and time varying-exfiltration into the edge of the riparian zone, which contributes to surface runoff during storm events.

AB Latitudinal permafrost in Northern Northeast (NNE) China is located in the southern margin of the Eurasian continent, and is very sensitive to climatic and environmental change. Numerical simulations indicate that air temperature in the permafrost regions of Northeast China has been on the rise since the 1950s, and will keep rising in the 21" century, leading to extensive degradation of permafrost. Permafrost degradation in NNE China has its own characteristics, such as northward shifts in the shape of a "W" for the permafrost southern boundary (SLP), discontinuous permafrost degradation into islandlike frozen soil, and gradually disappearing island permafrost. Permafrost degradation leads to deterioration of the ecological environment in cold regions. As a result, the belt of larch forests dominated by Larix gmelinii has shifted northwards and wetland areas with symbiotic relationships with permafrost have decreased significantly. With rapid retreat and thinning of permafrost and vegetation change, the CO2 and CH4 flux increases with mean air temperature from continuous to sporadic permafrost areas as a result of activity of methanogen enhancement, positively feeding back to climate warming. This paper reviews the features of permafrost degradation, the effects of permafrost degradation on wetland and forest ecosystem structure and function, and greenhouse gas emissions on latitudinal permafrost in NNE China. We also put forward critical questions about the aforementioned effects, including: (1) establish long-term permafrost observation systems to evaluate the distribution of permafrost and SLP change, in order to study the feedback of permafrost to climate change; (2) carry out research about the effects of permafrost degradation on the wetland ecosystem and the response of Xing'an larch to global change, and predict ecosystem dynamics in permafrost degradation based on long-term field observation; (3) focus intensively on the dynamics of greenhouse gas flux in permafrost degradation of Northeast China and the feedback of greenhouse gas emissions to climate change; (4) quantitative studies on the permafrost carbon feedback and vegetation carbon feedback due to permafrost change to climate multi-impact and estimate the balance of C in permafrost regions in the future.

AB The concentration of atmospheric methane (CH4) exerts a strong influence on atmospheric chemistry and the global climate. Natural and cultivated wetlands (rice paddies) are important sources of CH4, and the extent and strength of these sources may increase as a result of global warming and extension of rice production. Emission of methane From wetlands is an ecosystem process, closely coupled to local climatic and soil environments which influence complex processes of plant growth, soil organic matter decomposition, methanogenesis and CH4 oxidation. Rates of emission show large variation in both space and time and their estimation from point measurements or from correlation with net primary production is difficult and unreliable. Here we report a study in which process-based ecosystem models were used to estimate global CH4 emissions from natural wetlands and rice paddies, and the sensitivity of the models to simple climate change scenarios were tested. Our estimate of global emission was 145 Tg yr(-1), of which 92 Tg yr(-1) came from natural wetlands and 53 Tg yr(-1) from rice paddies. The emissions from wetlands at high-latitude and rice paddies were only half of those reported in the traditional literature, confirming more recent measurements. The models also showed thar modest global warming may produce a higher CH4 emission, but that this effect may be reversed by larger increases in temperature, due to the effect of soil moisture depletion.

AB Subgrid processes occur in various ecosystems and landscapes but, because of their small scale, they are not represented or poorly parameterized in climate models. These local heterogeneities are often important or even fundamental for energy and carbon balances. This is especially true for northern peatlands and in particular for the polygonal tundra, where methane emissions are strongly influenced by spatial soil heterogeneities. We present a stochastic model for the surface topography of polygonal tundra using Poisson-Voronoi diagrams and we compare the results with available recent field studies. We analyze seasonal dynamics of water table variations and the landscape response under different scenarios of precipitation income. We upscale methane fluxes by using a simple idealized model for methane emission. Hydraulic interconnectivities and large-scale drainage may also be investigated through percolation properties and thresholds in the Voronoi graph. The model captures the main statistical characteristics of the landscape topography, such as polygon area and surface properties as well as the water balance. This approach enables us to statistically relate large-scale properties of the system to the main small-scale processes within the single polygons.

AB A large amount of organic carbon is stored in high-latitude soils. A substantial proportion of this carbon stock is vulnerable and may decompose rapidly due to temperature increases that are already greater than the global average. It is therefore crucial to quantify and understand carbon exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic/arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we combine an Arctic-enabled version of the process-based dynamic ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS (version LPJG-WHyMe-TFM) with comprehensive observations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes to simulate long-term carbon exchange in a subarctic catchment at 50m resolution. Integrating the observed carbon fluxes from aquatic systems with the modeled terrestrial carbon fluxes across the whole catchment, we estimate that the area is a carbon sink at present and will become an even stronger carbon sink by 2080, which is mainly a result of a projected densification of birch forest and its encroachment into tundra heath. However, the magnitudes of the modeled sinks are very dependent on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, comparisons of global warming potentials between two simulations with and without CO2 increase since 1960 reveal that the increased methane emission from the peatland could double the warming effects of the whole catchment by 2080 in the absence of CO2 fertilization of the vegetation. This is the first process-based model study of the temporal evolution of a catchment-level carbon budget at high spatial resolution, including both terrestrial and aquatic carbon. Though this study also highlights some limitations in modeling subarctic ecosystem responses to climate change, such as aquatic system flux dynamics, nutrient limitation, herbivory and other disturbances, and peatland expansion, our study provides one process-based approach to resolve the complexity of carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems while simultaneously pointing out the key model developments for capturing complex subarctic processes.

AB Auckland Island is a small uninhabited Subantarctic island south (c.51 degreesS) of the New Zealand mainland. It is the southernmost outpost of tall forest in the southwest Pacific. Pollen analysis of two closely adjacent peat cores near tree-line documents climate change and forest dynamics during the Lateglacial and Holocene. After the retreat of glaciers before 15 000 C-14 yr BP, mountain tundra communities dominated on mineral soils under a cooler (c. 3 degreesC lower) climate than now. By 11 000 C-14 yr BP, a transition to Chionochloa antarctica grassland and peaty soils was complete, and by 10 000 C-14 yr BP shrub/grassland became dominant. Forest tree species (Metrosideros umbellata, Dracophyllum longifolium and Raukaua simplex) spread slowly from 10-000 C-14 yr BP, but did not form tall forest until 5500-4000 C-14 yr BP, despite southern ocean temperatures being warmer in the early Holocene. We suggest that warm, cloudy, low-radiation environments inhibited forest growth during the early Holocene in this intensely oceanic setting, through promoting saturated soils and reducing net photosynthesis. It was only in the later Holocene, when increased westerly windflow brought sunnier, although cooler and windier, climates, that forest expansion occurred on sheltered lowland sites. The forest at the study site collapsed to scrub at least twice within the last 2000 years, most likely because of extended periods of saturated soils.

AB Precise temperature data from four Alaskan permafrost sites (Prudhoe Bay, Barrow and two sites near Fairbanks) combined with computer modelling provide quantitative measures of the existence and dynamics of unfrozen water in the active layer and permafrost. Unfrozen water contents are negligible for living and dead moss layers, small in the peat layers and larger in the silts, and show significant site-to-site variation. The effect of unfrozen water on the ground thermal regime is largest immediately after freeze-up and during cooling of the active layer. It is less important during warming and thawing of the active layer and during freezing and thawing of seasonally frozen ground. The effects last less than a month in cold permafrost and throughout most of the freeze-up period in warm permafrost. Physically, unfrozen water introduces a spatially distributed latent heat and changes thermal properties which retards the thermal response of an active layer or permafrost. Unfrozen water in the freezing and frozen active layer and nearsurface permafrost also protects the ground from rapid cooling and creates a strong thermal gradient at the ground surface that increases the heat flux out of the ground. This enlarged heat flux also enhances the insulating effect of the snow cover. There do not appear to be any inherent difficulties in using conductive heat modelling for the active layer during the period when the zero curtain exists. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Climate warming perturbs ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, causing both positive and negative feedbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, we began a tidal marsh field experiment in two vegetation communities to investigate the mechanisms by which whole-ecosystem warming alters C gain, via plant-driven sequestration in soils, and C loss, primarily via methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we report the results from the first 4 years. As expected, warming of 5.1 degrees C more than doubled CH4 emissions in both plant communities. We propose this was caused by a combination of four mechanisms: (i) a decrease in the proportion of CH4 consumed by CH4 oxidation, (ii) more C substrates available for methanogenesis, (iii) reduced competition between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and (iv) indirect effects of plant traits. Plots dominated by Spartina patens consistently emitted more CH4 than plots dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, indicating key differences in the roles these common wetland plants play in affecting anaerobic soil biogeochemistry and suggesting that plant composition can modulate coastal wetland responses to climate change.

AB Arctic winter precipitation is projected to increase with global warming, but some areas will experience decreases in snow accumulation. Although Arctic CH4 emissions may represent a significant climate forcing feedback, long-term impacts of changes in snow accumulation on CH4 fluxes remain uncertain. We measured ecosystem CH4 fluxes and soil CH4 and CO2 concentrations and C-13 composition to investigate the metabolic pathways and transport mechanisms driving moist acidic tundra CH4 flux over the growing season (Jun-Aug) after 18years of experimental snow depth increases and decreases. Deeper snow increased soil wetness and warming, reducing soil %O-2 levels and increasing thaw depth. Soil moisture, through changes in soil %O-2 saturation, determined predominance of methanotrophy or methanogenesis, with soil temperature regulating the ecosystem CH4 sink or source strength. Reduced snow (RS) increased the fraction of oxidized CH4 (Fox) by 75-120% compared to Ambient, switching the system from a small source to a net CH4 sink (21 +/- 2 and -31 +/- 1mgCH(4)m(-2)season(-1) at Ambient and RS). Deeper snow reduced Fox by 35-40% and 90-100% in medium- (MS) and high- (HS) snow additions relative to Ambient, contributing to increasing the CH4 source strength of moist acidic tundra (464 +/- 15 and 3561 +/- 97mgCH(4)m(-2)season(-1) at MS and HS). Decreases in Fox with deeper snow were partly due to increases in plant-mediated CH4 transport associated with the expansion of tall graminoids. Deeper snow enhanced CH4 production within newly thawed soils, responding mainly to soil warming rather than to increases in acetate fermentation expected from thaw-induced increases in SOC availability. Our results suggest that increased winter precipitation will increase the CH4 source strength of Arctic tundra, but the resulting positive feedback on climate change will depend on the balance between areas with more or less snow accumulation than they are currently facing.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands are likely increasing and important in global climate change assessments. However, contemporary terrestrial biogeochemical model predictions of CH4 emissions are very uncertain, at least in part due to prescribed temperature sensitivity of CH4 production and emission. While statistically consistent apparent CH4 emission temperature dependencies have been inferred from meta-analyses across microbial to ecosystem scales, year-round ecosystem-scale observations have contradicted that finding. Here, we show that apparent CH4 emission temperature dependencies inferred from year-round chamber measurements exhibit substantial intra-seasonal variability, suggesting that using static temperature relations to predict CH4 emissions is mechanistically flawed. Our model results indicate that such intra-seasonal variability is driven by substrate-mediated microbial and abiotic interactions: seasonal cycles in substrate availability favors CH4 production later in the season, leading to hysteretic temperature sensitivity of CH4 production and emission. Our findings demonstrate the uncertainty of inferring CH4 emission or production rates from temperature alone and highlight the need to represent microbial and abiotic interactions in wetland biogeochemical models.

AB Wetlands are the largest natural source of the greenhouse gas methane to the atmosphere. Despite the fact that a large percentage of wetlands occur in tropical latitudes, methane emissions from natural tropical wetlands have not been extensively studied. The objective this research was to compare methane emissions from three natural tropical wetlands located in different climatic and ecological areas of Costa Rica. Each wetland was within a distinct ecosystem: (1) a humid flow-through wetland slough with high mean annual temperatures (25.9 degrees C) and precipitation (3700 mm yr-1); (2) a stagnant rainforest wetland with high mean annual temperatures (24.9 degrees C) and precipitation (4400 mm yr-1); or (3) a seasonally wet riverine wetland with very high mean annual temperatures (28.2 degrees C) and lower mean annual precipitation (1800 mm yr-1). Methane emission rates were measured from sequential gas samples using nonsteady state plastic chambers during six sampling periods over a 29-month period from 2006 to 2009. Methane emissions were higher than most rates previously reported for tropical wetlands with means (medians) of 91 (52), 601 (79), and 719 (257) mg CH4-C m-2 day-1 for the three sites, with highest rates seen at the seasonally flooded wetland site. Methane emissions were statistically higher at the seasonally wet site than at the humid sites (P < 0.001). Highest methane emissions occurred when surface water levels were between 30 and 50 cm. The interaction of soil temperature, water depth, and seasonal flooding most likely affected methanogenesis in these tropical sites. We estimate that Costa Rican wetlands produce about 0.80 Tg yr-1 of methane, or approximately 0.6% of global tropical wetland emissions. Elevated methane emissions at the seasonally wet/warmer wetland site suggest that some current humid tropical freshwater wetlands of Central America could emit more methane if temperatures increase and precipitation becomes more seasonal with climate change.

AB The temperature dependence of the methane oxidation rate is estimated. The methane lifetime in the atmosphere is shown to decrease by about 3% from 1900 to 2005. The overwhelming fraction of the total methane content is removed from the atmosphere at intratropical latitudes during the daytime. The methane oxidation rate growth due to the temperature increase in the troposphere generates negative feedback in the methane cycle and, accordingly, climatic feedback with the same sign. According to the estimates performed, the halt in methane concentration growth in the atmosphere observed in recent years can be associated with a decrease in the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere. According to the results of numerical experiments with the climatic model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS), the climatic effect of negative feedback of the tropospheric temperature and the methane lifetime in the atmosphere is not large and is comparable with the climatic forcing of the methane emission growth from bog ecosystems.

AB Arctic tundra ecosystems will play a key role in future climate change due to intensifying permafrost thawing, plant growth and ecosystem carbon exchange, but monitoring these changes may be challenging due to the heterogeneity of Arctic landscapes. We examined spatial variation and linkages of soil and plant attributes in a site of Siberian Arctic tundra in Tiksi, northeast Russia, and evaluated possibilities to capture this variation by remote sensing for the benefit of carbon exchange measurements and landscape extrapolation. We distinguished nine land cover types (LCTs) and to characterize them, sampled 92 study plots for plant and soil attributes in 2014. Moreover, to test if variation in plant and soil attributes can be detected using remote sensing, we produced a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and topographical parameters for each study plot using three very high spatial resolution multispectral satellite images. We found that soils ranged from mineral soils in bare soil and lichen tundra LCTs to soils of high percentage of organic matter (OM) in graminoid tundra, bog, dry fen and wet fen. OM content of the top soil was on average 14 g dm(-3) in bare soil and lichen tundra and 89 g dm(-3) in other LCTs. Total moss biomass varied from 0 to 820 gm(-2), total vascular shoot mass from 7 to 112 gm(-2) and vascular leaf area index (LAI) from 0.04 to 0.95 among LCTs. In late summer, soil temperatures at 15 cm depth were on average 14 degrees C in bare soil and lichen tundra, and varied from 5 to 9 degrees C in other LCTs. On average, depth of the biologically active, unfrozen soil layer doubled from early July to mid-August. When contrasted across study plots, moss biomass was positively associated with soil OM % and OM content and negatively associated with soil temperature, explaining 14-34% of variation. Vascular shoot mass and LAI were also positively associated with soil OM content, and LAI with active layer depth, but only explained 6-15% of variation. NDVI captured variation in vascular LAI better than in moss biomass, but while this difference was significant with late season NDVI, it was minimal with early season NDVI. For this reason, soil attributes associated with moss mass were better captured by early season NDVI. Topographic attributes were related to LAI and many soil attributes, but not to moss biomass and could not increase the amount of spatial variation explained in plant and soil attributes above that achieved by NDVI. The LCT map we produced had low to moderate uncertainty in predictions for plant and soil properties except for moss biomass and bare soil and lichen tundra LCTs. Our results illustrate a typical tundra ecosystem with great fine-scale spatial variation in both plant and soil attributes. Mosses dominate plant biomass and control many soil attributes, including OM % and temperature, but variation in moss biomass is difficult to capture by remote sensing reflectance, topography or a LCT map. Despite the general accuracy of landscape level predictions in our LCT approach, this indicates challenges in the spatial extrapolation of some of those vegetation and soil attributes that are relevant for the regional ecosystem and global climate models.

AB Temporal trends in inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) export in the stream water between 1979 and 2006 were studied in eight forested headwater catchments in eastern Finland, where an increasing air-temperature trend and a decreasing N-deposition trend has been observed since the 1980s. The Seasonal Kendall test was conducted to study if the stream water N concentrations have changed concurrently and a mixed model regression analysis was used to study which catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological variables were related to the variation in stream water N. The annual concentrations of total organic N (TON) increased at two catchments and the concentrations of nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) decreased at three and four catchments, respectively. The main factor explaining variation in concentrations and export of N was percentage of peatlands in a catchment. The NH4-N concentrations were also related to the N deposition, and the exports of NO3, NH4, and TON to precipitation. Quantitative changes in both the N concentrations and exports were small. The results suggested relatively small changes in the N concentrations and exports between 1979 and 2006, most probably because the effects of increased air and stream water temperatures largely have been concealed behind the concurrent decrease in N deposition.

AB Climate warming is likely to have pronounced impacts on soil biota in arctic ecosystems. In a warmer climate, heatwaves are more frequent and intense, but it is unclear to what extent soil communities are buffered against this. We studied the effects of an artificially induced heatwave on the structure of testate amoebae communities in dry heath tundra in Qeqertarsuaq (Disko Island, West Greenland) during the summer of 2003. While the heatwave was severe enough to induce significant leaf mortality in the aboveground vegetation, overall testate amoebae abundance did not react to the difference in temperature. However, in the heated plots transient shifts in species populations occurred during the exposure, followed by increases in species richness weeks after the heatwave had ended. The most important taxa appearing after the heating period belonged to bacterivorous genera, in agreement with a transient peak in bacterial colony forming units, caused by the heatwave. Lobose testate amoebae resisted the heating and its associated desiccation better than their filose counterparts.

AB The Northeast German Lowland Observatory (TERENO-NE) was established to investigate the regional impact of climate and land use change. TERENO-NE focuses on the Northeast German lowlands, for which a high vulnerability has been determined due to increasing temperatures and decreasing amounts of precipitation projected for the coming decades. To facilitate in-depth evaluations of the effects of climate and land use changes and to separate the effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers in the region, six sites were chosen for comprehensive monitoring. In addition, at selected sites, geoarchives were used to substantially extend the instrumental records back in time. It is this combination of diverse disciplines working across different time scales that makes the observatory TERENO-NE a unique observation platform. We provide information about the general characteristics of the observatory and its six monitoring sites and present examples of interdisciplinary research activities at some of these sites. We also illustrate how monitoring improves process understanding, how remote sensing techniques are fine-tuned by the most comprehensive ground-truthing site DEMMIN, how soil erosion dynamics have evolved, how greenhouse gas monitoring of rewetted peatlands can reveal unexpected mechanisms, and how proxy data provides a long-term perspective of current ongoing changes.

AB Campbell Island, which is 600 km south of New Zealand, has the southernmost tree line in this ocean sector. Directly under the maximum of the westerlies, the island is sensitive to changes in wind strength and direction. Pollen records from three peat cores spanning the tree line ecotone provide a 17,000-year history of vegetation change, temperature, and site moisture. With postglacial warming, tundra was replaced by tussock grassland 12,500 years ago. A subsequent increase of shrubland was reversed at 10,500 years ago and wetland-grassland communities became dominant. Around 9000 years ago, trees spread, with maximum tree line elevation reached around 6500 to 3000 years ago. This sequence is out of step with Southern Ocean sea surface temperatures, which were warmer than 12,500 to 9000 years ago, and, subsequently, cooled. Campbell Island tree lines were decoupled from temperature trends in the adjacent ocean by weaker westerlies from 12,500 to 9000 years ago, which leads to the intrusion of warmer, cloudier northern airmasses. This reduced solar radiation and evapotranspiration while increasing atmospheric humidity and substrate wetness, which suppressed tree growth. Cooler, stronger westerlies in the Holocene brought clearer skies, drier air, increased evapotranspiration, and rising tree lines. Future global warming will not necessarily lead to rising tree lines in oceanic regions.

Available techniques including satellite monitoring and phenological observations enable the detection of changes over the last few decades to centuries, but the full range of natural variability is still difficult to capture. Here we introduce a new approach to reconstruct growing season properties, by studying imprints of prolonged growing season on epidermal cell growth in Betula nana. A high correlation between cell expansion determined in annually collected B. nana leaves and subfossil leaf fragments collected from recent peat sections in northern Scandinavia, and climatic indices such as budburst date, growing-season degree-days and May September mean temperatures, enable the establishment of a new micro-phenological proxy for growing season characteristics. The applicability of the epidermal cell undulation index (UI) is tested by comparison with historical instrumental records of growing-season degree-days for the last 200 a. The results demonstrate the potential of the new leaf-morphology-based technique to reconstruct and quantify past changes in growing degree-days beyond instrumental data series. Applied to abundant B. nana leaf remains from peat and lake sediments, the UI may enable a reconstruction of growing degree-days throughout the Holocene and other parts of the late Quaternary.

ID FROZEN SOIL PARAMETERIZATION; MODEL; VALIDATION; BALANCE
AB [1] Freezing and thawing front (FTF) depths have implications for surface and subsurface exchanges of energy and water, vegetation growth and organic matter decomposition. Long-term changes in FTF depths are an important indicator of climate change. The FTF is seldom represented explicitly in land surface schemes, but the 0 degrees C isotherm is used as a surrogate for the front. However, when multiple FTFs occur within a soil column or when soil temperature hovers around the freezing point in the spring, the simulated 0 degrees C isotherm exhibits large fluctuations though in reality, the fronts develop rather smoothly. To explicitly simulate the FTF depths, this study couples a Two-Direction Stefan Algorithm (TDSA) in the Community Land Model 3 (CLM3). Several modifications are also introduced to adapt the CLM3 to the northern region, including the addition of a peat cover to the soil column, retention of a minimum unfrozen water content in the frozen soil, and implementation of canopy heat storage. The modified scheme was tested using field data from a boreal forest site. The TDSA enables the simulated FTF to be defined properly. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that the modified scheme (addition of a peat cover, unfrozen water and canopy heat storage) greatly improves the match between the simulated fronts and the 0 degrees C isotherm derived from measured soil temperatures. These modifications and the coupling of the TDSA are applicable to other lands surface schemes for the simulation of ground frost in the cold regions.

AB Fossiliferous sediments from The Pit Locality in Porcupine Cave, Park County, Colorado, span multiple glacial and interglacial cycles between ca. 800,000 and 400,000 yr B.P. at 2900 m elevation. The uppermost cycle probably represents oxygen-isotope glacial Stage 12 (stratigraphic Levels 4 and 3) and interglacial Stage 11 (Levels 3, 2, and 1) as determined by arvicoline biostratigraphic data that place the sequence between 487,000 and 365,000 yr B.P. A no-analog assemblage comprising the bog lemming Mictomys meltoni (of the M. borealis lineage) and the sagebrush vole Lemmiscus curtatus (=Lagurus curtatus) characterizes both the glacial and the interglacial deposits. Climatographs for these two species suggest that, compared to present conditions, the following local climatic limits can be imposed on oxygen-isotope Stages 12 and 11: (1) January effective moisture was greater, resulting from average temperatures of at least 5-degrees-C cooler and/or at least 15 mm more precipitation; (2) January solar radiation was lower by at least 75 Langleys; (3) effective July solar radiation might have been lower by at least 50 Langleys. Seasonal temperature extremes were not necessarily different from those of the present, but seasonal precipitation was more equable. Relative abundance of mammal taxa and sedimentological data indicate that aridity increased at the onset of the interglacial.   (C) 1994 University of Washington.

AB Two cores from calcite rafts deposits located in Cenote Ich Balam and Hoyo Negro were dated and analyzed for Sr-87/Sr-86, delta O-18, delta C-13, Sr/Ca and Cl/Ca. The geochemical records show changing aquifer salinity spanning the last similar to 8.5 cal kyrs BP and interrelationships with Holocene climate trends (wet and dry periods). During the wet mid-Holocene, the salinity of the meteoric Water Mass (WM; at 7.8-8.3 cal kyrs BP) was relatively high at 1.5-2.7 ppt and then became less saline (1.0-1.5 ppt) during the last similar to 7000 yrs as climate became progressively drier. High salinity of the meteoric WM during the wet mid-Holocene is attributed to increased turbulent mixing between the meteoric and underlying marine WM. Increased precipitation, in terms of amount, frequency, and intensity (e.g. hurricanes) causes higher flow of meteoric water towards the coast and mixing at the halocline, a phenomenon recorded with recent instrumental monitoring of the aquifer. Conversely, during dry periods reduced precipitation and flow in the meteoric WM would result in lower salinity. Karst properties and Holocene sea-level rise also seem to have an effect on the aquifer. When the regionally extensive network of shallow cave passages (similar to 10-12 m water depth) are flooded at similar to 8000 cal yrs BP, there is a rapid shift in salinity. This study demonstrates that calcite raft deposits can be used as paleo-environmental recorders documenting the effects of sea level and climate change on aquifer condition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing atmospheric CO2 is likely to produce chronic changes in global climate, as it may have done in the geologic past. Future CO2-induced changes in temperature and precipitation distribution changes could equal or exceed the changes which have occurred over the past 160,000 years and have affected the global carbon cycle. We consider ocean and terrestrial processes that could involve large changes in carbon fluxes (> 2 Pg C.yr-1) or changes in storage in large carbon pools (> 200 Pg C) resulting from CO2-induced climate changes. These include (1) air-sea exchange of CO2 in response to changes in temperature and salinity; (2) climate-induced changes in ocean circulation; (3) changes in oceanic new production and regeneration of organic debris caused directly by climate change; (4) altered oceanic nutrient supply needed to support new production due to climate-induced alteration of ocean circulation and river discharge; (5) CaCO3 compensation in sea water; (6) altered river nutrient flux and effects on coastal organic matter production and sediment accumulation; (7) seasonal balance between GPP and decomposition-respiration in terrestrial ecosystems in response to changes in temperature and precipitation; (8) successional processes in terrestrial ecosystems and formation of new plant associations in response to climatic change; (9) effects on soil nutrient availability, which amplifies ecosystem responses to climate change; (10) and responses of northern forests, tundra, and peatlands which have, until recently, been a sink for CO2. The potential effect of these processes on the rate of atmospheric CO2 concentration changes are estimated where possible, but not much quantitative information at a global scale is known, so uncertainty in these estimates is high. Each of these secondary feedbacks, however, has the potential of changing atmospheric CO2 concentration in magnitude similar to the effects of the direct human processes (fossil fuel burning and land clearing) responsible for the concern about global warming in the first place. It is therefore urgent that these uncertainties be resolved. Lines of research to accomplish this are suggested.

AB The south eastern plateau of New Caledonia (22 degrees S) preserves remnants of a deep regolith of ultramafic soils which is extensively gullied or eroded to form large alluvial fans. Dated sediments from four closed basins on the Plaine des Lacs (ca. 220 m altitude) show that organic muds were accumulating prior to 30,000 yr B.P. Over the next 5000-14,000 years limonitic clays infilled two basins as a result of slope instability in their catchment. Resistant laterite and bog iron surfaces became exposed during the period 30,000-15,000 yr B.P. by erosional events that seem to have been of greater magnitude than any in the earlier Pleistocene. Two sites, Lake Emeric and Lake Suprin, were chosen for pollen analysis. During the phases of organic deposition of these lakes, Nothofagus forests collapsed several times and were replaced by Gymnostoma maquis, apparently as a result of fires. These Pleistocene fires were associated with some inorganic deposition, presumably due to the substantial loss of primary forest cover. Regeneration of forest usually followed after an estimated gap of several centuries. Thus, fire was able to cause forest retreats of the same order of magnitude as that caused by massive fires today. The low nutritional status of the soils or lateritic crusts means that, as now, forest had difficulty reclaiming sites. Human activity is unknown prior to 3000 years ago, so the major erosion is presumed to have had natural causes. Thus, many of the wide-ranging changes are the result of natural instability in the sub-tropics, and some may be much older than hitherto thought. Climate change towards periods of dry, fire-prone, conditions may have been an underlying cause. In the Holocene, some climatic factor, possibly cyclonic storms, seems to prevent organic sedimentation. Switching from cyclone-free to cyclone-prone at the end of the Pleistocene may reflect temperature change in sea surfaces in the region. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stable isotopes are used to decipher hydrological processes in watershed research. A two-year monthly monitoring of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in a temperate catchment in Norther Europa, Latvia was undertaken. Isotope ratios in common water types - raised bog, confined groundwater, unconfined groundwater and surface water - were measured. We found characteristic signatures of isotope ratios for each of these four water types. The average isotope ratios of different water types ranged from -80.8 to -68.3 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and -11.46 to -8.76 parts per thousand for delta O-18, with standard deviations from 18 to 25 parts per thousand and 0.10 to 1.59 parts per thousand, respectively. The isotope ratios of the stream base flow were consistent with the groundwater isoscape and seasonally enriched by evaporation. Most enriched water are found in raised bogs and large lakes. The most depleted water is found in a spring discharging phreatic groundwater in a forest site with sandy soil. The most enriched water was associated with significant short-lived precipitation events, resulting in impoundment of water on the land surface and its enrichment due to evaporation. The novelty of this study is that this enriched isotope signal is propagated throughout the hydrological system, temporarily albeit significantly shifting isotope ratios of phreatic groundwater and surface runoff. Further case studies are needed to affirm if this is a regionally significant mechanism controlling isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water. The observed difference between the average delta O-18 of phreatic groundwater at two locations was 0.9 parts per thousand. We suggest that the differences are due to different land use and soil conditions.

AB Intensified warming in the Arctic and Subarctic is resulting in a wide range of changes in the extent, productivity, and composition of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Analysis of remote sensing imagery has documented regional changes in the number and area of ponds and lakes as well as expanding cover of shrubs and small trees in uplands. To better understand long-term changes across the edaphic gradient, we compared the number and area of water bodies and dry barrens (>100 m(2)) between 1956 (aerial photographs) and 2008-2011 (high-resolution satellite images) for eight similar to 25 km(2) sites near Nejanilini Lake, Manitoba (59.559 degrees N, 97.715 degrees W). In the modern landscape, the number of water bodies and barrens were similar (1162 versus 1297, respectively), but water bodies were larger (mean 3.1 x 10(4) versus 681 m(2), respectively) and represented 17% of surface area compared with 0.4% for barrens. Over the past 60 years, total surface area of water did not change significantly (16.7%-17.1%) despite a similar to 30% decrease in numbers of small (<1000 m(2)) water bodies. However, the number and area of barrens decreased (55% and 67%, respectively) across all size classes. These changes are consistent with Arctic greening in response to increasing temperature and precipitation. Loss of small water bodies suggests that wet tundra areas may be drying, which, if true, may have important implications for carbon balance. Our observations may be the result of changes in winter conditions in combination with low permafrost ice content in the region, in part explaining regional variations in responses to climate change.

AB Many researchers assume a proportional relationship among the atmospheric CO, concentration, temperature, and sea level. Thus, the rate of sea-level rise should increase in concert with the documented exponential increase in CO, Although sea surface temperature has increased in places over the past century and short-term sea level rose abruptly during the 1990s, it is difficult to demonstrate a proportional relationship using existing geologic or historic records. Tide gauge records in the United States cover too short a time interval to verify acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise, although multicentury tide gauge and staff records from the Netherlands and Sweden suggest a mid-19th-century acceleration in sea-level rise. Reconstructions of sea-level changes for the past 1000 years derived using benthic foraminifer data from salt marshes along the East Coast of the United States suggest an increased rate of relative sea-level rise beginning in the 1600s. Geologic records of relative sea-level rise for the past 6000 years are available for several sites along the US East Coast from C-14-dated basal peat below salt marshes and estuarine sediments. When these three scales of sea-level variation are integrated, adjusted for postglacial isostatic movement, and replotted, the range of variation in sea level suggested by basal peat ages is within +/- 1 meter of the long-term trend. The reconstruction from Long Island Sound data shows a linear rise in sea level beginning in the mid-1600s at a rate consistent with the historic record of mean high water. Long-term tide gauge records from Europe and North America show similar trends since the mid-19th century. There is no clear proportional exponential increase in the rate of sea-level rise. If proportionality exists among sea level, atmospheric CO, and temperature, there may be a significant time lag before an anthropogenic increase in the rate of sea-level rise occurs.

AB Today wildfire is an important disturbance in many continental ecosystems, and it is assumed that with ongoing climate changes the frequencies and impacts of wildfires will increase in many regions. One way to obtain information about the potential long term influences of wildfires on ecosystems and the climate system itself is to study palaeo-wildfires. A total of 140 Jurassic samples, including 122 coal samples and 18 rock samples from roof and floor of coal seams, were collected from 4 coalfields in Northwestern China. The samples were analyzed by macropetrography, microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to study the evidences of wildfires and their impact on the paleoclimate. High contents of pyrogenic inertinites (charcoal), natural char and natural coke particles observed in the samples which indicate that widespread wildfire events occurred in the early Middle Jurassic in all over Northwestern China. Additionally, high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the coal samples. These aromatic compounds were formed under high temperature and provide further evidence of wildfires. According to a carbon emission model for modern forest fires, the total carbon and gas emissions from wildfires in peat swamps of the Middle Jurassic in Northwest China were calculated by the data from 21,575 coal samples of number of 1567 drill core samples. The total carbon released from peat-swamp forest wildfires was at least 1207 Gt, corresponding to emissions of CO2, CO and CH4 of 1926 Gt, 163 Gt, and 8.8 Gt, respectively. The huge amount of CO2 released by forest fires in the peat swamp systems of the Middle Jurassic in Northwestern China alone was equivalent to 64.20% of the total CO2 in the atmosphere at present (3000Gt). The large amounts of greenhouse gases released by wildfires must have led to long-term changes in the atmospheric composition and have caused global warming, which could have the reason of affected the paleoclimate.

AB Moorland carbon reserves in organo-mineral soils may be crucial to predicting landscape-scale variability in soil carbon losses, an important component of which is dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Surface water DOC trends are subject to a range of scaling, transport and biotic processes that disconnect them from signals in the catchment's soils. Long-term soil datasets are vital to identify changes in DOC release at source and soil C depletion. Here we show, that moorland soil solution DOC concentrations at three key UK Environmental Change Network sites increased between 1993-2007 in both surface-and sub-soil of a freely-draining Podzol (48% and 215% increases in O and Bs horizons, respectively), declined in a gleyed Podzol and showed no change in a Peat. Our principal findings were that: (1) considerable heterogeneity in DOC response appears to exist between different soils that is not apparent from the more consistent observed trends for streamwaters, and (2) freely-draining organo-mineral Podzol showed increasing DOC concentrations, countering the current scientific focus on soil C destabilization in peats. We discuss how the key solubility controls on DOC associated with coupled physico-chemical factors of ionic strength, acid deposition recovery, soil hydrology and temperature cannot readily be separated. Yet, despite evidence that all sites are recovering from acidification the soil-specific responses to environmental change have caused divergence in soil DOC concentration trends. The study shows that the properties of soils govern their specific response to an approximately common set of broad environmental drivers. Key soil properties are indicated to be drainage, sulphate and DOC sorption capacity. Soil properties need representation in process-models to understand and predict the role of soils in catchment to global C budgets. Catchment hydrological (i.e. transport) controls may, at present, be governing the more ubiquitous rises in river DOC concentration trends, but soil (i.e. source) controls provide the key to prediction of future C loss to waters and the atmosphere.

AB Regional vegetation, climate history, and local water table fluctuations for the past 14,600 years are reconstructed from pollen and charcoal records of an ombrogenous peatbog in northern New Zealand (38 degrees S). A long-term warming trend between 14,600 and 10,000 cal. yr BP is punctuated by two brief plateaux between 14,200-13,800 and 13,500-12,000 cal. yr BP. Periods of relatively drier conditions are inferred between 14,000-13,400 and 12,000-10,000 cal. yr BP, while a long-term wet period is observed between 10,000 and 6000 cal. yr BP. The last 7000 years feature relatively stable temperatures, a long-term drying trend that culminates with persistent drier conditions over the last 3000 years and cyclical fluctuations in the bog's water table and fires. Present-day climate controls and comparisons with other climate reconstructions from New Zealand, the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and the tropical Pacific suggest that complex and temporally variable teleconnections exist between northern New Zealand and the Southern Hemisphere low- and high-latitude circulation.

AB Aim: To determine the growth responses of two peat swamp forest species, Shorea platycarpa, a shade-tolerant slow-growing species and Macaranga pruinosa, a light-demanding fast-growing species under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration.
   Methodology: The saplings of both species were grown in a shade house at ambient (400 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)) and in an open roof ventilation greenhouse at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration 800 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1) for seven months. The temperature in both environments ranged between 25-33 degrees C with 5560% sunlight transmittance and the saplings were thoroughly watered twice a day. Plants growth measurements were estimated at frequent intervals. Saplings biomass characteristics were examined using destructive methods after seven months of treatment and non-destructive method was used for determination of leaf area.
   Results: Elevated CO2 enhanced all the growth characteristics in M. pruinosa with a significant increase was observed particularly on both height and diameter relative growth rate and biomass characteristics. The height relative growth rate and leaf area were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 in S. platycarpa but did not affect the shoot or root diameter and biomass significantly. A positive correlation (r =0.77, p>0.05) between stem biomass and basal diameter for plants under elevated CO2 was recorded for M. pruinosa, but not in S. platycarpa. Both species showed negative correlation (S. platycarpa; r = -0.53, M. pruinosa; r = -0.46, p>0.05) between stem growth and stem biomass at elevated CO2.
   Interpretation: These results unveiled profound effects of elevated CO2 on the growth of light-demanding species M. pruinosa, while shade-tolerant species S. platycarpa was not relatively affected by elevated CO2. This underscored the necessity to analyse different species performance to elevated CO2, thereby improving the ability to predict tropical swamp forest ecosystem responses to rising CO2.Y

AB In the tundra, mosses play an important functional role regulating belowground and ecosystem processes, but there is still considerable uncertainty about how tundra moss communities will respond to climate change. We examined the effects of 5 years of in situ air and soil warming on net primary productivity (NPP), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and C:N in dominant Alaskan tundra mosses. Air warming increased mean air temperatures by up to 0.5A degrees C and resulted in an 80-90% reduction in NPP in the feather moss Pleurozium and the peat moss Sphagnum. Soil warming increased permafrost thaw depth by 12-18%, upper soil water content by 23-27%, and resulted in a threefold increase in Sphagnum NPP. delta C-13 was positively correlated with moss NPP, and increased by 0.5-1aEuro degrees in all mosses under soil warming. C:N was reduced in Sphagnum and Pleurozium, due to increases in tissue %N in the soil warming treatment, suggesting that moss N availability could increase as temperatures increases. Higher N availability in warmer conditions, however, may be offset by unfavorable moisture conditions for moss growth. Similar to responses in tundra vascular plant communities, our results forecast interspecific differences in productivity among tundra mosses. Specifically, air warming may reduce productivity in Sphagnum and Pleurozium, but soil warming could offset this response in Sphagnum. Such responses may lead to changes in tundra moss community structure and function as temperatures increase that have the potential to alter tundra C and N cycling in a future climate.

AB Wetlands provide significant ecosystem services but are also the largest natural source of methane (CH4), a critical greenhouse gas. Oxidation of CH4 in soils/sediments, driven by methanotrophs, offsets CH4 losses to the atmosphere. Manipulation of flooding regimes to optimize methanotrophy is a potential management strategy to reduce CH4 emissions from wetlands and offset global climate change. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine rates of potential CH4 oxidation (PMO) and shifts in methanotrophs over hydrological and seasonal gradients. Surface and subsurface soil samples (0-8 or 8-16 cm depths) were analyzed for PMO and profiled for methanotroph community structure using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis over four seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall) and 3 landscape positions (upland, intermittently flooded, and permanently flooded sites). PMO rates were highest in the winter. The permanently flooded sites had higher PMO rates than the intermittently flooded sites (p<0.05). Significantly higher PMO rates were observed in the 0-8 cm compared to the 8-16 cm soil depths (p<0.05). PLFA profiling of methanotrophs showed that both Type I and Type II methanotrophs were dominant in winter. Concentrations of the Type II methanotroph PLFA (18:omega 9c) was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those for Type I in all seasons and landscape positions. PMO and methanotroph biomass were highest in the winter and in the PFS which suggested substrate (CH4) concentration was more important in regulating methanotrophy than redox potential or seasonal shifts in temperature under flooded conditions. PFS had the lowest redox potential (which would not favor aerobic CH4 oxidation), yet it had the highest PMO rates, suggesting anaerobic methane oxidizers may be important in flooded soils.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon have increased in many, but not all, surface waters across acid impacted areas of Europe and North America over the last two decades. Over the last eight years several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these increases. but none are yet accepted universally. Research in this area appears to have reached a stalemate between those favouring declining atmospheric deposition, climate change or land management as the key driver of long-term DOC trends While it is clear that many of these factors influence DOC dynamics in soil and stream waters, their effect varies over different temporal and spatial scales We argue that regional differences in acid deposition loading may account for the apparent discrepancies between studies DOC has shown strong monotonic increases in areas which have experienced strong downward trends in pollutant sulphur and/or seasalt deposition. Elsewhere climatic factors, that strongly influence seasonality. have also dominated inter-annual variability, and here long-term monotonic DOC trends are often difficult to detect Furthermore, in areas receiving similar acid loadings, different catchment characteristics could have affected the site specific sensitivity to changes in acidity and therefore the magnitude of DOC release in response to changes in sulphur deposition We suggest that confusion over these temporal and spatial scales of investigation has contributed unnecessarily to the disagreement over the main regional driver(s) of DOC trends, and that the data behind the majority of these studies is more compatible than is often conveyed (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB Air temperature and light intensity in the tropical rainforest of Brunei Darussalam was recorded at a 20-min interval from 2011 to 2017. Five units of the HOBO Pendant (R) data loggers were attached to tree trunks within a circle of 5 m radius at 2 m above the ground. Approximately once a year, data were downloaded, and the sensors serviced. The test site is in a peat swamp forest classified as a mixed dipterocarp forest. The redundancy of the sensors allows for the assessment of the relative precision of the datasets. The root means squared error (RMSE) for the temperature is 0.37 degrees C, below the manufacturer's precision statement (0.53 degrees C). The RMSE for the light intensity data was 569.5 lux. There was no detection of systematic errors in the data. The sensors were calibrated before deployment. The data sets were captured in 2017. Ancillary data were collected in 2018, consisting of RGB orthoimagery and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data collected from an airborne platform. The data is a unique source of information on the diurnal, intraannual periodic effects, as well as random weather-related and phenology-related phenomenons. Multiannual datasets in the same ecosystem will be published in the future, allowing for a multidisciplinary analysis of the data in the context of climate change and the impact on the tropical rainforest ecosystems. The raw and auxiliary datasets are hosted in the Mendeley repository [1]. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Several recent studies have successfully applied diatom-based paleolimnological techniques to infer past hydrological changes in arctic and subarctic regions. For example, we summarize arctic studies that attempt to determine changes in peat water content, flood frequency, river discharge, effective moisture and ice cover in northern regions. Some of the investigations are still in preliminary stages, but represent innovative approaches to study arctic and subarctic paleohydrology. New data demonstrate that lake depth, which may be related to changing hydrological conditions, is a significant variable influencing the distributions of diatom taxa in lake surface sediment calibration sets from Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP), on the border of Alberta and the Northwest Territories, Canada, and from Fennoscandia (mainly northwest Finland). Weighted averaging regression and calibration methods were used to develop quantitative inference models for lake depth using diatom assemblages preserved in surface sediments. The predictive abilities of the transfer functions were relatively high (for WBNP r(2) = 0.70 and RMSE = 2.6 m, and for Fennoscandia r(2) = 0.88 and RMSE = 1.8 m). However, evaluating the transfer functions using jack-knifing procedures indicated lower predictive abilities, possibly reflecting the relatively small sample size and/or short gradients used in these calibration sets. Such transfer functions can be used to track overall trends in lake levels, and provide an objective assessment as to directions of changing lake levels. Any interpretations of inferred lake levels, especially those related to climate change, must be made cautiously and must include some understanding of the local, present-day hydrological system.

AB Shifting precipitation patterns brought on by climate change threaten to alter the future distribution of wetlands. We developed a set of models to understand the role climate plays in determining wetland formation on a landscape scale and to forecast changes in wetland distribution for the Midwestern United States. These models combined 35 climate variables with 21 geographic and anthropogenic factors thought to encapsulate other major drivers of wetland distribution for the Midwest. All models successfully recreated a majority of the variation in current wetland area within the Midwest, and showed that wetland area was significantly associated with climate, even when controlling for landscape context. Inferential (linear) models identified a consistent negative association between wetland area and isothermality. This is likely the result of regular inundation in areas where precipitation accumulates as snow, then melts faster than drainage capacity. Moisture index seasonality was identified as a key factor distinguishing between emergent and forested wetland types, where forested wetland area at the landscape scale is associated with a greater seasonal variation in water table depth. Forecasting models (neural networks) predicted an increase in potential wetland area in the coming century, with areas conducive to forested wetland formation expanding more rapidly than areas conducive to emergent wetlands. Local cluster analyses identified Iowa and Northeastern Missouri as areas of anticipated wetland expansion, indicating both a risk to crop production within the Midwest Corn Belt and an opportunity for wetland conservation, while Northern Minnesota and Michigan are potentially at risk of wetland losses under a future climate.

AB High-resolution pollen and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data from a sediment core from an alpine bog (3100 m) in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains (New Mexico) record variations in treeline elevation and in sedimentation for the last 14 ka (cal yr BP). Strong correspondence between the paleovegetation and the MS profile suggests that both records can be used to reconstruct past climatic conditions. The coldest conditions in this area occurred at the end of the late Pleistocene during the Pinedale glaciation and the Younger Dryas chron. A general warming trend took place during the early Holocene, lasting until similar to 5.6 ka, when the warmest conditions occurred. A progressive climate cooling is then observed until today. Millennial- and centennial-scale changes are also observed throughout the vegetation and MS records. The higher amplitude millennial-scale cold events appear to correlate with the timing and duration of episodes of enhanced sea-ice drift in the North Atlantic and the lower amplitude centennial-scale cold events may correlate with periods of lower solar activity. A solar-climate connection is suggested from these records by a prominent ca 200-yr cycle in tree pollen abundance, which may correlate with the 208 yr Suess solar cycle. This study shows an immediate response of the vegetation (treeline) to climate change at millennial- and centennial-scales, probably related to variations in summer insolation and solar activity during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Such high-resolution studies are very important in order to predict future climate change and particularly in very and areas, where human activity and economies are strongly influenced by climate.

AB The Holocene Megathermal is divided into early, middle and late periods, each having different impacts on the Neolithic cultures due to their different climate changing trends. This study is based on a comparative analysis of the environmental evolution information recorded in the Qinghai Lake, the western edge of the Loess Plateau and Zoige and the spatial distribution of Neolithic sites of the Gansu-Qinghai region. Results show that the early and middle periods towards warm and humid promoted the development of Neolithic cultures with agriculture as the main sector in the Gansu-Qinghai region, furthermore a heyday of Yang-shao Culture prosperity emerged. The Holocene entered the late period after the cold climate event at 5.9 ka BP in the Gansu-Qinghai region. Later the climate began to turn cold. However, at the 5.8-4.2 ka BP a relatively stable warm and humid climate created the conditions for the development of Majiayao Culture of the Neolithic Age in this region, thus the distribution of its cultural heritage sites expanded towards high altitudes and high latitudes. From 4.2 ka BP onwards, the climate became cold and dry, which had a significant influence on the Neolithic cultures of the Gansu-Qinghai region, leading to a dramatic change in the cultural characters and spatial distribution of Qijia Culture around 4.2 ka BP. After a nearly 300 years of cold and dry period, the unified Neolithic farming culture completely collapsed. Afterwards an industrial division of animal husbandry and farming and regional multiple cultures formed, and ultimately led to the end of primitive society and the starting of a civilized society.

AB Temperate wetlands in the Northern Hemisphere have high long-term carbon sequestration rates, and play critical roles in mitigating regional and global atmospheric CO2 increases at the century timescale. We measured soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) from 11 typical freshwater wetlands (Heilongjiang Province) and one saline wetland (Jilin Province) in Northeast China, and estimated carbon sequestration rates using Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating technology. Effects of climate, net primary productivity, and nutrient availability on carbon sequestration rates (R-carbon) were also evaluated. Chronological results showed that surface soil within the 0-40 cm depth formed during the past 70-205 years. Soil accretion rates ranged from 2.20 to 5.83 mm yr(-1), with an average of 3.84 +/- 1.25 mm yr(-1) (mean +/- SD). R-carbon ranged from 61.60 to 318.5 g Cm-2 yr(-1) and was significantly different among wetland types. Average R-carbon was 202.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in the freshwater wetlands and 61.6 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in the saline marsh. About 1.04 x 10(8) tons of carbon was estimated to be captured by temperate wetland soils annually in Heilongjiang Province (in the scope of 45.381-51.085 degrees N, 125.132-132.324 degrees E). Correlation analysis showed little impact of net primary productivity (NPP) and soil nutrient contents on R-carbon, whereas climate, specifically the combined dynamics of temperature and precipitation, was the predominant factor affecting R-carbon. The negative relationship observed between R-carbon and annual mean temperature (T) indicates that warming in Northeast China could reduce R-carbon. Significant positive relationships were observed between annual precipitation (P), the hydrothermal coefficient (defined as PEAT, where AT was accumulative temperature >= 10 degrees C), and Rcarbon, indicating that a cold, humid climate would enhance R-carbon. Current climate change in Northeast China, characterized by warming and drought, may form positive feedbacks with R-carbon in temperate wetlands and accelerate carbon loss from wetland soils.

AB The first dynamic model of dissolved organic Carbon (DOC) export in streams derived directly from high frequency (subhourly) observations sampled at a regular interval through contiguous storms is presented. The optimal model, identified using the recently developed RIVC algorithm, captured the rapid dynamics of DOC load from 15 min monitored rainfall with high simulation efficiencies and constrained uncertainty with a second-order (two-pathway) structure. Most of the DOC export in the four headwater basins studied was associated with the faster hydrometric pathway (also modeled in parallel), and was soon exhausted in the slower pathway. A delay in the DOC mobilization became apparent as the ambient temperatures increased. These features of the component pathways were quantified in the dynamic response characteristics (DRCs) identified by RIVC. The model and associated DRCs are intended as a foundation for a better understanding of storm-related DOC dynamics and predictability, given the increasing availability of subhourly DOC concentration data.

AB The complete life cycle of a permafrost mound is reconstructed from its growth until its degradation. The study site is a lithalsa, which is the subject of a long-term monitoring that includes geocryological observations, measurements of permafrost properties on cores, ground temperature measurements, and observations of landform changes. The landform likely grew as a palsa under cold climatic conditions in the past. The peat cover was subsequently eroded. Early stages of degradation are witnessed since 2003 as a new thermokarst pond is starting to form though mound collapse. Settlement of the structure has been observed, and a rim ridge has begun to form. Ultimately, the lithalsa shall disappear and be replaced by a circular thermokarst pond surrounded by a rampart, similar to many other ones in the study area. The monitoring of the thermal regime of the lithalsa illustrates the pattern of internal warming and points to the causes of its degradation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To improve knowledge of the distribution of species and modern pollen dispersal in the puna vegetation belt (central Andes) for palaeoenvironmental analysis and reconstructions.
   Location Puna belt, Nevado Coropuna, Western Cordillera, Peru.
   Methods The vegetation facies and belts of the area were mapped by remote sensing using a March 1998 SPOT4 image. This was complemented by the interpretation of aerial photographs, by field sampling, and by the identification of plants. Data from 1940 to 1994 from the Peruvian meteorological station network were modelled to characterize the relationship between climate and vegetation. Twenty-four soil-surface samples were collected in the various vegetation facies identified on the map, and standard palynological techniques were applied to analyse these samples. A principal components analysis was performed on the pollen data set.
   Results The map shows three bioclimatic belts and seven facies in the puna sensu lato, and identifies the main plants that are characteristic of each bioclimatic area. The pollen results fit the vegetation facies and belts, including the plant species of the distinct facies that are well represented in the pollen assemblages. The mesotropical belt is characterized by the predominance of Asteraceae-type Ambrosia; the supratropical belt shows significant frequencies of Asteraceae-type Senecio; the orotropical belt is characterized by high frequencies of Apiaceae and includes Polylepis woodland and peat bogs; and the cryorotropical belt shows significant frequencies of Asteraceae-type Senecio and Apiaceae.
   Main conclusions The pollen grains of the plants that grow on the puna sensu lato are generally entomophilous and are therefore not transported far from their plant source. The distinct bioclimatic facies and belts identified by the cartography can thus be well distinguished by their pollen production and deposition. We were therefore able to characterize the relationship between pollen, vegetation and climate that can be used for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. An altitudinal pollen gradient on the western slopes of the central Andes was revealed by the pollen study, with the succession of Asteraceae-type Ambrosia (1800-2200 m), Malvaceae (2700-3300 m), Asteraceae-type Senecio (3500-4100 m) and Apiaceae (above 4600 m).

AB Complementary to measurements in Antarctic ice cores, stomatal frequency analysis of leaves of land plants preserved in peat and lake deposits can provide a proxy record of preindustrial atmospheric CO2 concentration. CO2 trends based on leaf remains of Quercus robur (English oak) from the Netherlands support the presence of significant CO2 variability during the first half of the last millennium. The amplitude of the reconstructed multidecadal fluctuations, up to 34 parts per million by volume, considerably exceeds maximum shifts measured in Antarctic ice. Inferred changes in CO2 radiative forcing are of a magnitude similar to variations ascribed to other mechanisms, particularly solar irradiance and volcanic activity, and may therefore call into question the concept of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assumes an insignificant role of CO2 as a preindustrial climate-forcing factor. The stomata-based CO2 trends correlate with coeval sea-surface temperature trends in the North Atlantic Ocean, suggesting the possibility of an oceanic source/sink mechanism for the recorded CO2 changes.

AB Globally, lakes and reservoirs ecosystems are integral parts of ecological processes. Nevertheless, global warming is rapidly changing their function and sustainability, especially in the populated area of the northern hemisphere. Here we examined testate amoebae community and 10 environmental variables from 51 lakes and reservoirs across China and developed testate amoebae transfer functions for temperature based on both abundance- and biomass-datasets. A total of 169 testate amoebae taxa were identified. Our partial CCA analyses revealed that water temperature explained 5.15% (P = 0.006) and 5.57% (P = 0.008) of the total variance in testate amoebae abundance and biomass, respectively. The WA-PLS was the best model in abundance-based temperature transfer function (RMSEP= 2.87 degrees C, R-2 = 0.60), whereas the MAT proved to be the best model for biomass-based temperature transfer function (RMSEP= 3.34 degrees C, R-2 = 0.67). The application of all models should be carried out with suitable precautions. Our results suggested that freshwater testate amoebae could contribute to a better understanding of the ecological integrity and its vulnerability in inland aquatic environments.

AB Temperature variations at Lake Qinghai, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet plateau, were reconstructed based on four high resolution temperature indicators of the delta O-18 and the delta C-13 of the bulk carbonate, total carbonate content, and the detrended delta N-15 of the organic matter. There are four obvious cold intervals during the past 600 years at Lake Qinghai, namely 1430-1470, 1650-1715 1770-1820, and 1920-1940, synchronous with those recorded in tree rings at the northeast Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The intervals of 1430-1470, 1650-1715, and 1770-1820 are consistent with the three coldest intervals of the Little Ice Age. These obvious cold intervals are also synchronous with the minimums of the sunspot numbers during the past 600 years, suggesting that solar activities may dominate temperature variations on decadal scales at the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet plateau.

AB Changing winter climate extremes are expected to result in the poleward migration of mangrove forests at the expense of salt marshes. Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.

AB A field control experiment was carried out to determine the influence of water table changes on soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in Calamagrostis angustifolia freshwater marsh in Northeast of China. The results showed that the water depth of 5 cm below the ground surface increased soil CO2 emission, but there was no significant influence of deeper water table on gas emission. CH4 emission was accelerated by deep standing water and approached the peak in the plant booming time. This suggests that root activity has influence on CH4 production. The result also demonstrated that both low water table level and inundated environment would inhibit N2O emission. Comparing the total global warming potential of three gases under different conditions, it can be concluded that maintaining a comparatively steady water table near the soil surface can benefit soil carbon sequestration in the C. angustifolia marsh, and decrease of the greenhouse gases emissions to the atmosphere.

AB 1. The response of northern tundra plant communities to warming temperatures is of critical concern because permafrost ecosystems play a key role in global carbon (C) storage, and climate-induced ecological shifts in the plant community will affect the transfer of carbon-dioxide between biological and atmospheric pools.
   2. This study, which focuses on the response of tundra plant growth and phenology to experimental warming, was conducted at the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research project, located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep-soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming), and open-top chambers to increase summer air temperatures (summer warming).
   3. Winter warming increased wintertime soil temperature (5-40 cm) by 2.3 degrees C, resulting in a 10% increase in growing season thaw depth. Summer warming significantly increased growing season air temperature; peak temperature differences occurred near midday when summer warming plots were approximately 1.0 degrees C warmer than ambient plots.
   4. Changes in the soil environment as a result of winter warming treatment resulted in a 20% increase in above-ground biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP), while there was no detected summer warming effect on ecosystem-level ANPP or biomass. Both summer and winter warming extended the growing season through earlier bud break and delayed senescence, despite equivalent snow-free days across treatments. As with ANPP, winter warming increased canopy N mass by 20%, while there was no summer warming effect on canopy N.
   5. The warming-mediated increase in N availability, coupled with phenological shifts, may have driven higher rates of ANPP in the winter warming plots, and the lack of ecosystem-level N and ANPP response to summer warming suggest continued N limitation in the summer warming plots.
   6. Synthesis: These results highlight the role of soil and permafrost dynamics in regulating plant response to climate change and provide evidence that warming may promote greater C accumulation in tundra plant biomass. While warming temperatures are expected to enhance microbial decomposition of the large pool of organic matter stored in tundra soils and permafrost, these respiratory losses may be offset, at least in part, by warming-mediated increases in plant growth.

AB Few studies provide experimental data to support the role of permafrost thaw on changes in arctic freshwater chemistry. We designed an incubation experiment to look at rapid nutrient release from permafrost soils and active layer soils under different warming scenarios, changes in redox environment, and microbial activity. Permafrost soil tended to immediately release more nutrients than active layer soils, especially under warmer conditions; suggesting the active layer is depleted in nutrients and the water column may be re-supplied with these ions from thawing permafrost. The release of micronutrients (Ca, Fe, Mg, S, Si) from incubated permafrost soils responded strongly to increased temperature; however, temperature alone was not necessarily the primary driver of macronutrient (N, P) release from permafrost. Other physicochemical parameters influenced by temperature, such as oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), microbial activity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Fe played an additional role in nutrient release from permafrost. These experiments suggest nutrient release via thaw of permafrost soils is able to contribute ample essential nutrients to arctic aquatic ecosystems, even within one day of warming. Further warming of the Arctic is likely to result in substantial changes to nutrient availability and cycling in these dominant habitats.

AB Study results in this paper have indicated that the Holocene climate in Xinjiang, Northwestern China has been alternating between wet and dry conditions, and was punctuated with a series of abrupt climate shifts. A sediment core taken from Barkol Lake in the northern Xinjiang of Northwest China was analyzed at 1cm interval for grain-size distribution. Abrupt climate shifts revealed by the grain-size proxy occurred at ca 1.4, 3.0, 4.3, 5.6, 8.0 cal kyr B.P., which were well correlated to both the abrupt shifts recorded in the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) and the Holocene sea surface temperature (SST) cooling events in the Arabian Ocean. The correlation indicated that the climatic changes in the extreme and Northwest China were associated with the NAO, probably via the North Atlantic Oscillation-affected westerly winds. The strength and position of westerly winds probably modulated the Siberian-Mongolian high-pressure system (winter monsoon), and played an important role in climate change of Northwest China. Moreover, an evident drought interval during the middle Holocene was also revealed by grain-size proxy.

AB In southern Quebec (Charlevoix, Canada), reconstructions of the subalpine insect assemblages were made in environments that were transformed by fire during the late Holocene (since 4500 BP). The ecological requirements of beetle species likely to be found as fossils were studied by collecting living beetles in pitfall traps in forest, subalpine and alpine environments. The late-Holocene changes of insect assemblages were reconstructed by recovering fossil insects from 13 pear sections. Modem beetle assemblages are valuable indicators of tree cover. Well-developed podzol soils under peat, as well as numerous spruce charcoal remains overlaying the podzol in all sampling sites, suggest that a dense spruce cover was present before the beginning of the accumulation of peat, and was eliminated by lire (4570-800 BP). Ground beetle and bark beetle assemblages at the base of the pear sections contained a mixture of forest and open-environment species, indicating that the postfire environment was a subalpine one with a tree cover of 30-50%. The most recent fire in the area (AD 1915) increased the openness of the landscape (tree cover <30%). Forest ground beetles and bark beetles disappeared almost completely; only open-environment species remained. The late-Holocene history of the Charlevoix mountains as reconstructed using fossil insects is similar to that reconstructed using charcoal remains. However, fossil insects add significant information (tree cover, health of trees, forest composition) that is difficult to obtain using other macrofossils. This opens up new opportunities for palaeoecological studies in the boreal forest, which was formed during the Holocene epoch, and was frequently disturbed by fire and insect outbreaks.

AB Woodlands represent highly significant carbon sinks globally, though could lose this function under future climatic change. Effective large-scale monitoring of these woodlands has a critical role to play in mitigating for, and adapting to, climate change. Mediterranean woodlands have low carbon densities, but represent important global carbon stocks due to their extensiveness and are particularly vulnerable because the region is predicted to become much hotter and drier over the coming century. Airborne lidar is already recognized as an excellent approach for high-fidelity carbon mapping, but few studies have used multi-temporal lidar surveys to measure carbon fluxes in forests and none have worked with Mediterranean woodlands. We use a multi-temporal (5-year interval) airborne lidar data set for a region of central Spain to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) and carbon dynamics in typical mixed broadleaved and/or coniferous Mediterranean woodlands. Field calibration of the lidar data enabled the generation of grid-based maps of AGB for 2006 and 2011, and the resulting AGB change was estimated. There was a close agreement between the lidar-based AGB growth estimate (1.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and those derived from two independent sources: the Spanish National Forest Inventory, and a tree-ring based analysis (1.19 and 1.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). We parameterised a simple simulator of forest dynamics using the lidar carbon flux measurements, and used it to explore four scenarios of fire occurrence. Under undisturbed conditions (no fire) an accelerating accumulation of biomass and carbon is evident over the next 100 years with an average carbon sequestration rate of 1.95 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). This rate reduces by almost a third when fire probability is increased to 0.01 (fire return rate of 100 years), as has been predicted under climate change. Our work shows the power of multi-temporal lidar surveying to map woodland carbon fluxes and provide parameters for carbon dynamics models. Space deployment of lidar instruments in the near future could open the way for rolling out wide-scale forest carbon stock monitoring to inform management and governance responses to future environmental change.

AB Field data from 83 environmental monitoring stations across Labrador, 17 with permafrost, were used to analyze the interrelationships of key variables considered in the temperature at the top of permafrost model. Snow depth, not mean annual air temperature, was the strongest climatic determinant of mean temperatures at the ground surface and at the base of the annual freeze-thaw layer, and its variability was most closely related to land cover class. A critical late-winter snow depth of 70 cm or more was inferred to be sufficient to prevent the formation of permafrost at the monitoring sites, which meant that permafrost was absent beneath forest but present in some tundra, peatland and bedrock locations. Analyses showed no statistically significant relations identified between topographic indices and various station parameters, challenging their utility for regional modeling. Testing of several different land cover datasets for model parameterization gave errors in ground surface temperature ranging from +/- 0.9 to 2.1 degrees C. These results highlight the importance of local field data and emphasize the necessity of high-quality national-scale land cover datasets suitable for permafrost modeling.

AB Holocene sediments from Nelson Lake, on Michigan's eastern Upper Peninsula, provide isotopic, pollen, and charcoal evidence for a two-step sequence of changes in moisture source and increased lake-effect precipitation during the late Holocene. Between 8000 and 5300 cal yr B.P., a warm, dry climate and zonal atmospheric circulation produced enriched stable oxygen and carbon isotopic values in combination with high percentages of pine pollen and sustained influx of charcoal particles. After 5300 cal yr B.P., decreasing isotopic values in mart and increasing pollen percentages of mesic hardwoods and northern white cedar indicate increase meridional air flow and precipitation from cold winter storms generated in Alberta, Canada. After 3000 cal yr B.P., abrupt declines in values of delta(13)C and delta(18)O and increased pollen representation of hemlock, American beech, spruce, and aquatic plants indicate paludification from increased lake-effect snowfall. The moisture was derived from the Great Lakes and transported by Alberta cyclonic storms that were steered across Lakes Superior and Michigan by a southward shift in the modal winter position of the polar jet stream.

AB The fluxes Of CO2 and CH4 emission of the two types of primary swamp were measured in Sanjiang Plain using the opaque chamber and gas chromatogram technique. The mean value of ecosystem respiration flux in continuously inundated swamp ecosystem is 548.04 mg.m(-2).h(-1), lower than that of the seasonal inundated swamp (713.08 mg.m(-2).h(-1)). The peaks concentrated on July and August which are the growing period of the vegetation. CH4 emission was different from the respiration flux of ecosystem. The CH4 flux of continuously inundated swamp was 12.80 mg.m(-2.)h(-1), larger than that of the seasonal inundated swamp (8.56 mg.m(-2).h(-1)), and they were varied at different periods, the continuously inundated swamp emitted CH4 mainly from July to September, whereas from last August to middle September in the seasonal inundated swamp. The ecosystem respiration flux of the swamp has the significantly positive correlation with the soil temperature (0-10 cm depth) and the water temperature, but CH4 emission was associated with the soil temperature in a certain degree. The CH4 emission from swamp depends on the integral function of water table and soil temperature.

AB To date, few research have been reported on the evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation in southern China, and the main mechanism influencing the evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation is unclear. That makes it difficult for researchers to understand the competition mechanism of C-3 and C-4 plants under different climate environments and its relationship with the climate factors. It is also not conducive for researchers to assess the influence of future climate change on regional C-3/C-4 vegetation. Exactly, C-3/C-4 vegetation change in the regional-scale will have a significant impact on the global carbon cycle and agricultural production. Therefore, it is especially important to reconstruct the evolutionary history of C-3/C-4 vegetation in southern China and clarify the influencing mechanism of climate change. In this study, we systematically analyzed stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) of the long-chain n-alkanes in sediment samples from eight lakes and four peat profiles in southern China, to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation in these regions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and to investigate the climate factors that affect the C-4 plant abundance change in the research area. The integrated long-chain n-alkane (C-27-C-33) stable carbon isotope results of samples from Zhanjiang Huguangyan Maar Lake, Xingyun Lake, Lugu Lake and Dingnan peat showed that, from the LGM to the Early Holocene, C-4 plant relative abundance exhibited a gradually increasing trend from 21% to 34%. In the Middle Holocene, the C-4 plant abundance significantly declined and reached a lowest value of 10%. In space, the C-4 plant abundance generally exhibited a gradually declining trend from south to north in the LGM and the Early Holocene, while it showed an opposite trend in the Holocene Climate Optimum (6.0 cal ka BP). It reflected that the main influencing factor on C-4 plants spatial distribution was changing from temperature to precipitation. This study indicated that temperature was the dominant factor affecting C-4 plant distribution in southern China, however, when the temperature condition was appropriate, an increase in precipitation (especially more spring precipitation) would reduce the competitive advantages of C-4 plants. Therefore, the combination of temperature and seasonal precipitation was the important factor that determines the C-3/C-4 vegetation proportion change in the southern China. Under the premise that the temperature will rise and precipitation will increase in the future, the reduction of a competitive advantage for the C-4 plants could affect agricultural production in China.

AB Increases in ground temperature make soil organic carbon in permafrost environments highly vulnerable to release to the atmosphere. High-centred polygonal terrain is a form of patterned ground that may act as a large source of carbon to the atmosphere because thawing ice wedges can result in increased ground temperatures, soil moisture, and thaw depth. To evaluate the effect of ice wedge degradation on carbon flux, carbon emissions were characterized at two polygonal peatlands in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands in northern Canada. Opaque chambers were used to measure CO2 and CH4 emissions from nine nondegraded polygon centres and nine moderately degraded troughs four times during the growing season. To measure emissions from 10 ponds resulting from severe ice wedge degradation, wind diffusion models were used to characterize fluxes using CO2 and CH4 concentration measurements made in each pond. Our field data show that degraded troughs had increased ground temperature, deeper active layers, and increased CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our study shows that rates of CO2 and CH4 emissions from high-centreed polygonal terrain are likely to increase with more widespread melt pond formation in this terrain type.

AB Karkevagge, an alpine ecosystem in the subarctic, has been the subject of scientific study for half a century. We investigated the relationship of its vegetation to soil properties. At the lowest elevations, on stable portions of the landscape dominated by Betula and Empetrum, are found Spodosols developed in glacio-fluvial sediments. Cryosaprists occur in scattered bedrock depressions with bog-type vegetation. Cryofluvents are found in flood-prone areas covered by dwarf-willow thickets. Intermediate elevations have meadow-type vegetation with Cryofluvents on floodplains and on lower colluvial slopes, Cryaquents in wetter areas, and Cryorthents on steeper soliflucted slopes. Above that, on steep, west-facing Dryas-covered colluvial slopes, soils are Ca-rich Eutrocryepts and Haplocryolls. The highest-elevation soils are infertile with poor horizonation, despite their possible antiquity, and vegetation that is largely cryptogams. Dystrocryepts occur on more stable alpine locations; Cryorthents on soliflucted areas; and Haploturbels, with shallow permafrost, above 1400 m. Measured annual soil temperatures range from +2.4degreesC at a Dryas site to -3.4degreesC at 1585 to at an alpine cryptogam site. Vegetation distribution in Karkevagge is related to climatic factors, which are controlled by elevation and landscape position, and edaphic factors, which control soil moisture and nutrient availability.

AB Statistical correlations between seasonal air temperatures and snow depths and active layer depths and permafrost temperatures were analysed for tundra (Marre-Salle) and northern taiga (Nadym) sites in Western Siberia. Interannual variations in active layer depth in the tundra zone correlated with the average air temperature of the current summer, and in peatland and humid tundra, also with summer temperatures of the preceding 1-2 years. In the northern taiga zone, the active layer depth related to current summer air temperature and to a lesser extent, to spring and/or winter air temperatures. Variations in summer permafrost temperatures at 5-10 m depth were correlated with spring air temperatures in the current and preceding 1-2 years. The weather regime during the preceding 12 years, therefore, reinforced or weakened ground temperature variations in a given year. Overall, the most important factors influencing the permafrost regime were spring and summer air temperatures, and in one case snow depth. However, statistical links between meteorological and permafrost parameters varied between the tundra and northern taiga zones and among landscape types within each zone, emphasising the importance of analyses at short temporal scales and for individual terrain units.

AB Extreme global warmth and an abrupt negative carbon isotope excursion during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have been attributed to a massive release of methane hydrate from sediments on the continental slope [G.R. Dickens, J.R. O'Neil, D.K. Rea, R.M. Owen, Dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate as a cause of the carbon isotope excursion at the end of the Paleocene, Paleoceanography 10 (1995) 965-971.]. However, the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 degrees C [J.C. Zachos, M.W. Wara, S. Bohaty, M.L. Delaney, M.R. Petrizzo, A. Brill, T.J. Bralower, I. Premoli-Silva, A transient rise in tropical sea surface temperature during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, Science 302 (2003) 1551-1554.,J.P. Kennett, L.D. Stott, Abrupt deep-sea warming, paleoceanographic changes and benthic extinctions at the end of the Paleocene, Nature 353 (1991) 225-228.]) and rise in the depth of the CCD (> 2 km; [J.C. Zachos, U. Rohl, S.A. Schellenberg, D. Hodell, E. Thomas, A. Sluijs, C. Kelly, H. McCarren, D. Kroon, I. Raffi, L.J. Lourens, M. Nicolo, Rapid acidification of the ocean during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, Science 308 (2005) 1611-1615.]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM, for which there are several potential mechanisms. Production of thermogenic CH4 and CO2 during contact metamorphism associated with the intrusion of a large igneous province into organic rich sediments [H. Svensen, S. Planke, A. Malthe-Sorenssen, B. Jamtveit, R. Myklebust, T.R. Eidem, S.S. Rey, Release of methane from a volcanic basin as a mechanism for initial Eocene global warming, Nature 429 (2004).] is capable of supplying large amounts of carbon, but is inconsistent with the lack of extensive carbon loss in metamorphosed sediments, as well as the abrupt onset and termination of carbon release during the PETM. A global conflagration of Paleocene peatlands [A.C. Kurtz, L.R. Kump, M.A. Arthur, J.C. Zachos, A. Paytan, Early Cenozoic decoupling of the global carbon and sulfur cycles, Paleoceanography 18 (2003).] highlights a large terrestrial carbon source, but massive carbon release by fire seems unlikely as it would require that all peatlands burn at once and then for only 10 to 30 ky. In addition, this hypothesis requires an order of magnitude increase in the amount of carbon stored in peat. The isolation of a large epicontinental seaway by tectonic uplift associated with volcanism or continental collision, followed by desiccation and bacterial respiration of the aerated organic matter is another potential mechanism for the rapid release of large amounts Of CO2. In addition to the oxidation of the underlying marine sediments, the desiccation of a major epicontinental seaway would remove a large source of moisture for the continental interior, resulting in the desiccation and bacterial oxidation of adjacent terrestrial wetlands.

AB During winter when the active layer of Arctic and alpine soils is below 0 degrees C, soil microbes are alive but metabolizing slowly, presumably in contact with unfrozen water. This unfrozen water is at the same negative chemical potential as the ice. While both the hydrostatic and the osmotic components of the chemical potential will contribute to this negative value, we argue that the osmotic component (osmotic potential) is the significant contributor. Hence, the soil microorganisms need to be at least halotolerant and psychrotolerant to survive in seasonally frozen soils. The low osmotic potential of unfrozen soil water will lead to the withdrawal of cell water, unless balanced by accumulation of compatible solutes. Many microbes appear to survive this dehydration, since microbial biomass in some situations is high, and rising, in winter. In late winter however, before the soil temperature rises above zero, there can be a considerable decline in soil microbial biomass due to the loss of compatible solutes from viable cells or to cell rupture. This decline may be caused by changes in the physical state of the system, specifically by sudden fluxes of melt water down channels in frozen soil, rapidly raising the chemical potential. The dehydrated cells may be unable to accommodate a rapid rise in osmotic potential so that cell membranes rupture and cells lyse. The exhaustion of soluble substrates released from senescing plant and microbial tissues in autumn and winter may also limit microbial growth, while in addition the rising temperatures may terminate a winter bloom of psychrophiles. Climate change is predicted to cause a decline in plant production in these northern soils, due to summer drought and to an increase in freeze-thaw cycles. Both of these may be expected to reduce soil microbial biomass in late winter. After lysis of microbial cells this biomass provides nutrients for plant growth in early spring. These feedbacks in turn, could affect herbivory and production at higher trophic levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Shifts in temperature and rainfall regimes with climate change can feed back on redox dynamics and associated biogeochemical cycling in humid environments. This has global implications for greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem carbon (C) storage and loss. Though aerobic carbon dioxide (CO2) production is generally understood to follow an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence, the temperature sensitivity of anaerobic metabolisms such as iron (Fe) reduction and methane (CH4) fluxes, both processes affecting C cycling in soils, remains unclear in upland soils. We used a fully factorial incubation experiment to examine the interactive effects of temperature (8, 26, and 35 degrees C) and redox (oxic and anoxic) conditions on CO2 production, CH4 fluxes, Fe reduction, microbial biomass C, and the microbial metabolic quotient (MMQ) in upland soils from two contrasting climate regimes and redox environments: a tropical forest in Puerto Rico (PR) and a temperate peatland in California (CA). Under oxic conditions, we found that CO2 production increased across both temperature gradients (8-26 degrees C and 26-35 degrees C). In contrast, under anoxic conditions, net CH4 fluxes and Fe reduction exhibited a greater temperature sensitivity between 26 and 35 degrees C than 8-26 degrees C in both PR and CA soils. We also observed coupling between Fe reduction and net CH4 fluxes in PR and CA soils consistent with competition for acetate. The anoxic MMQ increased in PR soils at high temperature, but not in CA soils, suggesting that the native PR environment may favor the development of more efficient microbial communities better able to tolerate warmer, wetter conditions. Together, our results suggest that anaerobic microbial metabolisms may be much more sensitive to higher temperature than aerobic ones, possibly due to proportionally greater anaerobic microbial activity at high temperature. Our results suggest that increased global temperatures combined with higher rainfall regimes may significantly increase anaerobic greenhouse gas production in humid environments.

AB A process-based reservoir model of Flooded Forest Denitrification Decomposition (FF-DNDC) was developed to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from flooded boreal landscapes. The reservoir model is based on Forest-DNDC, a terrestrial biogeochemistry model which supports detailed soil carbon (C) processes including redox chemistry, with modification to represent the disturbed soil and vegetation C dynamics due to the presence of an overlying water column on the ecosystems. Soil decomposition rates and temperature and oxygen profiles were changed, and sedimentation to the soil surface was added. FF-DNDC was evaluated using CO2 exchange measurements from the newly created Eastmain-1 reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada. For the first four years of the reservoir (2006 to 2009), simulated daily CO2 emissions averaged 1.42 g C m(-2) d(-1) (ranging from 0.75 to 3.24 g C m(-2) d(-1)) from the flooded forest and 0.74 g Cm-2 d(-1) (ranging from 0.51 to 1.09 gC m(-2) d(-1)) from the flooded peatland. The simulated emissions were smaller than the thin-filmed boundary layer exchanges based on measured partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) but were larger than the exchanges measured using an eddy covariance system. However, the temporal patterns of simulated and measured exchanges were similar. We simulated potential CO2 emissions over 100 years, the expected operating lifetime of the reservoir, with assuming no change in climate. Simulated CO2 emissions decreased with time since flooding especially for the first four decades. The 100-year cumulative emissions from the flooded peatland were larger than those from the flooded forest. Sensitivity analysis indicated that vegetation and soil inputs and parameters controlling the quality and/or quantity of decomposable soil C in flooded ecosystems (e.g. woody vegetation biomass, soil organic carbon in organic and mineral layers, and carbon:nitrogen ratio in woody vegetation and soil) were important to the reservoir CO2 emission.

AB Bacterial mineralization of allochthonous (soil) dissolved organic matter (DOM) in boreal waters governs the CO2 flux from the lakes and rivers to the atmosphere, which is one of the main factor of carbon balance in high latitudes. However, the fate of colloidal trace element (TE) during bacterial processing of DOM remains poorly constrained. We separated monoculture of Pseudomonas saponiphila from a boreal creek and allowed it to react with boreal Fe-rich peat leachate of approximate colloidal (3 kDa-0.45 mu m) composition C1000Fe12Al3.3Mg2Ca3.7P1.2Mn0.1Ba0.5 in nutrient-free media. The total net decrease of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) concentration over 4 day of exposure was within 5% of the initial value, whereas the low molecular weight fraction of C-org (LMW< 3 kDa) yielded a 16%-decrease due to long-term bio-uptake or coagulation. There was a relative depletion in Fe over C-org of 0.45 mu m, colloidal and LMW fraction in the course of peat leachate interaction with P. saponiphila. Al, Mn, Ni, Cu, Ga, REEs, Y, U were mostly affected by bacterial presence and exhibited essentially the adsorption at the cell surface over first hours of reaction, in contrast to Fe, Ti, Zr, and Nb that showed both short-term adsorption and long-term removal by physical coagulation/coprecipitation with Fe hydroxide. The low molecular weight fraction (LMW< 3 kDa) of most TE was a factor of 2-5 less affected by microbial presence via adsorption or removal than the high molecular weight (HMW) colloidal fractions (< 0.45 mu m and < 50 kDa). The climate change-induced acceleration of heterotrophic bacterial activity in boreal and subarctic waters may lead to preferential removal of Fe over DOC from conventionally dissolved fraction and the decrease of the proportion of LMW < 3 kDa fraction and the increase of HMW colloids. Enhanced heterotrophic mineralization of organo-ferric colloids under climate warming scenario may compensate for on-going ''browning" of surface waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB National parks are supposed to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with species and ecosystems. Detailed knowledge about past vegetation and disturbance regimes therefore forms an important basis for appropriate management. In the Bavarian Forest National Park in SE Germany, we therefore studied fossil pollen, spores and macrofossils from lake Rachelsee, a nearby mire, and Stangenfilz mire, all lying at higher elevations. Results indicate that deciduous forest on lower slopes (ca. 500-1,000 m a.s.l.) were first affected by humans in Neolithic times ca. 4500 bc with marked declines of Tilia, Ulmus and Fraxinus. High-montane mixed forests (1,000-1,450 m a.s.l.) were in a near-natural state consisting of Picea, Abies and Fagus in comparable proportions up to ca. 500 bc (a natural baseline condition), after which they were impacted by forest grazing and/or logging, starting between early-Roman times to early-Medieval times depending on location. Abies especially declined markedly. Forest partially recovered during the migration period fifth-eighth century ad, especially Carpinus, but not Abies. Subsequently, deforestation increased at lower elevation for food production, and forest grazing and wood extraction at higher elevation led to a further strong decline of Abies around ad 1000 near Rachelsee. After that, nutrient levels increased continually at all elevations, and a forest fire occurred in the 13th century near Stangenfilz. During the 19th century, forests around Rachelsee recovered partially whereas overgrazing of Stangenfilz resulted in a hiatus. Forests declined further in the 20th century around the study sites, but after ca. ad 1960 less so around Rachelsee thanks to local conservation measures. Historically recorded large-scale bark-beetle infestations following heavy storms, such as in the ad 1870s and 1980s, hardly left traces in the pollen data. From a palaeoecological perspective the Park's no-intervention management strategy is well-suited to facilitate recovery of original forest functioning and diversity, as it is slowly leading to renewal of natural mixed forest of Abies, Picea and Fagus. This development may have considerable influence on the future disturbance regime, and the insights obtained will be important for the park management.

AB Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from terrestrial ecosystems are important for the atmospheric chemistry and the formation of secondary organic aerosols, and may therefore influence the climate. Global warming is predicted to change patterns in precipitation and plant species compositions, especially in arctic regions where the temperature increase will be most pronounced. These changes are potentially highly important for the BVOC emissions but studies investigating the effects are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality and quantity of BVOC emissions from a high arctic soil moisture gradient extending from dry tundra to a wet fen. Ecosystem BVOC emissions were sampled five times in the July-August period using a push-pull enclosure technique, and BVOCs trapped in absorbent cartridges were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Plant species compositions were estimated using the point intercept method. In order to take into account important underlying ecosystem processes, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem production were measured in connection with chamber-based BVOC measurements. Highest emissions of BVOCs were found from vegetation communities dominated by Salix arctica and Cassiope tetragon, which had emission profiles dominated by isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively. These results show that emissions of BVOCs are highly dependent on the plant cover supported by the varying soil moisture, suggesting that high arctic BVOC emissions may affect the climate differently if-soil water content and plant cover change.

AB Episodic acidification during snowmelt is a natural phenomenon that can be intensified by acidic deposition from heavy industry. In Canada's oil sands region, acid deposition is estimated to be as much as 5% of the Canadian total and large tracks of northeastern Alberta are considered acid-sensitive because of extensive peatland habitats with poorly weathered soils. To identify the frequency, duration and severity of acidification episodes during snowmelt (the predominant hydrological period for delivery of priority pollutants from atmospheric oil sands emissions to surface waters), a 25-year record (1989 to 2014) of automated water quality data (pH, temperature, conductivity) was assembled for 3 rivers along with a shorter record (2012-2014) for another 2 rivers. Acidic episodes (pH < 7, ANC < 0) were recorded during 39% of all 83 snowmelt events. The severity (duration x magnitude) of episodic acidification increased exponentially over the study period (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01) and was strongly correlated (P < 0.01) with increasing maximum air temperature and weakly correlated with regional land development (P = 0.06). Concentrations of aluminum and 11 priority pollutants (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se, Ag, TI and Zn) were greatest (P <0.01) during low (<6.5) pH episodes, particularly when coincident with high discharge, such that aluminum and copper concentrations were at times high enough to pose a risk to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although low pH (pH < 6.5) was observed during only 8% of 32 acidification episodes, when present, low pH typically lasted 10 days. Episodic surface water acidification during snowmelt, and its potential effects on aquatic biota, is therefore an important consideration in the design of long-term monitoring of these typically alkaline (pH = 7.72 +/- 0.05) rivers.

AB The alpine wetlands of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) contribute 30%-40% of China's natural wetlands, and they are experiencing changes in climate, i.e. warming of 0.26 degrees C 10 yr(-1) (since the 1950s), as well as considerable human impacts. Consequently, alpine wetland extent show strong response to these impacts in most part, a reduction since the 1970s, followed by a recovery since the 2000s. In the eastern TP, they suffered stronger human regulations in Zoige mires, i.e. decades' drainage and recent restoration. These alpine wetlands have long been considered as a vital CH4 source, while inventories and model simulations estimated these wetlands emit roughly 1 Tg CH4-C yr(-1) and predicted an increase due to increased temperature and recovery of wetland extent. The alpine wetlands are generally a CO2 sink of roughly 15.8 Tg CO2 yr(-1), mitigating half of their emitted CH4, and satellite-based observations of vegetation greening have observed that their plants took more CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, the alpine wetlands provide a biophysical cooling effect, due to higher evaporative energy loss during early growing seasons. Variations in both climate changes and human influences have been well documented and indicate that these alpine wetlands provide vital feedbacks to the climate.

AB Black spruce forests are a dominant covertype in the boreal forest region, and they inhabit landscapes that span a wide range of hydrologic and thermal conditions. These forests often have large stores of soil organic carbon. Recent increases in temperature at northern latitudes may be stimulating decomposition rates of this soil carbon. It is unclear, however, how changes in environmental conditions influence decomposition in these systems, and if substrate controls of decomposition vary with hydrologic and thermal regime. We addressed these issues by investigating the effects of temperature, moisture, and organic matter chemical characteristics on decomposition of fibric soil horizons from three black spruce forest sites. The sites varied in drainage and permafrost, and included a "Well Drained" site where permafrost was absent, and "Moderately well Drained" and "Poorly Drained" sites where permafrost was present at about 0.5 m depth. Samples collected from each site were incubated at five different moisture contents (2, 25, 50, 75, and 100% saturation) and two different temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C) in a full factorial design for two months. Organic matter chemistry was analyzed using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry prior to incubation, and after incubation on soils held at 20 degrees C, 50% saturation. Mean cumulative mineralization, normalized to initial carbon content, ranged from 0.2% to 4.7%, and was dependent on temperature, moisture, and site. The effect of temperature on mineralization was significantly influenced by moisture content, as mineralization was greatest at 20 degrees C and 50-75% saturation. While the relative effects of temperature and moisture were similar for all soils, mineralization rates were significantly greater for samples from the "Well Drained" site compared to the other sites. Variations in the relative abundances of polysaccharide-derivatives and compounds of undetermined source (such as toluene, phenol, 4-methyl phenol, and several unidentifiable compounds) could account for approximately 44% of the variation in mineralization across all sites under ideal temperature and moisture conditions. Based on our results, changes in temperature and moisture likely have similar, additive effects on in situ soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition across a wide range of black spruce forest systems, while variations in SOM chemistry can lead to significant differences in decomposition rates within and among forest sites.

AB Smoldering combustion is an important combustion process in wildfires; however, there are fewer experimental studies recorded in the literature in comparison with flaming combustion. An experimental study was conducted to characterize the initiation of smoldering and flaming combustion of biomass using temporal and spatial temperature profiles, mass loss profiles, and gas analyses. The results show that the peak temperature, temperature rise rate, and average mass loss rate of flaming combustion are much higher than those of smoldering combustion. The results on the ratio of CO to CO2 for flaming and smoldering combustion show good agreement with the data reported in the literature. The results also show that smoldering combustion can be initiated only under a low air flow; for the experimental apparatus used, this corresponded to flow velocity of <= 38.1 mm.s(-1). A combustion progress pathway diagram was developed that describes the stages of smoldering and flaming combustion of a single dry biomass particle. An analysis of combustion kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) and an energy balance analysis were also conducted to understand the differences between smoldering and flaming combustion.

SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION

DT Article
DE Peat fire; Climate change; Acid sulphate soils; Acid-buffering capacity;
   Groundwater
AB Declining rainfall and extraction of groundwater increase the vulnerability of wetland sediments to ignition and combustion. This study investigated the existence of a unique hydrochemical porewater signal associated with organic-rich sulfidic sediments that have been overheated, dried, cracked, and burnt, by the passage of fire. Porewater was collected from wetland sediments with recent fire histories, as well as a wetland that had not suffered any type of burn in recent times (i.e. 5+ years). The results show that fire brought about elevated base cation concentrations in addition to substantial increase in oxidation of sulfidic wetland sediments, the generation of acidic porewaters, and the concomitant mobilisation of metal species. These changes were episodic in nature, varying with seasonal fluctuations of groundwater and sediment hydration and saturation, and persistent for at least several years. The seasonally episodic nature of acid generation following fire leads to the depletion of the acid-neutralising capacity of the sediments (potentially faster than would otherwise have occurred as a result of drought-induced acidification events alone) and ultimately exhausts the buffering capacity of the sediments.

AB Annual catchment export of total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total iron (Fe), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to seven lakes in central Ontario was measured between 1978 and 1998. Fluctuations in annual water discharge and total DOC load (including precipitation) to the lakes over the 20-year period were similar in the seven study lakes. DOC export to the lakes responded proportionally to changes in discharge, decreasing during drier and warmer years. There were similar but less accentuated variations in annual DOC lake concentrations. There were no clear regional trends evident during the 20-year period toward drier or wetter conditions, less DOC load, clearer lakes, etc., that could be interpreted as signaling a shift toward a different equilibrium state. The fraction of the DOC load retained by lakes (transferred to sediments and the atmosphere) increased during an extended dry period. Fe, TP, and DON export decreased more than DOC export during the extended dry period. Runoff appears to affect Fe, TP, and DON export first by controlling export of organic matter and second by affecting water table position and thus redox levels in the surface layer of peatlands. Permanently drier conditions with less runoff would likely lead to clearer lakes that are less productive. Conversely, increased runoff would lead to more colored and productive lakes. Both scenarios have implications for subsistence and sport fishing economies.

AB According to recent studies, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in rivers throughout the boreal zone are increasing. However, the mechanistic explanation of this phenomenon is not yet well known. We studied how the short and long-term changes in precipitation, soil temperature, soil water content, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) are reflected to DOC concentrations and runoff DOC fluxes in two small forested upland catchments in Southern Finland. We used continuous eddy covariance measurements above the forest and runoff flow measurements from the catchment areas conducted over a 15 year long time period to study the correlation between NEE, gross photosynthetic production, total ecosystem respiration, litter production, and runoff DOC. In addition, we looked for the most important environmental variables in explaining the interannual changes in runoff DOC by using multiple linear regression. Finally, we studied the temporal connection between runoff DOC concentrations, precipitation, soil water content, and NEE by using wavelet coherence analysis technique. Our results indicate that the DOC concentrations have increased over the last 15 years. The DOC flux was to a large extent determined by the amount of precipitation, but the previous year's NEE and litter production had also a small but significant effect on runoff DOC fluxes.

AB The amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the high Arctic is generally poorly constrained. Because of periglacial processes such as frost churning and sequestration in frozen soils, a substantial amount of SOC is typically not inventoried. This study provides a detailed study of SOC content by depth in 55 soil pits in a high Arctic ecosystem of northwest Greenland. Sampling sites spanned ecosystems from mires to polar deserts, from sea level to the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and across various periglacial features. The amount of SOC in the various ecosystems was mapped using a correlation of SOC with high-resolution ASTER satellite imagery and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) classes from the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map. On the basis of this correlation, the total carbon was extrapolated to greater areas of the high Arctic. Our study found the amount of SOC in the high Arctic has typically been grossly underestimated, remarkably by the greatest amount in the most barren environments of the polar desert. We estimate that the high Arctic contains about 12 Pg SOC, a factor of over 5 times greater the most cited values previously reported. Since our estimate was only assessed in seasonally frozen ground, additional carbon frozen in the permafrost is likely present and potentially available in the event of permafrost thawing due to warming of the Arctic.

AB Mangrove surface elevation was measured by means of the Surface Elevation Table and Marker Horizon technique (SET-MH) in a range of settings in southeastern Australia. Despite sustained vertical accretion, surface elevation declined at most sites with the onset of an El Nino drought in 2001-2002. At these sites, the Southern Oscillation Index accounted for 70-85% of variability in surface elevation over a 3-year period. At deltaic island sites, this trend was not evident, an observation we attribute to lower terrestrial groundwater inputs. At one site (Homebush Bay), a high correlation was found between surface elevation and groundwater depth, monitored approximately every 2 weeks for 4 months. At the same site, the diurnal astronomical tide was also found to significantly affect mangrove surface elevation, although not to the extent of the El Nino drought. Models of the response of mangroves to sea-level rise on the basis of contemporary processes should account for short-term perturbations, such as climate variability at regional and local scales.

AB Understanding the fire evolution history and its driving mechanisms can provide useful insights into the fire regimes and their potential impacts in the future. Here, we present a well-dated peat profile with high-resolution charcoal and pollen records to reconstruct the fire and vegetation history in the Sanjiang Plain over the last 6000 yr. The regional and local fire frequencies were reconstructed with the microscopic (<125 mu m) and macroscopic (>125 mu m) charcoal fractions, respectively. During the interval similar to 6.0-4.5 ka BP, both the regional and local fires exhibited much low frequencies responding to the strong summer monsoon. Thereafter, the fire frequencies increased significantly with the decline of the summer monsoon, and the highest frequencies corresponded well with the weak monsoon intervals around 4.0, 2.7, and 0.8 ka BP. As for the local fires, in addition to the climate changes, the local vegetation conditions have also served an important role in driving their occurrences. During the last 300 yr, the gradually increased fire frequencies were attributed to the intensified human activities instead of the climate and vegetation influences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extratropical cyclones in winter and their characteristics are investigated in depth for the Atlantic European region, as they are responsible for a significant part of the rainfall and extreme wind and/or precipitation-induced hazards. The analysis is based on a seamless transient simulation with a state-of-the-art fully coupled Earth system model from 850 to 2100 CE. The Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario is used in the 21st century. During the Common Era, cyclone characteristics show pronounced variations on interannual and decadal timescales, but no external forcing imprint is found prior to 1850. Thus, variations of extratropical cyclone characteristics are mainly caused by internal variability of the coupled climate system. When anthropogenic forcing becomes dominant in the 20th century, a decrease of the cyclone occurrences mainly over the Mediterranean and a strong increase of extreme cyclone-related precipitation become detectable. The latter is due to thermodynamics as it follows the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. An important finding, though, is that the relation between temperature and extreme cyclone-related precipitation is not always controlled by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which suggests that dynamical processes can play an important role in generating extreme cyclone-related precipitation - for example, in the absence of anomalously warm background conditions. Thus, the importance of dynamical processes, even on decadal timescales, might explain the conundrum that proxy records suggest enhanced occurrence of precipitation extremes during rather cold periods in the past.

LA English
DT Article; Data Paper
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park (TDNP) is a Ramsar Medi-terranean wetland area designated as Biosphere Reserve by Unesco. The whole system dried out during a long drought period in the past decade (2006-2009) and a smouldering peat fire took place in 2009. The physical and chemical properties of sediments were significantly disturbed by the fire. To date, the ecological system has not fully recovered from the impact. We present a raw data collection of the chemical composition of soil, groundwater and surface water sampled over four consecutive years in 2006-2010. The data include major and minor anions and cations, nutrients and heavy metals. Sampling points were located inside and outside TDNP both upstream as well as downstream. The information provided can be used to analyse the medium and long term impact of drought and smouldering fire to the TDNP environment. It is also a baseline for hydro-ecological modelling of the impact of climate change in arid and semiarid wetlands to develop adaptive management strategies. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB This synthesis paper summarizes published proxy climate evidence showing the spatial and temporal pattern of climate change through the Holocene in Arctic Canada and Greenland. Our synthesis includes 47 records from a recently published database of highly resolved Holocene paleoclimate time series from the Arctic (Sundqvist et al., 2014). We analyze the temperature histories represented by the database and compare them with paleoclimate and environmental information from 54 additional published records, mostly from datasets that did not fit the selection criteria for the Arctic Holocene database. Combined, we review evidence from a variety of proxy archives including glaciers (ice cores and glacial geomorphology), lake sediments, peat sequences, and coastal and deep-marine sediments. The temperature-sensitive records indicate more consistent and earlier Holocene warmth in the north and east, and a more diffuse and later Holocene thermal maximum in the south and west. Principal components analysis reveals two dominant Holocene trends, one with early Holocene warmth followed by cooling in the middle Holocene, the other with a broader period of warmth in the middle Holocene followed by cooling in the late Holocene. The temperature decrease from the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C on average (n = 11 sites). The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka, consistent with many sites from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions around that time. The spatial pattern of temperature change through the Holocene was likely driven by the decrease in northern latitude summer insolation through the Holocene, the varied influence of waning ice sheets in the early Holocene, and the variable influx of Atlantic Water into the study region.

AB A physically based one-dimensional sharp-interface model of active layer evolution and permafrost thaw is presented. This computationally efficient, semianalytical, nonequilibrium solution to soil freeze-thaw problems in partially saturated media is proposed as a component of hydrological models to describe seasonal ground ice, active layer evolution, and changes in permafrost temperature and extent. The model is developed and validated against the analytical Stefan solution and a finite volume coupled heat and mass transfer model of freeze-thaw in unsaturated porous media. Unlike analytic models, the interface model provides a nonequilibrium solution to the heat equation while permitting a wide range of temporally variable boundary conditions and supporting the simulation of multiple interfaces between frozen and unfrozen soils. The model is implemented for use in discontinuous permafrost peatlands where soil properties are highly dependent on soil ice content and infiltration capacity is high. It is demonstrated that the model is suitable for the representation of variably saturated active layer and permafrost evolution in cases both with and without a talik.
   Key Points
   A novel semianalytical model of soil freeze and thaw is presented for application in hydrology The model is numerically stable and scale insensitive The model is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than continuum equivalent

Estimates based on radiocarbon dating suggest the water level has been rising 20 cm/century over the last three hundred years. This estimate is consistent with lake level records and models of isostatic uplift which suggest the level of the lake should be rising between 6.7 and 12 cm/century along the south shore. However, additional radiocarbon dates on submerged trees from Observation Point, at the north end of South Basin, and the Spider Islands, near the northern outlet, indicate that at least part of the water-level rise is basin wide.
   Southward transgression of Lake Winnipeg, throughout the Holocene, is believed to be the result of isostatic tilting of the basin, whereas the recent basin-wide water-level rise is more likely the result of a combination of isostatic tilting and increased precipitation associated with climate change.

AB The Little Ice Age is the most noted climatological event in recent history with dramatic consequences for a large part of the western European coastal landscape. A major morphological feature associated with this event is the presence of large-scale transgressive dune fields that actively advanced inland, encroaching, in some cases, human settlements and directly affecting coastal communities. Several hypotheses exist to explain the formation of such features, which purport increased storminess, sea-level changes, or human activities as the major drivers of the relatively well-documented enhanced aeolian activity during this event. However, these hypotheses do not explain entirely the whole process by which dunes are set into movement. Here, we show the temporal and spatial distribution of this event in terms of impact over the coast, focusing on the mobilization of coastal dunes and then elaborate a new conceptual model that explains the onset and evolution pathways of coastal dunes after the impact of the Little Ice Age. Our model proposes the combined effect of storms and other parameters to explain the initiation phases of the process, when sand becomes available and blown by the very strong winds associated with documented higher frequency and intensity of storms occurring during this period.

AB Permafrost thaw can alter the soil environment through changes in soil moisture, frequently resulting in soil saturation, a shift to anaerobic decomposition, and changes in the plant community. These changes, along with thawing of previously frozen organic material, can alter the form and magnitude of greenhouse gas production from permafrost ecosystems. We synthesized existing methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production measurements from anaerobic incubations of boreal and tundra soils from the geographic permafrost region to evaluate large-scale controls of anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production and compare the relative importance of landscape-level factors (e.g., vegetation type and landscape position), soil properties (e.g., pH, depth, and soil type), and soil environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and relative water table position). We found fivefold higher maximum CH4 production per gram soil carbon from organic soils than mineral soils. Maximum CH4 production from soils in the active layer (ground that thaws and refreezes annually) was nearly four times that of permafrost per gram soil carbon, and CH4 production per gram soil carbon was two times greater from sites without permafrost than sites with permafrost. Maximum CH4 and median anaerobic CO2 production decreased with depth, while CO2:CH4 production increased with depth. Maximum CH4 production was highest in soils with herbaceous vegetation and soils that were either consistently or periodically inundated. This synthesis identifies the need to consider biome, landscape position, and vascular/moss vegetation types when modeling CH4 production in permafrost ecosystems and suggests the need for longer-term anaerobic incubations to fully capture CH4 dynamics. Our results demonstrate that as climate warms in arctic and boreal regions, rates of anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production will increase, not only as a result of increased temperature, but also from shifts in vegetation and increased ground saturation that will accompany permafrost thaw.

AB Mountain glaciers and their sediments are prominent witnesses of climate change, responding sensitively to even small modifications in meteorological parameters. Even in such a classical and thoroughly studied area as the European Alps the record of Holocene glacier mass-balance is only incompletely known. Here we explore a novel and continuous archive of glacier fluctuations in a cave system adjacent to the Upper Grindelwald Glacier in the Swiss Alps. Milchbach cave became partly ice-free only recently and hosts Holocene speleothems. Four coeval stalagmites show consistent petrographic and stable isotopic changes between 9.2 and 2.0 ka which can be tied to abrupt modifications in the cave environment as a result of the closing and opening of multiple cave entrances by the waxing and waning of the nearby glacier. During periods of Holocene glacier advances, columnar calcite fabric is characterized by delta O-18 values of about -8.0%. indicative of speleothem growth under quasi-equilibrium conditions, i.e. little affected by kinetic effect related to forced degassing or biological processes. In contrast, fabrics formed during periods of glacier minima are typical of bacterially mediated calcite precipitation within caves overlain by an alpine soil cover. Moreover, delta O-18 values of the bacterially mediated calcite fabrics are consistent with a ventilated cave system fostering kinetic fractionation. These data suggest that glacier retreats occurred repeatedly before 5.8 ka, and that the amplitudes of glacier retreats became substantially smaller afterwards. Our reconstruction of the Upper Grindelwald Glacier fluctuations agrees well with paleoglaciological studies from other sites in the Alps and provides a higher temporal resolution compared to traditional analyses of peat and wood remains found in glacier forefields.

AB Soil hydrothermal dynamics, resulting from the freezing and thawing processes in the active layer and their influencing factors, were studied in the upper Heihe River Basin (UHRB) in the Qilian Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Soil temperature and water content measurements were taken in the active layer of the UHRB in alpine grassland from 2013 to 2014. The results showed that the thaw rate of the active layer was significantly smaller in alpine paludal meadows than the thaw rate in alpine meadows and alpine steppes. This was mainly related to the hydrothermal properties of soils in the active layer, such as moisture content, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. During the thawing process, the active layer soil water content was higher and fluctuated less in alpine paludal meadows. Conversely, the soil water content was lower and fluctuated more significantly in alpine meadows and alpine steppes. These findings could be explained by the prevalence of peat soils, with a low bulk density, and high clay and organic matter content. By contrast, the soil particles in the active layer of alpine meadows and alpine steppes were significantly coarser, with higher bulk density and lower organic matter content. During the freezing process, gravel content and soil texture had a great impact on the unfrozen water content in the frozen soils. However, the factors influencing the soil water retention in frozen soils are complex, and further study is needed. These results provide theoretical support for the evaluation of the hydrological characteristics of the alpine permafrost zone in the Qilian Mountains. Furthermore, the effect of frozen ground on hydrological changes due to climate change in the Heihe River Basin can be simulated and predicted, providing a scientific basis for the ecological conservation of the Qilian Mountains National Park.

AB There is a need for methodology to warm open-field plots in order to study the likely effects of global warming on ecosystems in the future. Herein, we describe the development of arrays of more powerful and efficient infrared heaters with ceramic heating elements. By tilting the heaters at 45 degrees from horizontal and combining six of them in a hexagonal array, good uniformity of warming was achieved across 3-m-diameter plots. Moreover, there do not appear to be obstacles (other than financial) to scaling to larger plots. The efficiency [eta(h) (%); thermal radiation out per electrical energy in] of these heaters was higher than that of the heaters used in most previous infrared heater experiments and can be described by: eta(h) = 10 + 25exp(-0.17 u), where u is wind speed at 2 m height (m s(-1)). Graphs are presented to estimate operating costs from degrees of warming, two types of plant canopy, and site windiness. Four such arrays were deployed over plots of grass at Haibei, Qinghai, China and another at Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA, along with corresponding reference plots with dummy heaters. Proportional integral derivative systems with infrared thermometers to sense canopy temperatures of the heated and reference plots were used to control the heater outputs. Over month-long periods at both sites, about 75% of canopy temperature observations were within 0.5 degrees C of the set-point temperature differences between heated and reference plots. Electrical power consumption per 3-m-diameter plot averaged 58 and 80 kW h day(-1) for Haibei and Cheyenne, respectively. However, the desired temperature differences were set lower at Haibei (1.2 degrees C daytime, 1.7 degrees C night) than Cheyenne (1.5 degrees C daytime, 3.0 degrees C night), and Cheyenne is a windier site. Thus, we conclude that these hexagonal arrays of ceramic infrared heaters can be a successful temperature free-air-controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system for warming ecosystem field plots.

AB Unstable snow cover and more frequent freeze-thaw events have been predicted for montane areas in southern Norway, where stable winters are common today. These systems are important contributors to the flux of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) to air and water. Here we quantify and compare the effects of freeze-thaw on C and N release from soils collected below Calluna, Molinia or Sphagnum. Intact organic soil cores were subjected to four different freeze-thaw regimes for four consecutive 2-week periods: (1) slow cycling (SC) with one long freezing event during each 2-week period, (2) fast cycling (FC) with four short freezing events during each 2-week period, (3) permanent frost (PF) and (4) permanent thaw (PT). The freezing temperature was -5 degrees C and the thawing temperature was 5 degrees C. Before start of treatment, at the end of each 2-week period, and during postincubation periods, carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emission as well as leachable dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved organic N (DON), ammonium (NH(4)), nitrate (NO(3)) and absorbance at 254 nm were measured. In soils from all three vegetations, PF increased the release of CO(2), DOC, DON and NH(4) compared with PT. SC caused some scattered effects whereas FC only resulted in some increase in NO(3) release below Molinia. Generally, the emission of CO(2) and leaching of DOC, DON and NH(4) increased in the following order: Sphagnum < Calluna < Molinia. The release of NO(3) was greatest below Calluna. Our data suggest that vegetation cover and composition seem at least as important as increased soil frost for future winter fluxes of CO(2), DOC, DON and dissolved inorganic N (DIN) from the soil to air and water. The freezing period needs to be sufficiently long to give significant effects.

AB The New Zealand conifers (20 species of trees and shrubs in the Araucariaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Cupressaceae) are often regarded as ancient Gondwanan elements, but mostly originated much later. Often thought of as tall trees of humid, warm forests, they are present throughout in alpine shrublands, tree lines, bogs, swamps, and in dry, frost-prone regions. The tall conifers rarely form purely coniferous forest and mostly occur as an emergent stratum above evergreen angiosperm trees. During Maori settlement in the thirteenth century, fire-sensitive trees succumbed rapidly, most of the drier forests being lost. As these were also the more conifer-rich forests, ecological research has been skewed toward conifer dynamics of forests wetter and cooler than the pre-human norm. Conifers are well represented in the pollen record and we here we review their late Quaternary history in the light of what is known about their current ecology with the intention of countering this bias. During glacial episodes, all trees were scarce south of c. 40 degrees S, and extensive conifer-dominant forest was confined to the northern third of the North Island. Drought- and cold-resistant Halocarpus bidwillii and Phyllocladus alpinus formed widespread scrub in the south. During the deglacial, beginning 18,000 years ago, tall conifers underwent explosive spread to dominate the forest biomass throughout. Conifer dominance lessened in favor of angiosperms in the wetter western lowland forests over the Holocene but the dryland eastern forests persisted largely unchanged until settlement. Mid to late Holocene climate change favored the more rapidly growing Nothofagaceae which replaced the previous conifer-angiosperm low forest or shrubland in tree line ecotones and montane areas. The key to this dynamic conifer history appears to be their bimodal ability to withstand stress, and dominate on poor soils and in cool, dry regions but, in wetter, warmer locations, to slowly grow thorough competing broadleaves to occupy an exposed, emergent stratum where their inherent stress resistance ensures little effective angiosperm competition.

AB Soils in the northern circumpolar region play a central role in the global carbon cycle because the release of carbon through permafrost thaw and geomorphological disturbances can potentially cause a feedback on climate. However, large uncertainties in estimates of permafrost carbon stocks remain, mainly because of wide gaps in the spatial coverage of soil carbon sampling sites and the large mapping polygons used to upscale data. By combining mapping of landforms and knowledge of surficial geology to upscale soil carbon content measurements, we provide an assessment of soil total carbon content in the region of the Narsajuaq river valley (Nunavik, Canada) to generate the first highesolution soil carbon estimate confirmed by field measurements in Nunavik. We estimate that the Narsajuaq river valley and the surrounding uplands have a weighted average of 3.4 kg C m(-2) (0-100 cm), with 73% of the total carbon content stored in the top 30 cm. The results also indicate that the valley is a carbon hotspot in the region, containing 76% of the total carbon content (0-100 cm) of the study area. Although soil carbon estimates will always require field sampling, the geomorphological mapping approach can significantly improve carbon content estimates and provide better inputs for models.

AB Increasing green space, especially in densely built-up areas is considered to be a valuable climate change adaptation response in order to reduce the threat of high temperatures to human health and comfort and to controlled global greenhouse gas emissions. Practical responses to climate change, under urban conditions, in order to avoid or reduce trees and shrubs vulnerability, can be considered drought resistant planting approaches, as the addition of organic amendeds to soil. The improvement of physical-chemical soil quality is a key step for carrying out xeriscaping programs of urban green spaces in Mediterranean semiarid areas. Organic amendments, particularly compost, have been receiving a renewed attention not only in horticulture but also in the context of restoring disturbed urban soils to address environmental issues as well as to improve trees and shrubs growth. The influence of increasing rates (0, 15, 30, and 45%) of composted sewage sludge (SSC) placed in the plantation hole on both urban soil properties and growth for three native Mediterranean woody hedge species was monitored over a 2-year period after planting. The experiment was supported by a xerogardening project in an urban context under semi-arid conditions. The results indicate that the urban soil physical characteristics were positively influenced by the addition of SSC: the 45% rate showed an increase in both moisture and infiltration values, thereby increasing the volume of plant-available water in the soil. The chemical properties of the amended soils were also directly affected by the SSC rate, but the effect of the compost on organic matter, nitrogen and potassium contents decreased overtime. Our results prove that the hedge growth response to the compost treatments is also highly dependent on the rate of compost used. At the end of the trial, in Rhamnus and Myrthus plants 30% compost level guarantees the best performance; in fact, the further addition of 15% of compost led to a significant decrease in hedge and diameter values, in particular in Myrtle. This could be explained by the high pH at 45% compost, which would seem not to suit the physiology of the two species. On the other hand, in Phillyrea plants, the rate of 45% compost gives high performance equal to that of 30%; it would therefore seem that the high pH at 45% compost does not influence the nutritive elements' absorption and, as a consequence, the growth. The use of composted sludge as an amendment for sclerophyllous could be feasible and, what is more, helpful to mitigate the environmental impact of organic waste disposal. Moreover more natural vegetation can be introduced into urban parks and green spaces in semi-arid environments to encourage sustainable landscaping and xerogardening. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB A lacustrine carbonate sequence from Hawes Water, Lancashire, UK, has been studied using stable isotopic, lithological, pollen and mineral magnetic analysis. The data reveal four abrupt climatic oscillations in the Late-glacial Interstadial leading up to the onset of the Loch Lomond Stadial. The data also point to climatic warming relatively early within the stadial, ca. 12 500 GRIP yr, prior to the onset of the Holocene. The oxygen isotope record is taken as a signature of climate forcing against which the response of the lake-system can be monitored. By adopting this approach it is revealed that the response of the biological system to the rapid climatic oscillations is nonlinear and primarily a function of the antecedent conditions. A significant end-Devensian isotopic excursion (A) is matched by only minor changes in the cold-adapted floras and faunas. During the warmer interstadial, the response of the biological ecosystem (events B-D) is clearly influenced by thresholds: major changes in the catchment vegetation associated with relatively minor oscillations in the isotopic signature. The stratigraphical patterns reveal significant lag effects between the onset of climate deterioration and resulting changes in vegetation. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Plant communities are often assumed to be stable on a year-to-year basis. We present evidence that species composition in permanent quadrats changes considerably between years at a range of Environmental Change Network sites across the UK. The extent of this variability varies with habitat type. Communities associated with low disturbance levels and low agricultural inputs, particularly moorland (upland grass and heath) and bog communities, are most stable.
   Inter-annual variability should, therefore, be considered in designing monitoring schemes to ensure that frequency of recording is sufficient to avoid short-term fluctuations obscuring long-term trends.
   More diverse communities were more stable, with less species turnover between years. However, diverse communities also tended to be dominated by slow-growing, slow-reproducing plants, adapted to low nutrient conditions, identified as 'stress tolerators' in the Grime CSR scheme and low Ellenberg N values. Species compositional stability was more strongly correlated with these indices of plant functional types than species richness. Nevertheless, a significant effect of species richness could be identified, even after other causes of variation were accounted for.
   More stable communities in our study are likely to be resilient to low levels of environmental change, although they may still change, and possibly change dramatically if critical 'tipping points' are reached. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degradation of permafrost is a large source of uncertainty in understanding the behaviour and projecting the future impacts of Earth's climate system. The spatial distributions of soil organic carbon (SOC) and ground ice (ICE) provide essential information for the assessment and projection of risks and impacts of permafrost degradation. However, uncertainties regarding the geographical distribution and estimated range of the total amount of stored carbon and ice are still substantial. A numerical soil organic carbon-ground ice budget model, SOC-ICE-v1.0, that considers essential aspects of carbon and hydrological processes in above-ground and subsurface environments and permanently frozen ground (permafrost) and land cover changes (ice sheets and coastlines) was developed to calculate the long-term evolution of local SOC and ICE. The model was integrated to cover the last 125 kyr - from the last interglacial to date for areas north of 50 degrees N at 1 degrees resolution - to simulate the balance between accumulation and dissipation of SOC and ICE. Model performance was compared with observation-based data and evaluated to assess allogenic (external) impacts on soil carbon dynamics in the circum-Arctic region on a glacial-interglacial timescale. Despite the limitation of forcing climate data being constructed on the basis of a single Greenland ice core dataset, the simulated results successfully reproduced temporal changes in northern SOC and ICE, consist with current knowledge. The simulation also captured regional differences in different geographical and climatic characteristics within the circum-Arctic region. The model quantitatively demonstrated allogenic controls on soil carbon evolution represented by a key parameter that reflects climatological and topo-geographical factors. The resulting circum-Arctic set of simulated time series can be compiled to produce snapshot maps of SOC and ICE distributions for past and present assessments or future projection simulations. Examples of 1 degrees resolution maps for the Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Holocene periods were provided. Despite a simple modelling framework, SOC-ICE-v1.0 provided substantial information on the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of circum-Arctic SOC and ICE. Model improvements in terms of forcing climate data, improvement of SOC and ICE dynamics, and choice of initial values are, however, required for future research.

AB Arctic wetlands store nearly half of the world's soil organic carbon and are crucial to the global carbon cycle. However, most Earth system models fail to account for wetlands given heterogeneity and uncertainty surrounding the response of different wetland types to climate change. We analyzed summer (June-August) carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, meteorological conditions, and ecological conditions at four Arctic wetlands. Micrometeorological flux tower data were used to assess CO2 exchange and meteorological conditions across 7 to 9years of data. Climate data were used to assess meteorological conditions across 30years of data. Satellite data described ecological conditions. Each site acted as a CO2 sink, but strength varied, ranging from -49 to -93gC/m(2) per summer. A trend analysis was used to investigate how CO2 balance and surrounding conditions may have changed. CO2 exchange significantly changed at one site, becoming a stronger sink. Changes in meteorological conditions were variable across sites with the exception of air temperature which, when considering significant trends, unanimously increased across sites. Ecological conditions suggested increased vegetation cover regardless of statistical significance at all sites. A conditional random forest algorithm was used to evaluate drivers of CO2 exchange. Cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity, while ecosystem respiration was primarily driven by air temperature, suggesting that projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns will influence the carbon balance of Arctic wetlands. Variability across sites emphasizes the need for long-term observations across wetland types and climatic gradients.

AB In a boreal forest catchment in the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, wildfire caused an increase in the concentrations of strong acid anions and base cations of the stream. In the naturally base-poor Northwest (NW) Subbasin, a 1980 wildfire caused exports of strong acid anions to increase more than export of base cations, causing a 2.5 fold increase in the acidity of the stream. Mean annual stream pH declined from 5.15 prior to fire to 4.76 two years after fire. Acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), calculated as the difference between total base cations and strong acid anions, decreased to 20% of pre-fire values. Sulfate and chloride were the strong acid anions responsible for the decline in ANC, increasing four-fold. While nitrate increased eleven-fold, concentrations were too low to significantly affect ANC. There was a significant correlation between weekly sulfate concentration and base cation concentration (r2 = 0.83) in the two years after fire. Recovery of ANC was caused by the more rapid decline in concentration of sulfate than by changes in base cations. brought produced a similar but weaker response than fire, with increased sulfate concentrations and decreased stream pH. Climatic warming that increases drought and fire frequency would have effects that mimic the impacts of acidic precipitation (i.e. higher sulfate concentrations and acidic stream waters). Areas which have higher concentrations of stored S from past acid precipitation or have large areas of peatlands in the watershed may have aggravated losses of S and H+ after drought and fire.

AB Tundra ecosystems store vast amounts of soil organic carbon, which may be sensitive to climatic change. Net ecosystem production, NEP, is the net exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between landscapes and the atmosphere, and represents the balance between CO2 uptake by photosynthesis and release by decomposition and autotrophic respiration. Here we examine CO2 exchange across seven sites in the Canadian low and high Arctic during the peak growing season (July) in summer 2008. All sites were net sinks for atmospheric CO2 (NEP ranged from 5 to 67 g C m(-2)), with low Arctic sites being substantially larger CO2 sinks. The spatial difference in NEP between low and high Arctic sites was determined more by CO2 uptake via gross ecosystem production than by CO2 release via ecosystem respiration. Maximum gross ecosystem production at the low Arctic sites (average 8.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was about 4 times larger than for high Arctic sites (average 2.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). NEP decreased with increasing temperature at all low Arctic sites, driven largely by the ecosystem respiration response. No consistent temperature response was found for the high Arctic sites. The results of this study clearly indicate there are large differences in tundra CO2 exchange between high and low Arctic environments and this difference should be a central consideration in studies of Arctic carbon balance and climate change.

AB Ecosystem trajectories are inextricably linked to hydrology; however, water availability is not easily observed within the landscape. The response of vegetation to soil water availability may provide an indicator of local hydrology and the resilience or sensitivity of ecosystems to long-term changes in water balance. In this study, vegetation trajectories derived from Landsat Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index over a 22-year period are used as an indicator of spatio-temporal changes of watershed water balance and surface water storage within 6 proximal watersheds of the Boreal Plains ecozone of Alberta, Canada. The interactions between hydrology, topography, geology, and land cover type are examined as they relate to vegetation change.
   In this study, we find that run-off ratio (run-off/precipitation) is greater within watersheds with greater variability of relief, compared within subhumid, wetland-dominated watersheds (average = 0.35, 0.20, respectively), which experience lagged run-off response. A 2-year drought had a greater impact on vegetation trajectories within variable relief watersheds containing a high proportion of coarse-grain surficial geology, compared with peatland-dominated watersheds. The drought extended for an additional 1 to 2 years within 3 subhumid watersheds, reducing watershed run-off to less than 50 mm per water year (November to October) in 2 watersheds. However, proportional area of decline of Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index was significantly less within these watersheds. The results of this study indicate that wetlands play an important role for local water balance and ecosystem maintenance during periods of water stress and should be considered within land use planning and reclamation strategies of the Boreal Plains.

AB It was recognized only recently that subglacial ecosystems support considerable methanogenic activity, thus significantly contributing the global methane production. However, only limited knowledge is available on the physiological characteristics of this kind of methanogenic community because of the technical constraints associated with sampling and cultivation under corresponding environmental conditions. To elucidate methanogenesis beneath the glacial margin in East Antarctic Ice Sheet, we took an integrated approach that included cultivation of microbes associated with the sediment samples in the lab and analysis of mcrA gene therein. After 7 months of incubation, the highest rate of methanogenesis [398 (pmol/day)/gram] was observed at 1 degrees C on a supply of H-2. The rates of methanogenesis were lower on acetate or unamended substrate than on H-2. The rates on these two substrates increased when the temperature was raised. Methanomicrobiales predominated before and after prolonged incubation, regardless whether H-2, acetate, or unamended substrate were the energy source. Therefore, it was inferred that psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the primary methaneproducing pathway in the subglacial ecosystem we sampled. These findings highlight the effects of temperature and substrate on potential methanogenesis in the subglacial sediment of this area, and may help us for a better estimation on the Antarctica methane production in a changing climate.

AB Large wildfires exert strong disturbance on regional and global climate systems and ecosystems by perturbing radiative forcing as well as the carbon and water balance between the atmosphere and land surface, while shortand long-term variations in fire weather, terrestrial ecosystems, and human activity modulate fire intensity and reshape fire regimes. The complex climate-fire-ecosystem interactions were not fully integrated in previous climate model studies, and the resulting effects on the projections of future climate change are not well understood. Here we use the fully interactive REgion-Specific ecosystem feedback Fire model (RESFire) that was developed in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to investigate these interactions and their impacts on climate systems and fire activity. We designed two sets of decadal simulations using CESM-RESFire for present-day (2001-2010) and future (2051-2060) scenarios, respectively, and conducted a series of sensitivity experiments to assess the effects of individual feedback pathways among climate, fire, and ecosystems. Our implementation of RESFire, which includes online land-atmosphere coupling of fire emissions and fire-induced land cover change (LCC), reproduces the observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) from space-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products and ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data; it agrees well with carbon budget benchmarks from previous studies. We estimate the global averaged net radiative effect of both fire aerosols and fire-induced LCC at - 0.59 +/- 0.52 W m(-2), which is dominated by fire aerosol- cloud interactions (-0.82 +/- 0.19 W m(-2)), in the presentday scenario under climatological conditions of the 2000s. The fire-related net cooling effect increases by similar to 170 % to -1.60 +/- 0.27 W m(-2) in the 2050s under the conditions of the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario. Such considerably enhanced radiative effect is attributed to the largely increased global burned area (+19 %) and fire carbon emissions (+100 %) from the 2000s to the 2050s driven by climate change. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon between the land and atmosphere components in the simulations increases by 33 % accordingly, implying that biomass burning is an increasing carbon source at short-term timescales in the future. High-latitude regions with prevalent peatlands would be more vulnerable to increased fire threats due to climate change, and the increase in fire aerosols could counter the projected decrease in anthropogenic aerosols due to air pollution control policies in many regions. We also evaluate two distinct feedback mechanisms that are associated with fire aerosols and fire-induced LCC, respectively. On a global scale, the first mechanism imposes positive feedbacks to fire activity through enhanced droughts with suppressed precipitation by fire aerosol-cloud interactions, while the second one manifests as negative feedbacks due to reduced fuel loads by fire consumption and postfire tree mortality and recovery processes. These two feed-back pathways with opposite effects compete at regional to global scales and increase the complexity of climate-fire-ecosystem interactions and their climatic impacts.

AB The presence of forest vegetation can aid in preserving the permafrost layer by maintaining lower soil temperatures via the accretion of an organic layer at the surface. This layer has a low bulk density and low thermal conductivity (due also to high evapotranspiration rates by forest vegetation), which insulates ice-rich permafrost. Forest removal can lead to significant increases in the summer soil temperature, which increases the thickness of the active layer (i.e., the surficial layer above permafrost which thaws during summer and freezes again in winter) and causes a rise in the active layer towards the surface. When vegetation is sensitive to saturated soil conditions, a rise in the active layer can lead to the conversion of forested areas to wetlands. In this manuscript, we develop a modeling framework to relate vegetation permafrost feedbacks to the emergence of multiple stable ecosystem states. Factors related to soil temperature and hydrologic characteristics of the system were examined to see how they affect the location of the stable and unstable states. This model was also used to examine how an increase in precipitation would affect the temporal dynamics of the active layer and vegetation. Results show that the presence of forest vegetation can enhance the resilience of the system in that it is less prone to state shifts following a disturbance. Understanding these dynamics is important given, (i) the rapid rate at which these systems can shift between states, (ii) the projected climatic changes for forested areas underlain by permafrost and (iii) the high rates of forest loss in these areas.

AB The Ruoergai Swamp (Zoige) at the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western China is the world's largest plateau peat wetland. Rapid shrinkage of the swamp since the 1950s has endangered the local terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the water supply of the upper Yellow River. The causes of the swamp shrinkage were evaluated based upon field investigations in 2011-2013 and analyses of remote sensing images and meteorological and hydrological data. Although a slight rise in the temperature was evident, there was no obvious decrease in the precipitation, indicating that climate change was not the primary cause of the recent swamp shrinkage. Remote sensing images indicated that roughly 920 km of artificial ditches excavated from the 1960s to 1990s have affected around 648 km(2) of swamp, accounting for 27% of the total shrinkage area (approximately 2400 km(2)). Bed incision of the upper Yellow River was considered to be the primary cause for the long-term degradation of the Ruoergai Swamp. Ensuing headcut erosion of countless tributaries has induced drainage network extension, draining large areas of the swamp and lowering the groundwater levels. Headcut erosion and construction of the artificial channels have markedly increased the flow and sediment movement in this landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Weakening mechanisms imposed on California's levees under multiyear
   extreme drought
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English

ID TEMPERATURE; RISK; DECOMPOSITION; BEHAVIOR; RIVER; PEAT
AB California is currently suffering from a multiyear extreme drought and the impacts of the drought are anticipated to worsen with climate change. The resilience of California's critical infrastructure such as earthen levees under drought conditions is a major concern that is poorly understood. California maintains more than 21,000 km of urban and nonurban levees which protect dry land from floods and deliver two-thirds of the state's drinking water. Many of these levees are currently operating under a high failure risk condition. This essay argues that California's protracted drought can further threaten the integrity of these already at-risk levee systems through the imposition of several thermo-hydro-mechanical weakening processes. Pertinent facts and statistics regarding California's drought and current status of its levees are presented. Lessons from previous catastrophic levee failures and major damages which occurred under similar events are discussed. Weakening processes such as soil-strength reduction, soil desiccation cracking, land subsidence and surface erosion, and microbial oxidation of soil organic carbon are comprehensively evaluated to illustrate the adverse impacts that the ongoing California drought can have on levees. This essay calls for further research in light of these potential drought-induced weakening mechanisms to support adaptation and mitigation strategies to possibly avert future levee failures. These weakening processes can threaten any drought-stricken infrastructure interfacing with soil, including embankments, roads, bridges, building foundations, and pipelines.

AB Surface air temperature and precipitation records for the years 1958-1999 from ten meteorological stations located throughout West Siberia are used to identify climatic trends and determine to what extent these trends are potentially attributable to the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Although recent changes in atmospheric variability are associated with broad Arctic climate change, West Siberia appears particularly susceptible to warming. Furthermore, unlike most of the Arctic, moisture transport in the region is highly variable. The records show that West Siberia is experiencing significant warming and notable increases in precipitation, likely driven, in part, by large-scale Arctic atmospheric variability. Because this region contains a large percentage of the world's peatlands and contributes a significant portion of the total terrestrial freshwater flux to the Arctic Ocean, these recent climatic trends may have globally significant repercussions. The most robust patterns found are strong and prevalent springtime warming, winter precipitation increases, and strong association of non-summer air temperatures with the AO. Warming rates for both spring (0.5-0.8degreesC/decade) and annual (0.3-0.5degreesC/decade) records are statistically significant for nine of ten stations. On average, the AO is linearly congruent with 96% (winter), 19% (spring), 0% (summer), 67% (autumn) and 53% (annual) of the warming found in this study. Significant trends in precipitation occur most commonly during winter, when four of ten stations exhibit significant increases (4-13%/decade). The AO may play a lesser role in precipitation variability and is linearly congruent with only 17% (winter), 13% (spring), 12% (summer), 1% (autumn) and 26% (annual) of precipitation trends.

AB Methane is an important greenhouse gas which contributes about 22% to the present greenhouse effect. Natural wetlands currently constitute the biggest methane source and were the major source in preindustrial times. Wetland emissions depend highly on the climate, i.e., on soil temperature and water table. To investigate the response of methane emissions from natural wetlands to climate variations, a process-based model that derives methane emissions from natural wetlands as a function of soil temperature, water table, and net primary productivity is used. For its application on the global scale, global data sets for all model parameters are generated. In addition, a simple hydrologic model is developed in order to simulate the position of the water table in wetlands. The hydrologic model is tested against data from different wetland sites, and the sensitivity of the hydrologic model to changes in precipitation is examined. The global methane-hydrology model constitutes a tool to study temporal and spatial variations in methane emissions from natural wetlands. The model is applied using high-frequency atmospheric forcing fields from ECMWF reanalyses of the period from 1982 to 1993. We calculate global annual methane emissions from wetlands to be 260 Tg yr(-1). Twenty-five percent of these methane emissions originate from wetlands north of 30degreesN. Only 60% of the produced methane is emitted, while the rest is reoxidized. A comparison of zonal integrals of simulated global wetland emissions and results obtained by an inverse modeling approach shows good agreement. In a test with data from two wetlands the seasonality of simulated and observed methane emissions agrees well.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes 1997-2010 were studied by combining remotely sensed normalised difference water index (NDWI) with in situ CH4 fluxes from Rylekaerene, a high-Arctic wet tundra ecosystem in the Zackenberg valley, north-eastern Greenland. In situ CH4 fluxes were measured using the closed-chamber technique. Regression models between in situ CH4 fluxes and environmental variables [soil temperature (T-soil), water table depth (WtD) and active layer (AL) thickness] were established for different temporal and spatial scales. The relationship between in situ WtD and remotely sensed NDWI was also studied. The regression models were combined and evaluated against in situ CH4 fluxes. The models including NDWI as the input data performed on average slightly better [root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.56] than the models without NDWI (RMSE = 1.67), and they were better in reproducing CH4 flux variability. The CH4 flux model that performed the best included exponential relationships against temporal variation in T-soil and AL, an exponential relationship against spatial variation in WtD and a linear relationship between WtD and remotely sensed NDWI (RMSE = 1.50). There were no trends in modelled CH4 flux budgets between 1997 and 2010. Hence, during this period there were no trends in the soil temperature at 10 cm depth and NDWI.

AB Significant climate risks are associated with a positive carbon-temperature feedback in northern latitude carbon-rich ecosystems, making an accurate analysis of human impacts on the net greenhouse gas balance of wetlands a priority. Here, we provide a coherent assessment of the climate footprint of a network of wetland sites based on simultaneous and quasi-continuous ecosystem observations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Experimental areas are located both in natural and in managed wetlands and cover a wide range of climatic regions, ecosystem types, and management practices. Based on direct observations we predict that sustained CH4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (i.e., several centuries) typically offset by CO2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the "cost" of CH4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulseresponse radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland. Our results quantify the role of human activities on the climate footprint of northern wetlands and call for development of active mitigation strategies for managed wetlands and new guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) accounting for both sustained CH4 emissions and cumulative CO2 exchange.

AB A chemical model (constructed in the ORCHESTRA modeling framework) of an organic soil horizon was used to describe soil solution data (10 cm depth) and assess if seasonal variations in soil solution dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could be explained by purely abiotic (geochemical controls) mechanisms or whether factors related to biological activity are needed. The NICA-Donnan equation is used to describe the competitive binding of protons and cations and the charge on soil organic matter. Controls on organic matter solubility are surface charge and a parameter, gamma, that accounts for the distribution of humic molecules between hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions. Calculations show that the variations in solute chemistry alone are not sufficient to account for the observed variations of DOC, but factors that alter gamma, such as biological activity, are. Assuming that DOC in organic soils is derived from soluble humic material and that gamma is modified seasonally due to biological activity (with monthly soil temperature used as a surrogate for biological activity) we are able to model the observed seasonality of soil solution DOC over a 10-year period. Furthermore, with modeled DOC coupled to other geochemical processes we also model soil Solution pH and Al concentrations.

AB One major challenge to the improvement of regional climate scenarios for the northern high latitudes is to understand land surface feedbacks associated with vegetation shifts and ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. We employed a customized, Arctic version of the individual-based dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to simulate the dynamics of upland and wetland ecosystems under a regional climate model-downscaled future climate projection for the Arctic and Subarctic. The simulated vegetation distribution (1961-1990) agreed well with a composite map of actual arctic vegetation. In the future (2051-2080), a poleward advance of the forest-tundra boundary, an expansion of tall shrub tundra, and a dominance shift from deciduous to evergreen boreal conifer forest over northern Eurasia were simulated. Ecosystems continued to sink carbon for the next few decades, although the size of these sinks diminished by the late 21st century. Hot spots of increased CH4 emission were identified in the peatlands near Hudson Bay and western Siberia. In terms of their net impact on regional climate forcing, positive feedbacks associated with the negative effects of tree-line, shrub cover and forest phenology changes on snow-season albedo, as well as the larger sources of CH4, may potentially dominate over negative feedbacks due to increased carbon sequestration and increased latent heat flux.

AB Hummock-hollow microtopography is a unique feature of wetland ecosystems, but our understanding of its effects on soil carbon and nutrient cycling is limited. We investigated effects of microtopography on hydrology, phenol oxidase activity (POX) and nutrient availability in a freshwater forested wetland of coastal North Carolina. Water table depth (WTD) was measured from September 2012 to August 2013. Ion exchange probes were used to measure nutrient concentrations prior to soil sample collection in August 2013. WTD fluctuated seasonally with maximum and minimum WTD resulting in 92% (September 2012) to 8% (June 2013) of the site in flooded and non-flooded conditions, respectively. Hummocks had greater POX activity (12 +/- 2.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) compared to hollows (4 +/- 0.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and greater concentrations of potassium and sulfur, but lower concentrations of calcium, iron, zinc, boron, and lead. POX was negatively correlated with soil water content. Higher enzyme activity in hummocks likely drives greater rates of carbon and nutrient cycling compared to hollows, consistent with observations that hummocks are hotspots for CO2 fluxes. Microtopography altered site-level hydrologic conditions, phenol oxidase activity and nutrient availability with important implications for understanding carbon and nutrient cycling in forested wetlands and response to changes in hydrology.

AB Twenty-one samples of sub-bituminous coal and 1 sample of coaly shale have been collected from different coal seams, representing the Cenozoic coal basins widely distributed in the region of Primorye and Sakhalin (Russia), and NE China (Hunchun deposit). The seams belong to lower Miocene-upper Oligocene (Sineutesovsky), Oligocene-upper Eocene (Pavlovsky), upper Eocene (Ust-Davydovsky), lower Eocene (Uglovsky), and upper Paleocene (Kivdinsky) local chronostratigraphic units.
   Terpenoid biomarker compositions indicate the contribution of conifers and angiosperms to peat formation. The results are in agreement with paleobotanical data from sedimentary successions closely associated with the seams, highlighting abundant conifers of the taxodioid Cupressaceae and Pinaceae families, as well as Betula, Alnus, Fagus, and Ulmus during Cenozoic in the Far East. In contrast to previous findings about changes in peat-forming vegetation in central Europe, the terpenoid biomarker ratios revealed increased contributions of angiosperms during the Oligocene and gymnosperm domination during Eocene and Miocene. The different evolution may be related to differences in temperature and precipitation distribution, as well as in geomorphology and landscape evolution.
   A positive relationship between the di-/(di- + tri-)-terpenoid biomarker ratios and delta C-13 of Oligocene samples indicates the role of varying gymnosperm/angiosperm influences on the delta C-13 of coal. Differences in vegetation and climate are most probably responsible for the different trends in delta C-13 of terpenoid biomarkers over the Cenozoic, beside their general variation coupled to the evolution in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2.
   Lower delta H-2 values of plant-derived lipids during the Oligocene were most probably caused by lower temperatures during coal formation. This conclusion is supported by the results of recent paleobotanical studies, yielding lower mean annual temperatures (MAT) during the Oligocene but comparable values for mean annual precipitation (MAP) during the Eocene and Oligocene in the Primorye region. Pimarane-type diterpenoids are significantly depleted in H-2. The results are in agreement with previous studies identifying different sources of hydrogen and/or different biosynthetic pathways during their formation.

AB Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow has a significant influence on the ocean-atmosphere system of the mid-to high latitudes with potentially global climate implications. Unfortunately, historic observations only extend back to the late 19th century, limiting our understanding of multi-decadal to centennial change. Here we present a highly resolved (30-year) record of past westerly wind strength from a Falkland Islands peat sequence spanning the last 2600 years. Situated within the core latitude of Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow (the so-called furious fifties), we identify highly variable changes in exotic pollen and charcoal derived from South America which can be used to inform on past westerly air strength. We find a period of high charcoal content between 2000 and 1000 cal. years BP, associated with increased burning in Patagonia, most probably as a result of higher temperatures and stronger westerly airflow. Spectral analysis of the charcoal record identifies a pervasive ca. 250-year periodicity that is coherent with radiocarbon production rates, suggesting that solar variability has a modulating influence on Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow. Our results have important implications for understanding global climate change through the late Holocene.

AB During the past three decades the Earth has warmed with a rate unprecedented during the past 1000 years. There is already ample evidence that this fast climate warming has affected a broad range of organisms, including plants. Plants from high-latitude and high-altitude sites ('cold biomes') are especially sensitive to climate warming. In this paper we (1) review the response in the phenology of plants, changes in their range and distribution, soil nutrient availability, and the effects on the structure and dynamics of plant communities for cold, northern biomes; and (2) we show, by using data from an ongoing snow and temperature manipulation experiment in northern Sweden, that also winter and spring events have a profound influence on plant performance. Both long-term phenological data sets, experimental warming studies (performed in summer or year-round), natural gradient studies and satellite images show that key phenological events are responsive to temperature increases and that recent climate warming does indeed lead to changes in plant phenology. However, data from a warming and snow manipulation study that we are conducting in northern Sweden show that plants respond differently to the various climatic scenarios that we had imposed on these species and that especially winter and spring events have a profound impact. This indicates that it is necessary to include several scenarios of both summer and winter climate change in experimental climate change studies, and that we need detailed projections of future climate at a regional scale to be able to assess their impacts on natural ecosystems. There is also ample evidence that the range shift of herbs and shrubs to more northern regions is for the vast majority of species mainly caused by changes in the climate. This is in line with the observed 'up-greening' of northern tundra sites. These rapid northern shifts in distribution of plants as a result of climate warming may have substantial consequences for the structure and dynamics of high-latitude ecosystems. An analysis of warming studies at 9 tundra sites shows that heating during at least 3 years increased net N-mineralization from 0.32 +/- 0.31 (SE) g N m(-2) yr(-1) in the controls to 0.53 +/- 0.31 (SE) g N m(2) yr(-1) in the heated plots (p < 0.05), an increase of about 70%. Thus, warming leads to higher N availability in high-latitude northern tundra sites, but the variability is substantial. Higher nutrient availability affects in turn the species composition of high-latitude sites, which has important consequences for the carbon and water balance of these systems.

AB Unusual exposure of the drift stratigraphy of a typical, vegetated hillslope in the Northern Highlands of Scotland has allowed reconstruction of its Holocene history. Graphic logging of palaeogully fill, sediment analysis, radiocarbon dating and microscopic investigation of horizon boundaries, link periodic slope instability to changes in hydrology and vegetation cover. The oldest preserved organic matter dates from about 7.5 cal. ka BP. Several millennia of subsequent stability were followed, at about 4.3 cal. ka BP, by destabilization whose magnitude and frequency markedly increased after about 2.7 cal. ka BP. Precipitation-driven weathering and erosion offer the best explanation for late-Holocene slope rejuvenation at this site, with change effected through long-lasting shifts in system equilibria as well as high magnitude inputs. Anthropogenic impacts on slope stability are apparently restricted to the last few hundred years. The timing and episodicity of slope evolution suggests climate forcing. Results raise the question of whether the extent of past and potential climate-driven Holocene slope evolution in non-glaciated uplands have been underestimated.

AB The values of many important traits of plants in a community change along environmental gradients. Such changes may involve intraspecific variation and replacement by species that have different trait values. We hypothesized that they also involve the variation within and among functional groups (FGs) to the environmental dependence of trait values at the community level. We studied environmental dependence of trait values in 27 moorlands at various scales and analyzed to what extent intraspecific variation, species replacement within FGs and FG replacement contribute to the gradient of community trait values. The community structure in moorlands was influenced mainly by two environmental factors: temperature and water condition. Plants inhabiting sites with low temperature and low-pH generally tended to have lower maximum leaf height, greater leaf mass per area, and smaller leaf size. At the community level, site-mean of maximum leaf height and leaf size generally increased with increasing temperature and water pH. Our analysis demonstrated that the relative contributions of intraspecific variation, species replacement within FGs and FG replacement differed depending on combinations of the traits and environments. The contribution of FG replacement varied considerably among cases (0.6-34.5 %). Species replacement within FGs, which has received little attention in previous studies, was most responsible for the community-level changes (31.6-65.3 %) and intraspecific variation also made a large contribution (22.9-57.9 %). Understanding such various mechanisms involving intraspecific variation and species replacement should help us better predict how the structure and functioning of moorland plant communities will respond to climate change.

AB Long-term monitoring data were analyzed to reveal correlations between declining ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) populations and phenological changes at two Environmental Change Network sites in Scotland. The potential role of advancing phenology as an adaptation function in population stability was investigated.
   Analysis focussed on the 25 most abundant species over an 18 year sampling period. Pitfall trap catches were used to calculate mean activity-densities both for the whole sampling period and for dates limited to those within the activity period. Several phenological measurements were calculated (i.e. first day of appearance, peak activity date, median activity, length of activity and winter inactivity periods, and the last day of presence) for each species. Robust non-parametric estimation was used to model changes in both activity density and phenology.
   Eight species declined in activity density over time, three increased and fourteen showed no change. The mean rate of decline was greater than that of increase.
   Most of the species included in the analysis changed their phenology. Advancing onset of activity and earlier cessation were the most pronounced changes. However, a slow advancing trend in the peak activity was also shown. Only Nebria brevicollis, an autumn species with recorded winter activity, extended its activity period to later dates, suggesting that cessation of activity for the remaining species may be more closely linked to photoperiod. The earlier termination of activity shortened substantially the activity window for several species.
   Declines in activity density showed a strong relationship with a narrowing window of activity, mainly caused by earlier cessation of activity. Declining species were found more in bog or dry heather moorland habitats compared to grassland, emphasizing the vulnerability of these vegetation types, and associated insect assemblages depending on them, to environmental or climatic changes. The reciprocal relationship found between the trend of timing of initiation of activity and changes in activity-densities suggests that populations with a higher capacity to advance their phenology are less prone to decline. Since phenological changes may drive changes in populations, investigating phenological variables is encouraged in both research and conservation planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although wetland soils represent a relatively small portion of the terrestrial landscape, they account for an estimated 20 %-30 % of the global soil carbon (C) reservoir. C stored in wetland soils that experience seasonal flooding is likely the most vulnerable to increased severity and duration of droughts in response to climate change. Redox conditions, plant root dynamics, and the abundance of protective mineral phases are well-established controls on soil C persistence, but their relative influence in seasonally flooded mineral soils is largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the relative importance of environmental (temperature, soil moisture, and redox potential) and biogeochemical (mineral composition and root biomass) factors in controlling CO2 efflux, C quantity, and organic matter composition along replicated upland-lowland transitions in seasonally flooded mineral soils. Specifically, we contrasted mineral soils under temperature deciduous forests in lowland positions that undergo seasonal flooding with adjacent upland soils that do not, considering both surface (A) and subsurface (B and C) horizons. We found the lowland soils had lower total annual CO2 efflux than the upland soils, with monthly CO2 efflux in lowlands most strongly correlated with redox potential (E-h). Lower CO2 efflux as compared to the uplands corresponded to greater C content and abundance of lignin-rich, higher-molecular-weight, chemically reduced organic compounds in the lowland surface soils (A horizons). In contrast, subsurface soils in the lowland position (C-g horizons) showed lower C content than the upland positions (C horizons), coinciding with lower abundance of root biomass and oxalate-extractable Fe (Fe-o, a proxy for protective Fe phases). Our linear mixed-effects model showed that Fe-o served as the strongest measured predictor of C content in up- land soils, yet Fe-o had no predictive power in lowland soils. Instead, our model showed that Eh and oxalate-extractable Al (Al-o, a proxy of protective Al phases) became significantly stronger predictors in the lowland soils. Combined, our results suggest that low redox potentials are the primary cause for C accumulation in seasonally flooded surface soils, likely due to selective preservation of organic compounds under anaerobic conditions. In seasonally flooded subsurface soils, however, C accumulation is limited due to lower C inputs through root biomass and the removal of reactive Fe phases under reducing conditions. Our findings demonstrate that C accrual in seasonally flooded mineral soil is primarily due to low redox potential in the surface soil and that the lack of protective metal phases leaves these C stocks highly vulnerable to climate change.

AB The Red List of Habitats of the Czech Republic assesses the risk of collapse for 157 types of natural and semi-natural habitats defined in the second edition of the Habitat Catalogue of the Czech Republic. The assessment followed the guidelines for the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems as used in the European Red List of Habitats project, using the criteria of habitat reduction in quantity, restricted geographic distribution, and reduction in abiotic and biotic quality. Quantitative data for the assessment were partly taken from a detailed field habitat mapping at the national scale, and where no quantitative information was available, the values were estimated by summarizing independent judgements of 17 experts. In addition to the criteria involved in the Red List assessment, the experts also assessed various types of threatening factors and their importance for each habitat. Of 157 assessed habitats, 2 were Collapsed (CO), 14 Critically Endangered (CR), 32 Endangered (EN), 33 Vulnerable (VU), 30 Near Threatened (NT) and 46 Least Concern (LC). The largest proportion of CR + EN habitats was in the habitat group of springs and mires and in the group of wetlands. The threatening factors evaluated as the most important were successional changes after cessation of traditional management, eutrophication due to atmospheric nutrient deposition and pollution from agriculture, and increased drought in water-dependent habitats due to climate change or changes in local hydrological regime. The study shows that the IUCN criteria for Red List assessment of habitats, although developed for the global scale, are also applicable within small countries or regions.

AB This study assesses the major chemical processes leading to acid extremes in a small, moorland stream in mid-Wales, UK, which has been monitored since 1979. Results suggest that base cation (mainly calcium) dilution, the "sea-salt effect", and elevated nitrate pulses, are the major causes of seasonal/episodic minima in acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and that the relative importance of these drivers has remained approximately constant during 25 years of decreasing acid deposition and associated long-term chemical recovery. Many of the chemical variations causing short-term reductions in stream acidity, particularly base cation dilution and organic acid increases, are closely related to changes in water-flowpath and therefore to stream discharge. Changes in the observed pH-discharge relationship over time indicate that high-flow pH has increased more rapidly than mean-flow pH, and therefore that episodes have decreased in magnitude since 1980. However a two-box application of the dynamic model MAGIC, whilst reproducing this trend, suggests that it will not persist in the long term, with mean ANC continuing to increase until 2100, but the ANC of the upper soil (the source of relatively acid water during high-flow episodes) stabilising close to zero beyond 2030. With climate change predicted to lead to an increase in maximum flows in the latter half of the century, high-flow related acid episodes may actually become more rather than less severe in the long term, although the model suggests that this effect may be small. Two other predicted climatic changes could also detrimentally impact on acid episodes: increased severity of winter "sea-salt" episodes due to higher wind speeds during winter storms; and larger sulphate pulses due to oxidation of reduced sulphur held in organic soils, during more extreme summer droughts. At the Gwy, the near-coastal location and relatively small extent of peat soils suggest that sea-salt episodes may have the greatest influence.

AB Developing a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the atmosphere and the geosphere is an ever-more pertinent issue as global average temperatures continue to rise. The possibility of more frequent volcanic eruptions and more therefore more frequent volcanic ash clouds raises potential concerns for the general public and the aviation industry. This review describes the major processes involved in short- and long-term volcano-climate interactions with a focus on Iceland and northern Europe, illustrating a complex interconnected system, wherein volcanoes directly affect the climate and climate change may indirectly affect volcanic systems. In this paper we examine both the effect of volcanic inputs into the atmosphere on climate conditions, in addition to the reverse relationship - that is, how global temperature fluctuations may influence the occurrence of volcanic eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions can cause surface cooling on regional and global scales through stratospheric injection of aerosols and fine ash particles, as documented in many historic eruptions, such as the Pinatubo eruption in 1991. The atmospheric effects of large-magnitude explosive eruptions are more pronounced when the eruptions occur in the tropics due to increased aerosol dispersal and effects on the meridional temperature gradient. Additionally, on a multi-centennial scale, global temperature increase may affect the frequency of large-magnitude eruptions through deglaciation. Many conceptional models use the example of Iceland to suggest that post-glacial isostatic rebound will significantly increase decompression melting, and may already be increasing the amount of melt stored beneath Vatnajokull and several smaller Icelandic glaciers. Evidence for such a relationship existing in the past may be found in cryptotephra records from peat and lake sediments across northern Europe. At present, such records are incomplete, containing spatial gaps. As a significant increase in volcanic activity in Iceland would result in more frequent ash clouds over Europe, disrupting aviation and transport, developing an understanding of the relationship between the global climate and volcanism will greatly improve our ability to forecast and prepare for future events.

AB Late Glacial to Holocene ice retreat was investigated along a 120 km long fjord system, reaching from Gran Campo Nevado (GCN) to Seno Skyring in the southernmost Andes (53 degrees S). The aim was to improve the knowledge on regional and global control on glacier recession with special emphasis on latitudinal shifting of the westerlies. The timing of ice retreat was derived from peat and sediment cores, using mineralogical and chemical characteristics, and pollen as proxies. Stratigraphy was based on C-14-AMS ages and tephrochronology. The ice retreat of the Seno Skyring Glacier lobe is marked by an ice rafted debris layer which was formed around 18,300 to 17,500 cal. yr B.P. Subsequently, fast glacier retreat occurred until around 15,000 to 14,000 cal. yr B.P. during which around 84% of Skyring Glacier were lost. This fast recession was probably also triggered by an increase of the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) from 200 to 300 m. Subsequently, the ice surface was lowered below the ELA in an area that previously made up more than 50% of the accumulation area. Much slower retreat and glacier fluctuations of limited extent in the fjord channel system northeast of GCN occurred between around 14,000 to 11,000 cal. yr B.P. during both the Antarctic Cold Reversal and the Younger Dryas. This slow down of retreat indicates a decline in the general warming trend and/or increased precipitation, due to a southward migration of the westerlies. After around 11,000 cal. yr B.P. pollen distribution shows evolved Magellanic Rainforest and similar climate as at present, which lasted throughout most of the Holocene. Only Late Neoglacial moraine systems were formed in the period 1220-1460 AD, and subsequently in the 1620s AD, and between 1870 and 19 10 AD. The results indicate that the Gran Campo Nevado ice cap has reacted more sensitive and partly distinct to climate change, compared to the Patagonian Ice Field. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB High-latitude ecosystems store approximately 1700Pg of soil carbon (C), which is twice as much C as is currently contained in the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial decomposition of permafrost organic matter could add large amounts of C to the atmosphere, thereby influencing the global C cycle. The rates at which C is being released from the permafrost zone at different soil depths and across different physiographic regions are poorly understood but crucial in understanding future changes in permafrost C storage with climate change. We assessed the inherent decomposability of C from the permafrost zone by assembling a database of long-term (>1year) aerobic soil incubations from 121 individual samples from 23 high-latitude ecosystems located across the northern circumpolar permafrost zone. Using a three-pool (i.e., fast, slow and passive) decomposition model, we estimated pool sizes for C fractions with different turnover times and their inherent decomposition rates using a reference temperature of 5 degrees C. Fast cycling C accounted for less than 5% of all C in both organic and mineral soils whereas the pool size of slow cycling C increased with C:N. Turnover time at 5 degrees C of fast cycling C typically was below 1year, between 5 and 15years for slow turning over C, and more than 500years for passive C. We project that between 20 and 90% of the organic C could potentially be mineralized to CO2 within 50 incubation years at a constant temperature of 5 degrees C, with vulnerability to loss increasing in soils with higher C:N. These results demonstrate the variation in the vulnerability of C stored in permafrost soils based on inherent differences in organic matter decomposability, and point toward C:N as an index of decomposability that has the potential to be used to scale permafrost C loss across landscapes.

AB The Lateglacial/early Holocene sediments from the ancient lake at Hasseldala Port, southern Sweden provide an important archive for the environmental and climatic shifts at the end of the last ice age and the transition into the present Interglacial. The existing multi-proxy data set highlights the complex interplay of physical and ecological changes in response to climatic shifts and lake status changes. Yet, it remains unclear how microorganisms, such as Archaea, which do not leave microscopic features in the sedimentary record, were affected by these climatic shifts. Here we present the metagenomic data set of Hasseldala Port with a special focus on the abundance and biodiversity of Archaea. This allows reconstructing for the first time the temporal succession of major Archaea groups between 13.9 and 10.8 ka BP by using ancient environmental DNA metagenomics and fossil archaeal cell membrane lipids. We then evaluate to which extent these findings reflect physical changes of the lake system, due to changes in lake-water summer temperature and seasonal lake-ice cover. We show that variations in archaeal composition and diversity were related to a variety of factors (e.g., changes in lake water temperature, duration of lake ice cover, rapid sediment infilling), which influenced bottom water conditions and the sediment-water interface. Methanogenic Archaea dominated during the Allerod and Younger Dryas pollen zones, when the ancient lake was likely stratified and anoxic for large parts of the year. The increase in archaeal diversity at the Younger Dryas/Holocene transition is explained by sediment infilling and formation of a mire/peatbog. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Regional and national parks have been created to preserve biodiversity and quasi-natural ecosystems, but uncertainties about local environmental history hinder the assessment of important nature-conservation baselines (e.g. natural vegetation composition, role of human activities). We use pollen, plant macrofossils, microcharcoal and radiocarbon dating to reconstruct the environmental dynamics at two mires in the mountain belt of southern Switzerland (Segna and Piano). Two major vegetation changes occurred during the past 3000 years: (1) Picea abies, Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica forests developed into monospecific beech forests and (2) F. sylvatica was reduced and open land expanded. The first change occurred at AD 450 at Segna and AD 1500 at Piano, the second at AD 1600-1700 at both sites. At Segna the A. alba decline occurred during a relatively warm and dry period when local fires and human impact increased. Similarly, at Piano the shift to Fagus-dominated forests was probably induced by human impact. The final decline of F. sylvatica and expansion of open land is clearly related to an intensification of human activities at both sites. Our results suggest a pronounced sensitivity of A. alba to human disturbance in the mountain belt and show that biodiversity is positively related to land use, while human activities decisively reduced woodland diversity. In conclusion, promoting natural succession and A. alba would significantly increase woodland diversity and may significantly contribute to stabilize forests under climatic conditions significantly warmer than today. Biodiversity conservation efforts should concentrate in areas where agriculture has a long history.

AB Past vegetation, fire, and climate dynamics, as well as human impact, have been reconstructed for the first time in the highlands of the Gilan province in the Alborz mountains (above the Hyrcanian forest) for the last 4,300 cal yrs bp. Multi-proxy analysis, including pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal, and geochemical analysis, has been applied to investigate the environmental changes at 2,280 m a.s.l., above the Hyrcanian forest. Dominant steppe vegetation occurred in the study area throughout the recorded period. The formation of the studied mire deposits, as well as vegetation composition, suggest a change to wetter climatic conditions after 4,300 until 1,700 cal yrs bp. Fires were frequent, which may imply long-lasting anthropogenic activities in the area. Less vegetation cover with a marked decrease of the Moisture Index (MI) suggests drier conditions between 1,700 and 1,000 cal yrs bp. A high proportion of Cichorioideae and Amaranthaceae, as well as the reduction of trees, in particular Fagus and Quercus, at lower elevations, indicate human activities such as intense livestock grazing and deforestation. Soil erosion as the result of less vegetation due to dry conditions and/or human activities can be reconstructed from a marked increase of Glomus spores and high values of K and Ti. Since 1,000 cal yrs bp, the increasing MI, as well as the rise of Poaceae and Cyperaceae together with forest recovery, suggest a change to wetter conditions. The occurrence of still frequent Cichorioideae and Plantago lanceolata along with Sordaria reflect continued intense grazing of livestock by humans.

AB Hydropedological units are of critical importance in modulating catchment response in terms of storage and flux dynamics under changing hydrological conditions. We examined the short-term impacts of an extreme drought on the storage dynamics and runoff response in hydropedological units in a headwater catchment in the Scottish Highlands. These included poorly drained histosols in riparian zones and freely draining podzols on steeper hillslopes. To characterize the storage and run-off dynamics prior to, during and after the drought period, precipitation, soil moisture, shallow ground water levels and consequent run-off were monitored and stable water isotopes samples collected. Storage changes in the histosols were remarkably small (<40 mm), compared with those in moorland (similar to 100 mm) and forest (similar to 200 mm) covered podzols. Although storage in all soils recovered soon after the drought, this took longest (3-4 months) for the forested podzols. During events, there was consistent threshold behaviour in most hydropedological units and the integrated response at the catchment scale, which was not affected by drying or wetting. The results suggest that during dry periods, large parts of the catchment were disconnected from the river network and run-off was generated mainly from the wet histosols. However, during events, there was an intermittent connection of the hillslopes that recharged the wetland and stream. This contributed to strong recovery and resilience of the catchment in its run-off response. Nevertheless, as future climate projections for northern environments suggest that prolonged dry periods are likely to become more frequent, further work is needed on the potential cumulative or carry over effects of consecutive drier periods.

AB We reconstructed the late-Holocene environmental history of a coastal lagoon in semi-arid southwestern Hispaniola through multiproxy analysis of a sediment core, including pollen, macroscopic and microscopic charcoal, loss-on-ignition analysis (LOI), stable isotope analysis, bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility. Four chronological accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates indicated that our core represents the past similar to 1000 years. We interpreted ten hurricanes events over the past millennium from high-resolution geological proxies, LOI data, and ostracod valve stable oxygen isotope data, thus producing the first long record of hurricanes from the Dominican Republic. Geological proxies indicated a high-energy event abruptly changed the ecosystem state of our core site from a shallow mangrove wetland to a lacustrine environment similar to 330 cal yr BP. We interpret the driver of that event to be the landfall of a strong hurricane that initiated lowland flooding, mangrove mortality, and subsequent peat collapse at the core site. Pollen data indicated that during the relatively moist Medieval Warm Period (MWP), hurricanes led to temporary declines in tropical dry forest taxa that recovered within several decades following disturbance. By comparison, during the relatively arid Little Ice Age (LIA), when precipitation was highly variable in the circum-Caribbean, closely spaced hurricanes seemed to delay forest recovery. Sedimentary charcoal concentrations revealed increased fire activity after inferred hurricane landfalls in the MWP, providing evidence of a link between enhanced biomass and fuel availability during moister periods and burning in recently disturbed dry forests and scrub of our semi-arid study region. Our interpretations of increased aridity and precipitation variability, indicated by alternating thin layers of microbial mats with evaporite layers, along with more frequent hurricanes from similar to 330 cal yr BP to present, generally agree with other sedimentary records from the circum-Caribbean, and may be linked to a more southerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the LIA.

AB Stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations display high spatial and temporal variation in boreal catchments. Understanding and predicting these patterns is a challenge with great implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates. Although several biogeochemical models have been used to estimate stream water DOC dynamics, model biases common during both rain and snowmelt-driven events. The parsimonious DOC-model, K-DOC, with 10 calibrated parameters, uses a nonlinear discharge and catchment water storage relationship including soil temperature dependencies of DOC release and consumption. K-DOC was used to estimate the stream water DOC concentrations over 5 years for eighteen nested boreal catchments having total area of 68 km(2) (varying from 0.04 to 67.9 km(2)). The model successfully simulated DOC concentrations during base flow conditions, as well as, hydrological events in catchments dominated by organic and mineral soils reaching NSEs from 0.46 to 0.76. Our semimechanistic model was parsimonious enough to have all parameters estimated using statistical methods. We did not find any clear differences between forest and mire-dominated catchments that could be explained by soil type or tree species composition. However, parameters controlling slow release and consumption of DOC from soil water behaved differently for small head-water catchments (less than 2 km(2)) than for those that integrate larger areas of different ecosystem types (1068 km(2)). Our results emphasize that it is important to account for nonlinear dependencies of both, soil temperature, and catchment water storage, when simulating DOC dynamics of boreal catchments.

AB We measured methane emissions over a two-year period (2006-08) from two 12 to 14-year-old created freshwater marshes in central Ohio, one initially planted and the other allowed to self-colonize. Overall, methane emissions in the two created wetlands were different (p < 0.05), with the plant self-colonized wetland having higher annual methane (median and mean) emissions of 19 and 68 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) than the planted wetland (6 and 17 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)). Since hydrology and soil/water temperature were identical for the two wetlands, we hypothesize that differences in carbon accumulation due to higher net primary productivity in the self-colonized wetland may be causing higher methane emissions in that wetland. Net primary productivity in the self-colonized wetland was higher 7 out of 11 years prior to the study. Methane emissions from the created wetlands were lower than the average methane emission of 82 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in a natural wetland in Ohio with similar hydrologic patterns. Methane emissions increased at a slower rate in the planted wetland (4 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)) than in the self-colonized wetland (16 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)) over a four-year period. Early methane emissions from created wetlands may depend as much or more on the methods used to create the wetlands, e.g. planting v. self colonization, as on their hydrogeomorphic conditions.

AB Combined magnetic mineral, organic and inorganic carbon content and geochemical analysis were conducted on laminated sediments from Santa Maria del Oro, a crater lake in Nayaril (western Mexico), to build up a model of the paleoenvironmental conditions for the last 2,600 years. This sequence is of particular importance as it constitutes a high resolution record of late Holocene climatic and environmental change in west-central Mexico. The analyses attained in this study allowed to recognize abrupt changes, to identify dry periods, and to compare these variations with available records in central Mexico. Laminations are caused in general by alternations of their main components: lithogenic detritus, biogenic and authigenic carbonates, and amorphous material from biological and volcanic remains. The volcaniclastic accumulations include two tephras, one of them, the Toba Jala, produced by the Cehoruco volcano. Six facies of silt, sand and peat were recognized Horizons characterized by high inorganic carbon content, authigenic siderite, and the dissolution of the finest ferrimagnetic mineralogy (magnetite) in reductive conditions, are upward followed by an increase in the concentrations of fine grained ferrimagnetic minerals. This sequence represents dissolution-precipitation cycles of magnetic minerals by anoxic/oxic variations in the water-sediment interface during warmer and dryer periods. These environmental conditions are especially present around 600 - 1140 A. D., and 1410 - 1830 A.D., which coincide with the archeological Classic period (300 - 900 A.D.) drought, the Little Ice Age (1350 - 1800 A.D.) and the droughts of the last 700 years. The effects of climatic variations such as the drought occurred in the archeological Classic period, the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, and the droughts over the last 700 years, have been documented in sites along central Mexico.

AB High-centred polygonal terrain is a widespread feature of Arctic landscapes that is sensitive to increasing ground temperatures because of its high ground-ice content. Understanding spatial variation in the distribution and sensitivity of high-centred polygonal terrain is important for predicting landscape change. In the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, Northwest Territories, Canada, mean annual ground temperatures in permafrost have increased between 1 and 2 degrees C over the last 40 years and high-centred polygonal terrain comprises about 10 per cent of the terrestrial landscape. To investigate factors affecting the distribution and potential degradation of ice wedges, we mapped high-centred polygonal terrain and ice-wedge melt ponds, and documented ice wedge related thermokarst at anthropogenic disturbances using 2004 aerial photographs. Historical melt pond distribution was assessed using 1972 aerial photographs. The density of polygonal terrain (up to 37%) was significantly higher in the northern than the southern part of the study area, where more abundant lacustrine sediments and lower ground temperatures have favoured ice-wedge development. Larger proportional melt pond area (0.68%), increases in pond area (up to 3.74%) and a higher frequency of major thermokarst activity following anthropogenic surface disturbance (54%) suggest that high-centred polygonal terrain in the northern part of the study area is more susceptible to degradation than in the southern part.

AB Understanding the role of fire in the Earth system, and particularly regional controls on its frequency and severity, is critical to risk assessment. Charcoal records from lake sediment and fire-scar networks from long-lived tree species have improved our understanding of long-term relationships between fire events and climate. This work has primarily focused on historically fire-prone ecosystems and regions. In the northeastern USA, where wildfire has been relatively infrequent in historical times, fire-risk assessments have incorporated little-to-no pre-historical data and little is known about long-term fire-climate relationships. We developed coupled, high-resolution records of moisture variability and fire from three ombrotrophic peatlands in Maine using testate amoebae and analysis of microscopic charcoal. Water-table depth reconstructions among the three sites were generally coherent, with high-magnitude dry and wet events corresponding within the uncertainty of age-depth models. At all sites, there was a significantly higher probability of fire events during high-magnitude droughts. However, although prolonged droughts were widespread and associated with higher probability of fire, the fire events were rarely synchronous among sites, with the exception of similar to 550 years before present (yr BP) when all three sites experienced both drought and fire. While fire has been relatively uncommon in the northeastern USA during the past century, our records clearly highlight the potential vulnerability of the region to future drought and fire impacts. Results also demonstrate the utility of coupled records of fire and climate in understanding regional fire-climate dynamics.

AB Over the past 3.5 million years, there have been several intervals when climate conditions were warmer than during the pre-industrialHolocene. Although past intervals of warming were forced differently than future anthropogenic change, such periods can provide insights into potential future climate impacts and ecosystem feedbacks, especially over centennial-to-millennial timescales that are often not covered by climate model simulations. Our observation-based synthesis of the understanding of past intervals with temperatures within the range of projected future warming suggests that there is a low risk of runaway greenhouse gas feedbacks for global warming of no more than 2 degrees C. However, substantial regional environmental impacts can occur. A global average warming of 1-2 degrees C with strong polar amplification has, in the past, been accompanied by significant shifts in climate zones and the spatial distribution of land and ocean ecosystems. Sustained warming at this level has also led to substantial reductions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, with sea-level increases of at least several metres on millennial timescales. Comparison of palaeo observations with climate model results suggests that, due to the lack of certain feedback processes, model-based climate projections may underestimate long-term warming in response to future radiative forcing by as much as a factor of two, and thus may also underestimate centennial-to-millennial-scale sea-level rise.

AB The growth of four white spruce (Picea glauca) clonal islands ranging in age from ca. 98 years to more than 400 years was investigated in the shrub zone of the forest-tundra east of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, The elongation of 20 similar-aged stems in each of the three youngest islands was monitored during 1988 and 1989. along with ground and air temperatures. Stems in the younger islands showed a more flexible response to both daily and annual variation in temperature, Younger islands showed faster recovery from frost events during elongation and longer periods of elongation in cooler years, Early spring warming that caused snowmelt to occur before the growing season appeared to result in moisture stress later in the period of elongation. In stems of spruce shrub, the branches are concentrated near ground level because growth is slow and adventitious buds develop on the stem after repeated loss of stem terminals through snow abrasion. In young trees, shading and increased moisture from trapped snow coincide with feather moss establishment and a deep active layer, resulting in higher ground temperatures and faster tree growth. It is during this early period of development that a tree may be best able to develop an erect stem. In later development, the lowest branches of trees become appressed, grow roots, and become second-order stems, and this process continues outward from the central stem. In older tree islands, peat accumulation and needle abrasion can lead to conditions less favourable for growth and maintenance of needles. Consequently, the canopy may thin, which reduces its ability to trap snow, When snow cover is reduced, lichen-heath establishes and permafrost intrudes into the mound. Subsequent growth of the secondary stems on the mound may be too slow to enable successful development of an erect stem. Thus. island development is largely dependent on changing ground temperatures, which become colder as peat accumulates and frost heaving elevates the mound. Warm spring and summer conditions appear to lead to unfavourable conditions for tree islands.

AB Understanding species' responses to fire regimes, particularly rare or threatened species, is important for land managers tasked with managing for biodiversity. Hickman's Allanaspides (Allanaspides hickmani, Anaspidesidae) is a rare, primitive, shrimp-like crustacean, with high conservation value. It is restricted to a single catchment in the island state of Tasmania, Australia, where it occurs within moorland pools typically containing crayfish (Ombrastacoides spp.) burrows. Although its moorland habitat has a long history of firing, adverse fire regimes are a potential threat to the species. A large part of its range is subject to planned burning to help manage the detrimental effects of high-intensity wildfires. The resilience of A. hickmani to low-moderate-intensity fires was investigated over 13 years using a replicated before-after-control-impact design. The fires resulted in an initial reduction in vegetation cover and surface water and an increase in water temperature. There was no effect of fire on A. hickmani captures 4 months after small-scale, low-intensity autumn burns. However, 5 months later, following an unintended larger-scale, medium-intensity spring burn, there was an 80-90% reduction in A. hickmani captures and their numbers did not recover until 6-9 years post-fire. It is not known whether the reduced catch was due to a reduction in the number of A. hickmani or their movement from pools into crayfish burrows. These findings together with evidence of a varied fire history, including high-intensity wildfires, within their range suggests that A. hickmani and its habitat are resilient to a range of fire frequencies and intensities provided that the fire regime does not degrade or lead to a complete loss of peat. Climate change predictions for warmer and drier summers in western Tasmania will increase the risk of peat loss. Planned burning is likely to be important for the protection of A. hickmani habitat from predicted adverse fire regimes.

AB Mosses dominate the surface cover in high northern latitudes and have the potential to play a key role in modifying the thermal and hydrologic regime of Arctic soils. These modifications in turn feed back to influence surface energy exchanges and hence may affect regional climate. However, mosses are poorly represented in models of the land surface. In this study the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM) was modified in two ways. First, additional soil texture types including mosses and lichens were added to more realistically represent northern soils. Second, the LSM was also modified so that a different soil texture type could be specified for each layer. Several experiments were performed using climate data from an Arctic tundra site in 1995. The model was run for a homogeneous loam soil column and then also for columns that included moss, lichen, peat, and sand. The addition of a surface layer of moss underlain by peat and loam had a substantial impact on modeled surface processes. First, moss acted as an insulative layer producing cooler summer temperatures (6.9 degreesC lower at 0.5 m) and warmer winter temperatures (2.3 degreesC higher at 0.5 m) when compared with a homogenous loam soil column. Second, a soil column with a moss surface had a greater surface infiltration, leading to greater storage of soil moisture in lower layers when compared with a homogeneous loam column. Last, moss modulated the surface energy exchanges by decreasing soil heat flux (57% in July) and increasing turbulent fluxes of heat (67% in July) and moisture (15% in July). Mosses were also more effective contributors to total latent heating than was a bare loam surface. These results suggest that the addition of moss and the ability to prescribe different soil textures for different soil layers result in a more plausible distribution of heat and water within the column and that these modifications should be incorporated into regional and global climate models.

AB Radiocarbon-dated pollen, rhizopod, chironomid and total organic carbon (TOC) records from Nikolay Lake (73degrees20'N, 124degrees 12' E) and a pollen record from a nearby peat sequence are used for a detailed environmental reconstruction of the Holocene in the Lena Delta area. Shrubby Alnus fruticosa and Betula exilis tundra existed during 10,300-4800 cal. yr BP and gradually disappeared after that time. Climate reconstructions based on the pollen and chironomid records suggest that the climate during ca. 10,300-9200 cal. yr BP was up to 2-3 degreesC warmer than the present day. Pollen-based reconstructions show that the climate was relatively warm during 9200-6000 cal. yr BP and rather unstable between ca. 5800-3700 cal. yr BP. Both the qualitative interpretation of pollen data and the results of quantitative reconstruction indicate that climate and vegetation became similar to modem-day conditions after ca. 3600 cal. yr BP. The chironomid-based temperature reconstruction suggests a relatively warm period between ca. 2300 and 1400 cal. yr BP, which corresponds to the slightly warmer climate conditions reconstructed from the pollen. Modem chironomid and rhizopod assemblages were established after ca. 1400 cal. yr BP. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zoige wetland, locating on the Tibet Plateau, accounts for 6.2% of organic carbon storage in China. However, the fate of the organic carbon storage in the Zoige wetland remains poorly understood despite the Tibetan Plateau is very sensitive to global climate change. As methane is an important greenhouse gas and methanogenesis is the terminal step in the decomposition of organic matter, understanding how methane emissions from the Zoige wetland is fundamental to elucidate the carbon cycle in alpine wetlands responding to global warming. In this study, microcosms were performed to investigate the effects of temperature and vegetation on methane emissions and microbial processes in the Zoige wetland soil. A positive correlation was observed between temperature and methane emissions. However, temperature had no effect on the main methanogenic pathway-acetotrophic methanogenesis. Moreover, methanogenic community composition was not related to temperature, but was associated with vegetation, which was also involved in methane emissions. Taken together, these results indicate temperature increases methane emissions in alpine wetlands, while vegetation contributes significantly to methanogenic community composition and is associated with methane emissions. These findings suggest that in alpine wetlands temperature and vegetation act together to affect methane emissions, which furthers a global warming feedback loop.

AB Changes in Faroese land surfaces during the late Holocene reflect intimate interactions between cultural and environmental development. Analyses of fossil wood, pollen and plant macrofossils indicate that the present open landscape replaced shrubby vegetation that was present from c. 6000 BC Up to c. AD 660. Conditions altered during the late Holocene, with loss of woody vegetation and increasing erosion: trends that were initiated prior to human settlement. AMS dating of sub-fossil Betula, Salix and Juniperus found buried in peat profiles from the islands of Suouroy, Sandoy, Eysturoy, Vagar and Streymoy, revealed that the islands had at least partial woody vegetation cover up to the time of continuous settlement. The settlement horizon, identified in a lacustrine sequence on the island of Eysturoy, dated to c. AD 570. It comprised pollen evidence for the cultivation of Hordeum, cultural macrofossil assemblages, charcoal fragments, diatom assemblage changes indicating lake nutrient enrichment and physical measurements showing increased sedimentation rates. The pollen record showed that heathland development was initiated prior to anthropogenic impact. The ecosystem impacts of settlement were therefore superimposed on landscape changes that began around AD 250. The earlier changes were most likely forced by increased storminess and declining atmospheric temperatures.

AB Organic carbon mineralization and storage in the inland water bodies is an important component of global carbon cycling. However, the mechanisms influencing carbon cycling in the inland water bodies remain uncertain. In this study, n-alkane data from a sediment core spanning the last glacial-interglacial cycle from Lake Xingkai in northeast China, were analyzed to determine response of regional carbon cycling to climate change. Prior to MIS 1 the sedimentary n-alkanes were mainly derived from terrigenous higher plants and helophytes in the wetland. By contrast, non-photosynthetic bacteria are probable major alternating source of sedimentary n-alkanes during MIS 1. The n-alkanes in the sediments are mainly influenced by the variations of lake level and deposition of mineral dust. The total organic carbon content (TOC) and TOC-normalized middle- and long-chain n-alkane concentrations increased during glacial times and decreased during interglacial periods, reflecting higher rates of organic matter decomposition under warmer climatic conditions. The temperature dependence of lacustrine organic matter mineralization suggests that the carbon burial potential of lakes in northeast China will decrease in the future as global warming intensifies.

AB Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas controlled by both biotic and abiotic processes. Few studies have investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, and climate change-induced shifts in CH4 flux and the overall carbon budget are therefore largely unknown. Hence, there is an urgent need for long-term in situ experiments allowing for the study of ecosystem processes over time scales relevant to environmental change. Here we present in situ CH4 and CO2 flux measurements from a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden subjected to 16 years of manipulations, including summer warming with open-top chambers, birch leaf litter addition, and the combination thereof. Throughout the snow-free season, the ecosystem was a net sink of CH4 and CO2 (CH4 -0.27 mg C m(-2) d(-1); net ecosystem exchange -1827 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), with highest CH4 uptake rates (-0.70 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during fall. Warming enhanced net CO2 flux, while net CH4 flux was governed by soil moisture. Litter addition and the combination with warming significantly increased CH4 uptake rates, explained by a pronounced soil drying effect of up to 32% relative to ambient conditions. Both warming and litter addition also increased the seasonal average concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the soil. The site was a carbon sink with a net uptake of 60 g Cm-2 over the snow-free season. However, warming reduced net carbon uptake by 77%, suggesting that this ecosystem type might shift from snow-free season sink to source with increasing summer temperatures.
   Plain Language Summary: Much attention has been directed toward methane (CH4) dynamics in peatlands and wet ecosystems at high latitudes, which are considered net CH4 sources which intensify the greenhouse effect and lead to further warming. However, few studies have hitherto investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, which likely exhibit both CH4 production and uptake. Therefore, climate-induced changes in CH4 exchange and the overall carbon balance are largely unknown. In this unique long-term field experiment, we investigated the response of biological CH4 uptake (microbial CH4 consumption) to increased summer warming by open-top chambers and deciduous leaf litter input in a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden, representative of a large proportion of the tundra landscape. We found that leaf litter addition significantly increases CH4 uptake rates due to a pronounced soil drying effect, which is intensified in combination with warming. Warming enhances CO2 release, while CH4 uptake is controlled by soil moisture. The study demonstrates the sensitivity and capacity of a wet heath ecosystem to function as a net CH4 sink. However, it was also shown that higher summer temperatures might shift the ecosystem toward a net carbon source due to an increase in CO2 release, thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect.

AB Meteorological data indicate that the increase in temperature at high-elevation sites with the background of global warming is much higher than the global average. However, there are few studies trying to evaluate temperature changes in high elevational areas over longer time scales. Here, we use brGDGTs in a sediment core collected from Hongyuan Peatland (3503 m a.s.l.), to reconstruct an independently-dated, high-resolution (similar to 100 years), quantitative record of mean annual temperature (MAT) over the past 13,300 yr BP on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our data, consisting with other quantitative local reconstructions, show a peak warmth in the middle Holocene (6100-5600 yr BP). Together with other published MAT records from similar to 30 degrees N in China, we find that the timing of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in high-elevation sites lagged that in low-elevation sites. We also find that the warming rate in early Holocene was faster at a higher elevation site, by comparing with another MAT reconstruction using the same archive and the same proxy. We hypothesize the delayed HTM at high-elevation areas was probably caused by the offset of remaining regional glaciers and/or snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau. The enhanced warming with elevation can be ascribed to snow albedo and latent heat release. Our new results may imply a faster high-elevation temperature rise with an on-going global warming, considering the disappearing regional glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Connections between environmental and cultural changes are analysed in Estonia during the past c. 4,500 years. Records of cereal-type pollen as (agri)cultural indices are compared with high-resolution palaeohydrological and annual mean temperature reconstructions from a selection of Estonian bogs and lakes (and Lake Igelsjon in Sweden). A broad-scale comparison shows increases in the percentage of cereal-type pollen during a decreasing trend in annual mean temperatures over the past c. 4,300 years, suggesting a certain independence of agrarian activities from environmental conditions at the regional level. The first cereal-type pollen in the region is found from a period with a warm and dry climate. A slow increase in pollen of cultivated land is seen around the beginning of the late Bronze Age, a slight increase at the end of the Roman Iron Age and a significant increase at the beginning of the Middle Ages. In a few cases increases in agricultural pollen percentages occur in the periods of warming. Stagnation and regression occurs in the periods of cooling, but regression at individual sites may also be related to warmer climate episodes. The cooling at c. 400-300 cal b.p., during the 'Little Ice Age' coincides with declines in cereal-type and herb pollen curves. These may not, however, be directly related to the climate change, because they coincide with war activities in the region.

AB The length increment and production of Sphagnum fuscum with enhanced nitrogen deposition (0, 10, 30 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and CO2 concentration (350, 700, 1000 and 2000 ppm) were measured. The experiment was carried out in the glasshouse, where S. fuscum was grown with the water table maintained at 10 cm below the moss surface for 120 d.
   For length growth, 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1): and for biomass production, 30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) were found to be the optimal loads. A load of 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) inhibited elongation and biomass production almost completely. An increased CO2 concentration reduced length increment slightly, but it did not have a significant effect on biomass production. However, above ambient CO2 concentrations increased capitulum density and stem dry mass per unit length. In addition, increased CO2 concentration accelerated relative growth in Sphagnum carpets when these also received additional nitrogen.
   The study highlights the high degree of spatial variability that occurs within Sphagnum fuscum. Differences in growth and biomass production between samples, not found in natural conditions, emerged during the experiment.
   On the basis of our results, the present nitrogen deposition load in Southern Finland (ca 6-10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) is quite suitable for the growth and production of S. fuscum. If N deposition increased substantially, differences in the vitality of the species might be expected.

AB Shoreline wetlands in the Great Lakes basin are susceptible to frequent changes in vegetation composition due to fluctuations in climate and water level. Although water-level changes occur naturally and are essential to maintain productivity, the magnitude and rate of these changes can have a significant effect on the wetland ecosystems. From a management and scientific viewpoint, it is important to be able to map and monitor these long-term changes. Using Long Point on Lake Erie as a test site, the goal of this research study is to refine methods for using multiple dates of Landsat imagery to map and monitor wetlands over a relatively long period of time. Landsat images covering the period from 1976 to 1999 are used to produce multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. Two change-detection methods, postclassification comparison and multitemporal data clustering, were selected to determine patterns of change in the Long Point wetlands over the 23 year period. These patterns are compared with lake water levels and Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) data recorded over the same time period. Results show that large sections of the shallow marshes of Long Point have experienced an increase in the amount of emergent vegetation over the period of study. This occurred simultaneously with downward trends in lake water level and PDSI values. Unlike the postclassification comparison approach, the multitemporal data clustering technique provides a method to observe fluctuations in NDVI over the entire time period.

AB The Romanian Carpathians are located at the confluence of three major atmospheric pressure fields: the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Siberian. Despite its importance for understanding past human impact and climate change, high-resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of Holocene hydroclimate variability, and in particular records of extreme precipitation events in the area, are rare. Here we present a 7500-year-long high-resolution record of past climatic change and human impact recorded in a peatbog from the Southern Carpathians, integrating palynological, geochemical and sedimentological proxies. Natural climate fluctuations appear to be dominant until 4500 years before present (yr BP), followed by increasing importance of human impact. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses document regular minerogenic deposition within the bog, linked to periods of high precipitation. Such minerogenic depositional events began 4000 yr BP, with increased depositional rates during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and during periods of societal upheaval (e.g. the Roman conquest of Dacia). The timing of minerogenic events appears to indicate a teleconnection between major shifts in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and hydroclimate variability in southeastern Europe, with increased minerogenic deposition correlating to low NAO index values. By linking the minerogenic deposition to precipitation variability, we state that this link persists throughout the mid-to -late Holocene. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Alpine wetlands play a sensitive function in global carbon cycle during the ongoing climate warming, yet the temporal patterns of carbon dynamics from in situ ground-based long-term observations remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured with the eddy covariance technique over an alpine peatland on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2007 to 2016. The wetland acted as a net CO2 source with a positive NEE (120.4 +/- 34.8 gC m(-2) year(-1), Mean +/- SD), with the mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP) of 500.3 +/- 59.4 gC m(-2) year(-1) and annual ecosystem respiration (RES) of 620.7 +/- 74.2 gC m(-2) year(-1). At the seasonal scale, the classification and regression trees (CART) analysis showed that aggregated growing season degree days (GDDs) were the predominant determinant on variations in monthly NEE and monthly GPP. Variations in monthly RES were determined by soil temperature (Ts). Furthermore, nongrowing season Ts had a significant positive correlation with the following year annual GPP (p < 0.05). Nongrowing season RES only accounted for about 25% of annual RES but had significant correlation with annual RES and annual NEE (p < 0.05). The further partial correlation analysis showed that nongrowing season air temperature (Ta, p = 0.05), rather than precipitation (PPT, p = 0.25) was a predominant determinant on variations in annual NEE. Our results highlighted the importance in carbon dynamics of climate fluctuations and CO2 emission from the nongrowing season in alpine wetlands. We speculated that the vast peadlands would positively feedback to climate change on the Tibetan plateau where the nongrowing season warming was significant.

AB We reconstructed the paleohydrologic and climatic history of the Lake Neor region, NW Iran, from the end of the late glacial to the middle Holocene (15,500-7500 cal yr BP). Subfossil chironomid and pollen assemblages in a sediment core from a peatland located south of Lake Neor enabled identification of four main hydrologic phases. The period 15,500-12,700 cal yr BP was characterized by a relatively dry climate with an open landscape, suggested by the abundance of Irano-Turanian steppe plants (e.g. Amaranthaceae, Artemisia and Cousinia). Dominance of several shallow-water and semi-terrestrial chironomid taxa (e.g. Pseudosmittia, Smittia/Parasmittia and Paraphaenocladius/Parametriocnemus) during this period is indicative of lower water tables in the wetland. Between 12,700 and 11,300 cal yr BP, chironomid taxa indicate higher wetland water tables, as suggested by the presence of Zavrelia, Chironomus anthracinus/plumosus-type and Micropsectra, which are inhabitants of open-water, lacustrine areas. The open-steppe vegetation remained dominant in the watershed during this time. Increasing wetland moisture could be explained by: (1) cool summers that reduced the evaporation rate; and/or (2) a decrease in duration of the summer dry season. The period 11,300-8700 cal yr BP was characterized by lower wetland moisture, contemporaneous with a delay in the expansion of deciduous forest, suggesting persistent dry climate conditions throughout the beginning of the Holocene, which may have been related to the intensified seasonality of precipitation. Around 8700 cal yr BP, higher wetland water levels, inferred from chironomids, occurred simultaneously with the onset of regional deciduous forest expansion, probably caused by a shortening of the summer dry period. We concluded that chironomids are appropriate paleoecological proxies to investigate global and local hydrologic variability in the Middle East.

AB There is growing evidence that within the last 2000 years western North America has had several droughts lasting > 100 years. In this paper we review the pollen evidence from four sites that record evidence of drought within the Great Basin. We use pollen ratios between taxonomic indicators of wet and dry climate to interpret droughts and compare these records with submerged stumps, tree-ring chronologies, packrat middens, and delta O-18 data from sediments. Pollen records provide evidence for long term changes that affect vegetation over a broad region. Studies in the Great Basin have identified four periods of low take levels that have been interpreted as century long droughts, with drought termination dates at approximately 1800, 1200, 800, and 550 cal yr BP. Our pollen records indicate that the period between 2000 and 1800 cal yr BP was dry, with the driest sites being in the western Great Basin. The century ending at 1200 cal yr BP may have been dry, but the pollen record does not support severe drought. Both of our high-resolution pollen records, Pyramid Lake and Mission Cross Bog, clearly identify a drought ending similar to 800 cal yr BP., whereas only the Pyramid Lake record indicates a drought ending at 550 cal yr BP. Evidence for wet climate at this time in northeastern Nevada constrains the regional extent of this drought. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The use of alternative materials to peat in soilless crop production, such as woody pruning wastes, has been reported by several researchers. In Mediterranean countries, several potential alternatives have been identified such as palm species or woody pruning wastes coming from different plant species. Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a tree crop widely used in Europe for urban landscaping and to provide shade. Mulberry trees are pruned in sericulture two or three times a year to obtain a better yield of leaves. In an urban landscape, the trees are pruned once a year to form the canopy. Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.) is a cereal crop widely cultivated because it is considered the fourth most important summer crop in the world after soy, corn, and sunflower. It is one among the few resilient crops that can adapt well to future climate change conditions, particularly increasing drought, soil salinity, and high temperatures. After the harvest, the inedible parts of the plant, the stalks and leaves, are left over and must be disposed of, most of the time by burning. Palm trees in Spain, as in most of the European regions where palms are cultivated, are mainly used as ornamental plants in urban areas. One of the most commonly used palm tree in landscaping is the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis Hort. Ex Chavaud). These palm trees are pruned up to twice a year in this region, producing huge amounts of biomass that are disposed of in landfills. In this experiment, physical and chemical parameters were determined in the different particle sizes (<0.25, 0.25-1, 1-2, and 2-4mm) of the raw residual materials from pruning activities of mulberry (Morus alba L.), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.), and palm (Phoenix canariensis) to evaluate their suitability for use as growing substrate. According to the results obtained, it can be concluded that the alternative materials for substrate preparation obtained from the pruning wastes of Morus alba (MAPW), Sorghum vulgare (SVPW), and Phoenix canariensis (PCPW) had suitable values of physical properties related to substrate porosity and wetting capacity. These materials also had high or very high total organic carbon (C) to total nitrogen (N) ratio values and low nutrient contents, except for potassium (K) in SVPW and PCPW.

AB Aims Canopy height is a key driver of forest biodiversity and carbon cycling. Accurate estimates of canopy height are needed for assessing mechanisms relating to ecological patterns and processes of tree height limitations. At global scales forest canopy height patterns are largely controlled by climate, while local variation at fine scales is due to differences in disturbance history and local patterns in environmental conditions. The relative effect of local environmental drivers on canopy height is poorly understood partly due to gaps in data on canopy height and methods for examining limiting factors. Here, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data on vegetation structure of boreal forests to examine the effects of environmental factors on potential maximum forest canopy height.
   Methods Relationships between maximum canopy height from ALS measures and environmental variables were examined to assess factors limiting tree height. Specifically, we used quantile regression at the 0.90 quantile to relate maximum canopy height with environmental characteristics of climate (i.e. mean annual temperature [MAT] and mean annual precipitation), terrain (i.e. slope) and depth-to-water (DTW) across a 33000 km(2) multiple use boreal forest landscape in northeast Alberta, Canada.
   Important Findings Maximum canopy height was positively associated with MAT, terrain slope and terrain-derived DTW, collectively explaining 33.2% of the variation in heights. The strongest explanatory variable was DTW explaining 26% of canopy height variation with peatland forests having naturally shorter maximum canopy heights, but also more sites currently at their maximum potential height. In contrast, the most productive forests (i.e. mesic to xeric upland forests) had the fewest sites at their potential maximum height, illustrating the effects of long-term forest management, wildfires and general anthropogenic footprints on reducing the extent and abundance of older, taller forest habitat in Alberta's boreal forest.

AB The Canadian Arctic is characterized by a high variation in landform types and there are complex interactions between land, water and the atmosphere which dramatically affect the distribution of biota. Biodiversity depends upon the intensity, predictability and scale of these interactions. Observations, as well as predictions of large-scale climate models which include ocean circulation, reveal an anomalous cooling of northeastern Canada in recent decades, in contrast to the overall significant increase in average annual temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. Predictions from models are necessary to forecast the change in the treeline in the 21st century which may lead to a major loss of tundra. The rate of change in vegetation in response to climate change is poorly understood. The treeline in central Canada, for example, is showing infilling with trees, and in some locations, northerly movement of the boundary. The presence of sea ice in Hudson Bay and other coastal areas is a major factor affecting interactions between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of ice and therefore hunting of seals by polar bears will reduce bear and arctic fox populations within the region. in turn, this is likely to have significant effects on their herbivorous prey populations and forage plants, Further, the undersurface of sea ice is a major site for the growth of algae and marine invertebrates which in turn act as food for the marine food web. A rise in sea-level may flood coastal saltmarsh communities leading to changes in plant assemblages and a decline in foraging by geese and other consumers. The anomalous cooling in the eastern Arctic, primarily in late winter and early spring, has interrupted northern migration of breeding populations of geese and ducks and led to increased damage to vegetation in southern arctic saltmarshes as a result of foraging. It is likely that there has been a significant loss of invertebrates in those areas where the vegetation has been destroyed, Warming will have major effects on permafrost distribution and on ground-ice resulting in a major destabilization of slopes and slumping of soil, and disruption of tundra plant communities. Disruption of peat and moss surfaces lead to loss of insulation, an increase in active-layer depth and changes in drainage and plant assemblages. Increases of UV-B radiation will strongly affect vulnerable populations of both plants and animals, The indigenous peoples will face major changes in life style, edibility of food and health standards, if there is a significant warming trend. The great need is for information which is sensitive to the changes and will assist in developing an understanding of the complex interactions of the arctic biota, human populations and the physical environment.

AB Observations of increased water colour have been made in lakes and rivers all across the northern mid-latitudes of Europe and North America, particularly during the last 10-20 yr. This water browning or brownification has been attributed to the increased organic carbon concentrations due to climate change and decreased add atmospheric deposition. Given that iron (Fe) may also increase water colour, the contribution of Fe to water brownification has received small attention. Our aim was to study the temporal trends of Fe in forested headwater catchments in eastern Finland, where an increasing air temperature and total organic carbon (TOC) trend had been observed in an earlier study. We found a statistically significant increasing trend also in stream water Fe concentrations and a strong correlation between the trends of TOC and Fe. The average increase in TOC and Fe concentrations between 1995 and 2006 was 0.5 mg l(-1) yr(-1) (2.5%), and 34.6 mu g 1(-1) yr(-1) (3.5%), respectively. These results indicate that the increased water colour or brownification in Northern Europe may not only be due to increased concentrations of organic matter but also increased concentrations of Fe. The change in precipitation and temperature conditions, particularly during late autumn and early winter periods, appeared to be the main environmental factor behind increasing Fe trends. The strong correlation between the trends of Fe and TOC indicated that the increased Fe-organic matter complexation is the mechanism behind increasing Fe trends, but further research is needed to assess the chemical forms of increased Fe that coupled with increased TOC concentrations would enhance water brownification.

AB The temporal variations in distribution pattern of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) have been used as an annual resolution record of past lake-level changes. Logs, preserved for thousands of years in bog and lakes (subfossil wood), were sampled from small lakes of the Scandinavian Mountains in west-central Sweden to construct a tree-ring chronology from an area where pines are sensitive to growth season (ie, summer) temperature. The chronology spans from AD 2006 to 4868 BC, with two minor gaps at 1600 BC and AD 900 and one larger gap at 2900 BC. The dendrochronological approach can provide a high quality long-term perspective on lake level fluctuations, which possibly can be coupled to changes in humidity. Submerged trunks were found in situ, embedded in sediments, and because trees from the earliest periods were not necessarily found at the deepest levels, this shows clearly that lake levels must have been lower than present at the time of tree-growth. The lake levels must have fluctuated, creating alternating conditions of pine regeneration and mortality. The fluctuating lake levels recorded are suggested to be a result of regional humidity increases and decreases, mainly governed by precipitation changes. Periods of lower lake levels were inferred at 4900-4800 BC, 3800-3600 BC, 3400-3250 BC, 2400-2200 BC, 2100-1800 BC, 1500-1100 BC, 900-800 BC, 400-100 BC, AD 50-300, AD 400-600, AD 900-1100, AD 1350-1500 and AD 1700-1800. Periods of higher lake levels are tentatively encountered at 3600-3400 BC, 3200-2900 BC, 2200-2100 BC, 1700-1500 BC, 1100-900 BC, 800-400 BC, 100 BC-AD 50, AD 300-400, AD 750-900, AD 1100-1250 and AD 1550-1700.

AB Understanding of the impact of past climate change on the terrestrial environment requires the development of quantitative palaeotemperature indicators that can be readily measured at closely spaced stratigraphic intervals. A high resolution oxygen isotopic record from Hawes Water, Lancashire, UK, reveals a degree of climatic instability that is greater than that recognised in previous isotopic studies of sites from the Atlantic margin of Northwest Europe. Four oscillations in the Late-Glacial interstadial before the onset of the Younger Dryas stadial are marked by sharp negative excursions in the delta(18)O record of the carbonate sediments and accompanied by marked changes in chironomid populations and the pollen record. The oscillations are interpreted as cold events: they correlate with events recognised in marine and lacustrine temperature proxy records as well as the isotopic record from the Greenland ice-cores. Results suggest that there has been a significant change in lake water composition since the Late-Glacial but it is argued that the Hawes Water isotopic record, constrained by the results of a study of carbonate precipitation in the modern lake, provides a quantitative record of Late-Glacial temperature change. The 7degreesC maximum temperature difference inferred from the isotopic data, from the Interstadial optimum to the Younger Dryas stadial, and the magnitude of individual oscillations, compare well with estimates from terrestrial (coleopterid) and marine (diatom sea surface temperature) records: all are significantly greater than the, independently calibrated, 4.2degreesC change documented from a chironomid record from South Scotland. Such differences need to be resolved if the impacts of climatic events are to be fully understood. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The response of tree-ring widths to groundwater-level decline varies among individual trees in forest stands. By contrast, vessel lumen area series contain common climatic signal of previous summer temperature.
   Drought events and the overuse of groundwater for water supply can cause significant declines of groundwater levels in naturally poorly drained forest stands. However, the documented growth reactions of trees to declines in groundwater level vary a lot and range from positive because of increased soil aeration to strongly negative because of drought stress. We analysed changes in tree-ring width and earlywood average vessel lumen area of Quercus robur from sites above an artesian aquifer, whose groundwater level declined in the late 1980s by about 5 m due to water pumping. Because we expected different responses of individual trees due to local microtopography and fine root distribution, we performed both site-level and tree-level analyses. Our results show that the site-level response of tree growth to groundwater-level pumping was not uniform. Individual trees were clustered into groups of drought-limited and water abundance-limited individuals. The response of trees to groundwater pumping differed between clusters-drought-sensitive trees responded negatively, whereas the growth of trees limited by water abundance remained stable or slightly increased. Inter-series correlation of drought-limited trees significantly increased in the period with the lowest groundwater level. In contrast to tree-ring widths, earlywood vessel lumen area series contained common temperature signal, with no imprint of groundwater-level alteration. Our results indicate that poorly drained forest ecosystems are characterized by a significantly individualistic response of radial growth to groundwater-level alteration. These individualistic responses could be, however, overshadowed in stand-level average tree-ring width chronologies.

AB The aim of this study was to establish the main drivers of the spatial variability in growing season CH4 flux within an arctic wetland ecosystem. During 3 years (2011-2013) we measured CH4 flux and potential drivers, e.g., CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration), temperature, water table depth, pore-water concentration of organic acids (e.g., acetate) and the vascular plant composition and density. The study included 16-20 main plots (C-main) and in 2013 also experimental plots (10 excluded muskoxen grazing, 9 snow fence and 10 automated chamber plots) distributed over 0.3 km(2). The results show a 1.8-times difference in CH4 flux magnitude inter-annually and 9- to 35-times spatially (depending on year and treatment). During all 3 years GPP was a strong driver of the variability in C-main plots. Accordingly, the plant productivity related variables NEE, GPP and acetate were singled out as the strongest drivers of the variability in 2013, when all variables were measured on a majority of the plots. These variables were equally strong drivers of the spatial variability in CH4 flux regardless of whether experimental plots were included in the analysis or not. The density of Eriophorum scheuchzeri was the strongest driver of the spatial variability in NEE, GPP and acetate. In conclusion, changes in vegetation composition or productivity of wet arctic ecosystems will have large impacts on their carbon balance and CH4 flux, irrespective of whether these changes are driven directly by climate change or by biotic interactions, such as grazing.

AB Arctic lakes and wetlands contribute a substantial amount of methane to the contemporary atmosphere, yet profound knowledge gaps remain regarding the intensity and climatic control of past methane emissions from this source. In this study, we reconstruct methane turnover and environmental conditions, including estimates of mean annual and summer temperature, from a thermokarst lake (Lake Qalluuraq) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska for the Holocene by using source-specific lipid biomarkers preserved in a radiocarbon-dated sediment core. Our results document a more prominent role for methane in the carbon cycle when the lake basin was an emergent fen habitat between similar to 12,300 and similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a time period closely coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in North Alaska. Enhanced methane turnover was stimulated by relatively warm temperatures, increased moisture, nutrient supply, and primary productivity. After similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a thermokarst lake with abundant submerged mosses evolved, and through the mid-Holocene temperatures were approximately 3 degrees C cooler. Under these conditions, organic matter decomposition was attenuated, which facilitated the accumulation of submerged mosses within a shallower Lake Qalluuraq. Reduced methane assimilation into biomass during the mid-Holocene suggests that thermokarst lakes are carbon sinks during cold periods. In the late-Holocene from similar to 2700 cal yr BP to the most recent time, however, temperatures and carbon deposition rose and methane oxidation intensified, indicating that more rapid organic matter decomposition and enhanced methane production could amplify climate feedback via potential methane emissions in the future.

AB We investigated the effects of simulated prospective increased temperatures and reduced soil moisture during the vegetation period on the early growth of three weed species that co-occur in spring crops and are currently spreading in Europe. Potted four-species crop-weed-communities of Abutilon theophrasti, Datura stramonium, Iva xanthiifolia, and maize were exposed to warming (ambient temperature + 2.5 degrees C, treatment "warm") and drought (soil water potential of -0.1 to -1.5 MPa, "dry") versus ambient temperature (treatment "ambient") and a soil water potential of -0.0036 MPa ("moist"), in four soil types (clay, loess, peat, sand based mixtures) in greenhouse settings. We determined the performance of the weeds in terms of total biomass accumulation as well as their morphological acclimation regarding root length, leaf size and root-to-shoot ratio at various combinations of the experimental factors. Warm-dry conditions had a significant negative effect on total weed biomass and also resulted in a higher proportion of maize in total aboveground biomass. In D. stramonium, aboveground vs. belowground allocation and leaf size responded more strongly to the experimental factors than in the other two species. Total biomass values of individual plants in warm-dry conditions on average were > 50%, 40 to 55%, and < 40% of those in ambient-moist conditions for A. theophrasti, I. xanthiifolia, and D. stramonium, respectively. Soil and its interaction with moisture and temperature additionally had a significant effect on various traits of the weed species which highlights the importance of considering this factor when investigating plant responses to altered climate conditions.

AB Warming and degradation of permafrost during the ongoing climate change is of growing concern. Recently, permafrost thawing has been recognized as a new factor triggering landslides in Iceland. Therefore, there is an increased need for a more thorough understanding of permafrost distribution and the temporal evolution of the ground thermal regime in this region. This study focuses on regional modelling of ground temperature evolution in Iceland for the last six decades (1960-2016) by employing the transient permafrost model CryoGrid 2 at 1-km spatial resolution. To account for the strong wind redistribution of snow in Iceland, we ran three realizations of the model, by forcing the embodied snow water equivalent model with 50, 100, and 150% of gridded precipitation. The modelled permafrost extent strongly depends on snow depth, with around 3-15 times more cells indicating permafrost in the halved-precipitation run in comparison to the other two precipitation runs. A three- to four-decade-long warming trend has led to warming or degradation of permafrost in some areas of Iceland. We roughly estimate that similar to 11 and 7% of the land area of Iceland was underlain by permafrost during the periods 1980-1989 and 2010-2016, respectively. Model validation with ground temperature measurements and the distribution of permafrost-related landforms, such as active rock glaciers and stable ice-cored moraines, together with palsas and peat plateaus, shows good agreement. The simulation results may be further used as a baseline for modelling of future permafrost evolution at a regional scale or for identification of landslide-susceptible areas in Iceland.

AB We reconstruct Holocene vegetation dynamics and associated hydroclimate change in the Chaiwopu Basin of the eastern Tianshan Mountains, China. Our study is based on 160 palynological samples from a well-dated peat core. Palynological, assemblages and the associated biome scores show that from similar to 11.5 to similar to 9.5 cal. Kyr BP desert vegetation dominated and from similar to 9.5 to similar to 7.9 cal. Kyr BP steppe and wetland vegetation expanded. From similar to 7.9 to similar to 6.5 cal. Kyr BP wetland continued to be important but coniferous forest also expanded. The period from similar to 6.5 to similar to 3.0 cal. Kyr BP was characterized by coniferous forest while wetlands contracted. Further expansion of coniferous forest coverage and contracted desert cover were features of the last 3000 years. The percentage of Picea and changes in the taiga biome indicate a persistent wetting trend during the Holocene. We infer that this was controlled by the increasing frequency of AMO (Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillations)-like events-linked in Siberian warm-season precipitation. The tundra biome score and the associated percentage of Poaceae+Cyperaceae in the Chaiwopu Basin indicate two major stages of wetland expansion. Wetland expansion can be possibly attributed to i) an increased glacier melt water supply when the ice extent was large, ii) an increase in precipitation when temperature remained more or less constant, or iii) a combined effect of increased precipitation and decreased temperature.

AB Role of changing climatic conditions on permafrost degradation and hydrology was investigated in the transition zone between the tundra and forest ecotones at the boundary of continuous and discontinuous permafrost of the lower Yenisei River. Three watersheds of various sizes were chosen to represent the characteristics of the regional landscape conditions. Samples of river flow, precipitation, snow cover, and permafrost ground ice were collected over the watersheds to determine isotopic composition of potential sources of water in a river flow over a two year period. Increases in air temperature over the last forty years have resulted in permafrost degradation and a decrease in the seasonal frost which is evident from soil temperature measurements, permafrost and active-layer monitoring, and analysis of satellite imagery. The lowering of the permafrost table has led to an increased storage capacity of permafrost affected soils and a higher contribution of ground water to river discharge during winter months. A progressive decrease in the thickness of the layer of seasonal freezing allows more water storage and pathways for water during the winter low period making winter discharge dependent on the timing and amount of late summer precipitation. There is a substantial seasonal variability of stable isotopic composition of river flow. Spring flooding corresponds to the isotopic composition of snow cover prior to the snowmelt. Isotopic composition of river flow during the summer period follows the variability of precipitation in smaller creeks, while the water flow of larger watersheds is influenced by the secondary evaporation of water temporarily stored in thermokarst lakes and bogs. Late summer precipitation determines the isotopic composition of texture ice within the active layer in tundra landscapes and the seasonal freezing layer in forested landscapes as well as the composition of the water flow during winter months.

AB To quantify the fluxes and examine the controls on greenhouse gas emissions from the permafrost marshes where the fate of the large quantity of soil organic carbon remains poorly understood, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions in the northern region of the Great Xing'an Mountains, northeast China, in the thawing seasons of 2011 and 2012. The mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the marshes were estimated at 403.47 and 0.14 mg m(-2) h(-1) on average during the two years. Soil temperature was determined as the primary control on the seasonal greenhouse gas emissions during the growing period. The Q(10) values, calculated from the exponential regression between soil temperature and CO2 emissions, suggest that the sensitivity of CO2 flux to climate warming has a high spatially variability in the study area. Absorption of atmospheric CH4 was seasonally detected at the sites with lower water table, which confirms the potential of the natural marshes as CH4 sink when water table goes down due to climate change. When viewed from the ecosystem scale, the mean annual water table level and aboveground primary production were deemed as the dominant influencing factors for the mean annual fluxes, which suggests that there were different controls on the gas emissions at different spatial scales. Therefore, the primary controls of the CO2 and CH4 emissions at different spatial scales need to be surveyed in more detail when focusing on the future alteration of greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost marshes due to climate warming.

AB Wetland ecosystems are an important component in global carbon (C) cycles and may exert a large influence on global climate change. Predictions of C dynamics require us to consider interactions among many critical factors of soil, hydrology, and vegetation. However, few such integrated C models exist for wetland ecosystems. In this paper, we report a simulation model, Wetland-DNDC, for C dynamics and methane (CH4) emissions in wetland ecosystems. The general structure of Wetland-DNDC was adopted from PnET-N-DNDC, a process-oriented biogeochemical model that simulates C and N dynamics in upland forest ecosystems. Several new functions and algorithms were developed for Wetland-DNDC to capture the unique features of wetland ecosystems, such as water table dynamics, growth of mosses and herbaceous plants, and soil biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions. The model has been validated against various observations from three wetland sites in Northern America. The validation results are in agreement with the measurements of water table dynamics, soil temperature, CH4 fluxes, net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and annual C budgets. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the most critical input factors for C dynamics in the wetland ecosystems are air temperature, water outflow parameters, initial soil C content, and plant photosynthesis capacity. NEP and CH4 emissions are sensitive to most of the tested input variables. By integrating the primary drivers of climate, hydrology, soil and vegetation, the Wetland-DNDC model is capable of predicting C biogeochemical cycles in wetland ecosystems.

AB Moss-associated N(2)fixation provides a substantial but heterogeneous input of new N to nutrient-limited ecosystems at high latitudes. In spite of the broad diversity of mosses found in boreal and Arctic ecosystems, the extent to which host moss identity drives variation in N(2)fixation rates remains largely undetermined. We used(15)N(2)incubations to quantify the fixation rates associated with 34 moss species from 24 sites ranging from 60 degrees to 68 degrees N in Alaska, USA. Remarkably, all sampled moss genera fixed N-2, including well-studied feather and peat mosses and genera such asTomentypnum, Dicranum, andPolytrichum. The total moss-associated N(2)fixation rates ranged from almost zero to 3.2 mg N m(-2)d(-1), with an average of 0.8 mg N m(-2)d(-1), based on abundance-weighted averages of all mosses summed for each site. Random forest models indicated that moss taxonomic family was a better predictor of rate variation across Alaska than any of the measured environmental factors, including site, pH, tree density, and mean annual precipitation and temperature. Consistent with this finding, mixed models showed that trends in N(2)fixation rates among moss genera were consistent across biomes. We also found "hotspots" of high fixation rates in one-fourth of sampled sites. Our results demonstrated the importance of moss identity in influencing N(2)fixation rates. This in turn indicates the potential utility of moss identity when making ecosystem N input predictions and exploring other sources of process rate variation.

AB Isotopic radiocarbon (Delta C-14) signatures of ecosystem respiration (Reco) can identify old soil carbon (C) loss and serve as an early indicator of permafrost destabilization in a warming climate. Warming also stimulates plant productivity causing plant respiration to dominate Reco Delta C-14 signatures and potentially obscuring old soil C loss. Here, we investigate how a wide spatio-temporal gradient of permafrost thaw and plant productivity affects Reco Delta C-14 patterns and isotopic partitioning. Spatial gradients came from a warming experiment with doubling thaw depth and variable biomass, and a vegetation removal manipulation to eliminate plant contributions. We sampled in August and September to capture transitions from high to low plant productivity, decreased surface soil temperature, and relatively small seasonal thaw extensions. We found that surface processes dominate spatial variation in old soil C loss and a process-based partitioning approach was crucial for constraining old soil C loss. Resampling the same plots in different times of the year revealed that old soil C losses tripled with cooling surface temperature, and the largest old soil C losses were detected when the organic-to-mineral soil horizons thawed (similar to 50-60 cm). We suggest that the measured increase in old soil respiration over the season and when the organic-to-mineral horizon thawed, may be explained by mobilization of nitrogen that stimulates microbial decomposition at depth. Our results suggest that soil C in the organic to mineral horizon may be an important source of soil C loss as the entire Arctic region warms and could lead to nonlinearities in projected permafrost climate feedbacks.

AB Declining surface water quality from agricultural nonpoint sources is of great concern across the Great Plains. Trends in the earth climate create abrupt changes in domestic weather (i.e., precipitation) that can alter the impact of the nonpoint sources on water quality. A 2-year (dry 2009 and wet 2010) study was conducted to assess the impact of soil C, N, and S losses by runoff on water quality of Salt Creek in the Roca watershed, Nebraska. Average dissolved nutrient concentrations in runoff were 95.4 and 94.9% of the total for the dry and wet years, respectively. The remaining nutrients in runoff were associated with sediment. Nutrient concentrations during the dry year were generally greater than those during the wet year. Average concentrations for 2009 were 63.2, 1.87, and 53.5 mg/L for C, N, and S, respectively, whereas concentrations for 2010 were 54.0, 3.0, and 16.6 mg/L, respectively. Total soil nutrient losses were greater for the wet year than those for the dry year. The dry year nutrient losses were 607, 19,978, and 441,569 metric tons for C, N, and S, respectively, whereas losses for the wet year were 1,997, 138,380, and 608,172 metric tons, respectively. These losses could be considered as the annual nutrient loadings for Salt Creek. Concentrations of C, N, and S measured in Salt Creek during the study were not expected to have any adverse effect on human/animal health or aquatic life. We concluded that greater precipitation during the wet year increased the impact on water quality and soil fertility in the Roca watershed.

AB Cold climate regions provide a multitude of ecosystem services. However, cold regions under a changing climate could be more vulnerable than others because their glaciers, freezing soils and peatlands are sensitive to the slightest of changes in climate. This has posed serious threats to the water resources, sustainable goods production and ecosystem services that depend on regional water quality. Therefore, proper watershed management is imperative. In this paper, we investigate this issue in a cold climate water-shed in central Alberta, Canada with the main objective of quantifying the impacts of climate change on water quality status. We modified specific water quality related processes of a process-based model - Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a view of better representing the reality of cold climate regions. A SWAT model is then built-up, followed up by a multi-site and multi-objective (streamflow, sediment and water quality) calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis in a baseline period (1983 - 2013). The calibrated and validated model is then fed with a high spatial resolution (25 km) daily future climate data - the CanRCM4. Improvements on stream water temperature (Ts) and dissolved oxygen (DO) simulations justified the modifications. This model is able to simulate the dynamics of other water quality variables (carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand - cBOD, total nitrogen - TN and phosphorus TP) with a wide range of accuracy (very good to satisfactory) in the base period. Agriculture areas account for the highest amount of annual TN (11.16 kgN/ha) and TP (2.88 kgP/ha) yield rate in the base period leading to poor water quality status in the immediate downstream reaches. The situation would be further exacerbated (16.52 kgN/ha and 4.89 kgP/ha) in future. Finally, we tested different alternative management options to compare the water quality status of the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) under a changing climate. Significant reduction in future nutrient concentrations (similar to 20% on TN and 60% on TP) can be achieved using a certain combination of management practices and the ecological status of the basin can be improved. This demonstrates that the modified SWAT model can be applied to other cold climate regions, and that the results can be translated to help in managing the ARB in a more holistic way.

AB High Andean ecosystems, such as grasslands and peatlands, are fragile and, due to the effects of climate change, their sustainability is being jeopardized. A key factor hampering sustainable management efforts from the government and communities, is the lack or scarcity of in-situ eco-hydrological and climate data. In that sense, remote sensing techniques offers a powerful alternative for the assessment of the evolution of these ecosystems, by providing a holistic view of the territory. The objective of this work is to determine both the spatial and temporal evolution of the local atmospheric temperature of the Apacheta micro-basin in Ayacucho over the past 34 years, using the soil surface temperature (SST) as a proxy. For this, thermal data of Landsat series (TM, ETM+ and TIRS sensors), covering the period from 1985 to 2018, were used. The TSS estimates were made from the emissivity correction of the brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere, considering the negligible atmospheric effect due to the conditions of high atmospheric transmissivity in the study area. The results show a positive trend of the SST with an increase of 4.9 degrees C, equivalent to 27.5% of the SST. Trends are higher (5.8 degrees C) in the snowy areas (equivalent to 35.3% of the TSS in the whole micro-basin). The SST in the snow area explains the 83.6% of the behavior of the snow cover derived by the NDSI, with a decreasing surface as SST increase.

AB Background and Aims The carbon (C) balance of boreal terrestrial ecosystems is sensitive to increasing temperature, but the direction and thresholds of responses are uncertain. Annual C uptake in Picea and other evergreen boreal conifers is dependent on seasonal-and cohort-specific photosynthetic and respiratory temperature response functions, so this study examined the physiological significance of maintaining multiple foliar cohorts for Picea mariana trees within an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem in Minnesota, USA.
   Methods Measurements were taken on multiple cohorts of needles for photosynthetic capacity, foliar respiration (R-d) and leaf biochemistry and morphology of mature trees from April to October over 4 years. The results were applied to a simple model of canopy photosynthesis in order to simulate annual C uptake by cohort age under ambient and elevated temperature scenarios.
   Key Results Temperature responses of key photosynthetic parameters [i.e. light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation (A(sat)), rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport rate (J(max))] were dependent on season and generally less responsive in the developing current-year (Y0) needles compared with 1-year-old (Y1) or 2-year-old (Y2) foliage. Temperature optimums ranged from 18.7 to 23.7, 31.3 to 38.3 and 28.7 to 36.7 degrees C for A(sat), V-cmax and J(max), respectively. Foliar cohorts differed in their morphology and photosynthetic capacity, which resulted in 64 % of modelled annual stand C uptake from Y1&2 cohorts (LAI 0.67m(2) m(-2)) and just 36 % from Y0 cohorts (LAI 0.52 m(2) m(-2)). Under warmer climate change scenarios, the contribution of Y0 cohorts was even less; e.g. 31 % of annual C uptake for a modelled 9 degrees C rise in mean summer temperatures. Results suggest that net annual C uptake by P. mariana could increase under elevated temperature, and become more dependent on older foliar cohorts.
   Conclusions Collectively, this study illustrates the physiological and ecological significance of different foliar cohorts, and indicates the need for seasonal-and cohort-specific model parameterization when estimating C uptake capacity of boreal forest ecosystems under ambient or future temperature scenarios.

AB An improved representation of the carbon cycle in permafrost regions will enable more realistic projections of the future climate-carbon system. Currently JULES (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) - the land surface model of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) - uses the standard four- pool RothC soil carbon model. This paper describes a new version of JULES (vn4.3_ permafrost) in which the soil vertical dimension is added to the soil carbon model, with a set of four pools in every soil layer. The respiration rate in each soil layer depends on the temperature and moisture conditions in that layer. Cryoturbation/bioturbation processes, which transfer soil carbon between layers, are represented by diffusive mixing. The litter inputs and the soil respiration are both parametrized to decrease with increasing depth. The model now includes a tracer so that selected soil carbon can be labelled and tracked through a simulation. Simulations show an improvement in the large-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of soil carbon over the standard version of JULES (vn4.3). Like the standard version of JULES, the vertically discretized model is still unable to simulate enough soil carbon in the tundra regions. This is in part because JULES underestimates the plant productivity over the tundra, but also because not all of the processes relevant for the accumulation of permafrost carbon, such as peat development, are included in the model. In comparison with the standard model, the vertically discretized model shows a delay in the onset of soil respiration in the spring, resulting in an increased net uptake of carbon during this time. In order to provide a more suitable representation of permafrost carbon for quantifying the permafrost carbon feedback within UKESM, the deep soil carbon in the permafrost region (below 1 m) was initialized using the observed soil carbon. There is now a slight drift in the soil carbon (< 0.018% decade(-1)), but the change in simulated soil carbon over the 20th century, when there is little climate change, is comparable to the original vertically discretized model and significantly larger than the drift.

AB The European Alps and their forelands provide a range of different archives and climate proxies for developing climate records in the time interval 60-8 thousand years (ka) ago. We review quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches for reconstructing climatic variables in the Austrian and Swiss sector of the Alpine region within this time interval. Available quantitative to semi-quantitative climate records in this region are mainly based on fossil assemblages of biota such as chironomids, cladocerans, co-leopterans, diatoms and pollen preserved in lake sediments and peat, the analysis of oxygen isotopes in speleothems and lake sediment records, the reconstruction of past variations in treeline altitude, the reconstruction of past equilibrium line altitude and extent of glaciers based on geomorphological evidence, and the interpretation of past soil formation processes, dust deposition and permafrost as apparent in loess-palaeosol sequences. Palaeoclimate reconstructions in the Alpine region are affected by dating uncertainties increasing with age, the fragmentary nature of most of the available records, which typically only incorporate a fraction of the time interval of interest, and the limited replication of records within and between regions. Furthermore, there have been few attempts to cross-validate different approaches across this time interval to confirm reconstructed patterns of climatic change by several independent lines of evidence. Based on our review we identify a number of developments that would provide major advances for palaeoclimate reconstruction for the period 60-8 ka in the Alps and their forelands. These include (1) the compilation of individual, fragmentary records to longer and continuous reconstructions, (2) replication of climate records and the development of regional reconstructions for different parts of the Alps, (3) the cross-validation of different proxy-types and approaches, and (4) the reconstruction of past variations in climate gradients across the Alps and their forelands. Furthermore, the development of downscaled climate model runs for the Alpine region 60-8 ka, and of forward modelling approaches for climate proxies would expand the opportunities for quantitative assessments of climatic conditions in Europe within this time-interval.

AB The Great Whale River region on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, Canada, encompasses the villages of Whapmagoostui (Cree First Nation) and Kuujjuarapik (Inuit) and surrounding areas. The principal field station of Centre d'etudes nordiques (CEN: Centre for Northern Studies) has operated at Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik (W-K; 55 degrees 15' N, 77 degrees 45' W) since the 1970s, with diverse research projects on past and present environments. The climate at W-K is strongly influenced by the proximity of Hudson Bay, and the recent pronounced loss of sea ice in this sector of northern Canada has been accompanied by large increases in air temperature. Discontinuous or scattered permafrost occurs throughout the region and is degrading rapidly. The W-K region continues to experience particularly rapid isostatic uplift in response to the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Parabolic dunes occur along the coast and are strongly influenced by the plant cover. Paleoecological studies have documented the Holocene evolution of landscapes, including lakes, wetlands, and forests. The vegetation type is coastal forest tundra, with some 400 recorded species. Studies on certain insect groups provide a baseline for assessing future ecological change. The first signs of human occupation in the W-K region have been dated at 3800 BP. The arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company in the 18(th) century marked the onset of continuous occupation. Rapid social, economic, and environmental change initiated in the mid-20(th) century continues to this day.

AB Wildfires that expose the soil organic layer to high heat levels can alter soil organic matter (SOM), which includes watersoluble organic matter (WSOM) components. Various evaluation methods were used to characterize and quantify the effects of high heat levels on SOM and WSOM, including ion chromatography, thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), colorimetry, elemental analysis, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH-py-GC/MS), total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, three-dimensional excitationemission matrix (3DEEM) spectroscopy, and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. In this study, we applied each of these evaluation methods using soil samples that were collected from broadleaf, coniferous, and bamboo forests and peatland in Japan and exposed to different initial high heat levels. Based on the TG-DTA results, the remaining mass in select soil samples markedly decreased when reheated to approximately 200 degrees C. Comparatively, the TMAH-py-GC/MS results indicated a drastic change in SOM composition and the production of low molecular organic components (<C-10) at this temperature. The TOC analysis results also indicated a significant increase in the proportion of WSOM. Colorimetry and elemental analysis results indicated that the soil color was dependent upon the initial heating temperature and was related to the H/C and O/C atomic ratios. The results of this study can form the basis for future similar studies for accurately characterizing and quantifying the heat effects on soil, and the effects of increasing wildfires due to climate change.

AB Background: The important greenhouse gas (GHG) methane is produced naturally in anaerobic wetland soils. By affecting the production, oxidation and transport of methane to the atmosphere, plants have a major influence upon the quantities emitted by wetlands. Different species and functional plant groups have been shown to affect these processes differently, but our knowledge about how these effects are influenced by abiotic factors such as water regime and temperature remains limited. Here we present a mesocosm experiment comparing eight plant species for their effects on internal transport and overall emissions of methane under contrasting hydrological conditions. To quantify how much methane was transported internally through plants (the chimney effect), we blocked diffusion from the soil surface with an agar seal.
   Results: We found that graminoids caused higher methane emissions than forbs, although the emissions from mesocosms with different species were either lower than or comparable to those from control mesocosms with no plant (i.e. bare soil). Species with a relatively greater root volume and a larger biomass exhibited a larger chimney effect, though overall methane emissions were negatively related to plant biomass. Emissions were also reduced by lowering the water table.
   Conclusions: We conclude that plant species (and functional groups) vary in the degree to which they transport methane to the atmosphere. However, a plant with a high capacity to transport methane does not necessarily emit more methane, as it may also cause more rhizosphere oxidation of methane. A shift in plant species composition from graminoids to forbs and/or from low to high productive species may lead to reduction of methane emissions.

AB Geomorphic disturbances to surrounding terrain induced by thermal degradation of permafrost often lead to surface ponding or soil saturation. However, interactions between soil moisture and temperature on belowground carbon processes are not fully understood. We conducted batch incubation for three temperature treatments [constant freezing (CF), constant thawing (CT), and fluctuating temperatures (FTC)] and two soil moisture conditions (ponded and unsaturated). Extracellular enzyme activity was higher under ponded conditions than under unsaturated conditions, resulting in higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels for ponded conditions. More CO2 and less CH4 were emitted under unsaturated conditions than under ponded conditions. Carbon dioxide emission was similar for CT and FTC treatments regardless of moisture conditions. However, CH4 emission was higher under ponded conditions than under unsaturated conditions for CT treatments, but was very low for FTC treatments regardless of moisture conditions. Little CO2 and CH4 were produced in CF treatments. Despite similar CO2 and CH4 emission levels for CT and FTC treatments, lower DOC levels were observed in the latter, indicating slower soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition. Similar DOC variation patterns between CT and CF treatments indicated that SOC decomposition was considerable and further degradation to CO2 or CH4 was negligible even for CF treatments. The SOC decomposition and CO2 and CH4 emissions were considerable for FTC treatments. Our results suggest that labile-C produced during SOC decomposition in seasonally frozen soils and permafrost may provide supplemental substrates that would enhance the positive feedback to climate change with rising temperatures and wetter conditions.

AB Many ecological functions of wetlands are influenced by wet-periods, i.e., the time interval when groundwater table (GWT) is continuously near the land surface. Hence, there is a crucial need to understand the controls on interannual variations of wet-periods. Given the scarcity of long-term measurements of GWT in wetlands, understanding variations in wet-periods using a measurement approach alone is challenging. Here we used a physically based, fully distributed hydrologic model, in synergy with publicly available hydrologic data, to simulate long-term wet-period variations in 10 inland forested wetlands in a southeastern US watershed. A Bayesian regression and variable selection framework was then implemented to (a) evaluate the extent to which the simulated wet-periods can be estimated and predicted by precipitation (Ppt) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and (b) infer the relative roles of seasonal Ppt and PET. Our results indicate that wet-period start date and duration could vary by more than 6 months during the 32 year simulation period. Remarkably, 60-90% of these variations could be captured using regressions based on seasonal Ppt and PET in most wetlands. Effects of seasonal meteorological conditions on wet-period variations were found to be nonuniform, which indicate that the annual variables may not explain interannual variations in wet-periods. The Bayesian framework was able to predict wet-period variations with errors smaller than 1 month at a 90% confidence level. The presented framework provides a minimalistic approach for estimating and predicting wet-period variations in wetlands and may be used to understand the future responses of associated ecological functions in wetlands.

AB Lake Jingpo is located in Ning'an County, Southeast Heilongjiang Province, northeast China and is strongly influenced by the East Asian monsoon system. Diatom analysis of the last 5000 cal. yr BP according to the results of AMS C-14 dating provides a detailed history of paleoenvironment changes. The relative abundance of diatom species, Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira, Cydostephanos, Stephanodiscus and Discostella species can be used as a proxy of spring wind speed, which is supported by the results of seasonal diatom and reviews of literature on the autoecologies of these species. In the sediment, high relative abundance of A formosa, Aulacoseira species indicates high wind-driven turbulence of the water column. The diatom record of the past 5000 years shows that the spring wind speed shifted from weak to strong to weak. In our result, the relative abundance of Aulacoseira species decreased sharply, while that of small-cell Cyclotella sensu lato (including Stephanodiscus, Cyclostephanos and Discostella) increased since 2000 cal. yr BP. The broad alternations between these species are probably keyed to mean temperature and wind variations that control lake circulation and stratification. Our results support the hypotheses that abiotic drivers affect the size structure of planktonic communities and that a warmer climate favors small-sized diatom cells. The change in the ratio of A. formosa and Aulacoseira species to Cyclostephanos. Stephanodiscus and Discostella species (AA/SC) basically correspond to change of the spring insolation (May) at 45 degrees N. Abundance of diatoms in Lake Jingpo roughly corresponds to changes in the Mid- to Low-latitude Circulation Index of the northern hemisphere as indicated by WIZ concentration from the GISP2 ice-core, the strength of the Asian summer monsoon as recorded from Hani Peat in Northeastern China, and from a stalagmite found in the Dongge cave in southern China. The results are important in demonstrating the sensitivity of diatoms to climate change, and providing proxy evidence for spring wind speed marked by shifts of diatom type. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Soil respiration is an important component of terrestrial carbon cycling and is sensitive to environmental change. Most previous studies focus on the effect of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration, whereas the impact of spatial heterogeneity (e.g., microtopography) is seldom studied.
   To test the impact of microtopography on soil respiration, we performed a field investigation to examine soil respiration, soil temperature, soil water content, soil total porosity, soil organic content, and plant biomass at a hummock site (composed of grass hummocks and inter-hummock areas) and an adjacent flat meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.
   Similar seasonal dynamics of soil respiration in the grass hummocks, inter-hummock areas, and flat meadow were found in the alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. However, soil respiration of the grass hummocks was 79.3% and 413.9% higher than that of the flat meadow during the growing (April, June, August) and non-growing seasons (October, December, February), respectively. Although there was no difference in soil respiration between the inter-hummock areas and the flat meadow during the non-growing season, soil respiration was 42.5% higher at the inter-hummock areas than the flat meadow during growing season. Larger soil porosity, greater surface area, and more substrate supply, but not more root growth, likely contributed to the higher soil respiration of grass hummocks.
   Our findings suggest that the impact of spatial heterogeneity on soil respiration should be taken into consideration to facilitate the accurate estimation of soil carbon fluxes at ecosystem and regional scales.

AB Permafrost in Arctic watersheds limits soil biological activity to a thin, seasonally thawed active layer that contributes water to streams. In many hillslopes, relatively wet drainage features called water tracks have distinct freeze-thaw patterns that affect groundwater flow and storage, and thus the export of heat and solutes to Arctic streams. This study uses groundwater flow and energy transport models to examine potential controls on the timing and duration of freeze-thaw conditions and the magnitude of temperature fluctuations within water tracks and their adjacent hillslopes. The simulated length of the active-layer thaw season varies by 1 month over the range of snow-cover and mean annual air-temperature scenarios simulated. The timing and duration of freezing is particularly sensitive to depth and duration of snow cover. Thus, the deeper snowpack covers that can accumulate in water tracks contribute to their more persistent thaw conditions and their ability to conduct groundwater downslope. A three-dimensional simulation shows that during the summer thaw season, the water track captures groundwater laterally from half way across the hillslope. The models presented here elucidate key mechanisms driving small-scale variation in the active-layer thermal regime of tundra hillslopes, which may be responsible for changes in drainage-network geometry and Arctic biogeochemical fluxes under a warming climate.

DE Diamictite; Coal; Rio Bonito Formation; Post-glacial deposits; Climate
   change; Late Paleozoic Ice Age
AB The end of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age was followed by a global warming climate. This climate transition is characterized by, beyond other aspects, a decrease in the intensity of physical weathering, characteristic of arid conditions, and an increase in the intensity of chemical weathering. In the southern Paran?a Basin, the post-glacial onset and intense record of ?Pedra-Areia? diamictite within the Mariana Pimentel paleovalley was likely controlled by warming climate conditions and mark a period of intense rainfall and slope instability. To test this hypothesis, we have performed facies and sequence stratigraphy analysis on cores located within the Mariana Pimentel paleovalley, and U?Pb-Hf investigations to acquire sediment provenance information. Diamictite deposits were produced by debris flow processes, which transported regolith from the valley wall to the bottom, eroding and incorporating mud and peat when reaching the bottom of the valley. The local source of sediment is explained by the sedimentological characteristics of the diamictite and zircon provenance studies. These deposits are preserved within the transgressive system tract and the abundant deposition was controlled by increasing temperature and humidity, and thus the increase in chemical weathering on the walls, forming the regolith. The development of more humid and warmer climatic conditions, contrasting with the cold and dry climate of the glacial period, was an important control over diamictite deposition.

AB Sea cliffs along the western coast of Cape Liptrap at Arch Rock provide nearly continuous exposure of calcareous eolianites dated at 68-112 ka (five optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages). Calcareous eolian deposition began immediately after the last interglacial marine highstand (Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5e) and continued during sea level fall until the beginning of OIS 4. West- southwesterly winds transported calcareous sand across similar to 12 km of exposed continental shelf by the beginning of OIS 4. A brief period of cold, arid, windy continental climate with ephemeral, but intense, surface runoff immediately preceded the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This resulted in fluvial reworking of the calcarenites into an alluvial fan dated at 23-25 ka (four OSL ages). The fan overlies peat dated at 25,279 yr cal BP and is capped by a paleosol dated at 60 10 yr cal BP. Concurrent eolian reworking by northwesterly winds of siliceous sediments on marine terraces along the eastern and central portion of Cape Liptrap formed siliceous longitudinal dunes with ages ranging from 19 to 24 ka (five OSL ages). The phase of maximum landscape instability at Cape Liptrap coincides with solar insolation and air temperature minima and preceded the LGM by several thousand years. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Knowledge of the environmental controls of carbon dioxide fluxes is essential for understanding the dynamics of carbon exchange between ecosystems and atmosphere. In this study we investigated soil respiration and moss photosynthesis as well as their contribution to the net carbon dioxide flux of two different wet tundra systems. During two summers, in situ carbon dioxide fluxes were measured in a tussock tundra and in a low-centre polygonal tundra on Taimyr Peninsula, central Siberia. Measurements were carried out by means of a multichannel gas exchange system. Results show pronounced differences in soil respiration rates as related to microscale topography, mainly due to differences of soil water table and soil temperatures. Modelling of soil respiration for individual microsites revealed differences of process performance with respect to both factors. The wet microsites showed the highest potential regarding an increase of soil respiration rates in warmer and drier climate change scenarios. Another important process compensating the CO2 release from the soil was the photosynthesis of the moss layer, assimilating as much as 51% to 98% of the daily amount of carbon dioxide released from wet tundra soils. This result demonstrates the importance of mosses in the context of tundra ecosystem processes. The magnitude of net system fluxes of the whole system at the depression of the polygonal tundra was strongly influenced by changes in soil water table. Consequently, any changes of the hydrology, as anticipated in the context of global change, would effectively alter the carbon balance of wet tundra systems.

AB Thermokarst features, such as thaw ponds, are hotspots for methane emissions in warming lowland tundra. Presently we lack quantitative knowledge on the formation rates of thaw ponds and subsequent vegetation succession, necessary to determine their net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This study sets out to identify development trajectories and formation rates of small-scale (<100 m(2)), shallow arctic thaw ponds in north-eastern Siberia. We selected 40 ponds of different age classes based on a time-series of satellite images and measured vegetation composition, microtopography, water table, and thaw depth in the field and measured age of colonizing shrubs in thaw ponds using dendrochronology. We found that young ponds are characterized by dead shrubs, while older ponds show rapid terrestrialization through colonization by sedges andSphagnummoss. While dead shrubs and open water are associated with permafrost degradation (lower surface elevation, larger thaw depth), sites with sedge and in particularSphagnumdisplay indications of permafrost recovery. Recruitment ofBetula nanaonSphagnumcarpets in ponds indicates a potential recovery toward shrub-dominated vegetation, although it remains unclear if and on what timescale this occurs. Our results suggest that thaw ponds display potentially cyclic vegetation succession associated with permafrost degradation and recovery. Pond formation and initial colonization by sedges can occur on subdecadal timescales, suggesting rapid degradation and initial recovery of permafrost. The rates of formation and recovery of small-scale, shallow thaw ponds have implications for the greening/browning dynamics and carbon balance of this ecosystem.

AB Although Finland's forest resources have been utilized intensively, the size of the total volume of the growing stock has increased since the mid-1960s, and hence increasing amounts of carbon have been sequestered by forests. The net sequestration by forests has also been substantial when compared with the CO2 emissions resulting from energy generation and consumption based on fossil fuels and peat. It is also important, from the point of view of mitigating the effects of climate change, to assess how the sequestration capacity of forests may change under changing climatic conditions. This paper presents the results of a study assessing the development of the forest and wood-product carbon budget for Finland, based on regionally measured data, detailed dynamic models, and recent predictions concerning the changing climate. At the starting point for the simulation (1990), nearly 90% of the forest sector's carbon storage was found in the forest. Regular management transferred carbon from forests to wood products. Under the current climatic conditions, the simulated forest carbon storage increased 45% by the year 2100, and the wood-product storage by 320%, as a consequence of continuous production. Under changing climate conditions, the forest carbon storage increased, but started to decline when the temperature increase exceeded 2.5 degrees C within 40 years.

AB Analysis of siliceous microfossils of a 79 cm long peat sediment core from Highlands Hammock State Park, Florida, revealed distinct changes in the local hydrology during the past 2,500 years. The coring site is a seasonally inundated forest where water availability is directly influenced by precipitation. Diatoms, chrysophyte statospores, sponge remains and phytoliths were counted in 25 samples throughout the core. Based on the relative abundance of diatom species, the record was subdivided into four diatom assemblage zones, which mainly reflect the hydrological state of the study site. An age-depth relationship based on radiocarbon measurements of eight samples reveals a basal age of the core of approximately 2,500 cal. yrs. BP. Two significant changes of diatom assemblage composition were found that could be linked to both, natural and anthropogenic influences. At 700 cal. yrs. BP, the diatom record documents a shift from tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species to epiphytic Eunotia species, indicating a shortening of the hydroperiod, i.e. the time period during which a wetland is covered by water. This transition was interpreted as being triggered by natural climate change. In the middle of the twentieth century a second major turnover took place, at that time however, as a result of human impact on the park hydrology through the construction of dams and canals close to the study site.

AB We monitored temperatures in stream water, groundwater and riparian wetland surface water over 18 months in a 3.2-km(2) moorland catchment in the Scottish Highlands. The stream occupies a glaciated valley, aligned east-west. It has three main headwater tributaries with a large north facing catchment, a south facing catchment and the smallest east facing headwater. The lower catchment sampling locations begin after the convalescence of all three headwaters. Much of the stream network is fringed by riparian peatlands. Stream temperatures are mainly regulated by energy exchanges at the air-water interface. However, they are also influenced by inflows from the saturated riparian zone, where surface water source areas are strongly connected with the stream network. Consequently, the spatial distribution of stream temperatures exhibits limited variability. Nevertheless, there are significant summer differences between the headwaters, despite their close proximity to each other. This is consistent with aspect (and incident radiation), given the south and east facing headwaters having higher temperatures. The largest, north-facing sub-catchment shows lower summer diurnal temperature variability, suggesting that lower radiation inputs dampen temperature extremes. Whilst stream water temperature regimes in the lower catchment exhibit little change along a 1-km reach, they are similar to those in the largest headwater; probably reflecting size and comparable catchment aspect and hydrological flow paths. Our results suggest that different parts of the channel network and its connected wetlands have contrasting sensitivity to higher summer temperatures. This may be important in land management strategies designed to mitigate the impacts of projected climatic warming. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A brief cold-warm-cold climate change during the middle Wisconsinan is described for the first time in North America, based on fossil beetle assemblages at Titusville, Pennsylvania. AMS dating of insect chitin and wood suggests the change occurred between 39,000 and 43,500 yr B.P. Basal peats in river terrace deposits contain arctic-subarctic beetle species representing a climate similar to that found at treeline in Canada, where mean July temperatures range from 10 degrees to 13 degrees C. These cold-adapted beetles were replaced by species representing a climate similar to the mixed coniferous-deciduous forests of southern Canada, where mean July temperatures range from 18 degrees to 20 degrees C. In turn, these warmer-adapted beetles were replaced by arctic-subarctic species in the upper part of the section, representing a climate with mean July temperatures in the range 10 degrees-13 degrees C. The brief warm interval is informally designated the Titusville interstade. The difference in temperature between the colder and wanner intervals is about 5 degrees-7 degrees C. The Titusville interstade is correlated with the Upton Warren Interstade of the British Isles which is of similar age and intensity. It is also correlated with the high sea-surface temperature interval between Heinrich events 4 and 5 represented in North Atlantic Sediment cores. (C) 1996 University of Washington.

AB A high-resolution record of sea-level change spanning the past 1000 years is derived from foraminiferal and chronological analyses of a 2m thick salt-marsh peat sequence at Chezzetcook, Nova Scotia, Canada. Former mean tide level positions are reconstructed with a precision of +/- 0.055 in using a transfer function derived from distributions of modern salt-marsh foraminifera. Our age model for the core section older than 300 years is based on 19 AMS C-14 ages and takes into account the individual probability distributions of calibrated radiocarbon ages. The past 300 years is dated by pollen and the isotopes Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-210, Cs-137 and Am-241.
   Between AD 1000 and AD 1800, relative sea level rose at a mean rate of 17cm per century. Apparent pre-industrial rises of sea level dated at AD 1500-1550 and AD 1700-1800 cannot be clearly distinguished when radiocarbon age errors are taken into account. Furthermore, they may be an artefact of fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 production. In the 19th century sea level rose at a mean rate of 1.6mm/yr. Between AD 1900 and AD 1920, sea-level rise accelerated to the modern mean rate of 3.2mm/yr. This acceleration corresponds in time with global temperature rise and may therefore be associated with recent global warming. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present 17 cosmogenic Be-10 ages of glacial deposits in Coire an Lochain (Cairngorm Mountains), which demonstrate that glacial and nival deposits cover a longer timescale than previously recognised. Five ages provide the first evidence of a late-Holocene glacier in the British Isles. A previously unidentified moraine ridge was deposited after c. 2.8 kyr and defines a small slab-like glacier with an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) at c. 1047 m. The late-Holocene glacier was characterised by rapid firnification and a dominance of sliding, enabling the glacier to construct moraine ridges in a relatively short period. Isotopic inheritance means that the glacier may have existed as recently as the Little Ice Age' (LIA) of the 17th or 18th century ad, a view supported by glacier-climate modelling. Nine Be-10 ages confirm a Younger Dryas Stadial (YDS) age for a cirque-floor boulder till, and date the glacier maximum to c. 12.3 kyr when the ELA was at c. 963 m altitude. Both glaciers existed because of enhanced accumulation from wind-blown snow, but the difference in ELA of only c. 84 m belies the YDS-LIA temperature difference of c. 7 degrees C and emphasises the glacioclimatic contrast between the two periods. Three Be-10 ages from till boulders originally deposited in the YDS yield ages <5.5 kyr and indicate snow-avalanche disturbance of older debris since the mid-Holocene, as climate deteriorated towards marginal glaciation.

AB Wetlands are one of the most important sources of atmospheric methane (CH4), but the strength of this source is still highly uncertain. To improve estimates of CH4 emission at the regional and global scales and predict future variation requires a process-based model integrating the controls of climatic and edaphic factors and complex biological processes over CH4 flux rates. This study used a methane emission model based on the hypothesis that plant primary production and soil organic matter decomposition act to control the supply of substrate needed by methanogens; the rate of substrate supply and environmental factors, in turn, control the rate of CH4 production, and the balance between CH4 production and methanotrophic oxidation determines the rate of CH4 emission into the atmosphere. Coupled to data sets for climate, vegetation, soil, and wetland distribution, the model was used to calculate spatial and seasonal distributions of CH4 emissions at a resolution of 1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude. The calculated net primary production (NPP) of wetlands ranged from 45 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for northern bogs to 820 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for tropical swamps. CH4 emission rates from individual gridcells ranged from 0.0 to 661 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), with a mean of 40 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) for northern wetland, 150 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) for temperate wetland, and 199 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) for tropical wetland. Total CH4 emission was 92 Tg yr(-1). Sensitivity analysis showed that the response of CH4 emission to climate change depends upon the combined effects of soil carbon storage, rate of decomposition, soil moisture and activity of methanogens.

AB Lithology, pollen, macrofossils, and stable carbon isotopes from an intermontane basin bog site in southern New Zealand provide a detailed late-glacial and early Holocene vegetation and climate record. Glacial retreat occurred before 17,000 cal yr B.P., and tundra-like grassland-shrubland occupied the basin shortly after. Between 16,500 and 14,600 cal yr B.P., a minor regional expansion of forest patches occurred in response to warming, but the basin remained in shrubland. Forest retreated between 14,600 and 13,600 cal yr B.P., at about the time of the Antarctic Cold Reversal. At 13,600 cal yr B.P., a steady progression from shrubland to tall podocarp forest began as the climate ameliorated. Tall, temperate podocarp trees replaced stress-tolerant shrubs and trees between 12,800 and 11,300 cal yr B.P., indicating sustained warming during the Younger Dryas Chronozone (YDC). Stable isotopes suggest increasing atmospheric humidity from 11,800 to 9300 cal yr B.P. Mild (annual temperatures at least VC higher than present), and moist conditions prevailed from 11,000 to 10,350 cal yr B.P. Cooler, more variable conditions followed, and podocarp forest was completely replaced by montane Nothofagus forest at around 7500 cal yr B.P. with the onset of the modem climate regime. The Cass Basin late-glacial climate record closely matches the Antarctic ice core records and is in approximate antiphase with the North Atlantic. (C) 2004 University of Washington.

AB Accurate identification of the relationships between permafrost extent and landscape patterns can help to develop airborne geophysical or remote sensing tools to map permafrost in remote locations or across large areas. These tools will be particularly applicable in discontinuous permafrost where climate warming or disturbances such as human development or fire can lead to rapid permafrost degradation. We have linked field-based geophysical, point-scale, and imagery surveying measurements to map permafrost at five fire scars (1930, 1975, 1988, 2001, and 2010) on the Tanana Flats in central Alaska. Ground-based elevation surveys, seasonal thaw-depth profiles, and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements were combined with airborne imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to identify relationships between permafrost geomorphology and elapsed time since fire disturbance. ERT proved to be a robust technique for mapping the presence or absence of permafrost because of the marked difference in resistivity values for frozen versus unfrozen material. There was no clear relationship between elapsed time since fire and permafrost extent at our sites. However, we have found that the transition zone boundaries between permafrost soils and unfrozen soils in the collapse-scar bogs at our sites had complex and unpredictable morphologies. This result suggested that attempts to quantify the presence or absence of permafrost using aerial measurements alone could lead to incomplete results. Taken in total, the results from our study indicated that although ground-based ERT measurements were the most rapid means of mapping permafrost, we were still limited in being able to apply airborne surveying measurements at the landscape scale toward accurately estimating permafrost extent.

AB The two most common low-temperature iron(III) oxides on Earth are goethite (alpha -FeOOH) and hematite (alpha -Fe2O3). The delta O-18 values of natural goethites range from -15.5 parts per thousand to +3.3 parts per thousand, whereas delta O-18 values of low-temperature hematites range from -16.7 parts per thousand to +4.7 parts per thousand. Plots of SD against delta O-18 for continental goethites are approximately parallel to the meteoric water line of Craig (H Craig. 1961. Science 133:1702-3). This suggests that goethite-water fractionation factors are systematic over a wide range of surficial environments and may indicate that isotopic equilibrium is commonly attained or closely approached. Several experimental or calculated mineral-water, oxygen isotope fractionation curves have been determined for both goethite and hematite. Although there is not yet a consensus on which of these curves best approximates isotopic fractionation in natural samples, oxygen isotope measurements of both goethite and hematite have provided evidence of significant continental climate change on time scales that range from thousands to millions of years. The concentration and delta C-13 values of an Fe(CO3)OH component in apparent solid solution in goethite are proxies for the partial pressure and delta C-13 values, respectively, of COL in the environment at the time of goethite crystallization. Biological productivity, CO2 pressures in soil or groundwater, and partial pressures of atmospheric CO2 in ancient environments have been estimated from measurements of the mole fractions and delta C-13 values of Fe(CO3)OH in goethite.

AB Agriculture in Taiwan is input-intensive. Chemical fertilizers are heavily used, and most arable land contains less than 2% of soil organic matter (SOM). To improve soil quality, to make agriculture sustainable, and to avoid over-production of rice, paddy rice-upland rotation and application of organic substances have been widely promoted. A change in the system often begins to alter the SOM content which takes from several up to even a hundred years to stabilize into a new SOM level. The purpose of this study was to find methods of determining long-term changes in SOM based on short-term data and to evaluate the effects of different kinds of organic materials in paddy-upland rotation. Organic matter was supplied as green manure, compost, and peat at similar intensity. SOM data were collected from the 1st to the 13th year for the calibration and validation of the model that was intentionally assembled for less mechanisms yet research purpose achievable. The ratio of the quantity of organic matter applied to that retained in soil was the lowest when organic C was supplied by growing green manure and the highest, or 3.7 times the control plot, when it was supplied in the form of compost. The minimum period for which data of SOM was required to calibrate the model varied with the form of organic matter: 5 years for green manure, 6 years for compost or peat, and 7 years for the control. The minimum years of data required for reliable calibration were significantly related to the return amounts of crop residues (R-2 = 0.807). In each application strategy, SOM contents in the 12th and 13th years were validated well with those predicted by the calibrated model. Relative sensitivity analysis showed that soil temperature and water are the two major factors that affected SOM content; while the humus-like portion of organic matter determined the potential to accumulate SOM. Long-term simulations suggested that it might take at least 20 years for SOM in these fields to be stabilized. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene is the most recent period in Earth history that experienced sustained global greenhouse warmth on multimillion year timescales. Yet, knowledge of ambient climate conditions and the complex interplay between various forcing mechanisms are still poorly constrained. Here we present a 14.75 million-year-long, high-resolution, orbitally tuned record of paired climate change and carbon-cycling for this enigmatic period (similar to 67-52 Ma), which we compare to an up-to-date compilation of atmospheric pCO(2) records. Our climate and carbon-cycling records, which are the highest resolution stratigraphically complete records to be constructed from a single marine site in the Atlantic Ocean, feature all major transient warming events (termed "hyperthermals") known from this time period. We identify eccentricity as the dominant pacemaker of climate and the carbon cycle throughout the Late Maastrichtian to Early Eocene, through the modulation of precession. On average, changes in the carbon cycle lagged changes in climate by similar to 23,000 years at the long eccentricity (405,000-year) band, and by similar to 3,000-4,500 years at the short eccentricity (100,000-year) band, suggesting that light carbon was released as a positive feedback to warming induced by orbital forcing. Our new record places all known hyperthermals of the Late Maastrichtian-Early Eocene into temporal context with regards to evolving ambient climate of the time. We constrain potential carbon cycle influences of Large Igneous Province volcanism associated with the Deccan Traps and North Atlantic Igneous Province, as well as the sensitivity of climate and the carbon-cycle to the 2.4 million-year-long eccentricity cycle.
   Plain Language Summary The study of globally warm climates and short-lived warming events in Earth's past can provide unrivaled insights into the challenges that mankind may face over the next few generations. Using samples recovered from an ocean drill core in the deep South Atlantic, we have generated continuous temperature and carbon cycle records from the calcite shells of a single microfossil species, spanning a period of globally warm climate from 67 to 52 million years ago, before the development of permanent large-scale polar ice sheets. Our record contains a number of rapid warming events, allowing us to determine their origin. We find that changes in the shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun initiated warming at Earth's surface, which was then amplified by the release of greenhouse gases from temperature-or climate-sensitive carbon stores (e.g., peat, permafrost, or methane hydrates). These rapid warming events increased in frequency and magnitude during the warmer climate intervals characterized by significant volcanic activity, suggesting that such carbon stores become more unstable during warmer climates. As our climate warms at unprecedented rates, the release of greenhouse gases from naturally occurring temperature- or climate-sensitive carbon stores could also form an additional and largely unconstrained contribution to future climate change.

AB The aim of this study is to infer past changes in total organic carbon (TOC) content of lake water during the Holocene in eight boreal forest, tree-limit and alpine lakes using a new technique - near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A training set of 100 lakes from northern Sweden covering a TOC gradient from 0.7 to 14.9 mg l(-1) was used to establish a relationship between the NIRS signal from surface sediments ( 0 - 1 cm) and the TOC content of the water mass. The NIRS model for TOC has a root mean squared error (RMSECV) of calibration of 1.6 mg l(-1) (11% of the gradient) assessed by internal cross-validation (CV), which yields an R-cv(2) of 0.61. The results show that the most dramatic change among the studied lakes occurs in both tree-line lakes around 1000 yrs BP when the TOC content decreases from ca. 7 to 3 mg l(-1) at the present, which is probably due to a descending tree-limit. The TOC content in the alpine lakes shows a declining trend throughout most of the Holocene indicating that TOC may be more directly correlated to climate in alpine lakes than forest lakes. All boreal forest lakes show a declining trend in TOC during the past 3000 yrs with the largest amplitude of change occurring in the lake with a connected mire. The results indicate that a change to a warmer and more humid climate can increase the TOC levels in lakes, which in turn may increase the saturation of CO2 in lake waters and the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB The significance of different environmental drivers for the chironomid compositional changes during the Holocene was assessed using partial redundancy analysis. These drivers included pollen-inferred mean July air temperature, vegetation cover as pollen percentages, diatom-inferred water pH and total organic carbon (TOC), and sediment properties as loss on iginition (LOI). Variance partitioning showed that on the Holocene timescale, chironomid assemblages were significantly responding to changes in Betula percentages. This is explained by the co-occurring response of chironomids to the Holocene climatic development, which has also been responsible for the development of vegetation in the catchment. However, during the very early Holocene period from 10 500 cal. yr BP to 8300 cal. yr BP chironomids were responding more directly to the changes in water quality, ie, pH. During the latter part of the Holocene, no environmental variable appeared to be significant in explaining the variation in chironomid assemblages. This may be due to the underestimation of the actual water TOC by the diatom-based TOC model. However, for the latter part of the Holocene, from 5000 cal. yr BP to the present, the importance of limnological changes attributed to the development of marginal mires on the midges is evident. Our study shows that factors other than climate may have had more direct influence on the chironomid abundances at certain time periods. Although these factors are probably indirectly connected to climate through catchment processes, more understanding of the catchment-mediated climate effects on lake ecology and chironomids in high latitudes is needed, in addition to careful site selection, in order to better understand the environmental reconstructions.

AB Numerous long-term, free-air plant growth facilities currently explore vegetation responses to the ongoing climate change in northern latitudes. Open top chamber (OTC) experiments as well as the experimental set-ups with active warming focus on many facets of plant growth and performance, but information on morphological alterations of plant cells is still scarce. Here we compare the effects of in-situ warming on leaf epidermal cell expansion in dwarf birch, Betula nana in Finland, Greenland, and Poland. The localities of the three in-situ warming experiments represent contrasting regions of B. nana distribution, with the sites in Finland and Greenland representing the current main distribution in low and high Arctic, respectively, and the continental site in Poland as a B. nana relict Holocene microrefugium. We quantified the epidermal cell lateral expansion by microscopic analysis of B. nana leaf cuticles. The leaves were produced in paired experimental treatment plots with either artificial warming or ambient temperature. At all localities, the leaves were collected in two years at the end of the growing season to facilitate between-site and within-site comparison. The measured parameters included the epidermal cell area and circumference, and using these, the degree of cell wall undulation was calculated as an Undulation Index (UI). We found enhanced leaf epidermal cell expansion under experimental warming, except for the extremely low temperature Greenland site where no significant difference occurred between the treatments. These results demonstrate a strong response of leaf growth at individual cell level to growing season temperature, but also suggest that in harsh conditions other environmental factors may limit this response. Our results provide evidence of the relevance of climate warming for plant leaf maturation and underpin the importance of studies covering large geographical scales.

AB Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle and thus global carbon budgets. Climate variability affects amount of material entering and the metabolic balance of wetlands, thereby modifying carbon dynamics. This study presents spatiotemporal changes in air-water CO2 exchange in the vast wetlands of Donana (Spain) in relation to different hydrological cycles. Water sources feeding Donana, including groundwater and streams, ultimately depend on the fluctuating balance between annual precipitation and evapotranspiration. Hence, in order to examine the contribution of the rainfall pattern to the emission/capture of CO2 by a range of aquatic habitats in Donana, we took monthly measurements during severely wet, dry, and normal hydrological years (2010-2013). During wet hydrological cycles, CO2 outgassing from flooded marshes markedly decreased in comparison to that observed during subsequent dry-normal cycles, with mean values of 25.8419 and 5.28mmolm(-2)d(-1), respectively. Under drier meteorological conditions, air-water CO2 fluxes also diminished in permanent floodplains and ponds, which even behaved as mild sinks for atmospheric CO2 during certain periods. Increased inputs of dissolved CO2 from the underground aquifer and the stream following periods of high rainfall are believed to be behind this pattern. Large lagoons with a managed water supply from an adjacent estuary took up atmospheric CO2 nearly permanently. Regional air-water carbon transport was 15.2GgCyr(-1) under wet and 1.24GgCyr(-1) under dry meteorological conditions, well below the estimated net primary production for Donana wetlands, indicating that the ecosystem acts as a large CO2 sink.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle, representing important contributors to the global carbon budget. Climate variability affects productivity in wetlands, thereby modifying their capacity to act as sink or source for atmospheric CO2. This study addresses how the hydrological cycle influences the capacity for carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean wetlands of Donana. Covering a surface of 3560km(2), Donana region includes a rich variety of landforms and vegetation types representative of Mediterranean lowlands. Its wetlands are one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe with a high biotic diversity and unique importance for aquatic wildfowl. The region experiences annual cycles of flooding (October to March) and desiccation (May to June), with the inundation cycles being dependent on rainfall. Our measurements suggest that drier meteorological conditions result in lower CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from flooded marshes and permanent ponds whereas large lagoons with man-managed water supply from an adjacent estuary behave as carbon sequestrators. Predictions indicate an increasing frequency of droughts over the Mediterranean region due to climate change. These results highlight the importance of water management in Donana for wetlands conservation and their role in the atmospheric CO2 exchange.

AB Superimposed on the long-term climate variability attributed to orbital forcing, there are other modes of variability covering timescales from interannual to millennial throughout the Holocene. Their signatures in climate proxy archives can differ substantially because of their lower magnitude and regional diversity. However, if identified they can yield better understanding of the physical mechanisms regionally linking causes and effects. Here we describe a high-resolution record of organic matter accumulation in the sediments of Burg lake (Pyrenees, NE Iberian Peninsula), as assessed using loss on ignition (LOI), and compare it with the ice rafted debris (IRD) indexes from the North Atlantic. The LOI record indicates two main phases in the water body, a lacustrine phase as a shallow lake and a palustrine phase as a fen. The latter covers the period 2600-7200 cal.yr BP and within it there is a high coherence between LOI and IRD, which indicates submillennial climate fluctuations in the Pyrenees that can be related to the North Atlantic influence. The Burg's LOI record suggests wetter (and occasionally colder) situations in the Pyrenees during high IRD in the Atlantic (Bond oscillations). These fluctuations would likely affect the snow covered period in the mountains (winter and spring seasons) the most, the period in which Atlantic westerlies currently have higher influence on precipitation over the Pyrenees. These climatic oscillations could have favoured Abies penetration during the mid Holocene, as evidenced by increased pollen percentages of this taxon during low IRD values (drier conditions). The pollen record also suggests potential relationships between climate and human activity as early as at mid Holocene, as human-related cereals increase during all the low IRD periods. The human signature (charcoal, cereals) becomes particularly evident at around 2800 cal.yr BP; in this oscillation Pinus overtake Abies in the conifer response to low IRD.

AB The biosphere-atmosphere exchange of methane (CH4) was estimated for a temperate/boreal lowland and wetland forest ecosystem in northern Wisconsin for 1997-1999 using the modified Bowen ratio (MBR) method. Gradients of CH4 and CO2 and CO2 flux were measured on the 447-m WLEF-TV tower as part of the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (ChEAS). No systematic diurnal variability was observed in regional CH4 fluxes measured using the MBR method. In all 3 years, regional CH4 emissions reached maximum values during June-August (24 +/- 14.4 Mg m(-2) day(-1)), coinciding with periods of maximum soil temperatures. In 1997 and 1998, the onset in CH4 emission was coincident with increases in ground temperatures following the melting of the snow cover. The onset of emission in 1999 lagged 100 days behind the 1997 and 1998 onsets, and was likely related to postdrought recovery of the regional water table to typical levels. The net regional emissions were 3.0, 3.1, and 2.1 g CH4 m(-2) for 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. Annual emissions for wetland regions within the source area (28% of the land area) were 13.2, 13.8, and 10.3 g CH4 m(-2) assuming moderate rates of oxidation of CH4 in upland regions in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. Scaling these measurements to the Chequamegon Ecosystem (CNNF) and comparing with average wetland emissions between 40degreesN and 50degreesN suggests that wetlands in the CNNF emit approximately 40% less than average wetlands at this latitude. Differences in mean monthly air temperatures did not affect the magnitude of CH4 emissions; however, reduced precipitation and water table levels suppressed CH4 emission during 1999, suggesting that long-term climatic changes that reduce the water table will likely transform this landscape to a reduced source or possibly a sink for atmospheric CH4.

AB In-situ snow measurements conducted by European institutions for operational, research, and energy business applications were surveyed in the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES1404, called "A European network for a harmonised monitoring of snow for the benefit of climate change scenarios, hydrology, and numerical weather prediction". Here we present the results of this survey, which was answered by 125 participants from 99 operational and research institutions, belonging to 38 European countries. The typologies of environments where the snow measurements are performed range from mountain to low elevated plains, including forests, bogs, tundra, urban areas, glaciers, lake ice, and sea ice. Of the respondents, 93% measure snow macrophysical parameters, such as snow presence, snow depth (HS), snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow density. These describe the bulk characteristics of the whole snowpack or of a snow layer, and they are the primary snow properties that are needed for most operational applications (such as hydrological monitoring, avalanche forecast, and weather forecast). In most cases, these measurements are done with manual methods, although for snow presence, HS, and SWE, automatized methods are also applied by some respondents. Parameters characterizing precipitating and suspended snow (such as the height of new snow, precipitation intensity, flux of drifting/blowing snow, and particle size distribution), some of which are crucial for the operational services, are measured by 74% of the respondents. Parameters characterizing the snow microstructural properties (such as the snow grain size and shape, and specific surface area), the snow electromagnetic properties (such as albedo, brightness temperature, and backscatter), and the snow composition (such as impurities and isotopes) are measured by 41%, 26%, and 13% of the respondents, respectively, mostly for research applications. The results of this survey are discussed from the perspective of the need of enhancing the efficiency and coverage of the in-situ observational network applying automatic and cheap measurement methods. Moreover, recommendations for the enhancement and harmonization of the observational network and measurement practices are provided.

AB Stable isotope measures in organic matter are frequently used as indicators of past climate change. Although such analyses can provide valuable information, there is considerable uncertainty associated with studies of organic-rich sediments, especially those from Arctic lakes and bogs. We studied stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and magnetic properties in a sediment core from a small alkaline lake with a high sedimentation rate, Lake Nattmalsvatn, Norway. There is good correspondence among the different sediment variables during the late glacial, and they seemingly reflect major climate variations such as the Allerod Interstade and the Younger Dryas, as well as the transition into the current interglacial. During the early Holocene, however, these relationships are more complex and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values do not stabilize until similar to 7,500 cal year BP. A significant excursion in all variables occurs between 6,850 and 6,500 cal year BP and is interpreted to represent climate deterioration. Holocene delta C-13 values vary little and indicate that isotopically-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake, possibly influenced by methanotrophy and high pCO(2), dominated the lake's carbon cycle. Holocene delta N-15 is similarly muted, likely due to the availability of abundant dissolved nitrogen. Bulk organic matter is probably dominated by phytoplankton remains produced beneath the ice cover in late spring and during ice breakup when isotopically-depleted DIC, pCO(2) and ammonium availability were maximal. Thus, use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 as indicators of Holocene paleoclimate and paleoproductivity variation can be challenging in a lake such as Nattmalsvatn, where ice cover isolates the basin for large parts of the year, allowing dissolved respiratory gases to accumulate in the water column. In contrast, magnetic variables appear to better track climate variations. In particular, runoff-driven influx of minerogenic sediments shows high variability that can be attributed to regional changes in Holocene winter precipitation. The most striking shifts occur between 4,000 and 2,300 cal year BP.

AB Terrestrial plant communities have the potential to respond to climate change rapidly, if dominant species are killed by a series of extreme events, or slowly, if the cumulative effects of shorter-term climate fluctuations result in longR term compositional change. We used pollen and charcoal records from a lake and a testate amoebae-derived history of water-table depth in a nearby peatland to assess the response of the jack pine-dominated forests of northwestern Wisconsin to the climate variability of the last similar to 2000 years. The hydrology record and the charcoal record indicate that the climate near Warner Lake over the last similar to 2000 years was characterized by multidecadal variation in moisture availability with no apparent multicentennial-long trends in moisture balance or fire frequency. However, the pollen record suggests that there were multicentennial-scale changes in the vegetation composition around Warner Lake. Direct comparison of the three proxy records is challenging, because of their differing temporal resolutions and the complexity of potential ecological responses to climate variability. Therefore, we developed an interpretive model to compare multiple simulated proxies under two scenarios of environmental variability in order to determine under what conditions apparently contradictory records are likely to be found. The interpretive model reveals that a record of multicentennial-long change in vegetation is possible if multidecadal climate variability interacts with ecological processes influencing the direction and magnitude of succession. Compositional changes in the Warner Lake pollen record could reflect longR term variation in temperature, seasonality or other climate factors independent of moisture balance; however it is also possible that multidecadal moisture variability interacted with ecological processes affecting recruitment and mortality of species following fires of varying size and severity. Decadal-scale climatic variability can lead to altered successional pathways and to changes in forest composition that last for centuries.

AB High resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is presented as a robust palaeoclimatic proxy, suitable for use on Late Pleistocene to Holocene sediments located in a volcanic crater on the Atherton Tableland in northeastern Queensland, Australia. The proxy allows identification of wet and dry shifts in a complex sedimentary sequence comprised of peat, gyttja, laminated organic rich muds and fine clastic silt-rich sediments. Significant correlation is found between the XRF record and other proxies including magnetic susceptibility, humification, grain size, macrocharcoal, delta C-13 and C/N and pollen.
   Sixteen wetter periods are identified in the 37 ka sedimentary record for Bromfield Swamp. Three wetter periods commence in late Marine Isotope Stage 3, nine in the early glacial, one in the late de-glacial and four in Holocene. Nineteen drier periods are identified, four in late MIS 3, seven in the early glacial, one during the LGM, one in the late de-glacial period and six in the Holocene.
   The XRF record for Bromfield Swamp is specifically used to identify periods of abrupt climate change. Marked changes in effective precipitation are detected at 32,690, 30,080, 24,660, 21,870, 11,880, 10,020, 9170 and 5120 cal. yr BP. The detection of these abrupt climate events may allow correlation with records from terrestrial sites across the Southern Hemisphere and potentially, the Northern Hemisphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB We analyze ground temperatures measured daily at depths of 0-10 m in the Nadym region, north-west Siberia (65 degrees 18 ' N, 72 degrees 6 ' E). Nadym is located within the discontinuous permafrost zone and the forest-tundra transition subzone, thus representing an area threatened by permafrost thawing. Soil comprises a 0.4-1.0-m-thick topmost layer of peat with high porosity (0.9), underlain by layers of mineral soil (sand, clay, loam) with lower porosities of 0.3-0.4. With a numerical heat transfer model, we provide predictions of general permafrost development for the next 300 years. Furthermore, we apply the model with the same time frame, to predict permafrost evolution in two monitoring boreholes (BH) in the Nadym area, BH 1-09 and 3-09 with present (2012-2016) temperatures at the top of the permafrost (TTOP) of -2.0 and 0.0 degrees C, respectively. Applying a mild warming trend (0.02 degrees C/yr in mean annual air temperature [MAAT], corresponding to the IPCC representative concentration pathway trend RCP 2.6) does not lead to thawing of permafrost during the applied 300 years of simulation time in BH 1-09, whereas in BH 3-09 thawing has already begun. Applying a strong warming trend of 0.05 degrees C/yr in MAAT (corresponding to RCP 8.5) leads to gradual thawing of permafrost in both boreholes.

AB Morphologic and stratigraphic evidence shows that a late-glacial ice cap existed on part of the Eastern Cordillera of Ecuador (Lat. 0 degrees 20' S) on ground with a mean elevation of 4200 m where none exists now. An outlet glacier from an ca. 800 km(2) ice cap terminated at 3850 m altitude in the Papallacta valley on the eastern side of the plateau. Radiocarbon dates show that moraines formed by this advance were ice-free by 13,200 C-14 yr B.P. Tephras and the age of organic deposits at the plateau edge indicate ice-free conditions before 11,800 C-14 yr B.P. This interval was followed by the expansion of an ca. 140 km(2) ice cap that discharged glaciers into adjacent valleys where terminal moraines were built at 3950 m altitude, AMS and conventional radiocarbon dates from macrofossils, peat, and gyttja above and below till of the readvance indicate that the ice cap formed between ca. 11,000 and 10,000 C-14 yr B.P. and was thus coeval with the European Younger Dryas event, The ice cap developed in response to a surface temperature cooling of at least 3 degrees C in the tropical Andes, a finding that is consistent with a coupled equatorial/high latitude North Atlantic climate system operating at the late-glacial/Holocene transition. These results are further evidence that Younger Dryas cooling may have been a global event. (C) 1997 University of Washington.

AB A large portion of carbon (C) is stored in the world's soils, including those of peatlands, wetlands and permafrost. However, there is disagreement regarding the effects of climate change on the rate of organic matter decomposition in permafrost soils of the arctic. In this study it was hypothesized that soil exposed to a higher ambient temperature would have a greater flux Of CO2 as well as a change in the metabolic diversity of culturable soil microorganisms. To evaluate this hypothesis we determined soil C dynamics, soil microbial respiration and activity, and C-13 and N-15 fractionation in laboratory incubations (at 14 and 21 degrees C) for an organic-rich soil (Mesic Organic Cryosol) and a mineral soil (Turbic Cryosol) collected at the Daring Lake Research Station in Canada's Northwest Territories. Soil organic C (SOC) and nitrogen (N) stocks (g m(-2)) and concentration (%) were significantly different (P <0.05) between soil horizons for both soil types. Stable isotope analysis showed a significant enrichment in delta C-13 and delta N-15 with depth and a depletion in delta C-13 and delta N-15 with increasing SOC and N concentration. In laboratory incubations, microbial respiration showed three distinct phases of decomposition: a phase with a rapidly increasing rate of respiration (phase 1), a phase in which respiration reached a peak midway through the incubation (phase 2), and a phase in the latter part of the incubation in which respiration stabilized at a lower flux than that of the first phase (phase 3). Fluxes Of CO2 were significantly greater at 21 degrees C than at 14 degrees C. The delta C-13 of the evolved CO2 became significantly enriched with time with the greatest enrichment occurring in phase 2 of the incubation. Soil microbial activity, as measured using Biolog Ecoplates(TM), showed a significantly greater average well color development, richness, and Shannon index at 21 degrees C; again the greatest change occurred in phase 2 of the incubation. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the Biolog data also showed a change in the distinct clustering of the soil microbial activity, showing that C sources from the soil were metabolized differently with time at 21 than at 14 degrees C, and between soil horizons. Our results show that Canadian arctic soils contain large stores of C, which readily decompose, and that substantial increases in CO2 emissions and changes in the metabolic diversity of culturable soil microorganisms may occur when ambient temperatures increase from 14 to 21 degrees C.

AB The Colorado Plateau is a distinct physiographic province in western North America, which presently straddles the transition between summer-wet and summer-dry climatic regimes to the south and northwest, respectively. In addition to climate, the diversity of environments and plant communities on the Colorado Plateau has resulted from extreme topographic diversity. Desert lowlands as low as 360 m elevation are surrounded by forested plateaus, and even higher peaks greater than 3800 m elevation. This environmental diversity provides a unique opportunity to study the history of biotic communities in an arid region of North America. Although the Colorado Plateau harbours numerous potential sites, the paleoecological record of the Plateau is poorly known. Potential deposits for analysis include packrat middens, alluvial and cave sites at lower elevations, and lake, bog and wetland sites at higher elevations. Forty-six sites have been analysed across the nearly 337,000 km(2) region, of which 27 contain records that span Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (IS) 2 data, with IS 3 information coming from only 12 sites. Most IS 2 and 3 sites are clustered along the lowland regions of the Colorado River corridor and the uplands of the Mogollon Rim area. We compiled selected data from long paleoecological records to examine patterns of vegetation and climate change across the southern Colorado Plateau for the middle and late Wisconsin. During the middle Wisconsin, mixed conifers covered middle-elevations presently dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and juniper (Juniperus) woodland grew at elevations today covered by blackbrush (Coleogyne) and sagebrush (Artemisia) desert. During the late Wisconsin, boreal conifers, primarily Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), replaced the mixed conifer association. Estimates of mean annual temperatures (MAT) during IS 3 were at least 3-4 degrees C cooler than today, whereas IS 2 MAT estimates are at least 5 degrees C colder. Our investigation of millennial-scale climatic variability within the region provided equivocal results. The packrat midden sequence could not distinguish vegetation changes that might be associated with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic. From the lake records, however, many Heinrich events were associated with generally drier intervals, often with elevated sagebrush pollen concentrations. Future paleoecological investigations should concentrate on the northern Colorado Plateau, as well as the eastern and western margins. Additional sites, along with closer-spaced sampling in regions already studied, will be important in determining the history of important climatic phenomena such as the timings of the Arizona monsoon.

AB Soil is the largest organic carbon (C) pool of terrestrial ecosystems, and C loss from soil accounts for a large proportion of land-atmosphere C exchange. Therefore, a small change in soil organic C (SOC) can affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and climate change. In the past decades, a wide variety of studies have been conducted to quantify global SOC stocks and soil C exchange with the atmosphere through site measurements, inventories, and empirical/process-based modeling. However, these estimates are highly uncertain, and identifying major driving forces controlling soil C dynamics remains a key research challenge. This study has compiled century-long (1901-2010) estimates of SOC storage and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) from 10 terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) in the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project and two observation-based data sets. The 10 TBM ensemble shows that global SOC estimate ranges from 425 to 2111Pg C (1Pg=10(15)g) with a median value of 1158Pg C in 2010. The models estimate a broad range of Rh from 35 to 69PgCyr(-1) with a median value of 51PgCyr(-1) during 2001-2010. The largest uncertainty in SOC stocks exists in the 40-65 degrees N latitude whereas the largest cross-model divergence in Rh are in the tropics. The modeled SOC change during 1901-2010 ranges from -70Pg C to 86Pg C, but in some models the SOC change has a different sign from the change of total C stock, implying very different contribution of vegetation and soil pools in determining the terrestrial C budget among models. The model ensemble-estimated mean residence time of SOC shows a reduction of 3.4years over the past century, which accelerate C cycling through the land biosphere. All the models agreed that climate and land use changes decreased SOC stocks, while elevated atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition over intact ecosystems increased SOC stockseven though the responses varied significantly among models. Model representations of temperature and moisture sensitivity, nutrient limitation, and land use partially explain the divergent estimates of global SOC stocks and soil C fluxes in this study. In addition, a major source of systematic error in model estimations relates to nonmodeled SOC storage in wetlands and peatlands, as well as to old C storage in deep soil layers.

AB Although catchment storage is an intrinsic control on the rainfall-runoff response of streams, direct measurement remains a major challenge. Coupled models that integrate long-term hydrometric and isotope tracer data are useful tools that can provide insights into the dynamics of catchment storage and the volumes of water involved. In this study, we use a tracer-aided hydrological model to characterize catchment storage as a dynamic control on system function related to streamflow generation, which also allows direct estimation of the nonstationarity of water ages. We show that in a wet Scottish upland catchment dominated by runoff generation from riparian peats (histosols) with high water storage, nonstationarity in water age distributions is only clearly detectable during more extreme wet and dry periods. This is explained by the frequency and longevity of hydrological connectivity and the associated relative importance of flow paths contributing younger or older waters to the stream. Generally, these saturated riparian soils represent large mixing zones that buffer the time variance of water age and integrate catchment-scale partial mixing processes. Although storage simulations depend on model performance, which is influenced by input variability and the degree of isotopic damping in the stream, a longer-term storage analysis of this model indicates a system that is only sensitive to more extreme hydroclimatic variability.

AB The UK Countryside Survey (CS) is a national long-term survey of soils and vegetation that spans three decades (1978-2007). Past studies using CS data have identified clear contrasting trends in topsoil organic carbon (tSOC) concentrations (0-15 cm) related to differences between habitat types. Herewe firstly examine changes in tSOC resulting from land use change, and secondly construct mixed models to describe the impact of indirect drivers where land use has been constant. Where it occurs, land use change is a strong driver of SOC change, with largest changes in tSOC for transitions involving SOC-rich soils in upland and bog systems. Afforestation did not always increase tSOC, and the effect of transitions involvingwoodlandwas dependent on the other vegetation type. The overall national spatial pattern of tSOC concentration where land use has been constant ismost strongly related to vegetation type and topsoil pH, with contributions from climate variables, deposition and geology. Comparisons of models for tSOC across time periods suggest that declining SO4 deposition has allowed recovery of topsoils from acidification, but that this has not resulted in the increased decomposition rates and loss of tSOC which might be expected. As a result, the relationship between pH and tSOC in UK topsoils has changed significantly between 1978 and 2007. The contributions of other indirect drivers in the models suggest negative relationships to seasonal temperature metrics and positive relationships to seasonal precipitation at the dry end of the scale. The results suggest that the CS approach of long-term collection of co-located vegetation and soil biophysical data provides essential tools both for identifying trends in tSOC at national and habitat levels, and for identifying areas of risk or areas with opportunities for managing topsoil SOC and vegetation change.

AB Vegetation and climate changes during the Last Glacial through to the late Holocene are identified by pollen analysis of a core from Lake Tangonge in far northern New Zealand. During the earliest part of the record (> 50 ka), regional vegetation was dominated by podocarp-hardwood forest. The most important tall podocarp trees were Dacrydium cupressinum and Dacryearpus dacrydioides. Knightia and Metrosideros sp. were common, and angiosperm elements dominated lowland/coastal forests. The cool, moist climates, of what may be equated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, were followed by a much wetter and slightly warmer period during MIS 3b (59-43 ka) when Ascarina became more abundant along with Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Metrosideros sp., Quintinia and Syzygium maire. From ca. 43 to 24 ka (MIS 3a) Agathis australis -dominated, mixed, conifer-hardwood forest expanded and hardy podocarps, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifiblia, became more abundant. Ascarina lucida was scarce. Climates characterised by drier summers and cooler winters became increasingly colder, drier and windier, particularly from ca. 30 ka. Replacement of Agathis australis-podocarp-hardwood forest with Fuscospora-podocarp-hardwood forest followed rapidly, and by the Last Glacial Maximum Northland forests as far north as ca. 35 degrees S were dominated by Fuscospora. Bog vegetation burned frequently. Regional temperatures may have been depressed by as much as 3-3.5 degrees C below those of today, and rainfall was probably reduced by about two-thirds. Warm, moist elements expanded in the late glacial as the glacial-type flora became increasingly restricted. Changes in forest composition progressed even more rapidly from the onset of the Holocene. Across the far northern region, Fuscospora -dominated podocarp hardwood forest was rapidly replaced by Agathis australis-podocarp-hardwood forest. Fuscospora declined sharply and Dacrydium cupressinum dominated regional forests. Hardy podocarps became less common than previously, and Ascarina reached its greatest abundance between ca. 10 and 7.6 ka. The early Holocene climate was probably the warmest and most equable for the past 100 ka and temperatures in the Kaitaia region may have been 1-2 degrees C warmer than present. The mid-to-late Holocene (5-2 ka) is characterised by the decline of Ascarina, and the increased abundance of Manoao colensoi, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifolia. Climates were probably slightly cooler and drier during this time as a more seasonal, dry summer/wet, cool winter regime prevailed. Increased cyclonic activity is suggested during this time.

AB Recent recession of high-mountain glacier ice and perennial snow and ice patches has exposed megafossil and macrofossil tree remnants and peat, offering a new source of Holocene high alpine vegetation history in the Scandes. Radiocarbon dates of 90 tree megafossils from Swedish Lapland, 29 of which had not previously been published, range from 11 980 to 1950 cal yr BP. During the interval 9500-8500 cal yr BP, mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) grew 600-700 m higher upslope than they do today, which is a new and remarkable discovery. Subsequently, tree density gradually declined at higher elevations, and as the tree line moved downslope, the ratio of Betula to Pinus increased. Tree growth ceased around 4500 cal yr BP, presumably in response to the return of perennial ice and snow. A short episode of resumed tree growth of Betula indicates conditions warmer than present around 2000 years ago. Between c. 8500 and 7300 cal yr BP, Picea abies, Larix sibirica, Populus tremula, Sorbus aucuparia and Alnus incana were subordinate species on a forest floor dominated by plant species characteristic of prealpine or subalpine woodlands. Growth of trees as much as 700 m higher upslope than today around 9500 cal yr BP implies that summer temperatures at that time may have been 3.0 degrees C warmer than today's temperatures (corrected for land uplift). This inferred temperature difference between the early Holocene and the present concurs with changes in the Earth's orbital parameters.

AB The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) climate is characterized by a high degree of variability, which poses a problem when attempting to put modern change in the context of natural variation. Therefore, novel methods are required to disentangle sometimes conflicting climate records from the region. In recent years, the development of Antarctic moss-cellulose isotopes as a proxy for summer terrestrial growing conditions has become more widespread, with the isotopes Delta C-13 and delta O-18 reflecting moss productivity and peatbank moisture conditions, respectively. Here, we used a combined Delta C-13 and delta O-18 isotope analysis of moss Chorisodontium aciphyllum cellulose from a peatbank located on Litchfield Island in the western AP to document changes in climate over the last 1700 years. High Delta C-13 values (>15 parts per thousand) indicate warm and productive conditions on Litchfield Island from 1600 to 1350 cal yr BP (350 to 600 AD) and over the last 100 years. The delta O-18 record shows two distinct intervals of dry conditions at 1350-1000 cal yr BP (600-950 AD) and at 500-0 cal yr BP (1450-1950 AD). Our record indicates that terrestrial ecosystems in the AP have responded to regional climate driven by atmospheric circulation, such as the southern annular mode (SAM) and, to a lesser extent, changes in ocean circulation.

AB Radiocarbon dated lacustrine sequences in Peru show that the chronology of glaciation during the late glacial in the tropical Andes was significantly out-of-phase with the record of climate change in the North Atlantic region. Fluvial incision of glacial-lake deposits in the Cordillera Blanca, central Peru, has exposed a glacial outwash gravel; radiocarbon dates from peat stratigraphically bounding the gravel imply that a glacier advance culminated between similar to 11,280 and 10,990 C-14 yr B.P.; rapid ice recession followed. Similarly, in southern Peru, ice readvanced between similar to 11,500 and 10,900 C-14 yr B.P. as shown by a basal radiocarbon date of similar to 10,870 C-14 yr B.P. from a lake within 1 ion of the Quelccaya Ice Cap. By 10,900 C-14 yr B.P, the ice front had retreated to nearly within its modern limits. Thus, glaciers in central and southern Peru advanced and retreated in near lockstep with one another. The Younger Dryas in the Peruvian Andes was apparently marked by retreating ice fronts in spite of the cool conditions that are inferred from the partial derivative O-18 record of Sajama ice. This retreat was apparently driven by reduced precipitation, which is consistent with interpretations of other paleoclimatic indicators from the region and which may have been a nonlinear response to steadily decreasing summer insolation.

DE Permafrost; Active layer; Frozen ground; Thermal regime; Climate change;
   Pipeline
AB Field observations from a permafrost thermal monitoring network in the Norman Wells pipeline corridor Northwest Territories, and thermal modelling have been utilized to gain insights into the relative effects that both environmental disturbance associated with vegetation clearance and ongoing climate warming have on the ground thermal regime in the vicinity of a right-of-way (ROW). This analysis was conducted to generate information that may aid engineering design of northern development projects, the assessment of environmental impacts associated with these projects and the development of related environmental monitoring and management plans. The separate and combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate change on the ground thermal regime beneath and adjacent to a ROW in an area of discontinuous permafrost are investigated using a two-dimensional finite element thermal model. A simplified soil profile consisting of one metre of peat overlying a fine-grained mineral soil is considered. A limited set of scenarios consider the effect of: ROW clearing alone: ROW clearing followed by vegetation recovery; ROW clearing combined with climate warming of 0.5 degrees C per decade; and ROW clearing followed by vegetation recovery combined with climate warming. Simulation results for warm thin permafrost (mean annual ground temperature above -1 degrees C; 20 m thick) indicate that the combined effects of ROW disturbance and climate warming are likely to result in permafrost degradation within 20 to 40 years, and ROW-disturbance effects may extend off-ROW under scenarios of climate warming. In colder and thicker permafrost (mean annual ground temperature below -1 degrees C; 50 m thick), the combined effect of climate warming and ROW disturbance will not likely lead to talik formation within 50 years, although seasonal thaw penetration will increase. For the range in ground thermal conditions considered, the results of the simulations indicate that the effects of ROW disturbance outweigh those associated with climate warming in the initial 10 to 15 years following disturbance, although climate warming becomes important over longer time periods. Climate warming and its influence on the ground thermal regime should therefore be incorporated into the design of northern development projects (and assessment of associated environmental impacts) expected to operate over two decades or more and where ground instability associated with permafrost thawing is a concern.

TI Climate Impacts on Northern Canada: Regional Background
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY; TRENDS
AB Understanding the implications of climate change on northern Canada requires a background about the size and diversity of its human and biogeophysical systems. Occupying an area of almost 40% of Canada, with one-third of this contained in Arctic islands, Canada's northern territories consist of a diversity of physical environments unrivaled around the circumpolar north. Major ecozones composed of a range of landforms, climate, vegetation, and wildlife include: Arctic, boreal and taiga cordillera; boreal and taiga plains; taiga shield; and northern and southern Arctic. Although generally characterized by a cold climate, there is an enormous range in air temperature with mean annual values being as high as -5 degrees C in the south to as low as -20 degrees C in the high Arctic islands. A similar contrast characterizes precipitation, which can be >700 mm y(-1) in some southern alpine regions to as low as 50 mm y(-1) over islands of the high Arctic. Major freshwater resources are found within most north m ecozones, varying from large glaciers or ice caps d lakes to extensive wetlands and peat lands. Most of the North's renewable water, however, is found within its major river networks and originates in more southerly headwaters. Ice covers characterize the freshwater systems for multiple months of the year while permafrost prevails in various forms, dominating the terrestrial landscape. The marine environment, which envelops the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, is dominated by seasonal to multiyear sea ice often several meters thick that plays a key role in the regional climate. Almost two-thirds of northern Canadian communities are located along coastlines with the entire population being just over 100 000. Most recent population growth has been dominated by an expansion of nonaboriginals, primarily the result of resource development and the growth of public administration. The economies of northern communities, however, remain quite mixed with traditional land-based renewable resource-subsistence activities still being a major part of many local economies.

AB High mountains are humid islands in arid central Asia, and alpine vegetation is sensitive to climate change, especially to temperature variations. Here we present a palynological sequence and discuss the past vegetation and climate changes based on core BY10A from the Swan Lake, an alpine lake situated at an inter-montane basin in the central Tienshan Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China. We collected 52 modern pollen surface samples at different elevations to aid in the interpretation of fossil-pollen data, which provide a reconstruction of vegetation and climate history for the last 8.5 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). Artemisia and Amaranthaceae (= Chenopodiaceae) are the main pollen types in desert steppe zone below 1800 m elevation, while Poaceae and Picea dominate the mid-elevation forest steppe zone (1800-2800 m). Cyperaceae is the main indicator of high alpine meadows (>2800 m). From 8.5 to 6.9 ka, the vegetation was steppe meadow suggesting relatively warm climate. From 6.9 to 2.6 ka generally high values of Cyperaceae and peaty sediments indicate a fen environment and cooler, more humid conditions. Interrupting this mid-Holocene period is a 5.5-4.5 ka millennium of lacustrine sediments with lower Cyperaceae, higher Poaceae and Artemisia, and high values of Myriophyllum and Pediastrum indicating higher water levels and warmer temperatures. After 2.6 ka, pollen data indicate alpine steppe and warmer climate. The mid-Holocene pattern of cooler climate interrupted by a warmer period is consistent from other regional records from Xinjiang, including the Guliya ice core and Kesang Cave speleothem record. During the cooler periods, the regional record indicates that a weakened summer Asian monsoon is countered to some extent by a stronger winter monsoon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change has resulted in warmer soil temperatures, earlier spring thaw and later fall freeze-up, resulting in warmer soil temperatures and thawing of permafrost in tundra regions. While these changes in temperature metrics tend to lengthen the growing season for plants, light levels, especially in the fall, will continue to limit plant growth and nutrient uptake. We conducted a laboratory experiment using intact soil cores with and without vegetation from a tundra peatland to measure the effects of late freeze and early spring thaw on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, methane (CH4) emissions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (N) leaching from soils. We compared soil C exchange and N production with a 30 day longer seasonal thaw during a simulated annual cycle from spring thaw through freeze-up and thaw. Across all cores, fall N leaching accounted for similar to 33% of total annual N loss despite significant increases in microbial biomass during this period. Nitrate(NO3-) leaching was highest during the fall (5.33 +/- 1.45 mgNm(-2) d(-1)) following plant senescence and lowest during the summer (0.43 +/- 0.22 mg Nm(-2) d(-1)). In the late freeze and early thaw treatment, we found 25% higher total annual ecosystem respiration but no significant change in CH4 emissions or DOC loss due to high variability among samples. The late freeze period magnified N leaching and likely was derived from root turnover and microbial mineralization of soil organic matter coupled with little demand from plants or microbes. Large N leaching during the fall will affect N cycling in low-lying areas and streams and may alter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem nitrogen budgets in the arctic.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above-and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than similar to 30 cm. Global uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these uncertainties, we estimate global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m to be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700 Pg smaller. Sedimentary deposits deeper than 3 m likely contain >500 Pg of additional SOC. Soils hold the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial carbon pool on Earth and are critical for stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, global pressures on soils continue from changes in land management, including the need for increasing bioenergy and food production.

AB Freshwater wetlands harbour diverse archaeal communities and associated membrane lipid assemblages, but the effect of environmental factors (e.g. pH and temperature) on the distribution of these lipids is relatively poorly constrained. Here we explore the effects of temperature and pH on archaeal core-lipid and intact polar lipid (IPL) derived core lipid distributions in a range of wetlands. We focus, not only on the commonly studied isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs), but also widen our analyses to include more recently identified, but relatively widespread, archaeal lipids such as isoGDGT isomers, methylated isoGDGTs (Me-GDGTs), and butanetriol and pentanetriol tetraethers (BDGTs and PDGTs). Based on multivariate analysis and a globally distributed set of wetlands, we find that the degree of isoGDGT cyclisation does increase along with temperature and pH in wetlands. However, and unlike in some other settings, this relationship is obscured in simple scatterplots due to the incorporation of isoGDGTs from highly diverse archaeal sources with multiple ring-temperature or ring-pH relationships. We further show that the relative abundance of early eluting to later eluting isoGDGT isomers increases with pH, representing a previously unknown and seemingly widespread archaeal membrane homeostasis mechanism or taxonomic signal. The distribution and abundance of crenarchaeol, a marker for Thaumarchaeota, demonstrates that in wetlands these Archaea, likely involved in ammonia oxidation, are restricted primarily to the generally drier soil/sediment surface and typically are more abundant in circumneutral pH settings. We identify Me-GDGTs and Me-isoGMGTs (homologs of isoGDGTs and isoGMGTs, but with additional methylation on the biphytanyl chain) as ubiquitous in wetlands, but variation in their abundance and distribution suggests changing source communities and/or membrane adaptation. The high relative abundance of BDGTs and PDGTs in the perennially anoxic part of the peat profile (catotelm), as well as their elevated abundance in a circumneutral pH wetland, is consistent with an important input from their only known culture source, belonging to the methanogenic Methanomassiliicoccales. Our results underline the diversity of archaeal membrane lipids preserved in wetlands and provide a baseline for the use of archaeal lipid distributions in wetlands as tracers of recent or ancient climate and biogeochemistry.

AB This paper describes the operational methods to achieve and measure both deep-soil heating (0-3 m) and whole-ecosystem warming (WEW) appropriate to the scale of tall-stature, high-carbon, boreal forest peatlands. The methods were developed to allow scientists to provide a plausible set of ecosystem-warming scenarios within which immediate and longer-term (1 decade) responses of organisms (microbes to trees) and ecosystem functions (carbon, water and nutrient cycles) could be measured. Elevated CO2 was also incorporated to test how temperature responses may be modified by atmospheric CO2 effects on carbon cycle processes. The WEW approach was successful in sustaining a wide range of aboveground and belowground temperature treatments (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75 and +9 degrees C) in large 115m(2) open-topped enclosures with elevated CO2 treatments (+0 to +500 ppm). Air warming across the entire 10 enclosure study required similar to 90% of the total energy for WEW ranging from 64 283 mega Joules (MJ) d(-1) during the warm season to 80 102 MJ d(-1) during cold months. Soil warming across the study required only 1.3 to 1.9% of the energy used ranging from 954 to 1782 MJ d(-1) of energy in the warm and cold seasons, respectively. The residual energy was consumed by measurement and communication systems. Sustained temperature and elevated CO2 treatments were only constrained by occasional high external winds. This paper contrasts the in situ WEW method with closely related field-warming approaches using both aboveground (air or infrared heating) and belowground-warming methods. It also includes a full discussion of confounding factors that need to be considered carefully in the interpretation of experimental results. The WEW method combining aboveground and deep-soil heating approaches enables observations of future temperature conditions not available in the current observational record, and therefore provides a plausible glimpse of future environmental conditions.

AB Heterogeneous Holocene climate evolutions in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes are primarily determined by orbital-scale insolation variations and melting ice sheets. Previous inter-model comparisons have revealed that multi-simulation consistencies vary spatially. We, therefore, compared multiple model results with proxy-based reconstructions in Fennoscandia, Greenland, north Canada, Alaska and Siberia.
   Our model-data comparisons reveal that data and models generally agree in Fennoscandia, Greenland and Canada, with the early-Holocene warming and subsequent gradual decrease to 0 ka BP (hereinafter referred as ka). In Fennoscandia, simulations and pollen data suggest a 2 degrees C warming by 8 ka, but this is less expressed in chironomid data. In Canada, a strong early-Holocene warming is suggested by both the simulations and pollen results. In Greenland, the magnitude of early-Holocene warming ranges from 6 degrees C in simulations to 8 degrees C in delta O-18-based temperatures.
   Simulated and reconstructed temperatures are mismatched in Alaska. Pollen data suggest strong early Holocene warming, while the simulations indicate constant Holocene cooling, and chironomid data show a stable trend. Meanwhile, a high frequency of Alaskan peatland initiation before 9 ka can reflect a either high temperature, high soil moisture or large seasonality. In high-latitude Siberia, although simulations and proxy data depict high Holocene temperatures, these signals are noisy owing to a large spread in the simulations and between pollen and chironomid results. On the whole, the Holocene climate evolutions in most regions (Fennoscandia, Greenland and Canada) are well established and understood, but important questions regarding the Holocene temperature trend and mechanisms remain for Alaska and Siberia.

AB Accurate soil organic carbon (SOC) maps are needed to predict the terrestrial SOC feedback to climate change, one of the largest remaining uncertainties in Earth system modeling. Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to >3000 Pg of C within the top 1m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal water sheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 PgC(to 1m) for the study region, 22% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 +/- 111 Mg C ha(-1) fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11-33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates fromtwo spatially explicit global products (Pearson's correlation: rho = .0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest. In sum our study demonstrates that CTR ecosystems represent amoisture-dependent hotspot for SOCstorage at mid-latitudes.

AB Annual mean ground temperatures (T-g) decline northward from approximately -3.0 degrees C in the boreal forest to -7.0 degrees C in dwarf-shrub tundra in the Tuktoyuktuk Coastlands and Anderson Plain, NWT, Canada. The latitudinal decrease in T-g from forest to tundra is accompanied by an increase in the range of values measured in the central, tall-shrub tundra zone. Field measurements from 124 sites across this ecotone indicate that in undisturbed terrain Tg may approach 0 degrees C in the forest and -4 degrees C in dwarf-shrub tundra. The greatest range of local variation in T-g (similar to 7 degrees C) was observed in the tall-shrub transition zone. Undisturbed terrain units with relatively high T-g include riparian areas and slopes with drifting snow, saturated soils in polygonal peatlands and areas near lakes. Across the region, the warmest permafrost is associated with disturbances such as thaw slumps, drained lakes, areas burned by wildfires, drilling-mud sumps and roadsides. Soil saturation following terrain subsidence may increase the latent heat content of the active layer, while increases in snow depth decrease the rate of ground heat loss in autumn and winter. Such disturbances increase freezeback duration and reduce the period of conductive ground cooling, resulting in higher Tg and, in some cases, permafrost thaw. The field measurements reported here confirm that minimum T-g values in the uppermost 10 m of permafrost have increased by similar to 2 degrees C since the 1970s. The widespread occurrence of T-g above -3 degrees C indicates warm permafrost exists in disturbed and undisturbed settings across the transition from forest to tundra.

AB The frost table depth is a critical state variable for hydrological modelling in cold regions as frozen ground controls runoff generation, subsurface water storage and the permafrost regime. Calculation of the frost table depth is typically performed using a modified version of the Stefan equation, which is driven with the ground surface temperature. Ground surface temperatures have usually been estimated as linear functions of air temperature, referred to as n-factors' in permafrost studies. However, these linear functions perform poorly early in the thaw season and vary widely with slope, aspect and vegetation cover, requiring site-specific calibration. In order to improve estimation of the ground surface temperature and avoid site-specific calibration, an empirical radiative-conductive-convective (RCC) approach is proposed that uses air temperature, net radiation and antecedent frost table position as driving variables. The RCC algorithm was developed from forested and open sites on the eastern slope of the Coastal Mountains in southern Yukon, Canada, and tested at a high-altitude site in the Canadian Rockies, and a peatland in the southern Northwest Territories. The RCC approach performed well in a variety of land types without any local calibration and particularly improved estimation of ground temperature compared with linear functions during the first month of the thaw season, with mean absolute errors <2 degrees C in seven of the nine sites tested. An example of the RCC approach coupled with a modified Stefan thaw equation suggests a capability to represent frozen ground conditions that can be incorporated into hydrological and permafrost models of cold regions.

   PENINSULA
AB A synthesis of 93 hydrologic records from across North and Central America, and adjacent tropical and Arctic islands, reveals centennial to millennial trends in the regional hydroclimates of the Common Era (CE; past 2000 years). The hydrological records derive from materials stored in lakes, bogs, caves, and ice from extant glaciers, which have the continuity through time to preserve lowfrequency (> 100 year) climate signals that may extend deeper into the Holocene. The most common pattern, represented in 46 (49 %) of the records, indicates that the centuries before 1000 CE were drier than the centuries since that time. Principal component analysis indicates that millennialscale trends represent the dominant pattern of variance in the southwestern US, northeastern US, midcontinent, Pacific Northwest, Arctic, and tropics, although not all records within a region show the same direction of change. The Pacific Northwest and the southernmost tier of the tropical sites tended to dry toward present, as many other areas became wetter than before. In 22 records (24 %), the Medieval Climate Anomaly period (8001300 CE) was drier than the Little Ice Age (14001900 CE), but in many cases the difference was part of the longer millennialscale trend, and, in 25 records (27 %), the Medieval Climate Anomaly period represented a pluvial (wet) phase. Where quantitative records permitted a comparison, we found that centennial-scale fluctuations over the Common Era represented changes of 3-7% in the modern interannual range of variability in precipitation, but the accumulation of these long-term trends over the entirety of the Holocene caused recent centuries to be significantly wetter, on average, than most of the past 11 000 years.

AB Boreal wetlands hold vast stocks of soil carbon (C), which may be vulnerable to changes in climate. In southcentral Alaska, wetlands of the Kenai Lowlands have experienced a warming and drying trend that has led to woody vegetation encroachment into herbaceous wetlands. We examined whether predicted higher rates of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) would be offset by higher rates of ecosystem respiration (ER) in woody wetland communities. We measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in four communities along a hydrologic and vegetation gradient during (1) a warm and dry growing season, (2) a more typical cool and wet growing season and (3) the intervening winter. We fit simple GEP and ER models to our data and estimated annual NEE for each community using hourly measurements of photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature. We found that woody communities exhibited greater GEP than herbaceous communities under cool and moist conditions, but more similar GEP under warm and dry conditions. Woody communities also showed greater ER than herbaceous communities during all seasons, outpacing GEP during the warm and dry growing season. On an annual basis, we estimated that herbaceous communities were either net sinks or approximately CO2 neutral, ranging from 132 center dot 8 to 4 center dot 7g CO2Cm2y1. In contrast, woody communities were sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, ranging from 78 center dot 8 to 181 center dot 7g CO2Cm2y1. Our results suggest that the initial encroachment of woody vegetation into herbaceous wetlands will lead to a substantial loss of C, particularly if conditions continue to become warmer and drier.

AB This work examined the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature and water regimes, alone and in interaction, on the leaf characteristics [leaf area (LA), specific leaf weight (SLW), leaf nitrogen content (N-L) based on LA], photosynthesis (light-saturated net carbon fixation rate, P-sat) and carbon storage in aboveground biomass of leaves (C-l) and stem (C-s) for a perennial reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L., Finnish local cultivar). For this purpose, plants were grown under different water regimes (ranging from high to low soil moisture) in climate-controlled growth chambers under the elevated CO2 and/or temperature (following a factorial design) over a whole growing season (May-September in 2009). The results showed that the elevated temperature increased the leaf growth, photosynthesis and carbon storage of aboveground biomass the most in the early growing periods, compared with ambient temperature. However, the plant growth declined rapidly thereafter with a lower carbon storage at the end of growing season. This was related to the accelerated phenology regulation and consequent earlier growth senescence. Consequently, the elevation of CO2 increased the P-sat, LA and SLW during the growing season, with a significant concurrent increase in the carbon storage in aboveground biomass. Low soil moisture decreased the P-sat, leaf stomatal conductance, LA and carbon storage in above ground biomass compared with high and normal soil moisture. This water stress effect was the largest under the elevated temperature. The elevated CO2 partially mitigated the adverse effects of high temperature and low soil moisture. However, the combination of elevated temperature and CO2 did not significantly increase the carbon storage in aboveground biomass of the plants.

AB Although methane (CH4) fluxes from northern wetlands in Asia have been described in previous research at different temporal and spatial scales, integrated studies at the ecosystem scale were scarce. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured using eddy covariance (EC) technique and the chamber method in a cool temperate marsh in northeast China during the growing season (May-September) of 2011. CH4 emissions were highly variable, both temporally and spatially during the measurement period. According to the EC observation data, CH4 fluxes showed a significant diurnal cycle during the mid-growing season with nighttime average flux about 67% of the average daytime values. Daily cumulative CH4 fluxes varied from 54 to 250 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) with an average flux of 136.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The observations of chamber method showed that CH4 emissions differed markedly among the three main plant communities. Average flux at the Carex lasiocarpa site was about 4 times and 13.5 times of that at the Glyceria spiculosa site and Deyewcia angustifolia site, respectively. The spatial variability of CH4 flux was mainly controlled by the varying water table level as well as the spatial distribution of different vascular plants, while the seasonal dynamic of CH4 emission could be best explained by the change of surface soil temperature and air pressure. A comparison was made between EC measurements and the upscaled chamber based model. The results from the model overestimated CH4 emission by 28% compared to the EC data. Considering the large variability of methane emission, it is necessary to conduct continuous observations on CH4 emission from northern wetlands at different temporal and spatial scales to comprehend the variability and also to predict responses to climate change.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. Coastal and river plains are the surfaces of depositional systems, to which sediment input is a parameter of key-importance. Their habitation and economic development usually requires protection with dikes, quays, etc., which are effective in retaining floods but have the side effect of impeding sedimentation in their hinterlands. The flood-protected Dutch lowlands (so-called dike-ring areas) have been sediment-starved for up to about a millennium. In addition to this, peat decomposition and soil compaction, brought about by land drainage, have caused significant land subsidence. Sediment deficiency, defined as the combined effect of sediment-starvation and drainage-induced volume losses, has already been substantial in this area, and it is expected to become urgent in view of the forecasted effects of climate change (sea-level rise, intensified precipitation and run-off). We therefore explore this deficiency, compare it with natural (Holocene) and current human sediment inputs, and discuss it in terms of long-term land-use options.
   Materials and Methods. We use available 3D geological models to define natural sediment inputs to our study area. Recent progress in large-scale modelling of peat oxidation and compaction enables us to address volume loss associated with these processes. Human sediment inputs are based on published minerals statistics. All results are given as first-order approximations.
   Results. The current sediment deficit in the diked lowlands of the Netherlands is estimated at 136 +/- 67 million m(3)/a. About 85% of this volume is the hypothetical amount of sediment required to keep up with sea-level rise, and 15% is the effect of land drainage (peat decomposition and compaction). The average Holocene sediment input to our study area (based on a total of 145 km(3)) is similar to 14 million m(3)/a, and the maximum (millennium-averaged) input similar to 26 million m(3)/a. Historical sediment deficiency has resulted in an unused sediment accommodation space of about 13.3 km(3). Net human input of sediment material currently amounts to similar to 23 million m(3)/a.
   Discussion. As sedimentary processes in the Dutch lowlands have been retarded, the depositional system's natural resilience to sea-level rise is low, and all that is left to cope is human countermeasure. Preserving some sort of status quo with water management solutions may reach its limits in the foreseeable future. The most viable long-term option therefore seems a combination of allowing for more water in open country (anything from flood-buffer zones to open water) and raising lands that are to be built up (enabling their lasting protection). As to the latter, doubling or tripling the use of filling sand in a planned and sustained effort may resolve up to one half of the Dutch sediment deficiency problems in about a century.
   Conclusions, Recommendations and Perspectives. We conclude that sediment deficiency-past, present and future-challenges the sustainable habitation of the Dutch lowlands. In order to explore possible solutions, we recommend the development of long-term scenarios for the changing lowland physiography, that include the effects of Global Change, compensation measures, costs and benefits, and the implications for long-term land-use options.

AB The Uddelermeer is a unique lake for The Netherlands, containing a sediment record that continuously registered environmental and climatic change from the late Pleistocene on to the present. A 15.6-m-long sediment record was retrieved from the deepest part of the sedimentary basin and an age-depth model was developed using radiocarbon dating, Pb-210 dating, and Bayesian modeling. Lake-level change was reconstructed using a novel combination of high-resolution palaeoecological proxies (e.g. pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, chironomids), quantitative determinations of lake-level change (ground-penetrating radar), and estimates of changes in precipitation (lipid biomarker stable isotopes). We conclude that lake levels were at least as high as present-day water levels from the late glacial to 3150 cal. yr BP, with the exception of at least one lake-level lowstand during the Preboreal period. Lake levels were ca. 2.5 m lower than at present between 3150 and 2800 cal. yr BP, which might have been the result of a change in moisture source region prior to the so-called 2.8-kyr event. Increasing precipitation amounts around 2800 cal. yr BP resulted in a lake-level rise of about 3.5-4 m to levels that were 1-1.5 m higher than at present, in line with increased precipitation levels as inferred for the 2.8-kyr event from nearby raised bog areas as well as with reconstructions of higher lake levels in the French Alps, all of which have been previously attributed to a phase of decreased solar activity. Lake levels decreased to their present level only during recent times, although the exact timing of the drop in lake levels is unclear.

AB The varved sediment of Lake Gosciaz (Central Poland) is one of the most detailed and complete climate archives of the Late Glacial and the Holocene in Central Europe. Here, we present microfacies analyses in combination with mu XRF core scanning and a detailed varve chronology of a new and continuous GOS18 sediment record.
   This record presents six lithozones that mark the most prominent depositional and geochemical changes during the Holocene and Late Glacial. Varve boundaries and five main varve microfacies types were distinguished under petrographic microscope. Analysis provides detailed insights into depositional processes and its changes since the Late Glacial. Microfacies components were used to interpret processes leading to varve formation. A new and independent chronology is obtained by triple varve counting on petrographic thin sections that is complemented by Cs-137 measurements and C-14 AMS dating of terrestrial plant remains. The age-depth model consists of three parts: (1) the upper part (0-520 cm) that is primarily based on varve counting, (2) the middle part (520-758 cm) obtained through age-depth modelling and (3) the lower part (758-1897 cm) developed by varve counting. The bottom of the composite profile coincides with the onset of lacustrine sedimentation in the late Allerod at 12,834 +134/-233 varve yr BP.
   The largest shift in geochemistry, expressed by log(Ca/Ti) and log(Si/Ti) ratios show a rapid increase of calcite precipitation and primary productivity at 7940 +112/-168 varve yr BP. Possible triggers for this include local changes in hydrology as the formation of "Na Jazach" system due to the Ruda River development and fluctuations of lake water level. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Large, deep-seated landslides are common throughout the south-eastern San Juan Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico, but their timing and initiation are not well understood. Determining when the landslides occurred would aid in clarifying the mechanisms for initiating landslides in the region and would help us to understand post-glacial landscape evolution. We studied seven pre-historic landslides located within the Tertiary volcanic rocks of the San Juan Volcanic Field. The landslides range in area from similar to 0.8km(2) to similar to 11.3km(2) and most are located in areas that were previously mapped as having been ice-covered during the last glaciation. Landslide deposits were dated using a variety of methods including surface exposure dating (chlorine-36, Cl-36), radiocarbon dating of basal bog sediments and organic material buried in soils, and relative soil development. The resulting limiting ages range from approximately 14ka to 2ka and show that deep-seated landsliding has occurred throughout the post-glacial period. This broad range in ages is inconsistent with our initial hypothesis, which proposed that landslides were likely the result of debuttressing of glacial walls during glacial retreat. Furthermore, the timing of landslides does not seem to correlate with documented post-glacial climatic shifts. Therefore, we conclude that landsliding in the region was the result of wetter than normal periods lasting months to years acting on weak bedrock preconditioned to failure and prepared by glacial debuttressing. Our findings suggest that the study area is likely still susceptible to deep-seated landsliding and may become even more prone to large-scale slope failure if future climate change increases precipitation in the San Juan Mountains.

AB Determining the temperature sensitivity of terrestrial carbon (C) stores is an urgent priority for predicting future climate feedbacks. A key aspect to solve this long-standing research gap is to determine whether warmer temperatures will increase autotrophic activities leading to greater C storage or promote heterotrophic activities that will drive these systems to become C sources. We experimentally addressed this critical question by subjecting intact plant-soil systems in a UK upland ecosystem to simulated climate warming under natural field conditions. We report the results of a 13-year field-based climate manipulation experiment combining in situ respiration measurements with radiocarbon (C-14) analyses of respired CO2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil and the tissue contents of the dominant soil fauna (enchytraeids). We found that warming during the growing season produced the largely expected increases in ecosystem respiration (63%) and leaching of DOC (19%) with no evidence for thermal acclimation or substrate exhaustion over the whole 13-year experimental period. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence to support an increased release of old soil C after more than a decade of simulated climatic change, and indeed, C-14 analyses indicated that warming caused a significant shift towards mineralisation of more recent plant-derived C inputs. Further support came from the radiocarbon analyses of the enchytraeid tissues, which showed a greater assimilation of the more recent (plant-derived) C sources following warming. Therefore, in contrast to subarctic ecosystems, our results suggest that changes in C storage in this UK upland soil are strongly coupled to plant activities and that increasing temperatures will drive the turnover of organic material fixed only within recent years, without resulting in the loss of existing old carbon stores.

AB Arctic soils contain large amounts of organic matter which, globally, exceed the amount of carbon stored in vegetation biomass and in the atmosphere. Recent studies emphasise the potential sensitivity for this soil organic matter (SOM) to be mineralised when faced with increasing ambient temperatures. In order to better refine the predictions about the response of SOM to climate warming, there is a need to increase the spatial coverage of empirical data on SOM quantity and quality in the Arctic area. This study provides, for the first time, a characterisation of SOM from the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal Region, Western Siberia, Russia. On the one hand, soil humic acids and their humification state were characterised by measuring the elemental composition and diversity of functional groups using solidstate C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Also, the total mineralisable carbon was measured. Our results indicate that there is a predominance of aliphatic carbon structures, with a minimal variation of their functional-group composition both regionally and within soil depth. This vertical homogeneity and low level of aromaticity reflects the accumulation in soil of lowly decomposed organic matter due to cold temperatures. Mineralisation rates were found to be independent of SOM quality, and to be mainly explained solely by the total carbon content. Overall, our results provide further evidence on the sensitivity that the soils of Western Siberia may have to increasing ambient temperatures and highlight the important role that this region can play in the global carbon balance under the effects of climate warming.

AB The morphologies of sympatric juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar parr and brown trout Salmo trutta parr were compared between Irish rivers with contrasting hydraulic environments a high-gradient and a low-gradient tributary from the River Barrow catchment, south-east Ireland and a high-gradient river from the Burrishoole catchment, west of Ireland. The two catchments differ markedly in mean annual precipitation (849.0 mm year-1 and 1370.3 mm year-1 for the Barrow and Burrishoole catchments, respectively). Parr of both species demonstrated morphological variation between and within catchments. Changes in metrics such as pectoral fin length, body depth and body length between and within catchments suggest that hydraulic forces were a major determinant of morphological variation. Both species from the Burrishoole catchment had relatively larger pectoral fins, longer heads, larger eyes and shallower bodies than conspecifics from the Barrow catchment. In rivers subject to frequent rainfall-driven high discharges, such as those in the Burrishoole catchment, a more fusiform body and head shape coupled with larger pectoral fins may reduce the energetic cost of maintaining position in the water column, as well as increase stability and manoeuvrability. The larger eyes in both parr species in the Burrishoole catchment could further be a response to the lower visibility of the more turbid and peat-stained waters or to the reduced prey availability. The results of this study demonstrate that local adaptation to flow conditions can yield morphologically distinct populations and that multiple species can exhibit parallel phenotypic responses to changing environmental conditions.

AB East African wetlands are naturally dominated by papyrus, the world's fastest growing herbaceous plant, reaching up to 5 m in height and 3 kg m (2) of standing biomass per year. While its provisioning services are well-known, papyrus plays a less evident role in supporting tropical swamp ecosystems by controlling nutrient balances as well as hydrological flows, and through the provision of critical biotopes vital for the reproduction of insects, fishes and birds, including a small number of endemic species. Claims are made condemning papyrus for enhancing water loss, yet only few proper evapotranspiration studies have been carried out. Conflicting evidence indicates that papyrus swamps could be important in regulating local climate through evapotranspiration and hold significant potential in climate mitigation through carbon sequestration and carbon storage as peat. These benefits may become soon severely eroded because papyrus swamps are degrading rapidly due to direct exploitation, to agricultural encroachment, and to extensive trampling and feeding by cattle. We review papyrus ecosystem services, with a focus on its role on biodiversity enhancement and regulating functions. We present new evidence, showing an inverse temperature gradient within papyrus swamps, indicative of an optimised water retention capacity, with examples from Lake Naivasha and Lake Victoria. Better understanding of papyrus regulating services should underpin papyrus restoration as an ecohydrological tool to improve water quality, to moderate local climate by regulating the water cycle, to provide base material for a variety of provisioning ecosystem services, to enhance biotope structure and to support biodiversity.

AB Arctic tundra soils store a large quantity of organic carbon that is susceptible to decomposition and release to the atmosphere as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) under a warming climate. Anaerobic processes that generate CH4 and CO2 remain unclear because previous studies have focused on aerobic decomposition pathways. To predict releases of CO2 and CH4 from tundra soils, it is necessary to identify pathways of soil organic matter decomposition under the anoxic conditions that are prevalent in Arctic ecosystems. Here molecular and spectroscopic techniques were used to monitor biological degradation of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) during anoxic incubation of tundra soils from a region of continuous permafrost in northern Alaska. Organic and mineral soils from the tundra active layer were incubated at -2, +4, or +8 degrees C for up to 60 days to mimic the short-term thaw season. Results suggest that, under anoxic conditions, fermentation converted complex organic molecules into simple organic acids that were used in concomitant Fe-reduction and acetoclastic methanogenesis reactions. Nonaromatic compounds increased over time as WEOC increased. Organic acid metabolites initially accumulated in soils but were mostly depleted by day 60 because organic acids were consumed to produce Fe(II), CO2, and CH4. We conclude that fermentation of nonprotected organic matter facilitates methanogenesis and Fe reduction reactions, and that the proportion of organic acids consumed by methanogenesis increases relative to Fe reduction with increasing temperature. The decomposition pathways observed in this study are important to consider in numerical modeling of greenhouse gas production in the Arctic.

AB Continued warming of the Arctic may cause permafrost to thaw and speed the decomposition of large stores of soil organic carbon (OC), thereby accentuating global warming. However, it is unclear if recent warming has raised the current rates of permafrost OC release to anomalous levels or to what extent soil carbon release is sensitive to climate forcing. Here we use a time series of radiocarbon age-offsets (C-14) between the bulk lake sediment and plant macrofossils deposited in an arctic lake as an archive for soil and permafrost OC release over the last 14,500 years. The lake traps and archives OC imported from the watershed and allows us to test whether prior warming events stimulated old carbon release and heightened age-offsets. Today, the age-offset (2ka; thousand of calibrated years before A.D. 1950) and the depositional rate of ancient OC from the watershed into the lake are relatively low and similar to those during the Younger Dryas cold interval (occurring 12.9-11.7ka). In contrast, age-offsets were higher (3.0-5.0ka) when summer air temperatures were warmer than present during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (11.7-9.0ka) and BOlling-AllerOd periods (14.5-12.9ka). During these warm times, permafrost thaw contributed to ancient OC depositional rates that were similar to 10 times greater than today. Although permafrost OC was vulnerable to climate warming in the past, we suggest surface soil organic horizons and peat are presently limiting summer thaw and carbon release. As a result, the temperature threshold to trigger widespread permafrost OC release is higher than during previous warming events.

AB Radiocarbon dates were obtained from 24 samples of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) wood recovered from sites beyond the modern conifer tree-line on the Kola Peninsula of Russia. Twenty-one of the samples came from the shallow waters and eroding peats at the edges of two small lakes at 68 degrees 43'N, 35 degrees 10'E, located north of the modem conifer tree-line. Three samples came from a small pond located above the modem elevational limits of Pinus sylvestris at 68 degrees 25'N, 35 degrees 19'E. The radiocarbon dates indicate that pine trees grew approximately 20 km north of the mapped modern limits of the species from 6680 BP to 3830 BP. Pine trees were also growing some 40 m above their modern elevational limits between 5890 BP and 3450 BP. Nineteen of the samples date from 6680 BP to 5070 BP, suggesting that the density of trees north of the modern treeline was greatest between similar to 7000 and 5000 BP. The timing of tree-line advance and greatest density on the Kola Peninsula are in agreement with the results of similar studies from northern Fennoscandia which indicate that maximum northern and elevational extension of tree-line occurred between 7000 BP and 4000 BP. The general agreement between tree-line reconstructions suggests that the climatic changes that promoted mid-Holocene tree-line extension along the North Atlantic margins in northern Fennoscandia propagated eastward to the Kola Peninsula. The late timing of initial pine expansion on the Kola and in adjacent northern Fennoscandia remains problematic and may relate to lower winter insolation, temperature regimes in the adjacent oceans or slow rates of migration.

AB Fire can have large effects on ecosystems, with phosphorus being highly important in this regard, especially when considering productivity in burned or adjacent ecosystems after fire. Unfortunately, existing data pose contradictions and methodological challenges to assessing P availability. Here, the impact of fire on topsoil available P was estimated using three different types of organic soil layers (raw humus from spruce, humus from beech, and peat) and two fire regimes (obtaining black carbon and ash). Our findings suggest a strong fire impact on P availability, by enhancing available P during burning to black carbon (similar to 10-fold), and to ash (similar to 2- to 7.5-fold) dependent on calcite content. Fire impact on P availability is on a similar order of magnitude as mineral weathering and annual P cycling/uptake in/by ecosystems. Furthermore, the proportion of available P in relation to total P depends on the origin of the organic soil layers. When related to the remaining mass after burning, as is commonly done, P availability can be overestimated by up to 1400%. Results from this study provide a realistic magnitude of shifts in P release and P availability by fire events of different intensity for widely abundant ecosystem conditions. Taking the importance of P for ecosystem processes into account, these results are highly relevant, because fires for fuel reduction are a common application, and for temperate and boreal ecosystems even moderate climate change scenarios predict an increasing appearance of fires in these regions.

AB Many articles published in the last few years start with the assumption that the past decades have seen an increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the rivers and lakes of the Northern Hemisphere. This study analyses whether the existing evidence supports this claim. With this aim, we have collected published studies where long series of organic carbon concentrations (i.e., longer than 10 years) were analyzed for existing trends and have carefully evaluated the 63 articles found. Information has been collated in a comprehensive and comparable way, allowing readers to easily access it. The two main aspects considered in our analysis have been the analytical methods used and the data treatment methods applied. Both are sensitive issues because, on the one hand, the difficulties associated with correctly determining organic carbon concentrations in surface waters are well known, while, on the other, dealing with real environmental data (i.e., lack of normality, censoring, missing values, etc.) is an extremely intricate matter. Other issues such as data reporting and the geographical location of the systems studied are also discussed. In conclusion, it is clear that organic carbon concentrations have increased in some surface waters in the Northern Hemisphere since the 1990s. However, due to a lack of data in many parts of the world, it is not known whether this phenomenon is general and, more importantly, in the areas for which such data do exist, the reporting and methodological problems in the published studies prevent any conclusion on the existence of a general temporal behavior of organic carbon from being drawn.

AB Hudson Bay remains frozen or is dominated by ice over the summer solstice and throughout much of the high-sun season.  This contributes directly to the winterization of summer.  The juxtaposition of the mean summer position of the Arctic front and of treeline to the west of Hudson Bay has been clearly documented, and the coincidence of treeline and the southern boundary of continuous permafrost is well known.  The strong southward thrust of the Arctic front in summer is, in major degree, a response to cold air masses spawned over Hudson Bay.
   On a mesoscale, Hudson Bay generates onshore winds across a strong temperature and pressure gradient.  This mesoscale regime dominates the temperature and surface energy balance for a large distance inland across the Hudson Bay Lowlands.  Superimposed on the mesoscale wind field is a land-sea breeze, which is sometimes well developed in coastal areas and which can be traced up to 65 km inland.  It is, however, of low frequency occurrence and is usually overridden by the regional wind.
   Progressing inland from the coast, in the central Hudson Bay Lowlands, the landscape becomes dominated by deep peat soils and a surface vegetation which is resistant to evapotranspiration.  As a result, it is much drier than the wetlands near the coast and evapotranspiration is reduced.
   The large-scale cold air masses originating over Hudson Bay and the cold mesoscale winds combine to impose cold air temperatures on the adjacent terrestrial environment.  Even with abundant solar radiation and saturated surfaces, evaporation is vigorously suppressed by these cold temperatures.  Any warming or cooling during climate change will have a double impact on the terrestrial environment through the strong linkages with Hudson Bay.

AB Active layer probing in northern Sweden, northeast Greenland, and central Svalbard indicates active layer thickening has occurred at Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) sites with long-term, continuous observations, since the sites were established at these locations in 1978, 1996, and 2000, respectively. The study areas exhibit a reverse latitudinal gradient in average active layer thickness (ALT), which is explained by site geomorphology and climate. Specifically, Svalbard has a more maritime climate and thus the thickest active layer of the study areas (average ALT = 99 cm, 2000-2018). The active layer is thinnest at the northern Sweden sites because it is primarily confined to superficial peat. Interannual variability in ALT is not synchronous across this Nordic Arctic region, but study sites in the same area respond similarly to local meteorology. ALT correlates positively with thawing degree days in Sweden and Greenland, as has been observed in other Arctic regions. However, ALT in Svalbard correlates with freezing degree days, where the maritime Arctic climate results in relatively high and variable winter air temperatures. The difference in annual ALT at adjacent sites is attributed to differences in snow cover and geomorphology. From 2000 to 2018, the average rate of active layer thickening at the Nordic Arctic CALM probing sites was 0.5 cm/yr. The average rate was 1 cm/yr for Nordic Arctic CALM database sites with significant trends, which includes a borehole in addition to probing sites. This range is in line with the circum-Arctic average of 0.8 cm/yr from 2000 to 2018.

AB Thawing of permafrost and subsequent release of organic carbon in the warming Arctic has great potential to influence carbon cycling between the land and ocean. Here, we investigated temporal and spatial differences of organic carbon sources in sediments of Colville River delta and the adjacent Simpson Lagoon, Alaska (USA) over the last similar to 50 years, using a multi-proxy approach (lignin, fatty acids, sterols, bulk and compound-specific C-13 isotopes). Stations closer to the river mouth showed greater inputs of soil and litter-derived terrestrial material based on the terrestrial inputs indicator (Lambda(8)), soil biomarker (3,5-Bd), and degradation index ([Ad/Al](v)), as well as stronger and more frequent watershed-flushing events, coupled with Colville River discharge events, than stations in the lagoon. Values of Lambda(8), 3,5-Bd, and [Ad/Al](v) in sediments ranged from 0.75-2.69, 0.02-0.44 mg/ 100 mg OC, and 0.23-0.85, respectively. The increase of terrestrial inputs in sediments near the delta for the last similar to 50 years is most likely due to increase of river discharge under warmer temperatures in recent decades. Coastal erosion and inputs from other river sources (e.g., Kuparuk and Mackenzie Rivers) also contribute to the organic carbon in sediments of the delta. Rudimentary fatty acid indices reflected two distinct groups of bacteria in these sediments. Additionally, the sterol biomarker 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3 beta-ol is useful to track peat inputs in the Arctic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A snapshot of the thermal state of permafrost in northern North America during the international Polar Year (IPY) was developed using ground temperature data collected from 350 boreholes. More than half these were established during IPY to enhance the network in sparsely monitored regions. The measurement sites span a diverse range of ecoclimatic and geological conditions across the continent and are at various elevations within the Cordillera. The ground temperatures within the discontinuous permafrost zone are generally above -3 degrees C, and range down to -15 degrees C in the continuous zone. Ground temperature envelopes vary according to substrate, with shallow depths of zero annual amplitude for peat and mineral soils, and much greater depths for bedrock. New monitoring sites in the mountains of southern and central Yukon suggest that permafrost may be limited in extent. In concert with regional air temperatures, permafrost has generally been warming across North America for the past several decades, as indicated by measurements from the western Arctic since the 1970s and from parts of eastern Canada since the early 1990s. The rates of ground warming have been variable, but are generally greater north of the treeline. Latent heat effects in the southern discontinuous zone dominate the permafrost thermal regime close to 0 degrees C and allow permafrost to persist under a warming climate. Consequently, the spatial diversity of permafrost thermal conditions is decreasing over time. Copyright (C) 2010 Crown in the right of Canada and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Studies in tropical and boreal regions suggest that wetlands and forest soils are important sources and sinks, respectively, for atmospheric methane. This study was conducted to determine whether temperate wetlands and forests play important roles in the global balances of atmospheric methane. Flux measurements for methane in several different wetland, forest, and open-water (e.g., beaver pond and low-order stream) sites were determined using collection chambers placed over the soil- or water-air interface. All of the sites were located in the Appalachian Mountain region of West Virginia and western Maryland. Between June 1987 and April 1989 the wetland sites acted as small sources of atmospheric methane, with emission rates for methane usually < 200 mg CH-4 m-2 d-1; consumption of atmospheric methane in the wetland soils was observed frequently. The forest sites were mostly atmospheric methane sinks, even though emission rates (< 40 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) were observed sporadically. Open-water sites were large sources of atmospheric methane, with emission rates often exceeding 1000 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Methane fluxes were poorly correlated with environmental variables including soil moisture, soil and air temperature, and cloud cover, thereby making it difficult to determine the factors controlling methane fluxes in these sites. Scenarios of future global climate warming due to an increase greenhouse effect suggest that wetlands and forests in the southern boreal forest will begin to resemble present-day temperate wetlands and forests. The results of our studies suggest that methane emissions from these "temperatelike" ecosystems will not result in a large positive feedback that might exacerbate the rate of global climate warming.

AB Important unknowns remain about how abrupt permafrost collapse (thermokarst) affects carbon balance and greenhouse gas flux, limiting our ability to predict the magnitude and timing of the permafrost carbon feedback. We measured monthly, growing-season fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O at a large thermokarst feature in alpine tundra on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Thermokarst formation disrupted plant growth and soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a growing-season carbon sink to a weak source but decreasing feature level CH4 and N2O flux. Temperature-corrected ecosystem respiration from decomposing permafrost soil was 2.7 to 9.5-fold higher than in similar features from Arctic and Boreal regions, suggesting that warmer and dryer conditions on the northern QTP could accelerate carbon decomposition following permafrost collapse. N2O flux was similar to the highest values reported for Arctic ecosystems and was 60% higher from exposed mineral soil on the feature floor, confirming Arctic observations of coupled nitrification and denitrification in collapsed soils. Q(10) values for respiration were typically over 4, suggesting high-temperature sensitivity of thawed carbon. Taken together, these results suggest that QTP permafrost carbon in alpine tundra is highly vulnerable to mineralization following thaw, and that N2O production could be an important noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. Permafrost collapse altered soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a carbon sink to carbon source but decreasing CH4 and N2O flux. Little to no vegetation recovery after stabilization suggests potentially large net carbon losses. High N2O flux compared to Arctic and Boreal systems suggests noncarbon permafrost climate feedback.

AB Non-biting midges (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are now widely recognised as powerful biological proxies for inferring past climatic change. In this paper the response of chironomid assemblages to Lateglacial and Holocene climatic change from sites in Scotland and Norway is discussed. Analyses have shown that midge assemblages have responded to major and minor climatic fluctuations during the last 15,000 yr, such as the Aegelsee Oscillation, Gerzensee Oscillation and Younger Dryas in the Lateglacial, and the thermal optimum, "Little Ice Age" and cooling events at 8.2 and 2.0 cal ka BP in the Holocene. In an attempt to quantify these and other climatic fluctuations a chironomid-mean July air temperature inference model. based on a modern calibration set of 109 lakes in Norway and Svalbard. has been developed. The 3-component weighted averaging partial least squares inference model performs well with a root mean squared error of prediction of 0.90 degreesC and a maximum bias of 0.59 degreesC (both based on leave-one-out cross-validation) which is lower than chironomid-temperature inference models developed in Canada, Switzerland and Finland. However, while temperature-inference models perform well in the Lateglacial, the more subtle climatic changes of the Holocene are more difficult to reconstruct because the likely temperature changes are close to the limits of the prediction errors of the existing models. To address this problem, future work is required to refine and develop the calibration set by further improving taxonomic resolution, by adding more lakes to the calibration set and by investigating the influence of other environmental variables on chironomid distributions and abundances.

AB The relevance of the work is due to insufficient observational data on small watercourses required for climate change monitoring, dangerous hydrological phenomena forecast, culvert installations calculation and efficient exploitation of micro-hydro power plants.
   The main aim of the study: to justify the choice of optimum methods of automated water runoff accounting and hydrological and climate information collecting for modeling the dynamics of water-balance elements, as well as, to ensure an adaptive land management and the needs of hydrological and geochemical monitoring.
   The methods used in the study. Of all the elements of water balance it is the surface water runoff that is most accurately measured, reflecting the current active layer moisture on a small watershed. Instruments (designed and manufactured at the Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems of SB RAS) for the automatic monitoring of water level, of soil, water and air temperatures were established on three small catchments in the diverse climatic conditions. Model watersheds are located in a zone of oligotrophic swamps of southern taiga, in a zone of frost mound bog of forest tundra and mountain zone of southern taiga. Various methods of hydraulic calculations were used for water runoff account: the first one for free over fall round in section broadcrested weir, the second one for uniform motion in natural channels, the third one for the triangular weir with partial drowned downstream. To determine the surface roughness of a certain water flow the measurements of the flow were performed by means of a hydrometric method (current meter) or a volumetric method for low water discharge. The measurements of a level and other meteorological parameters were carried out with an interval of 1:00 and were saved in the control unit.

AB Previous research showed that anaerobic respiration using iron (Fe) oxides as terminal electron acceptor contributed substantially to ecosystem respiration (ER) in a drained thaw lake basin (DTLB) on the Arctic coastal plain. As DTLBs age, the surface organic layer thickens, progressively burying the Fe-rich mineral layers. We therefore hypothesized that Fe(III) availability and Fe reduction would decline with basin age. We studied four DTLBs across an age gradient, comparing seasonal changes in the oxidation state of dissolved and extractable Fe pools and the estimated contribution of Fe reduction to ER. The organic layer thickness did not strictly increase with age for these four sites, though soil Fe levels decreased with increasing organic layer thickness. However, there were surprisingly high levels of Fe minerals in organic layers, especially in the ancient basin where cryoturbation may have transported Fe upward through the profile. Net reduction of Fe oxides occurred in the latter half of the summer and contributed an estimated 40-45% to ecosystem respiration in the sites with the thickest organic layers and 61-63% in the sites with the thinnest organic layers. All sites had high concentrations of soluble Fe(II) and Fe(III), explained by the presence of siderophores, and this pool became progressively more reduced during the first half of the summer. Redox titrations with humic acid (HA) extracts and chelated Fe support our view that this pattern indicates the reduction of HA during this interval. We conclude that Fe(III) and HA reductions contribute broadly to ER in the Arctic coastal plain.

AB Tundra ecosystem is of importance for its high accumulation of organic carbon and vulnerability to future climate change. Microorganisms play a key role in carbon dynamics of the tundra ecosystem by mineralizing organic carbon. We assessed both ecosystem process rates and community structure of Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi in different soil layers (surface organic layer and subsurface mineral soil) in an Arctic soil ecosystem located at Spitsbergen, Svalbard during the summer of 2008 by using biochemical and molecular analyses, such as enzymatic assay, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and pyrosequencing. Activity of hydrolytic enzymes showed difference according to soil type. For all three microbial communities, the average gene copy number did not significantly differ between soil types. However, archaeal diversities appeared to differ according to soil type, whereas bacterial and fungal diversity indices did not show any variation. Correlation analysis between biogeochemical and microbial parameters exhibited a discriminating pattern according to microbial or soil types. Analysis of the microbial community structure showed that bacterial and archaeal communities have different profiles with unique phylotypes in terms of soil types. Water content and hydrolytic enzymes were found to be related with the structure of bacterial and archaeal communities, whereas soil organic matter (SOM) and total organic carbon (TOC) were related with bacterial communities. The overall results of this study indicate that microbial enzyme activity were generally higher in the organic layer than in mineral soils and that bacterial and archaeal communities differed between the organic layer and mineral soils in the Arctic region. Compared to mineral soil, peat-covered organic layer may represent a hotspot for secondary productivity and nutrient cycling in this ecosystem.

AB Wetlands contribute considerably to the global greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. In these ecosystems, groundwater level (GWL) and temperature, two factors likely to be altered by climate change, exert important control over CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes. However, little is known about the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of the combined GHG emissions from hydromorphic soils and how this Q(10) varies with GWL. We performed a greenhouse experiment in which three different (plant-free) hydromorphic soils from a temperate spruce forest were exposed to two GWLs (an intermediate GWL of -20 cm and a high GWL of -5 cm). Net CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured continuously. Here, we discuss how these fluxes responded to synoptic temperature fluctuations. Across all soils and GWLs, CO2 emissions responded similarly to temperature and Q(10) was close to 2. The Q(10) of the CH4 and N2O fluxes also was similar across soil types. GWL, on the other hand, significantly affected the Q(10) of both CH4 and N2O emissions. The Q(10) of the net CH4 fluxes increased from about 1 at GWL = -20 cm to 3 at GWL = -5 cm. For the N2O emissions, Q(10) varied around 2 for GWL = -20 cm and around 4 for GWL = -5 cm. This substantial GWL-effect on the Q(10) of CH4 and N2O emissions was, however, hardly reflected in the Q(10) of the total GHG emissions (which varied around 2), because the contribution of these gases was relatively small compared to that of CO2.

AB The occurrence of permafrost in bedrock in northern Fennoscandia and its dependence on past and presently ongoing climatic variations was investigated with one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) numerical models by solving the transient heat conduction equation with latent heat effects included. The study area is characterized by discontinuous permafrost occurrences such as palsa mires and local mountain permafrost. The ground temperature changes during the Holocene were constructed using climatic proxy data. This variation was used as a forcing function at the ground surface in the calculations. Several versions of the present ground temperature were applied, resulting in different subsurface freezing-thawing conditions in the past depending on the assumed porosity and geothermal conditions.
   Our results suggest that in high altitude areas with a cold climate (present mean annual ground temperature between 0 degreesC and -3 degreesC), there may have been considerable variations in permafrost thickness (ranging from 0 to 150 m), as well as periods of no permafrost at all. The higher is the porosity of bedrock filled with ice, the stronger is the retarding effect of permafrost against climatic variations.
   Two-dimensional models including topographic effects with altitude-dependent ground temperatures and slope orientation and inclination dependent solar radiation were applied to a case of mountain permafrost in Yllas, western Finnish Lapland, where bedrock permafrost is known to occur in boreholes to a depth of about 60 m. Modelling suggests complicated changes in permafrost thickness with time as well as contrasting situations on southern and northern slopes of the mountain.
   Extrapolating the climatic warming of the last 200 years to the end of the next century when the anticipated increase in the annual average air temperature is expected to be about 2 K indicates that the permafrost occurrences in bedrock in northern Fennoscandia would be thawing rapidly in low-porosity formations. However, already a porosity of 5% filled with ice would retard the thawing considerably. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An abrupt cold event ca. 8200 cal.yr BP, is believed to have been caused by the catastrophic release of ice-dammed meltwater from Lake Agassiz and associated disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Previous reviews have highlighted both the "ideal" nature of the 8200 yr event as a target for numerical model validation and the likely geographical restriction of the ensuing cold event to the circum-North Atlantic region but have cited a lack of sufficiently resolved palaeoclimatic records to test this hypothesis. We review the current set of high-resolution stable isotope records from multiple archives (lake, bog, marine and ice cores) in the North Atlantic region for the period 9200-7400 yr BP (present = AD 1950). The isotopic values of terrestrial records are closely linked to isotopic values of palaeoprecipitation. All sites provided evidence for at least one centennial-scale anomaly (beginning similar to 8500-8250 yr BP) that exceeded background variability. No evidence for spatial or temporal transgression of the isotope anomalies was identified, implying that a simultaneous climate signal was observed in the circum-North Atlantic region. Comparison with new simulations using the UK Hadley Centre model HadCM3, which was isotope-enabled to simulate changes in the stable isotope composition of precipitation and forced by freshwater input ("hosing") of 5 Sverdrups (Sv) (0.005 km(3)/s), for 1 yr, indicated agreement with the observed decrease in the amplitude of the isotope anomaly with distance from the NW North Atlantic. The model-simulated duration of the event, however, was consistently shorter than that observed in palaeoclimatic records. A review of evidence for forcing additional to the catastrophic release of meltwater from Lake Agassiz (solar variability, sea-ice feedback and longer-term meltwater history) suggested that reduced solar output did not directly coincide with the 8200 yr event, but that a more complex history of meltwater discharges and sea-ice feedback may have conditioned the AMOC for sustained climatic impact.

AB Forests in Europe are changing due to interactions between climate change, nitrogen (N) deposition and new forest management practices. The concurrent impact on the forest greenhouse gas (GHG) balance is at present difficult to predict due to a lack of knowledge on controlling factors of GHG fluxes and response to changes in these factors. To improve the mechanistic understanding of the ongoing changes, we studied the response of soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) at twelve experimental or natural gradient forest sites, representing anticipated future forest change. The experimental manipulations, one or more per site, included N addition (4 sites), changes of climate (temperature, 1 site; precipitation, 2 sites), soil hydrology (3 sites), harvest intensity (1 site), wood ash fertilisation (1 site), pH gradient in organic soil (1 site) and afforestation of cropland (1 site).
   On average, N2O emissions increased by 0.06+/-0.03 (range 0-0.3) g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) across all treatments on mineral soils, but the increase was up to 10 times higher in an acidic organic soil. Soil moisture together with mineral soil C/N ratio and pH were found to significantly influence N2O emissions across all treatments. Emissions were increased by elevated N deposition, especially in interaction with increased soil moisture. High pH reduced the formation of N2O, even under otherwise favourable soil conditions.
   Oxidation (uptake) of CH4 was on average reduced from 0.16+/-0.02 to 0.04+/-0.05 g CH4-Cm-2 yr(-1) by the investigated treatments. The CH4 exchange was significantly influenced by soil moisture and soil C/N ratio across all treatments, and CH4 emissions occurred only in wet or water-saturated conditions.
   For most of the investigated forest manipulations or natural gradients, the response of both N2O and CH4 fluxes was towards reducing the overall GHG forest sink. The most resilient forests were dry Mediterranean forests, as well as forests with high soil C/N ratio or high soil pH. Mitigation strategies may focus on (i) sustainable management of wet forest areas and forested peatlands, (ii) continuous forest cover management, (iii) reducing atmospheric N input and, thus, N availability, and (iv) improving neutralisation capacity of acid soils (e.g. wood ash application).

AB To determine the sum of 'direct' and 'indirect' effects of climatic change on enchytraeid activity and C fluxes from an organic soil we assessed the influence of temperature (4, 10 and 15 degreesC incubations) on enchytraeid populations and Soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes over 116 days. Moisture was maintained at 60% of soil dry weight during the experimental period and measurements of enchytraeid biomass and numbers, and CO2 and CH4 fluxes were made after 3, 16, 33, 44, 65, 86 and 116 days. Enchytraeid population numbers and biomass increased in all temperature treatments with the greatest increase produced at 15 degreesC (to over threefold initial values by day 86). Results also showed that enchytraeid activity increased CO2 fluxes by 10.7 +/- 4.5, 3.4 +/- 4.0 and 26.8 +/- 2.6% in 4, 10 and 15 degreesC treatments, respectively, with the greatest CO, production observed at 15 degreesC for the entire 116 day incubation period (P < 0.05). The soil respiratory quotient analyses at lower temperatures (i.e. 4-10 degreesC) gave a Q(10) of 1.7 and 1.9 with and without enchytraeids, respectively. At temperatures above 10 degreesC (i.e. 10-15 degreesC) Q10 significantly increased (P<0.01) and was 25% greater in the presence of enchytraeids (Q(10)=3.4) than without (Q(10)=2.6). In contrast to CO, production, no significant relationships were observed between net CH4 fluxes and temperature and only time showed a significant effect on CH4 production (P<0.01).
   Total soil CO2 production was positively linked with enchytraeid biomass and mean Soil CO2-C production was 77.01 +/- 6.05 CO2-C mug mg enchytraeid tissue(-1) day(-1) irrespective of temperature treatment. This positive relationship was used to build a two step regression model to estimate the effects of temperature on enchytraeid biomass and Soil CO2 respiration in the field. Predictions of potential CO2 production were made using enchytraeid biomass data obtained in the field from two upland grassland sites (Sourhope and Great Dun Fell at the Moor House Nature Reserve, both in the UK). The findings of this work suggest that a 5 degreesC increase in atmospheric temperature above mean ambient temperature could have the potential to produce a significant increase in enchytraeid biomass resulting in a near twofold increase in soil CO2 release from both soil types. The interaction between temperature and soil biology will clearly be an important determinant of soil respiration responses to global warming. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new Late glacial-Holocene palaeoenvironmental record from near Lago Lynch (53 degrees 54'S, 69 degrees 26'W), Tierra del Fuego is presented. The record was sampled from a mire located within the deciduous Nothofagus forest-steppe ecotone and pollen and spore analysis suggest a high degree of vulnerability of past vegetation to changes in effective moisture. AMS radiocarbon dating supplemented by the application of tephrochronology including the geochemical fingerprinting of six visible and cryptotephra layers provides robust age constraint. The Lago Lynch record commences at c.15.6 ka. The sequence of vegetation changes between c.15.6 and 14.4 ka reflect a gradual increase in temperature and humidity followed by a colder interval between c.14.4 and 13.3 ka, which is broadly coeval with the Antarctic Cold Reversal. After c.13.3 ka patches of Nothofagus forest appeared, suggesting more mesic-temperate conditions leading gradually to the establishment of an open-canopy Nothofagus forest by c.12.5 ka which marks the start of the Holocene. Moderate to strong effective moisture levels dominated during the early Holocene until c.11.0 ka, followed by a sustained period (c.11.0-6.5 ka) of drier climatic conditions, particularly two arid phases at c.10.5-10.0 ka and 8.5-6.5 ka. An eastwards expansion of the forest margin after c.6.5 ka at the site suggests a return to more humid conditions during the late Holocene. We argue that the periods of increased moisture and aridity inferred from Lago Lynch closely reflect the extent to which the southern westerly winds (SWWs) push eastwards to the drier regions of Fuego-Patagonia during the Holocene. The longitudinal variations in moisture are driven by the nature and timing of latitudinal shifts in the SWWs. More significantly the vulnerability of the forest-steppe ecotone to moisture changes amplifies the ecological impact of relatively small-scale shifts in the SWWs.

   TRENDS
AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from many catchments in Europe and North-America are steadily increasing. Several studies have sought to explain this observation. As possible causes, a decrease in acid rain or sulfate deposition, concomitant reductions in ionic strength and increasing temperatures were identified. DOC often originates from riparian wetlands; but here, despite higher DOC concentrations, ionic strength in pore waters usually exceeds that in surface waters. In the catchment under study, DOC concentrations were synchronous with dissolved iron concentrations in pore and stream water. This study aims at testing the hypothesis that DOC exports are mediated by iron reduction/oxidation cycles. Following the observed hydrographs, delta O-18 of water and DOC fluorescence, the wetlands were identified as the main source of DOC. Antecedent biogeochemical conditions, i.e., water table levels in the wetlands, influenced the discharge patterns of nitrate, iron and DOC during an event. The correlation of DOC with pH was positive in pore waters, but negative in surface waters; it was negative for DOC with sulfate in pore waters, but only weak in surface waters. Though, the positive correlation of DOC with iron was universal for pore and surface water. The decline of DOC and iron concentrations in transition from anoxic wetland pore water to oxic stream water suggests a flocculation of DOC with oxidising iron, leading to a drop in pH in the stream during high DOC fluxes. The pore water did not per se differ in pH. There is, thus, a need to consider processes more thoroughly of DOC mobilisation in wetlands when interpreting DOC exports from catchments. The coupling of DOC with iron fluxes suggested that increased DOC exports could at least, in part, be caused by increasing activities in iron reduction, possibly due to increases in temperature, increasing wetness of riparian wetlands, or by a shift from sulfate dominated to iron reduction dominated biogeochemical regimes.

AB Understanding relations between climate and pollen production is important for several societal and ecological challenges, importantly pollen forecasting for pollinosis treatment, forensic studies, global change biology, and high-resolution palaeoecological studies of past vegetation and climate fluctuations. For these purposes, we investigate the role of climate variables on annual-scale variations in pollen influx, test the regional consistency of observed patterns, and evaluate the potential to reconstruct high-frequency signals from sediment archives. A 43-year pollen-trap record from the Netherlands is used to investigate relations between annual pollen influx, climate variables (monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation values), and the North Atlantic Oscillation climate index. Spearman rank correlation analysis shows that specifically in Alnus, Betula, Corylus, Fraxinus, Quercus and Plantago both temperature in the year prior to (T-1), as well as in the growing season (T), are highly significant factors (T-April r(s) between 0.30 [P<0.05[ and 0.58 [P<0.0001]; TJuli-1 rs between 0.32 [P<0.05[and 0.56 [P<0.0001]) in the annual pollen influx of wind-pollinated plants. Total annual pollen prediction models based on multiple climate variables yield R-2 between 0.38 and 0.62 (P<0.0001). The effect of precipitation is minimal. A second trapping station in the SE Netherlands, shows consistent trends and annual variability, suggesting the climate factors are regionally relevant. Summer temperature is thought to influence the formation of reproductive structures, while temperature during the flowering season influences pollen release. This study provides a first predictive model for seasonal pollen forecasting, and also aides forensic studies. Furthermore, variations in pollen accumulation rates from a sub-fossil peat deposit are comparable with the pollen trap data. This suggests that high frequency variability pollen records from natural archives reflect annual past climate variability, and can be used in palaeoecological and -climatological studies to bridge between population- and species-scale responses to climate forcing.

AB Permafrost occurs mainly at high latitudes and is currently subjected to widespread thawing due to global warming, which has significant ecological and socio-economic impacts. One way to map permafrost condition and its change at high spatial resolution is to calculate soil temperatures using a process-based permafrost model, such as the Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST) model, based on remote-sensing data. In a previous paper (Ou et al. 2015), we showed that the NEST model can be used to model soil temperatures, frozen depth, and active layer thickness in a warm and discontinuous permafrost area that is located in the Hudson Bay Lowlands in northern Ontario, Canada. In this article, we applied the model over the whole study area to map the distribution of permafrost conditions and their changes from the 1960s to the 2000s at high spatial resolution. Some of the model inputs were estimated based on land-cover and surficial material maps derived from Landsat-5 TM and Radarsat-2 SAR C-HH and C-HV images. By comparison to field observations, we were able to achieve an average mapping accuracy of 99% for both the land-cover and surficial material maps, when both Landsat and Radarsat-2 images were used. In addition, all the 49 field-observed treed and shrub permafrost landform sites found in the study area were correctly identified on the classified image. This spatial modelling study shows that permafrost currently underlies about 9.4% of the land in this area, and varies significantly among land-cover types. With the increases in mean annual air temperature (1.9 degrees C) and precipitation (2.4%) from the 1960s to the 2000s, the model results show a deepening of active layer by 20.5%. However, the permafrost has persisted in most of the area due to the protection of thick peat. The modelled permafrost extent reduced only from 9.8% to 9.4%.

AB Climate change especially moisture condition in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan in China are mainly controlled by the strength and variability of Asian winter and summer monsoon. In this paper, we presented the climate record and related winter and summer monsoonal history in Gonghe Basin, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, based on the geochemical indicators (geochemical elements content, i.e., Fe2O3, CaO, Zr and Sr content;and geochemical parameters, i.e., the chemical index of alteration (CIA), Zr/Rb, Rb/Sr, CaO/MgO, SiO2/TiO2 and SiO2/(Al2O3 + Fe2O3) ratio) of the peat deposits and C-14 and OSL technologies. The regional temperature and humidity gradually increased in 10.0-8.5 cal ka BP, accompanied by enhanced summer monsoonal strength and decreased winter monsoonal strength. But climate became cold and dry between 8.5 cal ka BP and 7.6 cal ka BP owing to the stronger winter monsoon. During the 7.6-3.8 cal ka BP, stronger summer monsoon and weaker winter monsoon led to an optimal warm and humid condition, although it had several cold phases. From 3.8 cal ka BP to 0.5 cal ka BP, the regional climate tended to be cold and dry, with increasing winter monsoonal strength and decreasing summer monsoonal strength. Thereafter, the relatively warm and humid climate appeared again, due to the stronger summer monsoon. That is to say, the regional climate conditions are mainly related to the winter and summer monsoonal changes. These changes are consistent with palaeoclimatic records (monsoonal model) from the region influenced by the Asian monsoon in eastern China. In addition, nine cold events were recorded: 8.5-7.8 cal ka BP, 6.1-5.6 cal ka BP, 5.2-4.8 cal ka BP, 4.7-4.3 cal ka BP, 4.1-4.0 cal ka BP, 3.8-3.4 cal ka BP, 3.0-2.3 cal ka BP, 1.4-1.3 cal ka BP, and 1.0-0.5 cal ka BP, which are coincident with cold fluctuations in the high and low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere on a millennial scale, as recorded by lakes, peat sediments, and ice cores in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In conclusion, Holocene millennial-scale climatic changes in Gonghe Basin were controlled by the dual function of Asian monsoonal changes and global cold fluctuations.

AB The magnitude and acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions from warming Arctic tundra soil is an important part of the Region's influence on the Earth's climate system. We investigated the links between soil carbon stocks, soil organic matter decomposition, vegetation heterogeneity, temperature, and environmental sensitivities in dwarf shrub tundra near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. We quantified carbon stocks of forty-two soil profiles using bulk density estimates based on previous studies in the region. The soil profiles were located within six vegetation types at nine study sites, distributed across an environmental gradient. We also monitored air and soil temperature and measured in situ soil respiration to quantify variation in carbon flux between vegetation types. For spatial extrapolation, we created a high-resolution land cover classification map of the study area. Aside from a single soil profile taken from a fen soil (54.55 kg C m(-2); 2.13 kg N m(-2)), the highest carbon stocks were found in wet grassland soils (mean, 95% CI: 34.87 kg C m(-2), [27.30, 44.55]). These same grassland soils also had the highest mid-growing-season soil respiration rates. Our estimation of soil carbon stocks and mid-growing-season soil respiration measurements indicate that grassland soils are a "hot spot" for soil carbon storage and soil carbon dioxide efflux. Even though shrub, steppe, and mixed vegetation had lower average soil carbon stocks (14.66 - 20.17 kg C m(-2)), these vegetation types played an important role in carbon cycling at the landscape scale because they cover approximately 50 percent of the terrestrial landscape and store approximately 68 percent of the landscape soil organic carbon. The heterogeneous soil carbon stocks in this landscape may be sensitive to key environmental changes, such as shrub expansion and climate change. These environmental drivers could possibly result in a trend toward decreased soil carbon storage and increased release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

AB Climate, atmospheric pCO(2), and fire all may exert major influences on the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 grasses in the present-day vegetation. However, the relative role of these factors in driving variation in C-3 and C-4 grass abundances in the paleorecord is uncertain, and C-4 abundance is often interpreted narrowly as a proxy indicator of aridity or pCO(2). We measured delta C-13 values of individual grains of grass (Poaceae) pollen in the sediments of two sites in southeastern Australia to assess changes in the proportions of C-3 and C-4 grasses during the past 25,000 years. These data were compared with shifts in pCO(2), temperature, moisture balance, and fire to assess how these factors were related to long-term variation of C-4 grass abundance during the late Quaternary. At Caledonia Fen, a high-elevation site in the Snowy Mountains, C-4 grass abundance decreased from an average of 66% during the glacial period to 11% during the Holocene, primarily in response to increased pCO(2) and temperature. In contrast, this pattern did not exist in low-elevation savannah woodlands around tower Hill Northwest Crater, where C-4 grass abundance instead varied in response to shifts in regional aridity. Fire did not appear to have strongly influenced the proportions of C-3 and C-4 grasses on the landscape at millennial timescales at either site. These patterns are similar to those of a recent study in East Africa, suggesting that elevation-related climatic differences influence how the abundance of C-3 and C-4 grasses responds to shifts in climate and pCO(2). These results caution against using C-4 plant abundance as a proxy indicator of either climate or pCO(2) without an adequate understanding of key controlling factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Permafrost presence is determined by a complex interaction of climatic, topographic, and ecological conditions operating over long time scales. In particular, vegetation and organic layer characteristics may act to protect permafrost in regions with a mean annual air temperature (MAAT) above 0 degrees C. In this study, we document the presence of residual permafrost plateaus in the western Kenai Peninsula lowlands of south-central Alaska, a region with a MAAT of 1.5 +/- 1 degrees C (1981-2010). Continuous ground temperature measurements between 16 September 2012 and 15 September 2015, using calibrated thermistor strings, documented the presence of warm permafrost (0.04 to 0.08 degrees C). Field measurements (probing) on several plateau features during the fall of 2015 showed that the depth to the permafrost table averaged 1.48m but at some locations was as shallow as 0.53 m. Late winter surveys (augering, coring, and GPR) in 2016 showed that the average seasonally frozen ground thickness was 0.45 m, overlying a talik above the permafrost table. Measured permafrost thickness ranged from 0.33 to >6.90 m. Manual interpretation of historic aerial photography acquired in 1950 indicates that residual permafrost plateaus covered 920 ha as mapped across portions of four wetland complexes encompassing 4810 ha. However, between 1950 and ca. 2010, permafrost plateau extent decreased by 60.0 %, with lateral feature degradation accounting for 85.0% of the reduction in area. Permafrost loss on the Kenai Peninsula is likely associated with a warming climate, wildfires that remove the protective forest and organic layer cover, groundwater flow at depth, and lateral heat transfer from wetland surface waters in the summer. Better understanding the resilience and vulnerability of ecosystem-protected permafrost is critical for mapping and predicting future permafrost extent and degradation across all permafrost regions that are currently warming. Further work should focus on reconstructing permafrost history in south-central Alaska as well as additional contemporary observations of these ecosystem-protected permafrost sites south of the regions with relatively stable permafrost.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from plants have substantial effects on atmospheric chemistry/physics and feedbacks on ecosystem function. The on-going climate change and anthropogenic disturbance have been confirmed to cause the evident degradation of grassland with shift of plant community, and hence BVOCs emissions were suspected to be altered due to the different BOVCs emission potentials of different species. In this study, we investigated BVOCs concentration above ground surface during growing season in a degraded semi-arid grassland (41 degrees 2'N-45 degrees 6'N, 113 degrees 5'-117 degrees 8') in Inner Mongolia. The observed monoterpenes' concentrations varied from 0.10 to 215.78 mu gm(-3) (34.88 +/- 9.73 mu gm(-3) in average) across 41 sites. Compared to non-degraded grassland, concentrations of monoterpenes were about 180 times higher at the sites dominated by subshrub - Artemisia frigida, a preponderant species under drought stress and over-grazing. The biomass of A. frigida explained 51.39% of the variation of monoterpenes' concentrations. a-pinene, beta-pinene and gamma-terpinene dominated in the 10 determined monoterpenes, accounting for 37.72 +/- 2.98%, 14.65 +/- 2.55% and 10.50 +/- 2.37% of the total monoterpenes concentration, respectively. Low isoprene concentrations (<= 3.25 mu g m(-3)) were found and sedge biomass contributed about 51.76% to their spatial variation. alpha-pinene and isoprene emissions at noon were as high as 515.53 +/- 88.34 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and 7606.19 +/- 1073.94 mu g m(-2)h(-1) in A. frigida- and sedge-dominated areas where their biomass were 236.90 g m(-2) and 72.37 g m(-2), respectively. Our results suggested that the expansion of A. frigida and sedge caused by over-grazing and climatic stresses may increase local ambient BVOCs concentration in grassland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau are an important indicator of climate change. Automatic glacier facies mapping utilizing remote sensing data is challenging due to the spectral similarity of supraglacial debris and the adjacent bedrock. Most of the available glacier datasets do not provide the boundary of clean ice and debris-covered glacier facies, while debris-covered glacier facies play a key role in mass balance research. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic algorithm to distinguish ice cover types based on multi-temporal satellite data, and the algorithm was implemented in a subregion of the Parlung Zangbo basin in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The classification method was built upon an automated machine learning approach: Random Forest in combination with the analysis of topographic and textural features based on Landsat-8 imagery and multiple digital elevation model (DEM) data. Very high spatial resolution Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) Panchromatic and Multi-Spectral (PMS) imagery was used to select training samples and validate the classification results. In this study, all of the land cover types were classified with overall good performance using the proposed method. The results indicated that fully debris-covered glaciers accounted for approximately 20.7% of the total glacier area in this region and were mainly distributed at elevations between 4600 m and 4800 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Additionally, an analysis of the results clearly revealed that the proportion of small size glaciers (<1 km(2)) were 88.3% distributed at lower elevations compared to larger size glaciers (1 km(2)). In addition, the majority of glaciers (both in terms of glacier number and area) were characterized by a mean slope ranging between 20 degrees and 30 degrees, and 42.1% of glaciers had a northeast and north orientation in the Parlung Zangbo basin.

AB The lake-rich glacial landscapes of north-eastern central Europe play an important role in the preservation and use of water resources, including protection of biodiversity, carbon storage and promotion of tourism. With a view to the last c. 20 years and the future, a regional 'syndrome of water shortage' has been frequently stated, which impairs particularly peatlands, flowing waters and lakes. Accordingly, the overall question addressed in this study is: What can regional and local gauging records tell us about decadal hydrological changes of lakes and their catchments? In the study area, most of the gauging records of lakes begin only in the late 1990s. Forty-five lake-level records were analysed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering, looking for the trend in the 1999-2008 time window. The analyses show that lake levels had varying dynamics, namely a negative, unclear or even a positive trend. The proportional shares of these three groups are 23 (51 %) to 15 (34 %) to 7 lakes (15 %), respectively. In group 1, largely groundwater-fed lakes, lake-level changes depend on groundwater-level changes. These are controlled by decreasing groundwater recharge in the catchments, which are caused by specific seasonal weather conditions in the observation period, and the impact of the dominating pine forests, which consume high quantities of water. In group 2, mainly stream lakes, direct human impact drives the lake levels through the management of weirs and ground sills. Nearly all lakes in group 3, consisting of river, stream and spring lakes, were subject to impoundment measures initiated by local rewetting projects. Thus, an important finding with respect to the impact of climate and land use is the fact that the ('natural') lakes of the region, primarily fed by groundwater and precipitation, show a predominantly negative lake-level trend in the period studied. Beyond the 10-year-time window analysed, further regional data show that periodic lake-level fluctuations with amplitudes of c. 1-2(-3) m are characteristic for regional groundwater-fed lakes.

AB Many regions around the world experienced abrupt climate change with far-reaching societal and environmental effects at ca. 4.2 cal. ka BP. As one of the most distinct climatic events of the last 11.7 ka, it has been used to establish the formal boundary between the mid- and late-Holocene. Although the 4.2 ka event was not pronounced in East-Central Europe, its exact impact on the area has yet to be evaluated. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to reconstruct the functioning of the selected lake and terrestrial ecosystems from northern Poland around the time of the 4.2 ka event, and (2) to disentangle the drivers of the recorded environmental changes (local factors vs. climate impact). We studied the sedimentary record of Lake Spore, focusing on the period between 3.8 and 4.5 cal. ka BP using numerous biotic and abiotic proxies, such as chironomids, cladocerans, pollen and spores, delta C-13(org), delta N-1(5)org, delta O-18(carb), delta C-13(carb), TOC/N, Fe, S, LOI550, and LOI950. The chironomid-derived reconstruction of mean July air temperature did not change during the 4.2 ka event. Pollen accumulation rate (PAR) data showed lower pollen production of some tree taxa during the period 4.0-4.25 cal. ka BP that is consistent with low PARs recorded for the corresponding period in the sediments of nearby (similar to 75 km) Lake Suminko. This change might have occurred due to either regional-scale forest disturbance or cooler winters resulting from an exceptionally strong Siberian High during the 4.2 ka event. Distinct peaks of Fe and delta C-13(carb) at 4.2 cal. ka BP likely record a pulse of podzolization. Although soil transformation processes were common in East-Central Europe after ca. 5 cal. ka BP due to general climate cooling, they could have been enhanced at Lake Spore during the 4.2 ka event, if winters were more severe. The delta C-13(org), delta N-15(org), TOC/N and delta O-1(8)carb records point to a water level rise after 4.2 cal. ka BP that most likely resulted from soil transformation in the catchment, not a change in effective precipitation. The composition of the terrestrial vegetation and the lake fauna and flora remained largely unaffected by the 4.2 ka event.

AB The individual effects of either elevated CO2 or N deposition on soil microbial communities have been widely studied, but limited information is available regarding the responses of the bacteria, fungi, and archaea communities to both elevated CO2 and N in wetland ecosystems with different types of plants. Using a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR), we compared communities of bacteria, fungi, and archaea in a marsh microcosm with one of seven macrophytes, Typha latifolia, Phragmites japonica, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Scirpus lacustris, Juncus effusus, Phragmites australis, or Zizania latifolia, after exposing them to eCO(2) and/or amended N for 110 days. Overall, our results showed that the elevated CO2 and N may affect the bacterial and archaeal communities, while they may not affect the fungal community in terms of both diversity and abundance. The effects of elevated CO2 and N on microbial community vary depending on the plant types, and each microbial community shows different responses to the elevated CO2 and N. In particular, elevated CO2 might force a shift in the archaeal community irrespective of the plant type, and the effect of elevated CO2 was enhanced when combined with the N effect. This study indicates that elevated CO2 and N addition could lead to changes in the community structures of bacteria and archaea. Our results also suggest that the fungal group is less sensitive to external changes, while the bacterial and archaeal groups are more sensitive to them. Finally, the characteristics of the plant type and relevant physicochemical factors induced by the elevated CO2 and N may be important key factors structuring the microbial community's response to environmental change, which implies the need for a more comprehensive approach to understanding the pattern of the wetland response to climate change.

AB High Altitude Wetlands of the Andes (HAWA) belong to a unique type of wetland within the semi-arid high Andean region. Knowledge about HAWA has been derived mainly from studies at single sites within different parts of the Andes at only small time scales. On the one hand, HAWA depend on water provided by glacier streams, snow melt or precipitation. On the other hand, they are suspected to influence hydrology through water retention and vegetation growth altering stream flow velocity. We derived HAWA land cover from satellite data at regional scale and analysed changes in connection with precipitation over the last decade. Perennial and temporal HAWA subtypes can be distinguished by seasonal changes of photosynthetically active vegetation (PAV) indicating the perennial or temporal availability of water during the year. HAWA have been delineated within a region of 12 800 km(2) situated in the Northwest of Lake Titicaca. The multi-temporal classification method used Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Differenced Infrared Index (NDII) data derived from two Landsat ETM+ scenes at the end of austral winter (September 2000) and at the end of austral summer (May 2001). The mapping result indicates an unexpected high abundance of HAWA covering about 800 km(2) of the study region (6 %). Annual HAWA mapping was computed using NDVI 16-day composites of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Analyses on the relation between HAWA and precipitation was based on monthly precipitation data of the Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM 3B43) and MODIS Eight Day Maximum Snow Extent data (MOD10A2) from 2000 to 2010. We found HAWA subtype specific dependencies on precipitation conditions. A strong relation exists between perennial HAWA and snow fall (r(2): 0.82) in dry austral winter months (June to August) and between temporal HAWA and precipitation (r(2): 0.75) during austral summer (March to May). Annual changes in spatial extend of perennial HAWA indicate alterations in annual water supply generated from snow melt.

AB Premise of research. Sphagnum peatmosses strongly influence local and regional hydrology and biotic communities and based on high abundance at high latitudes also play a global environmental role in maintaining atmospheric chemistry and climate homeostasis. Previous field research suggests that elevated temperature linked to global climate change or elevated UV related to ozone depletion at high latitudes affects aspects of peatmoss productivity or external morphology hypothesized to influence environmental roles. However, changes in microscopic anatomy or potential temperature-UV interaction effects have not previously been investigated. Controlled environments offer advantages for assessing anatomical impacts of temperature and UV variation and detecting temperature-UV interactions.
   Methodology. Clonal cultures of experimentally tractable Sphagnum compactum were treated for a 2-mo period with environmentally relevant temperature levels (10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees C) and two levels of UV-A + UV-B found in a pilot study to produce contrasting structural effects, in a factorial experimental design. Proportions of hydrolysis-resistant and cellulosic biomass and numerous features of microscopic anatomy having potential ecological significance were assessed and analyzed using two-way ANOVA.
   Pivotal results. Elevated temperature, the higher level of UV treatment, or temperature-UV interaction significantly influenced survival, biomass, cell wall biochemistry, or anatomical features of ecological significance. Plants grown at 10 degrees or 20 degrees C and under the higher level of UV treatment displayed increased proportion of hydrolysis-resistant cell wall material. Elevated temperature was associated with reduction in stem width and reduced numbers of supportive fibrils in branch and stem leaf hyaline cells. Plants exposed to 30 degrees C and the higher level of UV treatment died during the treatment period.
   Conclusions. Elevated temperature, UV, and temperature-UV interactions affect peatmoss biomass, wall chemistry, and anatomy in ways that could influence environmental roles. Functionally important traits affected by temperature or UV are recommended for assessment in field studies.

AB Aim Recent studies suggest insect declines in parts of Europe; however, the generality of these trends across different taxa and regions remains unclear. Standardized data are not available to assess large-scale, long-term changes for most insect groups but opportunistic citizen science data are widespread for some. Here, we took advantage of citizen science data to investigate distributional changes of Odonata.
   Location Germany.
   Methods We compiled over 1 million occurrence records from different regional databases. We used occupancy-detection models to account for imperfect detection and estimate annual distributions for each species during 1980-2016 within 5 x 5 km quadrants. We also compiled data on species attributes that were hypothesized to affect species' sensitivity to different drivers and related them to the changes in species' distributions. We further developed a novel approach to cluster groups of species with similar patterns of distributional change to represent multispecies indicators.
   Results More species increased (45%) than decreased (29%) or remained stable (26%) in their distribution (i.e. number of occupied quadrants). Species showing increases were generally warm-adapted species and/or running water species, while species showing decreases were cold-adapted species using standing water habitats such as bogs. Time series clustering defined five main patterns of change-each associated with a specific combination of species attributes, and confirming the key roles of species' temperature and habitat preferences. Overall, our analysis predicted that mean quadrant-level species richness has increased over most of the time period.
   Main conclusions Trends in Odonata provide mixed news-improved water quality, coupled with positive impacts of climate change, could explain the positive trends of many species. At the same time, declining species point to conservation challenges associated with habitat loss and degradation. Our study demonstrates the great value of citizen science and the work of natural history societies for assessing large-scale distributional change.

AB The optimum range of temperature for germination (96-100%) of Calamintha cretica, an herb with potential pharmaceutical and horticultural uses, was 15 to 20 degrees C, with 10 and 30 degrees C cardinal temperatures. Storage up to one year did not affect germination. The effect of zeatin (ZEA), 6-benzyladenine (BA), kinetin, and 6-gamma-gamma-(dimethylallylamino)-purine added in MS medium at concentrations from 0.0 to 8.0 mg L-1 was tested for shoot proliferation of both adult- and seedling-origin nodal explants at first- and sub-culture. Both explant types responded similarly during in vitro culture. At cytokinin concentrations up to 1 mg L-1 explant response was high (over 85%) but shoot number per explant was low (1.2-2.2). Increasing cytokinin from 2.0 to 8.0 mg L-1 resulted to an analogous decrease of explant response and shoot length, and an increase of shoot number, particularly when ZEA or BA was used (5.0-6.6 shoots per explant, 0.5-1.0 cm long) with simultaneous though increase of hyperhydricity (up to 50%). The addition of 0.1 mg L-1 naphthaleneacetic acid into the 8.0 mg L-1 BA medium almost eliminated hyperhydricity and increased explant response, while the increase of agar concentration from 8.0 to 12.0 g L-1 eliminated hyperhidricity and induced the highest shoot proliferation (93-95% explant response, 11.2-12.3 shoots per explant, 0.8-1.0 cm long). Microshoots and microshoot clusters rooted (88-96%) on half-strength MS medium either hormone free or supplemented with 1 to 4 mg L-1 indole-3-butyric acid. Plantlets survived at 80% to 100% after ex vitro acclimatization in peat: perlite 1: 1 (v/v).

AB It is increasingly recognised that widespread and substantial increases in Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in remote surface, and soil, waters in recent decades are linked to declining acid deposition. Effects of rising pH and declining ionic strength on DOC solubility have been proposed as potential dominant mechanisms. However, since DOC in these systems is derived mainly from recently-fixed carbon, and since organic matter decomposition rates are considered sensitive to temperature, uncertainty persists over the extent to which other drivers that could influence DOC production. Such potential drivers include fertilisation by nitrogen (N) and global warming. We therefore ran the dynamic soil chemistry model MADOC for a range of UK soils, for which time series data are available, to consider the likely relative importance of decreased deposition of sulphate and chloride, accumulation of reactive N, and higher temperatures, on soil DOC production in different soils. Modelled patterns of DOC change generally agreed favourably with measurements collated over 1020 years, but differed markedly between sites. While the acidifying effect of sulphur deposition appeared to be the predominant control on the observed soil water DOC trends in all the soils considered other than a blanket peat, the model suggested that over the long term, the effects of nitrogen deposition on N-limited soils may have been sufficient to raise the "acid recovery DOC baseline" significantly. In contrast, reductions in non marine chloride deposition and effects of long term warming appeared to have been relatively unimportant. The suggestion that future DOC concentrations might exceed preindustrial levels as a consequence of nitrogen pollution has important implications for drinking water catchment management and the setting and pursuit of appropriate restoration targets, but findings still require validation from reliable centennial-scale proxy records, such as those being developed using palaeolimnological techniques.

AB Peat fires in boreal and tundra regions can potentially cause a high CO2 release, because of their large soil carbon stocks. Under current and future climate warming the frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing and will cause the plant community and organic soil to become more susceptible to fire. The organic soil consumption by fire is commonly used as a proxy for fire severity and is a large source of carbon release. However, the role of organic soils in both above- and belowground fire behavior has only rarely been studied. In this study we collected soil and branches from Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies obovata from the taiga/tundra ecotone across a large spatial scale. In laboratory fire experiments we burned different fuel type combinations to examine the fire spread through fuel ladders both from branches to soil and vice versa. We found that the tree species identity influences the fire spread from branches to soil and vice versa. The combination of chemical and structural plant traits could explain the stronger interaction between soil and coniferous spruce and pine fuels in a fire ladder compared to the deciduous birch. Therefore, total carbon emission from a boreal forest fire may not only depend on burned plant fuel, but also on the species-specific potential of the trees to ignite the soil. Carbon emission models and forest management could be improved if not only the aboveground plant fuel consumption is considered, but also the interaction between fuels in a fuel ladder and the probability of soil ignition by a forest crown fire and vice versa.

AB A palaeolimnological study of the annually laminated sediment sequence of Lake Xiaolongwan, a small maar lake in northeastern China, revealed distinct diatom responses to Lateglacial and early Holocene climate change between c. 19 700 and c. 10 700 a BP. In addition to analyses of diatom assemblage composition and of the bio-volume accumulation rate of planktonic diatoms, geochemical (total nitrogen, total organic carbon) and physical (varve type and thickness) indicators were used to assess past environmental change. The diatom assemblages reveal a complex interplay between direct climate effects on the seasonal lake conditions (timing of ice cover break-up, water column mixing and thermal stratification), catchment-mediated effects on the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon and, possibly, biotic interactions between the different algal groups present in the phytoplankton of Lake Xiaolongwan (diatoms, Chrysophyceae and Dinophyceae). The most remarkable changes in the aquatic system were: (i) a sharp increase in Asterionella formosa and the collapse of Handmannia balatonis at c. 14 780 a BP, corresponding with the onset of the Bolling - Allerod interstadial; (ii) a sharp rise in Stephanodiscus minutulus at c. 12 840 a BP, marking the start of the Younger Dryas event and (iii) when the lake phytoplankton became dominated by Dinophyceae instead of diatoms at c. 11 170 a BP, after the Pre-Boreal oscillation. Two diatom assemblage zones characterize the Younger Dryas at Lake Xiaolongwan, suggesting a bipartite division of this stadial event as in several records from eastern Asia and Europe. The quasi-synchronicity of these events with the oscillations described in the North Atlantic realm demonstrates that during the Lateglacial, North Atlantic dynamics at centennial and millennial time scales had a strong control upon the climate in northeastern China.

AB Forested wetlands dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. Global climate change and in particular sea level rise will alter the frequency and magnitude of wet/dry periods and salinity levels in these ecosystems. Soil microcosm experiments were set up to identify the effects of water level variations (0.4-3.0 g-water g-soil(-1)) and salinity changes (0, 1 and 5 ppt of NaCl) on greenhouse gas emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characteristics from forested wetland soils. Our results indicate that, the effect of water level was much greater than salt intrusion on C and N cycling. Wet dry treatments significantly decreased DOC production and total CH4-C loss, aromatic and humic-like substance compounds in DOC were increased in both flooding and wet dry treatments after 60-d incubation. The molecular weight (MW) of DOC, as indicated by E2/E3 ratio and spectral slope, after flooding treatments was higher than that in wet dry treatments. A first order kinetic model showed there was a positive linear correlation (r(2) = 0.73) between CO2 emission rate and DOC concentration which indicated that CO2 was mainly generated from DOC. An exponential kinetic model was applied to describe the correlation between CH4 emission rate and DOC concentration (r(2) = 0.41). This study demonstrates that an increase in salinity, and in particular variations in wet dry cycles, will lead to changes in the formation of climate -relevant greenhouse gases, such as CH4, CO2, and N2O.

AB Increase of surface temperatures has long been recognized as an unequivocal response to radiative forcing and one of the most important implications for global warming. However, it remains unclear whether the variation of ground surface temperature (GST) and soil temperatures is consistent with simultaneous changes of the near-surface air and land (or skin) surface temperatures (T-a and LST). In this study, a seven-year continuous observation of GST, T-a, and surface water and heat exchange was carried out at an elevational permafrost site at Chalaping, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results showed a distinct retarding of warming on the ground surface and subsurface under the presence of dense vegetation and moist peat substrates. Mean annual T-a and LST increased at noteworthy rates of 0.22 and 0.32 degrees C/a, respectively, while mean annual GST increased only at a rate of 0.057 degrees C/a. No obvious trends were detected for the four radiation budgets except the soil heat flux (G), which significantly increased at a rate of 0.29 W.m(-2).a(-1), presumably inducing the melting of ground ice and resulted in much higher moisture content through the summers of 2015 and 2016 than preceding years and subsequent 2017 at the depths between 80 and 120 cm. However, no noticeable immediate variations of soil temperatures occurred owing to the large latent heat effect (thermal inertia) and the extending zero-curtain period. We suggest that a better protected eco-environment, particularly the surface vegetation, helps preserving the underlying permafrost, and thus to mitigates the potential degradation of elevational permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Soil moisture plays a vital role in regulating the direction and magnitude of methane (CH4) fluxes. However, it remains unclear whether the responses of CH4 fluxes to climate warming exhibit difference between dry and moist ecosystems. Based on standardized manipulative experiments (i.e., consistent experimental design and measurement protocols), here we explored warming effects on growing season CH4 fluxes in two alpine grasslands with contrasting water status on the Tibetan Plateau. We observed that experimental warming enhanced CH4 uptake in the relatively arid alpine steppe, but had no significant effects on CH4 emission in the moist swamp meadow. The distinct responses of CH4 fluxes were associated with the different warming effects on biotic and abiotic factors related to CH4 oxidation and production processes. Warming decreased soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and increased the pmoA gene abundance and CH4 oxidation potential in the alpine steppe, which together led to a significant increase in CH4 uptake at this alpine steppe site. However, warming-induced enhancement in CH4 oxidation potential might be counteracted by the simultaneously increased CH4 production potential in the swamp meadow, which could then result in insignificant warming effects on CH4 emission at this swamp meadow site. Based on a meta-analysis of warming effects on CH4 fluxes across the entire Tibetan Plateau, we found that the entire alpine grasslands could absorb an extra 0.042 Tg CH4 (1 Tg = 10(12) g) per growing season if soil temperature increased by 1 degrees C. These findings demonstrate that warming effects on CH4 fluxes differ between two alpine grasslands with contrasting moisture conditions and the entire alpine grasslands may not trigger a positive CH4 feedback to climate system with moderate warming.

AB Vegetation, active-layer soils, and snow cover regulate energy exchange between the atmosphere and permafrost. Therefore, interactions between changes to tundra vegetation and soil thermal regime will fundamentally affect permafrost in a warmer world. We recorded soil temperatures for approximately 1 year in a Siberian Low Arctic landscape with a known history of alder (Alnus) shrub expansion on disturbed microsites in patterned ground. We recorded near-surface soil temperatures and measured physical properties of soils and vegetation on sorted-circle microsites in four stages of shrubland development: (1) tundra lacking tall shrubs; (2) shrub colonization zones; (3) mature shrublands; and (4) paludified, long-established shrublands with thick soil organic layers. Summer soil temperatures declined with increasing shrub cover and soil organic thickness; shrub colonization suppressed cryoturbation, facilitating the development of continuous vegetation and a surface organic mat on circles. Compared to open tundra, mature shrubs cooled soils by up to 9 A degrees C during summer, but warmed soils by greater than 10 A degrees C in winter presumably because they developed highly insulative snowpacks. Paludified shrublands had the coldest summer active layers, but winter soil temperatures were much colder than mature shrublands and were similar to earlier stages. Our results indicate that although tall shrub establishment dramatically warms winter soils within decades, much of this warming is transient at paludification-prone sites because the buildup of wet peat favors cooling in winter and the stature and snow-trapping capacity of shrubs diminish over time. In the ecosystem we studied, shrub expansion has contrasting effects on active-layer temperatures both seasonally and over longer timescales due to successional processes.

AB The ORCHIDEE land surface model has recently been updated to improve the representation of high-latitude environments. The model now includes improved soil thermodynamics and the representation of permafrost physical processes (soil thawing and freezing), as well as a new snow model to improve the representation of the seasonal evolution of the snow pack and the resulting insulation effects. The model was evaluated against data from the experimental sites of the WSibIso-Megagrant project (www.wsibiso.ru). ORCHIDEE was applied in stand-alone mode, on two experimental sites located in the Yamal Peninsula in the northwestern part of Siberia. These sites are representative of circumpolar-Arctic tundra environments and differ by their respective fractions of shrub/tree cover and soil type. After performing a global sensitivity analysis to identify those parameters that have most influence on the simulation of energy and water transfers, the model was calibrated at local scale and evaluated against in situ measurements (vertical profiles of soil temperature and moisture, as well as active layer thickness) acquired during summer 2012. The results show how sensitivity analysis can identify the dominant processes and thereby reduce the parameter space for the calibration process. We also discuss the model performance at simulating the soil temperature and water content (i.e., energy and water transfers in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum) and the contribution of the vertical discretization of the hydrothermal properties. This work clearly shows, at least at the two sites used for validation, that the new ORCHIDEE vertical discretization can represent the water and heat transfers through complex cryogenic Arctic soils-soils which present multiple horizons sometimes with peat inclusions. The improved model allows us to prescribe the vertical heterogeneity of the soil hydrothermal properties.

AB Predicted climate changings can affect hemi-boreal forests especially for soil conditions with low water-holding capacity and susceptibility to soil water deficits. In our study, species-specific sap flux, transpiration and water use efficiency of growth (WUE) were investigated at a mixed hemi-boreal forest ecosystems, especially during temporary moderate dry periods in the main growing season. Therefore, two representative forest sites with different drought susceptibility were selected in Northwest-Lithuania. The aim of our investigations was to identify the responsible factors influencing transpiration and WUE from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. H. Karst.) and birch (silver birch: Betula pendula Roth. and downy birch: B. pubescens Ehrh.) during temporary drought incidents at a water-limited, oligitrophic sand dominated forest site and at a water saturated, mesoeutrophic organic peat forest site for the whole vegetation period and two moderate short-term drought incidents in 2016. During the dry periods Norway spruce trees exhibited lowest sap flux compared to Scot pine and birch while similarly showing highest WUE. Up-scaled to a virtual pure stand none of the species were differing in species specific transpiration. Thus, we found no evidence for extended drought sensitivity of Norway spruce at the water limited site during the first investigation year. Sap flux of Scots pine trees was more or less constantly high during the main growing season and the dry periods at both plots, while WUE was quite low during the "dry periods". Thus, we assume that Scots pine trees are less affected by temporarily drought events than Norway spruce. Birch trees exhibited significantly highest sap flux during dry periods at the water limited site whereas quite low WUE was not differing between sites.

AB Numerous pedogenically altered subaerial exposure surfaces within Middle-Late Mississippian (Visean-Serpukhovian) shallow carbonates in the Moscow Basin attest to sea-level fluctuations and climate change. In total, fifteen palaeosols at seven stratigraphical levels from five open pits were described and studied in detail. They show both stratigraphic and lateral soil type variability. The factors of major influence are substrate type, time of exposure (tectonics and relief), and climate. All palaeosols are polycyclic and consist of at least two parts. The lower unit (substrate), consisting mainly of limestone, with siliciclastic deltaic and palustrine beds, was altered to different degrees by weathering/pedogenesis. Depending on climate, the limestone was transformed into calcrete or caliche. The substrate is capped by a terrigeneous topclay which represents an individual palaeosol developed prior to subsequent marine flooding. Indications of gley conditions, as well as the presence of coal, sphaerosiderite and framboidal pyrite, indicate a wet peat-swamp environment that was, however, periodically dry. The calculated mean annual precipitation (MAP) based on a CIA-K proxy of siliciclastic units shows that the climate was characterized by alternating periods of aridity and humidity, with the most humid conditions (similar to 1250 mm) during the middle Visean. The same proxy applied to Late Mississippian sediments of the Appalachian Basin shows a similar MAP range. High-amplitude sea-level fluctuations at the Mikhailovian-Venevian boundary followed by prolonged exposure resulted in the development of a laterally extensive deep karst capped by a pedocomplex and then by a palustrine bed. The structure and scale of this unconformity are comparable to those of the Florida Everglades environment, which represents a modern marsh landscape. The majority of topclays are smectitic, except for the most humid and most arid environments, which are dominated by kaolinite and palygorskite, respectively. Besides mineralogy, we also provide data regarding geochemistry, carbon isotopic composition of carbonate, organic matter characteristics including solid state C-13 NMR and delta C-13 data, and evidence of vegetation types based on field observations and SEM images.

AB 1. This paper addresses the origin and development of the oldest prehistoric pasture in the timberline ecotone known so far in the Alps and its relation to anthropogenic pressure and natural climate change.
   2. Palaeoecological and geochemical techniques were applied on the Crotte Basse mire stratigraphy (2365 m a.s.l, northwestern Italy) to describe changes in vegetation composition, forest biomass, land use and fertilization between c. 6400-1800 cal years bp.
   3. Subalpine forests dominated by Pinus cembra occurred at very high-altitude up to c. 5600 cal years bp, when a sharp contraction of woody vegetation took place. This major vegetation shift is matched by increasing charcoal input and markers of pastoral/grazing activities (pollen, dung spores and forms of phosphorus) in the sediment sequence in this small basin. 4. Major phases of landscape change detected in our multiproxy record chronologically match intervals of cumulative probability density of C-14 ages from nearby archaeological sites, suggesting that human activity was the factor leading to massive landscape change from the onset of the Copper Age (c. 5600 cal years bp). The change may have been reinforced by climate variability in the period 5700-5300 cal years bp.
   5. Sensitivity of woody species to fires was statistically explored (AppendixS1, Supporting Information), revealing negative reactions of P.cembra and Betula to frequent fire episodes and positive reactions of Alnus viridis and Juniperus. Fire episodes do not affect Larix dynamics.
   6. Synthesis. Mt. Fallere provides some of the oldest and consistent evidence so far available in the Alps for major anthropogenic pressure at the upper forest limit. As far back as 5600 cal years bp, high-elevation forest ecosystems were permanently disrupted and the alpine pastures were created. Palaeoecological data enable a clear distinction between a random and sporadic use of the alpine space, typical for Mesolithic and Neolithic societies, and an organized seasonal exploitation of natural resources, starting from the Copper Age onwards. The chronological comparison of independent climate proxies, palaeoecological information and pollen-based temperature reconstructions sheds light on the relationships between climate and humans since prehistoric times.

TI Decadal variability of north-eastern Atlantic storminess at the
   mid-Holocene: New inferences from a record of wind-blown sand, western

AB Disentangling the external and internal forcing responsible for the variability of the Earth's climate and associated extreme events over the Holocene is crucial for producing reliable scenarios of adaptation to the effects of ongoing climate change. At mid-latitudes, significant relationships between westerly storminess, solar activity and internal atmospheric and oceanic modes of variability have been repeatedly evidenced to exist over millennial and centennial time scales. However, at shorter (decadal) scale, it is still challenging to establish clear control links between the forcing mechanisms and the spatio-temporal variability of past extra-tropical storms. This probably owes to the existence of complex multi-scale relationships and feedback loops, as well as to the difficulty of producing proxy-records of sufficiently high-resolution and wide spatial significance.
   Here we present a reconstruction of westerly storminess in western Denmark between 4840 and 2300 yrs. cal. B.P. Past-storminess is retrieved from an organic-rich sedimentary succession by combining markers of aeolian sand influx, mu-XRF geochemistry and plant macrofossils. Particular focus is paid to the c. 4840-4350 yrs. cal. B.P. period for which our record is characterized by a pluri-annual resolution. We evidence concurrent pluri-decadal shifts in storminess and humidity regime at our site that we interpret as relocations of the mean westerly storm-track over the North-Atlantic. The signal is dominated by approximate to 90, approximate to 50-80 and approximate to 35-yr periods, evoking possible links with solar activity, the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modes of variability, respectively. The approximate to 35-yr periodicity found in our record is especially strong and stationary, suggesting that storminess could have been closely linked with the AMOC over the study period. Our records of storminess indeed show some great similarities with a record of deep overflow of a branch of the AMOC. Opposite to some model outputs, the strength of the AMOC seems to have often co-varied with storminess at pluri-decadal scales over the study period. We also find periods of high storminess activity to be significantly correlated with solar minima and relative pluri-decadal lows in the NAO. We suggest that small lowering in the strength of the NAO in an otherwise positive NAO context may have caused southward relocations of the mean westerly storm-track from subpolar latitudes to northern Europe. This invites to reconsider the importance given to using the NAO as a binary index.
   Finally, an attempt is made to explore the temporal lead-lag relationships between storminess and different potential forcing agents such as the Total Solar Irradiance, the NAO and the AMOC. Unfortunately, the insufficient chronological precision of the proxy-records available for the TSI, the NAO and the AMOC over the study period prevents us from deriving any robust interpretations regarding potential teleconnections at a decadal-scale between past north-Atlantic westerly storminess activity, solar forcing, the NAO and north-Atlantic surface and deep oceanic circulation.

AB We employ water isotope tracers to assess hydrological processes controlling lake water balances in the Old Crow Flats (OCF) landscape, northern Yukon Territory, Canada. Fifty-six lakes were sampled in June and July 2007 and 26 of these were re-sampled in September 2007. Based on patterns of isotopic evolution in delta O-18-delta H-2 space, calculations of input water compositions (delta(I)) and evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios, and field observations we identify snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, groundwater-influenced, evaporation-dominated and drained lake types, which represent the dominant hydrological process influencing the lake water balance. These results highlight the diversity in lake water balance conditions in the OCF, which are strongly associated with landscape characteristics. Snowmelt-dominated lakes are located where more dense vegetation cover entraps snow transported by prevailing northeasterly winds. Rainfall-dominated lakes occupy areas of sparse tundra vegetation cover where less snow accumulates. Groundwater-influenced oxbow lakes are located along the floodplain of higher-order river and creek channels and receive input throughout the ice-free season from snowmelt-recharged channel fens and sub-surface flow. Only one basin became evaporation-dominated during the 2007 open-water season probably because extremely high precipitation during the preceding late summer, late winter and early spring offset vapour loss. However, rainfall-dominated lakes appear to be more susceptible to evaporative drawdown than snowmelt-dominated and groundwater-influenced lakes, and many would likely evolve to evaporation-dominated during drier summers. Drained lakes are commonly observed throughout the landscape and in most cases likely result from elevated water levels and channel erosion between water-bodies. Unusually high amounts of snowmelt and/or rainfall triggered the drainage of two lakes in early June 2007 in which overflow led to rapid erosion of outlet channels. Our classification of lake types and corresponding isotopic evolution patterns are likely typical of other thermokarst landscapes and their identification could be used to better predict hydrological responses to ongoing climate change.

AB Today astronomical tuning is widely accepted as numerical dating method after having revolutionised the age calibration of the geological archive and time scale over the last decades. However, its origin is not well known and tracing its roots is important especially from a science historic perspective.
   Astronomical tuning developed in consequence of the astronomical theory of the ice ages and was repeatedly used in the second half of the 19th century before the invention of radio-isotopic dating. Building upon earlier ideas of Joseph Adhemar. James Croll started to formulate his astronomical theory of the ice ages in 1864 according to which precession controlled ice ages occur alternatingly on both hemispheres at times of maximum eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. The publication of these ideas compelled Charles Lyell to revise his Principles of Geology and add Croll's theory, thus providing an alternative to his own geographical cause of the ice ages. Both Croll and Lyell initially tuned the last glacial epoch to the prominent eccentricity maximum 850,000yr ago. This age was used as starting point by Lyell to calculate an age of 240 million years for the beginning of the Cambrium. But Croll soon revised the tuning to a much younger less prominent eccentricity maximum between 240,000 and 80,000yr ago. In addition he tuned older glacial deposits of late Miocene and Eocene ages to eccentricity maxima around 800,000 and 2,800,000yr ago. Archibald and James Geikie were the first to recognize interglacials during the last glacial epoch, as predicted by Croll's theory, and attempted to tune them to precession. Soon after Frank Taylor linked a series of 15 end-moraines left behind by the retreating ice sheet to precession to arrive at a possible age of 300,000yr for the maximum glaciation. In a classic paper, Axel Blytt (1876) explained the scattered distribution of plant groups in Norway to precession induced alternating rainy and dry periods as recorded by the layering in Holocene peat bogs. He specifically linked the exceptionally wet Atlantic period to the prolonged precession minimum at 33,300yr ago and further related basic stratigraphic alternations to precession induced climate change in general. Such a linkage was also proposed by Grove Karl Gilbert for cyclic alternations in the marine Cretaceous of North America. Extrapolating sedimentation rates, he arrived at an astronomical duration for part of the Cretaceous that was roughly as long as the final estimate of William Thomson for the age of the Earth. Assuming that orbital parameters directly affect sea level, Karl Mayer-Eymar and Blytt correlated the well known succession of Tertiary stages to precession and eccentricity, respectively. Remarkably, Blytt, like Croll before him, used very long-period cycles in eccentricity to establish and validate his tuning.
   Understandably these studies in the second half of the 19th century were largely deductive in nature and proved partly incorrect later. Nevertheless, this fascinating period marks a crucial phase in the development of the astronomical theory of the ice ages and climate, and in astronomical dating. It preceded the final inductive phase, which started with the recovery of deep-sea cores in 1947 and led to a spectacular revival of the astronomical theory, by a century. The first half of the 20th century can best be regarded as an intermediate phase, despite the significant progress made in both theoretical aspects and tuning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aim To reconstruct the history of vegetation and environments using pollen, charcoal and sediment analysis, and to identify the timing and nature of climate change and human impact on the vegetation of a remote Pacific island.
   Location Cerro de Los Inocentes, 1000 m above sea level, Alexander Selkirk Island (33degrees45'S, 80degrees45'W), Chile. The westernmost island of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, south-east Pacific Ocean.
   Methods A 150-cm long sediment core comprising 87 cm dark brown peat overlying 63 cm of yellow grey clay was extracted from a shallow depression on the southern slopes of Cerro de Los Inocentes. Pollen, charcoal, sediment and accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon analyses were used to construct a record of vegetation change through time. Numerical analysis of multispecies data allowed the classification of fossil assemblages into distinct pollen zones.
   Results Pollen and spores are preserved throughout the sediment with high concentrations coinciding with the beginning of organic sediment accumulation at around 8000 (14) C yr BP. Prior to 8000 (14) C yr BP, the deposition of clays, presumably from upslope erosion, occurred in a landscape sparsely vegetated by grasses, ferns and Pernettya rigida heath, including several plants that are only found 100-200 m above the site today (Zone CI-1). After 8000 (14) C yr BP, a P. rigida heath was the dominant vegetation (Zone CI-2). A shift to a wet heath-shrubland (Zone CI-3) occurred at 6000 (14) C yr BP and was followed by a transition to a treefern-shrubland mosaic accompanied by periodic burning (Zone CI-4) after 4500 (14) C yr BP. The impact of human occupation is evident in Zone CI-5 at 450 (14) C yr BP with the loss of forest species, increased burning and invasion of the exotic plant Rumex .
   Main conclusions The pollen and charcoal record provides the first evidence of vegetation changes spanning at least the last 8000 (14) C yr BP from the high altitude environment of Alexander Selkirk Island. Prior to 8000 (14) C yr BP, the altitudinal ranges of different plant species may have been suppressed by a cooler and drier climate. Increasing precipitation and temperatures at the end of the last glacial period may have mobilized exposed sediments in a sparsely vegetated upland environment, altering local drainage patterns, eventually leading to slope stabilization and deposition of organic detritus under an increasing density of heath and shrub vegetation. The subalpine heath-shrubland persisted until 4500 (14) C yr BP when first evidence for sustained burning is found in association with the establishment of a more open treefern-shrubland vegetation pattern. In the absence of human occupation at this time, the influence of increased climatic variability associated with more frequent El Nino-Southern Oscillation events during the mid to late Holocene is considered one of the main driving forces behind increased vegetation disturbance during this period. The record provides evidence that island vegetation patterns have been highly dynamic over millennial to decadal time-scales and that the flora has persisted through periods of rapid and major climate change. This changed with the discovery of the island by European explorers in the late sixteenth century and the subsequent introduction of goats and exploitation and burning of forests, which resulted in the progressive destruction of native vegetation and the invasion of introduced plants. There is evidence that reduced burning and control of the goat population within the last 50 years has resulted in marginal recovery of some high altitude native plant species.

AB Besides water vapour, greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, O-3 and N2O contribute similar to 60%, 20%, 10% and 6% to global warming, respectively; minor contribution is made by chlorofluorocarbons and volatile organic compounds (VOC). We present CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged soil-plant ecosystems (the ecosystems minimally disturbed by direct human or human- induced activities). All natural ecosystems are net sinks for CO2, although tundra and wetlands (including peatlands) are large sources of CH4, whereas significant N2O emissions occur mainly from tropical and temperate forests. Most natural ecosystems decrease net global warming potential (GWP) from - 0.03 +/- 0.35 t CO2-eha(-1) y(-1) (tropical forests) to - 0.90 +/- 0.42 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1) (temperate forests) and - 1.18 +/- 0.44 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1) (boreal forests), mostly as CO2 sinks in phytobiomass, microbial biomass and soil C. But net GWP contributions from wetlands are very large, which is primarily due to CH4 emissions. Although the tropical forest system provides a large carbon sink, the negligible capacity of tropical forests to reduce GWP is entirely due to N2O emissions, possibly from rapid N mineralisation under favourable temperature and moisture conditions. It is estimated that the natural ecosystems reduce the net atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3.55 +/- 0.44 GtCO(2)-ey(-1) or similar to 0.5 ppm(v) CO2-e y(-1), hence, the significant role of natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems in slowing global warming and climate change. However, the impact of increasing N deposition on natural ecosystems is poorly understood, and further understanding is required regarding the use of drainage as a management tool, to reduce CH4 emissions from wetlands and to increase GHG sink from the restoration of degraded lands, including saline and sodic soils. Data on GHG fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems are further compounded by large spatial and temporal heterogeneity, limited sensitivity of current instruments, few and poor global distribution of monitoring sites and limited capacity of models that could integrate GHG fluxes across ecosystems, atmosphere and oceans and include feedbacks from biophysical variables governing these fluxes.

TI Climate model predictions for the latest Cretaceous: An evaluation using

AB To date, many general circulation model (GCM) experiments have failed to reproduce the warm, high latitude temperatures suggested for the Cretaceous by geological proxy climate indicators, especially for the Northern Hemisphere and within continental interiors. The vast majority of these proxies are biologically based, and it is important to determine whether alternative sedimentologically based proxies indicate similar cold biases in models. Therefore, we have performed an evaluation of the very latest generation of climate model predictions for terrestrial sites using climatically sensitive sediments as palaeoclimate indicators. Evidence from the geological record, comprising coal/peat, evaporites, bauxite and laterite deposits, are portrayed on a series of palaeoclimate-data maps. These are then compared with the global distributions of potential deposits generated from model simulations of the Maastrichtian using versions of the Hadley Centre climate model. The Maastrichtian was chosen because of the greater range and sophistication of GCMs adapted for its climate simulation and sediment prediction than for other Cretaceous stages. This thus represents the first attempt at comparing such state-of-the-art models to lithological climate indicators and quantifying their relative performances.
   For peat/coal, there is generally good correspondence between Maastrichtian model predictions for predicted potential deposits and the observed record. For evaporites, there is also very close agreement between predictions by the models and the geological record, minor differences between the individual model versions resulting from their differing levels of atmospheric CO2 and the different palaeogeographical representations of intracontinental seaways in the Northern Hemisphere. For bauxites and laterites, the models predict less than half of the documented deposits, successfully portraying equatorial accumulations but omitting the majority of mid to high latitude deposits. The main discrepancy is therefore identified as the failure of all models to predict bauxite and laterite deposits corresponding with recorded accumulations within the mid to high latitudes of Europe and Asia. In many cases, the effects of CO2 have minimal impact on the skill of model prediction. However, for evaporite distributions, the low CO2 model is appreciably worse. In general, the best match across the geological data and models is achieved by the simulation with open Northern Hemisphere seaways.
   Overall, these results confirm those inferred from biological proxies, showing that climate models have a serious cold bias in high latitudes and continental interiors during the Cretaceous and that the latest generation of climate models still produces results which are incompatible with the geological data. Levels of atmospheric CO2 and uncertainties in palaeogeography cannot explain the discrepancy. The cold bias is common to many climate models, and suggests that a process or mechanism is poorly represented or omitted in the current generation of climate models, or that we are failing to recognise a major boundary condition change in the Cretaceous. If the former, this implies that we may be underestimating the extent of extreme future climate change at high latitudes and in continental interiors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Diel variation in metabolism contributes to variation in oxygen (O-2) concentrations in streams. This variation in O-2 and other parameters (e.g. pH) can in turn affect the rates of microbial nitrogen (N) processing, concentrations of nitrogenous solutes and production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). We investigated diel variability in emissions of N2O and the magnitude of short-term variability in N solutes across 10 streams.
   2. Nitrous oxide fluxes varied on average 2.3-fold over diel cycles. Concentrations would be underestimated by sampling around noon, but N2O fluxes would not show a consistent bias. Time-weighted mean daily N2O flux was strongly related to nitrate concentration (r(2) = 0.58). Diel patterns in N2O and dissolved N species were often complex (rather than simple sinusoidal curves), probably reflecting complex underlying processes.
   3. Reliance on samples obtained around noon would overestimate daily mean nitrate concentrations by 5% and underestimate ammonium by 32% (average bias across all streams and dates).
   4. Dissolved organic N did not show consistent day-night variation. However, the magnitude of diel variability was similar to that observed for dissolved inorganic N. Organic and inorganic N concentrations were often similar. Both appear to be dynamic components of stream N budgets.
   5. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) relies upon an emission factor to estimate indirect agricultural N2O emissions from streams and ground water. The measured emission factor (defined as the ratio of concentrations of N2O-N to NO3--N) was typically below the recently revised IPCC default figure. Measured values varied on average 1.8-fold over approximately 24-h periods and were slightly higher at night than by day. The emission factor was actually highest in streams that were net sinks for N2O, highlighting a conceptual problem in the current IPCC method.
   6. Typical sampling programmes rely on daytime-only sampling, which might cause bias in results. In our study streams, the bias was generally small. Diel variation in nitrate concentrations was related to mean temperature; variation in ammonium and N2O concentrations was greatest at low concentrations of nitrite and ammonium.

AB The Younger Dryas (YD) is the most recent abrupt climatic event recognized during the transition from the last glaciation to the Holocene. Growing evidence from the middle and high latitudes of Europe and North America shows that the climate within the YD event was highly unstable. Until recently, however, climate instability during this event has received little attention elsewhere in the world. Here we present evidence of a climatically unstable YD based on pollen-climate transfer function and REDFIT spectral analysis of pollen data from Haligu in the Hengduan Mountains of southwestern China, a low latitude temperate biodiversity hotspot. Our data show that the climate fluctuated significantly during the YD, with three warm peaks recognized at 11.5, 11.7 and 12.3 cal kyr BP. In particular, we estimate a gradual rise in mean annual temperature by 3.7 degrees C between the end of the YD and the early Holocene (11.2-10.9 cal kyr BP). In response to this, the subalpine conifer forest dominated by Picea and Abies may have migrated about 610 m upwards. We also detected that the climate fluctuations during the YD-Holocene transition show significant centennial periodicities of 76 yr, 84 yr, 91 yr, 95 yr, and 638 yr. The former four cycles are possibly related to the Gleissberg (around 80 yr) solar cycle, which was also detected in the Hongyuan peat, the PC-6 core of the East China Sea and the GISP2 ice core. These new findings enhance our understanding of millennial-scale abrupt climate events which may be of great significance in predicting the impact of future climate change on mountainous ecosystems in southwestern China. The warming at the end of the YD may provide a potential analog for global warming in the near future, during which the upward migration of vegetation zones will likely lead to the loss of habitat for threatened species. We therefore should take action to restore habitats and provide protected areas for species at risk.

AB The last interglacial-glacial cycle (125-10 ka BP) is characterised by numerous rapid shifts in global climate on sub-Milankovitch timescales, recorded in the ocean and ice core records. These climatic fluctuations are clearly recorded in those European terrestrial sedimentary sequences that span this time period without interruption. In the UK, only fragmentary Upper Pleistocene sequences exist, mainly within the fluvial archive of the major river systems such as the Thames. The response of the upper River Thames to abrupt fluctuations in climate is documented in the fluvial sediments beneath the Floodplain Terrace (Northmoor Member of the Upper Thames Formation) at Ashton Keynes, Wiltshire. A number of criteria are set out by which significant changes in the fluvial system may be established from the sedimentological, palaeoecological and geochronological information contained within the succession. The sedimentary succession is divisible into four facies associations, on the basis of their sedimentology and bounding surface characteristics. These represent distinct phases of fluvial activity at the site and allow changes in fluvial style to be inferred. Palaeoecological reconstructions from pollen analysis of peats within the sequence provides an indication of the nature and direction of Late Glacial environmental change and optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating methods provide chronological control on the sequence. These data suggest that major changes in fluvial style are recorded within the succession, which can be related to the climatic fluctuations that took place on the oxygen isotope stage 5a/4 transition (approximately 70 ka BP) and the Devensian Late Glacial climatic warm-cold-warm oscillation (13-11 ka BP). The changes in fluvial style are a result of variations in sediment supply to the river resulting from changes in slope stability, vegetation cover and cold-climate mass movement processes and variations in discharge regime caused by changes in precipitation patterns, snow cover, permafrost distribution and vegetation cover.

AB Given the magnitude of soil carbon stocks in northern ecosystems, and the vulnerability of these stocks to climate warming, land surface models must accurately represent soil carbon dynamics in these regions. We evaluate soil carbon stocks and turnover rates, and the relationship between soil carbon loss with soil temperature and moisture, from an ensemble of eleven global land surface models. We focus on the region of NASA's Arctic-Boreal vulnerability experiment (ABoVE) in North America to inform data collection and model development efforts. Models exhibit an order of magnitude difference in estimates of current total soil carbon stocks, generally under- or overestimating the size of current soil carbon stocks by greater than 50 PgC. We find that a model's soil carbon stock at steady-state in 1901 is the prime driver of its soil carbon stock a hundred years later-overwhelming the effect of environmental forcing factors like climate. The greatest divergence between modeled and observed soil carbon stocks is in regions dominated by peat and permafrost soils, suggesting that models are failing to capture the frozen soil carbon dynamics of permafrost regions. Using a set of functional benchmarks to test the simulated relationship of soil respiration to both soil temperature and moisture, we find that although models capture the observed shape of the soil moisture response of respiration, almost half of the models examined show temperature sensitivities, or Q10 values, that are half of observed. Significantly, models that perform better against observational constraints of respiration or carbon stock size do not necessarily perform well in terms of their functional response to key climatic factors like changing temperature. This suggests that models may be arriving at the right result, but for the wrong reason. The results of this work can help to bridge the gap between data and models by both pointing to the need to constrain initial carbon pool sizes, as well as highlighting the importance of incorporating functional benchmarks into ongoing, mechanistic modeling activities such as those included in ABoVE.

AB Global warming, altering the physiology and irrigation demand of grapevines, has already been perceived in certain premium viticulture regions across the world. Selection of proper rootstocks for especially new cultivars has vital role for asustainable viticulture under water-deficit conditions. The grapevine cultivar 'Michele Palieri' has been finding a good reception on the global markets. The objective of this study was to determine the response of 'Michele Palieri' cultivar to deficit irrigation using different rootstocks with distinct genetic origins. Two irrigation regimes (Full Irrigation [FI] and Deficit Irrigation [DI]) were applied to the vines of different grafting combinations of 'Michele Palieri' with Kober 5 BB, Richter 99, Richter 110, 140 Ruggeri, 44-53 Malegue or grown on own roots. Two years old vines were cultivated in 60L pots containing sterile peat under controlled glasshouse conditions. Irrigations were regulated according to soil water matric potential (m) levels using tensiometers. The volume of the irrigation water that has to be applied to attain 100% field capacity was performed as FI, while 50% of FI was considered as DI. The water was transported directly into the pots by micro-irrigation systems consisting of individual spaghetti tubes. The vines of DI treatment showed visible symptoms of mild water stress (e.g., loss of turgor in shoot tips), but no defoliation or leaf necrosis occurred. DI treatment reduced the gs of 'Michele Palieri' scion cultivar in varying levels depending on the rootstock. DI treatment also affected vegetative growth of the scion cultivar in different levels. For example, the greatest decrease (26.7%) in shoot length resulting from DI was determined in 'Michele Palieri'/5 BB grapevines, followed by own rooted vines (13.1%), while the lowest change (2.4%) was found in vines grafted on 110R. Overall findings of this study imply that the rootstocks originating from V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids (110R, 99R, 140Ru and 44-53M) better performed in a similar genetic aptitude under deficit irrigation regime while the rootstock 5 BB (V. berlandiery x V.rupestris) showed more susceptible responses. On the other hand, the general response of own rooted vines were better than those grafted on 5 BB. Therefore, the use of one of V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids may be abetter choice for viticulture under semiarid regions.

AB Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) spawn in fall and overwintering egg development can benefit from stable, relatively warm temperatures in groundwater-seepage zones. However, eggs are also sensitive to dissolved oxygen concentration, which may be reduced in discharging groundwater (i.e., seepage). We investigated a 2 km reach of the coastal Quashnet River in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, to relate preferred fish spawning habitats to geology, geomorphology, and discharging groundwater geochemistry. Thermal reconnaissance methods were used to locate zones of rapid groundwater discharge, which were predominantly found along the central channel of a wider stream valley section. Pore-water chemistry and temporal vertical groundwater flux were measured at a subset of these zones during field campaigns over several seasons. Seepage zones in open-valley sub-reaches generally showed suboxic conditions and higher dissolved solutes compared to the underlying glacial outwash aquifer. These discharge zones were cross-referenced with preferred brook trout redds and evaluated during 10 years of observation, all of which were associated with discrete alcove features in steep cutbanks, where stream meander bends intersect the glacial valley walls. Seepage in these repeat spawning zones was generally stronger and more variable than in open-valley sites, with higher dissolved oxygen and reduced solute concentrations. The combined evidence indicates that regional groundwater discharge along the broader valley bottom is predominantly suboxic due to the influence of near-stream organic deposits; trout show no obvious preference for these zones when spawning. However, the meander bends that cut into sandy deposits near the valley walls generate strong oxic seepage zones that are utilized routinely for redd construction and the overwintering of trout eggs. Stable water isotopic data support the conclusion that repeat spawning zones are located directly on preferential discharges of more localized groundwater. In similar coastal systems with extensive valley peat deposits, the specific use of groundwater-discharge points by brook trout may be limited to morphologies such as cutbanks, where groundwater flow paths do not encounter substantial buried organic material and remain oxygen-rich.

AB Vertical water transport plays an important role in the development and maintenance of lakes in arid zones. However, previous study of this phenomenon has focused mainly on the effects of regional precipitation, rather than effects of groundwater recharge, on arid-zone environmental change. We selected a sedimentary profile from a seasonal lake basin located in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert, northwestern China, to assess the Holocene environmental evolution of this region and its response to climate change. Our results show that peat deposition from 11 to 10 ka indicates humidification after Younger Dryas (YD) event; the lake sediment and lower EM2 and lower principal component analysis (PCA)-1 scores indicate relative more humid environment from 10 to 7.8 ka; the lake sediment and higher EM2 and higher PCA-1 scores indicate most humid environment from 7.8 to 5.8 ka; the transition from lacustrine facies to limnetic facies and increasing salinity indicate drying trend from 5.8 to 2.5 ka; the aeolian sand sediment and lowest EM2 and lowest PCA-1 scores indicate driest environment from 2.5 to 0.8 ka; and lacustrine facies and finest grain size indicate relative humid environment during the 'Little Ice Age' period. The environment was relative humid in early Holocene, most Humid in mid-Holocene, and dry in mid-late Holocene. The moisture pattern in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert was synchronous with that in the northeastern of Tibetan Plateau, which implies that the groundwater recharge lake was dominated by the intensity of groundwater recharge from monsoon margin area, especially the northeastern of Tibetan Plateau. As a record from groundwater recharge lake without runoff, our study provides the groundwater output quantity record from northeastern of Tibetan Plateau and would benefit the environment change research and regional water resources allocation around the Tibetan Plateau.

AB The weathering of U and/or Th rich granite plutons, which occurs worldwide, may serve as a potentially important, but as yet poorly defined source for U and Th in (sub-) surface environments. Here, we assessed the impact of an outcrop of such granite (5 km in diameter) and its erosional products on the distribution of U and Th in four nemo-boreal catchments. The results showed that (i) the pluton was enriched in both U and Th; and (ii) secondary U and Th phases were accumulated by peat/gyttja and in other Quaternary deposits with high contents of organic matter. Movement of the ice sheet during the latest glaciation led to dispersal of U- and Th-rich materials eroded from the pluton, resulting in a progressive increase in dissolved U and Th concentrations, as well as U concentrations in aquatic plants with increasing proximity to the pluton. The accumulation of U in the aquatic plants growing upon the pluton (100-365 mg kg(-1), dry ash weight) shows that this rock represents a long-term risk for adjacent ecosystems. Dissolved pools of U and Th were correlated with those of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and were predicted to largely occur as organic complexes. This demonstrates the importance of DOM in the transport of U and Th in the catchments. Large fractions of Ca2UO2(CO3)(3)(0)(aq) were modeled to occur in the stream with highest pH and alkalinity and thus, explain the strongly elevated U concentrations and fluxes in this particular stream. In future climate scenarios, boreal catchments will experience intensified runoff and warmer temperature that favor the production of hydrologically accessible DOM and alkalinity. Therefore, the results obtained from this study have implications for predicting the distribution and transport of Th and U in boreal catchments, especially those associated with U and/or Th rich granite plutons.

SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE soil evolution; soil climate; climate normal; climate warming
AB In connection with warming, the current state of the climate relative to the climate normal is analyzed. In quantitative terms, the climate normal is a parameter of any characteristic of climate of atmosphere or soil sampled from 1961 to 1990 in a daily, ten-day, monthly, seasonal, or annual cycle. Currently, climatic changes occur on global, continental and regional level. On the global level, especially strong climate warming has been observed over the past 100 years: the average ten-year air temperature increased, as compared with its lowest (1891-1900), by 1.2-1.3 degrees C by now. Modern warming has affected all continents, while the air temperature on the continents has increased, as compared with the climate normal, by 0.3-1.5 degrees C.
   Analysis of climate change on the regional level was carried out during the period of experimental observations (1921-2015) by the example of soils in the zonal range of the European part of Russia: peat gleyzems of forest-tundra, podzolic soils of middle taiga, sod-podzolic soils of southern taiga, and light-chestnut soils of dry steppe. It is established that each soil is characterized by a certain normal of climatic parameters. For zonal series of soils under research it was shown that the current climate warming is accompanied by the increase in air and soil temperature and, consequently, by displacement of soil-climatic zones in the north. The current climate warming, according to the temperature parameter, has become commensurate with the climatic optimum of the Holocene. Favorable conditions are created for promotion of forest communities to the north, which may lead to development of a podzolic type of soil formation in forest-occupied tundra territories. For forest soils of the northern and middle taiga, under conditions of the current climate warming, soil formation will be accompanied by weakening podzolic soil and intensification of sod soil-forming processes. One can also expect increase in aridization and salinization of chestnut soils of dry steppes.

AB The lack of multi-millennial multi-proxy paleoenvironmental reconstructions from Mexico's Pacific coast has limited our understanding of the regional response to climate change and sea-level rise. A 479-cm core covering the last 6900 years was extracted from Laguna Mitla in the state of Guerrero on Mexico's Pacific coast. Beginning as a Rhizophora-dominated salt pan 6900 yr BP, at 6500 yr BP, the site transitioned to a mangrove swamp dominated by Laguncularia, which lasted about 300 years. The beach barrier formed from 6200 to 5200 yr BP, during which time, the site existed as an intermittently sheltered bay, the result of large, rapid changes in wave energy associated with the shifting barrier location and changes in stability. After the beach barrier was stabilized at 5200 yr BP, water level at the coring site became a function of precipitation rather than sea level. Since that time, deposition has alternated between peat, laid down in a mangrove swamp, and clay intervals characterized by high concentrations of titanium and a predominantly regional pollen signal, representing open-water lagoon phases. Seven periods of increased water level, varying in duration, occurred during the backbarrier period, with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) likely the main climatic mechanism causing these periodic shifts in the paleo-precipitation levels. We suggest that the deepest water levels detected over the last 3200 years correlate with periods of increased ENSO activity. The spatial distribution of tropical cyclone rainfall, which represents a significant percentage of total annual precipitation along Mexico's Pacific coast, may explain the inconsistencies between our record and paleoclimatic records from Mexico's interior, but more work is needed to test this hypothesis.

AB The Tibetan plateau is a cold environment at high altitude and is very sensitive to global climate change. Wetlands on this plateau are among the major sources of the important greenhouse gas methane, and temperature is an important factor in controlling CH4 production. However, it remains unknown how CH4 production and microbial processes in such wetlands respond to climate warming. Therefore, we anaerobically incubated soil slurries at 10, 20, 30 and 45 degrees C for 100 days to investigate the effects of temperature on CH4 production and microbial community structure in the wetland soil next to NamCo, an alkaline lake on the Tibetan plateau. Rates and pathways of CH4 production were determined by measuring accumulation of CH4 and stable isotope fractionation, respectively. The microbial community structures were investigated by Illumina sequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA and methanogenic mcrA genes and/or transcripts. Increasing the temperature from 10 to 30 degrees C enhanced CH4 production, but at 45 degrees C it almost ceased and the methanogenic precursor acetate accumulated. At lower temperatures, acetate accumulated only if acetoclastic CH4 production was inhibited with methyl fluoride. The abundance of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and mcrA genes were generally around 10(8) g(-1) dry weight soil or higher. Aaproteobacteria became increasingly abundant with time of incubation (up to 100 days) and temperature increasing from 10 to 30 degrees C. At 45 degrees C, however, Firmicutes became the dominant bacterial phylum. While about > 70% of CH4 was produced from acetoclastic methanogenesis at 10-30 degrees C, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant ( > 82%) pathway at 45 degrees C. The acetoclastic genus Methanoseata was the main methanogen at low (10 degrees C) and moderate (20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) temperatures, but the hydrogenotrophic genera Methanoregula and Methanomassiliicoccus dominated at high temperature (45 degrees C). Bathyarchaeota, with unknown function, dominated next to methanogenic Euryarchaeota the archaeal community, especially on DNA level. The methanogenic archaeal community composition of NamCo soil resembled that of alkaline lake sediments from the Tibetan Plateau. Structure and function of the methanogenic microbial community in alkaline wetlands and their temperature response seem to be different from those found in neutral paddy soil or acidic peatland soil.

AB Conservation organizations have most often focused on land-use change, climate change, and invasive species as prime threats to biodiversity conservation. Although air pollution is an acknowledged widespread problem, it is rarely considered in conservation planning or management. In this synthesis, the state of scientific knowledge on the effects of air pollution on plants and animals in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States is summarized. Four air pollutants (sulfur, nitrogen, ozone, and mercury) and eight ecosystem types ranging from estuaries to alpine tundra are considered. Effects of air pollution were identified, with varying levels of certainty, in all the ecosystem types examined. None of these ecosystem types is free of the impacts of air pollution, and most are affected by multiple pollutants. In aquatic ecosystems, effects of acidity, nitrogen, and mercury on organisms and biogeochemical processes are well documented. Air pollution causes or contributes to acidification of lakes, eutrophication of estuaries and coastal waters, and mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. In terrestrial ecosystems, the effects of air pollution on biogeochemical cycling are also very well documented, but the effects on most organisms and the interaction of air pollution with other stressors are less well understood. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence for effects of nitrogen deposition on plants in grasslands, alpine areas, and bogs, and for nitrogen effects on forest mycorrhizae. Soil acidification is widespread in forest ecosystems across the eastern United States and is likely to affect the composition and function of forests in acid-sensitive areas over the long term. Ozone is known to cause reductions in photosynthesis in many terrestrial plant species. For the most part, the effects of these pollutants are chronic, not acute, at the exposure levels common in the eastern United States. Mortality is often observed only at experimentally elevated exposure levels or in combination with other stresses such as drought, freezing, or pathogens. The notable exceptions are the acid/aluminum effects on aquatic organisms, which can be lethal at levels of acidity observed in many surface waters in the region. Although the effects are often subtle, they are important to biological conservation. Changes in species composition caused by terrestrial or aquatic acidification or eutrophication can propagate throughout the food webs to affect many organisms beyond those that are directly sensitive to the pollution. Likewise, sublethal doses of toxic pollutants may reduce the reproductive success of the affected organisms or make them more susceptible to potentially lethal pathogens. Many serious gaps in knowledge that warrant further research were identified. Among those gaps are the effects of acidification, ozone, and mercury on alpine systems, effects of nitrogen on species composition of forests, effects of mercury in terrestrial food webs, interactive effects of multiple pollutants, and interactions among air pollution and other environmental changes such as climate change and invasive species. These gaps in knowledge, coupled with the strong likelihood of impacts on ecosystems that have not been studied in the region, suggests that current knowledge underestimates the actual impact of air pollutants on biodiversity.
   Nonetheless, because known or likely impacts of air pollution on the biodiversity and function of natural ecosystems are widespread in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, the effects of air pollution sould be considered in any long-term conservation strategy. It is recommended that ecologically relevant standards, such as "critical loads," be adopted for air pollutants and the importance of long-term monitoring of air pollution and its effects is emphasized.

AB In the southern Great Lakes Region, North America, between 19,000 and 8,000 years ago, temperatures rose by 2.5-6.5 degrees C and spruce Picea forests/woodlands were replaced by mixed-deciduous or pine Pinus forests. The demise of Picea forests/woodlands during the last deglaciation offers a model system for studying how changing climate and disturbance regimes interact to trigger declines of dominant species and vegetation-type conversions.
   The role of rising temperatures in driving the regional demise of Picea forests/woodlands is widely accepted, but the role of fire is poorly understood. We studied the effect of changing fire activity on Picea declines and rates of vegetation composition change using fossil pollen and macroscopic charcoal from five high-resolution lake sediment records.
   The decline of Picea forests/woodlands followed two distinct patterns. At two sites (Stotzel-Leis and Silver Lake), fire activity reached maximum levels during the declines and both charcoal accumulation rates and fire frequency were significantly and positively associated with vegetation composition change rates. At these sites, Picea declined to low levels by 14 kyr BP and was largely replaced by deciduous hardwood taxa like ash Fraxinus, hop-hornbeam/hornbeam Ostrya/Carpinus and elm Ulmus. However, this ecosystem transition was reversible, as Picea re-established at lower abundances during the Younger Dryas.
   At the other three sites, there was no statistical relationship between charcoal accumulation and vegetation composition change rates, though fire frequency was a significant predictor of rates of vegetation change at Appleman Lake and Triangle Lake Bog. At these sites, Picea declined gradually over several thousand years, was replaced by deciduous hardwoods and high levels of Pinus and did not re-establish during the Younger Dryas.
   Synthesis. Fire does not appear to have been necessary for the climate-driven loss of Picea woodlands during the last deglaciation, but increased fire frequency accelerated the decline of Picea in some areas by clearing the way for thermophilous deciduous hardwood taxa. Hence, warming and intensified fire regimes likely interacted in the past to cause abrupt losses of coniferous forests and could again in the coming decades.

AB The siliceous sub-fossil content (diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, sponges and phytoliths) of two cores was studied to determine the evolution and environmental changes that have occurred since the formation of two fenland lakes, Lac de Collanges and Lac de Freycenet, on the Deves Plateau, Massif Central, France. Cluster analyses determined eight siliceous zones, whereas a detrended correspondence analysis showed similar changes occurring in both sites, and principal component analysis identified four major shifts occurring over time at both sites, corresponding to the establishment of the fenland, the development of a pond and changes in the terrestrial environment. Four classic pollen zones previously determined for the French Massif Central were recorded in the core. The Boreal and beginning of the Old Atlantic period (9445-9250 cal bp) are marked by the development of the fenland, a decrease in pine trees and loss of grassland. The siliceous component was dominated by chrysophyte cysts indicating a cooler and lower trophic level. The Atlantic period (83657852 cal bp) saw maximum expansion of the fenland and the first occurrence and dominance of Aulacoseira perglabra (Ostrup) Haworth, indicating higher water levels as a result of climate change. Increasing numbers of sponge spicules and the decrease in A. perglabra showed a shift to dryer conditions. During this phase, greater and more frequent droughts occurred in Collanges compared with Freycenet, most likely due to its smaller drainage basin. With the Subboreal, around 5000 cal bp, a change in conditions occurred: A. lacustris (Grunow) Krammer became the most important centric diatom and phytoliths became an important component. Pine trees increased and total herb and grasses became more important. The increase in total herb and grass pollen, along with the major increase in phytoliths, indicated an increase in human agro-pastoral activity within the area. The Subatlantic saw a decrease in water levels with periods of desiccation. A cyclic pattern of wet and dry phases was documented by a diatom increase in regularly moist and mostly moist subaerial environments. Including counts of phytoliths, sponges and chrysophyte cysts with diatoms allows better interpretation of the changes occurring over time within the area and permitted determination of the arrival of human agro-pastoral activity. The other three groups, namely phytoliths, sponges and cysts, were particularly useful when certain samples contained very few or were totally devoid of diatoms.

AB Droughts can have an impact on forest functioning and production, and even lead to tree mortality. However, drought is an elusive phenomenon that is difficult to quantify and define universally. In this study, we assessed the performance of a set of indicators that have been used to describe drought conditions in the summer months (June, July, August) over a 30-year period (1981-2010) in Finland. Those indicators include the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), and the Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA). Herein, regional soil moisture was produced by the land surface model JSBACH of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). Results show that the buffering effect of soil moisture and the associated soil moisture memory can impact on the onset and duration of drought as indicated by the SMI and SMA, while the SPI and SPEI are directly controlled by meteorological conditions.
   In particular, we investigated whether the SMI, SMA and SPEI are able to indicate the Extreme Drought affecting Forest health (EDF), which we defined according to the extreme drought that caused severe forest damages in Finland in 2006. The EDF thresholds for the aforementioned indicators are suggested, based on the reported statistics of forest damages in Finland in 2006. SMI was found to be the best indicator in capturing the spatial extent of forest damage induced by the extreme drought in 2006. In addition, through the application of the EDF thresholds over the summer months of the 30-year study period, the SPEI and SMA tended to show more frequent EDF events and a higher fraction of influenced area than SMI. This is because the SPEI and SMA are standardized indicators that show the degree of anomalies from statistical means over the aggregation period of climate conditions and soil moisture, respectively. However, in boreal forests in Finland, the high initial soil moisture or existence of peat often prevent the EDFs indicated by the SPEI and SMA to produce very low soil moisture that could be indicated as EDFs by the SMI. Therefore, we consider SMI is more appropriate for indicating EDFs in boreal forests. The selected EDF thresholds for those indicators could be calibrated when there are more forest health observation data available. Furthermore, in the context of future climate scenarios, assessments of EDF risks in northern areas should, in addition to climate data, rely on a land surface model capable of reliable prediction of soil moisture.

AB Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.

AB Laboratory incubations, gas and solute analyses, and stable isotope methods were used to investigate the pathway of methanogenesis in 25 wetland peats of varying vegetation composition along a latitudinal gradient in Alaska. Sites were divided into gross vegetation classes indicative of tropic status: mostly Sphagnum (class 1); Sphagnum plus vascular plants (i. e., Carex) (class 2); mostly vascular plants, but still containing Sphagnum (class 3), and; sites dominated by vascular plants with no visible Sphagnum species (class 4). The magnitude of CO2, acetate and CH4 as end products of anaerobic metabolism varied greatly, but ratios of end product formation indicative of differences in the pathway of C flow and methanogenesis corresponded with vegetation classes, especially at the extremes, e. g., acetate-C accounted for 67% of total C production in Sphagnum-rich sites (class 1) decreasing to 13% in sites devoid of sphagna (class 4). Conversely, CH4 comprised only 0.4% of products in class 1 sites, but increased to 14% in class 4. Total respiration rates (sum of all three products) varied by only a factor of similar to 2 among vegetation classes (200 -440 nmol ml(-1) day(-1)), but rates differed greatly if acetate formation was not included suggesting that belowground C cycling can be much more rapid than previously thought. Apparent fractionation factors (alpha = delta C-13(DIC) + 1000/delta(13) C-CH4 + 1000) that estimate methanogenic pathway, i. e., the relative contribution of CO2 reduction or acetate as precursors of methane, varied from similar to 1.030 to similar to 1.080 and agreed with incubation end product ratios, underscoring the importance of the presence or absence of vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses in affecting the pathway of anaerobic C flow. We contend that methanogenesis in general, including CO2 reduction, is impeded in northern wetlands compared to the production of other C compounds and that its importance decreases with oligotrophy. The connection with vegetation suggests that climate change scenarios leading to increases in vascular plant cover in northern wetlands may shift methanogenic pathways toward increased acetotrophy and increased methane formation, which is a positive feedback on warming.

AB Warming temperatures in continuous permafrost zones of the Arctic will alter both hydrological and geochemical soil conditions, which are strongly linked with heterotrophic microbial carbon (C) cycling. Heterogeneous permafrost landscapes are often dominated by polygonal features formed by expanding ice wedges: water accumulates in low centered polygons (LCPs), and water drains outward to surrounding troughs in high centered polygons (HCPs). These geospatial differences in hydrology cause gradients in biogeochemistry, soil C storage potential, and thermal properties. Presently, data quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) release from HCP soils are needed to support modeling and evaluation of warming-induced CO2 and CH4 fluxes from tundra soils. This study quantifies the distribution of microbial CO2 and CH4 release in HCPs over a range of temperatures and draws comparisons to previous LCP studies. Arctic tundra soils were initially characterized for geochemical and hydraulic properties. Laboratory incubations at -2, +4, and +8 degrees C were used to quantify temporal trends in CO2 and CH4 production from homogenized active layer organic and mineral soils in HCP centers and troughs, and methanogen abundance was estimated from mcrA gene measurements. Results showed that soil water availability, organic C, and redox conditions influence temporal dynamics and magnitude of gas production from HCP active layer soils during warming. At early incubation times (2-9 days), higher CO2 emissions were observed from HCP trough soils than from HCP center soils, but increased CO2 production occurred in center soils at later times (>20 days). HCP center soils did not support methanogenesis, but CH4-producing trough soils did indicate methanogen presence. Consistent with previous LCP studies, HCP organic soils showed increased CO2 and CH4 production with elevated water content, but HCP trough mineral soils produced more CH4 than LCP mineral soils. HCP mineral soils also released substantial CO2 but did not show a strong trend in CO2 and CH4 release with water content. Knowledge of temporal and spatial variability in microbial C mineralization rates of Arctic soils in response to warming are key to constraining uncertainties in predictive climate models.

AB Arctic and boreal ecosystems are experiencing pronounced warming that is accelerating decomposition of soil organic matter and releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Future carbon storage in these ecosystems depends on the balance between microbial decomposition and primary production, both of which can be regulated by nutrients such as phosphorus. Phosphorus cycling in tundra and boreal regions is often assumed to occur through biological pathways with little interaction with soil minerals; that is, phosphate released from organic molecules is rapidly assimilated by plants or microorganisms. In contrast to this prevailing conceptual model, we use sequential extractions and spectroscopic techniques to demonstrate that iron (oxyhydr)oxides sequester approximately half of soil phosphate in organic soils from four arctic and boreal sites. Iron (III) (oxyhydr)oxides accumulated in shallow soils of low-lying, saturated areas where circumneutral pH and the presence of a redox interface promoted iron oxidation and hydrolysis. Soils enriched in short-range ordered iron oxyhydroxides, which are susceptible to dissolution under anoxic conditions, had high phosphate sorption capacities and maintained low concentrations of soluble phosphate relative to soils containing mostly organic-bound iron or crystalline iron oxides. Thus, substantial quantities of phosphorus in these organic soils were associated with minerals that could reduce bioavailability but potentially also serve as phosphorus sources under anoxic conditions. The implication of this finding is that mineral surfaces effectively compete with biological processes for phosphate and must be considered as a nutrient regulator in these sensitive ecosystems.
   Plain Language Summary The ability of plants to derive nutrients from the soil influences their capacity to photosynthesize and draw carbon out of the atmosphere. Plants compete for nutrients such as phosphate with soil microorganisms and with soil minerals. Iron oxides, in particular, effectively bind phosphate and keep it sequestered from plants. We demonstrate that iron oxides bind high quantities of phosphate in arctic and boreal systems where minerals are often assumed to have negligible influence on biological processes. Although plant biomass is likely to increase in a climate that is warmer and enriched in carbon dioxide, iron oxides may increasingly limit phosphate availability to plants and constrain ecosystem productivity.

AB The impact of diffuse pollution, agricultural land use and climate change on the long-term response of subsurface-surface water quality is not well understood, but is a prerequisite for evaluation of water management options. The goal of this study is to model geochemical evolution of water chemistry from the infiltration through soil into the unsaturated zone, transport through bedrocks and granular aquifers to a river in order to identify zones of steep concentration gradients and high dynamics under transient flow conditions. A numerical model was constructed comprising a 2-D 1,500 m x 150 m vertical cross-section of typical sedimentary rock formations, a glacio-fluvial quaternary gravel aquifer in the valley and soil layers. The model coupled saturated/un-saturated flow and reactive transport under steady state and transient conditions. Geochemical interactions, include intra-aqueous kinetic reactions of oxygen with dissolved organic matter, as well as kinetics of carbonate dissolution/precipitation. This model section was chosen to provide insight in to the principal processes and time scales affecting water chemistry along different flow paths. The numerical simulator MIN3P was used, a finite volume program for variably saturated subsurface flow and multi-component reactive transport. The results show that subsurface water residence times range from approximately 2 to 2,000 years. Different zones are to be expected with respect to the development of mineral equilibria; namely, purely atmospherically influenced, as well as open and closed system carbonate dissolution. Short-term responses to daily averaged changes in precipitation, however, are only visible to some extent in the shallower and near-river parts of flow system and solute loads. This can most likely be explained by directional changes in flow paths, indicating that equilibrium geochemical condition predominate at the hillslope scale, i.e. water quality depends on transport pathways rather than on kinetic effects. The extent of reducing conditions is controlled by the presence of organic-rich layers (i.e. peat deposits), the dissolution kinetics of aquifer organic matter and the subsequent mixing with oxygenated water by hydrodynamic dispersion.

AB Soil carbon, a major component of the global carbon inventory, has significant potential for change with changing climate and human land use. We applied the Century ecosystem model to a series of forest and grassland sites distributed globally to examine large-scale controls over soil carbon. Key site-specific parameters influencing soil carbon dynamics are soil texture and foliar lignin content; accordingly, we perturbed these variables at each site to establish a range of carbon concentrations and turnover times. We examined the simulated soil carbon stores, turnover times, and C:N ratios for correlations with patterns of independent variables. Results showed that soil carbon is related linearly to soil texture, increasing as clay content increases, that soil carbon stores and turnover time are related to mean annual temperature by negative exponential functions, and that heterotrophic respiration originates from recent detritus (similar to 50%), microbial turnover (similar to 30%), and soil organic matter (similar to 20%) with modest variations between forest and grassland ecosystems. The effect of changing temperature on soil organic carbon (SOC) estimated by Century is dSOC/dT = 183e(-0.034T). Global extrapolation of this relationship leads to an estimated sensitivity of soil C storage to a temperature of -11.1 Pg degrees C-1, excluding extreme arid and organic soils. In Century, net primary production (NPP) and soil carbon are closely coupled through the N cycle, so that as temperatures increase, accelerated N release first results in fertilization responses, increasing C inputs. The Century-predicted effect of temperature on carbon storage is modified by as much as 100% by the N cycle feedback. Century-estimated soil C sensitivity (-11.1 Pg degrees C-1) is similar to losses predicted with a simple data-based calculation (-14.1 Pg degrees C-1). Inclusion of the N cycle is important for even first order predictions of terrestrial carbon balance. If the NPP-SOC feedback is disrupted by land use or other disturbances, then SOC sensitivity can greatly exceed that estimated in our simulations. Century results further suggest that if climate change results in drying of organic soils (peats), soil carbon loss rates can be high.

AB The morainic and outwash deposits of the Larrikins (1a) and Moana (mn) formations in north Westland are correlated with the M5/T5 and M6/T6 deposits in south Westland. The 1a/M5 deposits resulted from two separate Otira Glaciation glacial advances (1a(1)/M5(1), 1a(2)/M5(2)) of essentially similar extents. Pollen sequences in peats and coverbeds extending from before to after the Kawakawa Tephra (26,500 cal. yr BP) indicate an extensive period of cold with a slight amelioration beginning shortly before tephra deposition. This amelioration, which is supported by interpretation of coverbed sequences in south Westland, separates the 1a(1)/M5(1) and 1a(2)/M5(2) advances. The three Westland glacial advances, 1a(1)/M5(1), 1a(2)/M5(2) and mn/M6, culminated at ca 28,000, 21,500 and 19,000 cal. yr BP, the last being followed by major rapid glacier retreat. Pollen and CaCO3 records from DSDP 594 east of the South Island reflect contemporary glacier fluctuations on the east side of the Southern Alps. They show the last major cold period as lasting from ca 34,000 to ca 16,000 years ago, a period starting before the culmination of the 1a(1)/M5(1) advance and ending later than the beginning of glacier retreat from the mn/M6 advance. The period from the 1a(1)/M5(1) culmination to the mn/M6 culmination represents the LGM in New Zealand. A slightly longer LGM is recorded in Chile, and a long LGM may also be indicated in Australia. A long LGM in the Southern Hemisphere is supported by the global sea level curve and by the regional Antarctic temperature criteria of the Vostok ice core. These different records indicate a Southern Hemisphere LGM beginning at least as early as 27,000 years ago, much earlier than the ocean Last Isotope Maximum (LIM) from 21,500 to 18,000 years ago. The beginning of MIS 2, defined primarily from deep-sea benthic 6180 at 24,000 years, is well after the beginning of ice advances leading to the Southern Hemisphere LGM. A review of global land and ocean correlations is desirable. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fossil fungal spores and other non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) are powerful environmental proxies in European palaeoecological and archaeological contexts. However, their application on other continents, and particularly in the tropics, is hampered by uncertain equivalence with morphologically similar taxa in Europe, and incomplete knowledge of their ecology in the new local contexts. Here we use fossil NPP assemblages in a 25,000-year sediment record from Lake Challa, a steep-sided crater lake near Mt. Kilimanjaro in southeastern Kenya, to assess NPP diversity in a tropical-African context and the equivalence of African taxa with their European counterparts. We recovered a total of 65 well-defined NPP types, of which 61 are fungal spores, and 42 could be linked to known taxa. We provide diagnoses and illustrations of 61 recovered taxa, 58 of which have not been documented before.
   Using the Challa pollen record of past regional vegetation dynamics and two independent proxies of past temperature and rainfall, we also assessed the association of individual fungal taxa with particular species and biomes of tropical-African vegetation, and with the history of regional climate change. We often found strong correspondence between the stratigraphic distribution of individual fungal spore taxa and the occurrence of specific vegetation types. Changing climate conditions appear to have had a strong impact on the ability of fungi to play a role in the decomposition of dead plants. For fungal spore assemblages, the most prominent change in regional palaeoenvironments over the past 25,000 years occurred at the start of the wet early Holocene, following Younger Dryas drought. Epicoccum purpurascens is common in the Glacial and Late-Glacial parts of the sequence, but shows a strong decline during the early Holocene. Coniochaeta cf. ligniaria occurs throughout the record but shows dramatic fluctuations that appear to relate to major changes in humidity. Correlation between fungal abundance and humidity is also observed in taxa for which the Challa region provided suitable habitat from ca. 16,500 cal.yr BP (e.g., Curvularia) or from the Late-Glacial to Holocene transition (e.g., Tetraploa aristata, Dictyoarthrinium cf. sacchari, cf. Byssothecium, types HdV-1032 and HdV-1033, cf. Alternaria, cf. Brachysporium, cf. Helminthosporium. Spegazzinia tessarthra and cf. Lasiodiplodia theobromae). Many of these taxa did not occur, or were rare, during both wet and dry phases of the Glacial period, suggesting an additional temperature effect on their occurrence in tropical African environments. A possibly dominant role of temperature is revealed in the stratigraphic distribution of Acrodictys, which appears at the onset of deglacial climate warming ca. 17,500 cal.yr BP and remains common throughout both wet and dry phases of the Holocene. Spores of the dung-inhabiting fungus Sporormiella occur throughout the 25,000-year record without notable fluctuations, suggesting little changes in the overall population density of large herbivores in the region.

AB Cold episode in Northern Europe happened about 8200 years ago was known for a relatively long time, mainly due to paleobotanical (palynological) data obtained from analysis of lake and peat sediments. Detailed analysis of ice cores from the Greenland holes GRIP, GISP2, and NGRIP with a time resolution of about 10 years made possible to refine the duration and characteristics of the time structure of this cold period. This cooling lasted for approximately 160 yr. Spore-pollen analysis of lake sediments in Northern Europe (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, the North and North-West of Russia) and deep-sea cores of the North Atlantic showed that the mean annual air temperature during the maximum stage of the cooling was reduced by 1-2 degrees C, and in some areas by more than 3 degrees C. The cold spread from the coast of the North Atlantic into the European continent and manifested itself mostly in Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, and to a lesser extent in the North-West and West of the Russian Federation. In the central Russia and North of 70 degrees N the cooling was weak or absent. The question about a nature of this cold event and other cold spells in Late Glaciation, known as the cold of the early, middle and late Dryas, is widely discussed in the scientific literature. Most of scientists accept a hypothesis proposed more than 20 years ago, that the reduction of air temperatures in regions immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic was caused by the large volume of melt water discharged into the ocean as a result of disintegration and melting of ice-sheets. Climate models that take into account these effects allow estimating a decrease in the air and sea surface temperature due to freshening (desalination) of the upper ocean layer, and this confirms that the greatest decrease in temperature should be observed in the regions directly adjacent to the ocean. The increase in global temperature over the last 30 years is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C, which is already reflected in a noticeable increase in precipitation in high latitudes. In addition, the melting of mountain glaciers and sea ice in the Arctic basin promotes freshening of the upper ocean, and as a result of these processes one can expect a certain decrease in the air temperature in the high latitudes if the present-day climate warming will continue. On the basis of paleoclimatic data, it can be assumed that such a decrease in air temperature can be relatively small and occur only in areas directly adjacent to the North Atlantic.

AB Seasonally flooded, freshwater cypress-tupelo wetlands, dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distictum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (S-R) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i.e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54.8, 1.48, 0.270, and 0.0205 mg L-1, for DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher S-R and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.

AB 1 Decomposition of plant litter, a key component of the global carbon budget, is hierarchically controlled by the triad: climate > litter quality > soil organisms. Given the sensitivity of decomposition to temperature, especially in cold biomes, it has been hypothesized that global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates, both through direct temperature effects and through indirect effects on litter quality and soil organisms.
   2 A meta-analysis of experimental warming studies in cold biomes (34 site-species combinations) showed that warming resulted in slightly increased decomposition rates. However, this response was strongly dependent on the method used: open top chambers reduced decomposition rates, whereas heating lamps stimulated decomposition rates. The low responsiveness was mainly due to moisture-limited decomposition rates in the warming treatments, especially at mesic and xeric sites. This control of litter decomposition by both temperature and moisture was corroborated by natural gradient studies.
   3 Interspecific differences in litter quality and decomposability are substantially larger than warming-induced phenotypic responses. Thus, the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have a considerably greater impact on ecosystem litter decomposition than phenotypic responses.
   4 Soil fauna communities in cold biomes are responsive to climate warming. Moreover, temperature-driven migration of the, hitherto absent, large comminuters to high-latitude sites may significantly increase decomposition rates. However, we do not know how far-reaching the consequences of changes in the species composition and structure of the soil community are for litter decomposition, as there is a lack of data on functional species redundancy and the species' dispersal ability.
   5 Global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates only if there is sufficient soil moisture. Hence, climate scenario and experimental studies should focus more on both factors and their interaction. As interspecific differences in potential decomposability and litter chemistry are substantially larger than phenotypic responses to warming, the focus of future research should be on the former. In addition, more light should be shed on the below-ground 'darkness' to evaluate the ecological significance of warming-induced soil fauna community changes for litter decomposition processes in cold biomes.

AB 1 Northern ecosystems may lose large amounts of soil C as the global climate warms over the next few decades. This study describes how soil C loss is related to temperature, moisture and chemical composition of organic matter in Alaskan tundra soils, including soils that were fertilized annually for 8 years prior to the study.
   2 Fertilized and unfertilized soils from four vegetation types (tussock, intertussock, sedge and heath) were incubated at 7 or 15 degrees C, under saturated or well-drained conditions, through four 100-day 'seasons' separated by 25- to 45-day frozen periods.
   3 Losses of CO2 were monitored and total C loss was determined by difference between initial and final C stocks. Initial and final organic matter composition was determined by separation into non-polar extractable (NPE, mainly fats, oils, and waxes), water-soluble (WS, mainly soluble carbohydrates and phenolics), acid-soluble (AS, mainly cellulose and related compounds), and acid-insoluble (AIS, 'lignin') fractions. An isotopic label (99% C-13-enriched glucose) was added to track transformations among the C fractions.
   4 Total C loss during the experiment was 3-32% of initial C mass depending on soil type and treatment, with most of the loss as CO2. Wet sedge tundra soils, with the largest AS and AIS fractions, lost the least CO2 and total C. The added C-13 ended up in all C fractions, indicating production, as well as loss of all fractions.
   5 The greatest CO2 and total C losses occurred under warm, well-drained conditions, in all soils. The effects of fertilizer treatment were occasionally significant but never large relative to the other treatments.
   6 Despite the long incubation under standard conditions, there was no evidence for convergence in C chemistry among soils as indicated by changes in relative abundances of the four C fractions.
   7 Large and constant rates of C loss even after 4 'seasons' of incubation suggest that a large portion of the C pool is potentially mineralizable in all soil types.
   8 Warming of the Arctic climate and associated thawing of permafrost and the increase in soil drainage have the potential to cause a large release of C. This C, currently stored in soil organic matter, will be released to the atmosphere, creating a positive feedback on future climate changes.

AB Arctic tundra ecosystems are currently facing amplified rates of climate warming. Since these ecosystems store significant amounts of soil organic carbon, which can be mineralized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), rising temperatures may cause increasing greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. To understand how net the ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 will respond to changing climatic and environmental conditions, it is necessary to understand the individual responses of the processes contributing to NEE. Therefore, this study aimed to partition NEE at the soil-plant-atmosphere interface in an arctic tundra ecosystem and to identify the main environmental drivers of these fluxes. NEE was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and further into autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic respiration (R-H). The study examined CO2 flux data collected during the growing season in 2015 using closed-chamber measurements in a polygonal tundra landscape in the Lena River Delta, northeastern Siberia. To capture the influence of soil hydrology on CO2 fluxes, measurements were conducted at a water-saturated polygon center and a well-drained polygon rim. These chamber-measured fluxes were used to model NEE, GPP, R-eco, R-H, R-A, and net primary production (NPP) at the pedon scale (1-10 m) and to determine cumulative growing season fluxes. Here, the response of in situ measured R-A and R-H fluxes from permafrost-affected soils of the polygonal tundra to hydrological conditions have been examined. Although changes in the water table depth at the polygon center sites did not affect CO2 fluxes from R-H, rising water tables were linked to reduced CO2 fluxes from R-A. Furthermore, this work found the polygonal tundra in the Lena River Delta to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2 during the growing season. The NEE at the wet, depressed polygon center was more than twice that at the drier polygon rim. These differences between the two sites were caused by higher GPP fluxes due to a higher vascular plant density and lower R-eco fluxes due to oxygen limitation under water-saturated conditions at the polygon center in comparison to the rim. Hence, soil hydrological conditions were one of the key drivers for the different CO2 fluxes across this highly heterogeneous tundra landscape.

AB Mangroves are biogenic systems that accumulate sedimentary sequences, where cores can provide records of mangrove species variation in distribution with past climate change and sea-level change. Fossil evidence used forpalaeoecological reconstruction is basedon organic remains that preserve identifying features so that they can be identified to generic levels at least. This includes macrofossils such as fruit, flowers, wood or leaves, or microfossils particularly pollen. Anaerobic conditions in mangrove sediment allow the long-term preservation of these fossil records. Fossil pollen from core samples is concentrated for microscopic examination by use of standard chemical treatments, but refinements of these are necessary for the peculiarities of mangrove peat. Pollen diagrams are expressed in concentrations, or more usefully in mangrove environment as proportions relative to others, its this has been shown to demonstrate the depositional environment actually underneath the mangrove forest. Radiocarbon dating of sedimentary sequences is used to date palaeoecological successions shown by fossil sequences, or long-term sedimentation rates. sediment accretion in the last 50-200 years can been analysed better using Cs-137 and Pb-210) analyses. From pollen and macrofossils mostly recovered from stratigraphic cores of sedimentary rock and more recent sediment, the evolution and dispersal of mangroves through geological time has been reconstructed. While reconstruction of actual temperatures in these earlier records is associative to the fossil types present, it is apparent that mangroves have always been tropical species, extending to higher latitudes only during global warm periods. Many sedimentary records show mangroves deeper than the present lower limit of man,,rove growth at mean sea-level. These indicate sea-level rising over time, and mangroves keeping pace with rising sea-level. Stratigraphic dating shows accretion rates of 1 min a(-1) for low island locations, and up to 1.5 min a(-1) in high islands/continental margins. Sedimentary records can also show die-off of mangroves with more rapid sea-level rise and replacement by open water during rising sea-level, landward retreat of mangrove zones, or replacement of mangroves by freshwater forest with sedimentary infill. The causes of mangrove community changes identified in the palaeoccological record can only be inferred by comparison with ecological studies in the modern environment, the link between the two that may be possible through long-term mangrove monitoring being poorly established.

AB Aim Evaluate the hypothesis that nine disjunct vascular plant species along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains and in the Peace River District of west-central Alberta represent remnants of more southerly vegetation that occupied these areas during the Holocene Hypsithermal (9000-6000 yr bp). Alternatively, these plants represent populations that became established because of independent chance dispersal events.
   Location This study focuses on the area east of the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in the Province of Alberta and the State of Montana in western Canada and USA, respectively.
   Methods Disjunct species were identified and their distributions mapped based on a review of occurrence maps and records, botanical floras and checklists, herbaria specimens, ecological and botanical studies, and field surveys of selected species. A disjunct species was defined as a plant population separated from its next nearest occurrence by a distance of > 300 km. Evaluation of the hypothesis was based on a review of published and unpublished pollen stratigraphy and palaeoecological studies. The potential geographical distribution of Hypsithermal vegetation was based on modern regional-based ecosystem mapping and associated monthly temperature summaries as well as future climatic warming models.
   Results The hypothesis was compatible with Holocene pollen stratigraphy, Hypsithermal permafrost and fen occurrence, and palaeosol phytolith analyses; and future global climatic warming models. Modelled regional Hypsithermal vegetation based on a 1degreesC increase in July temperatures relative to current conditions, indicated that much of the boreal forest zone in Alberta could have been grassland, which would explain the occurrence of Prairie species in the Peace River District. This amount of latitudinal vegetation shift (6.5degrees) was similar to an earlier Hypsithermal permafrost zone location study. An equivalent shift in vegetation along the eastern Cordillera would have placed south-western Montana-like vegetation and species such as Boykinia heucheriformis (Rydb.) Rosend. and Saxifraga odontoloma Piper within the northern half of the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, which represents the location of modern-day disjunct populations of these species.
   Main conclusions Warmer and drier climatic conditions during the Holocene Hypsithermal resulted in the northward displacement of vegetation zones relative to their current distribution patterns. Most of Alberta was probably dominated by grasslands during this period, except the Rocky Mountains and northern highlands. Modern-day species disjunctions within the Rocky Mountains and Peace River District as well as more northerly areas such as the Yukon Territory occurred when the vegetation receded southward in response to climatic cooling after the Hypsithermal. Wind dispersal was considered an unlikely possibility to explain the occurrence of the disjunct species, as most of the plants lack morphological adaptations for long distance transport and the prevailing winds were from west to east rather than south to north. However, consumption and transport of seeds by northward migrating birds could not be excluded as a possibility.

AB Plant litter (including standing litter) modification plays a vital role in wetland carbon (C) balance, which can be greatly altered by global change. Our knowledge of the fundamental function of plant litter in ecosystem respiration (Re) is crucial for evaluating C exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere. However, it is not well understood how litter manipulation could influence the dynamics of Re and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in wetland ecosystems. In the present study, we conducted a field manipulation experiment with the following treatments of total aboveground plant litter removal (ALR), standing litter exclusion (AR), doubled plant litter (DL) and unchanged litter input (CK) to study the effects of wetland plant litter on Re and Q(10) values over two growing seasons (2015 and 2016) in a Deyeuxia angustifolia-dominated freshwater marsh in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. Results showed that wetland Re was significantly affected by different plant litter input manipulations. During the two growing seasons, the Re ranged from 27.16 to 643.61 (ALR), 39.61-690.25 (AR), 136.27-1270.38 (DL) and 72.11-862.42 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) (CK), which decreased by 28.36-68.04% and 15.11-63.23% of the ALR and AR treatments and increased by 15.41-20.59% of the DL treatment compared with CK, respectively. The changes in Re was more susceptible to litter removal effects. In 2016, the mean Re values of ALR and AR treatments decreased significantly compared with the corresponding values in 2015, while it was significantly increased in the DL treatment. The concentrations of NH4+ and DOC, as microbes directly used carbon and nitrogen sources in soil pore water were significantly affected by litter input manipulations suggesting that there are various carbon and nitrogen sources within and outside the plant litter. The Q(10) values of Re under each litter input manipulation treatment differed markedly, and the highest value (3.32-4.06) occurred in the total plant-derived litter input removal treatments indicating that the wetland soil was vulnerable to disturbance that prone to carbon losses in the context of global warming. Our results also demonstrated that the Q(10) values of the deeper soil (below 15 cm) with vegetation present were lower than that for the other litter removal treatments implying the important function of the carbon sink in this wetland ecosystem. Overall, we recommend that the role of wetland plant litter input to the soil system should be seriously considered when predicting biosphere-atmosphere C exchange model under the background of global climate change.

AB The Amsterdam area, a highly manipulated delta area formed by polders and reclaimed lakes, struggles with high nutrient levels in its surface water system. The polders receive spatially and temporally variable amounts of water and nutrients via surface runoff, groundwater seepage, sewer leakage, and via water inlets from upstream polders. Diffuse anthropogenic sources, such as manure and fertiliser use and atmospheric deposition, add to the water quality problems in the polders. The major nutrient sources and pathways have not yet been clarified due to the complex hydrological system in lowland catchments with both urban and agricultural areas. In this study, the spatial variability of the groundwater seepage impact was identified by exploiting the dense groundwater and surface water monitoring networks in Amsterdam and its surrounding polders. A total of 25 variables (concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH4, NO3, HCO3, SO4, Ca, and Cl in surface water and groundwater, N and P agricultural inputs, seepage rate, elevation, land-use, and soil type) for 144 polders were analysed statistically and interpreted in relation to sources, transport mechanisms, and pathways. The results imply that groundwater is a large source of nutrients in the greater Amsterdam mixed urban-agricultural catchments. The groundwater nutrient concentrations exceeded the surface water environmental quality standards (EQSs) in 93% of the polders for TP and in 91% for TN. Groundwater outflow into the polders thus adds to nutrient levels in the surface water. High correlations (R-2 up to 0.88) between solutes in groundwater and surface water, together with the close similarities in their spatial patterns, confirmed the large impact of groundwater on surface water chemistry, especially in the polders that have high seepage rates. Our analysis indicates that the elevated nutrient and bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater seepage originate from the decomposition of organic matter in subsurface sediments coupled to sulfate reduction and possibly methanogenesis. The large loads of nutrient-rich groundwater seepage into the deepest polders indirectly affect surface water quality in the surrounding area, because excess water from the deep polders is pumped out and used to supply water to the surrounding infiltrating polders in dry periods. The study shows the importance of the connection between groundwater and surface water nutrient chemistry in the greater Amsterdam area. We expect that taking account of groundwater-surface water interaction is also important in other subsiding and urbanising deltas around the world, where water is managed intensively in order to enable agricultural productivity and achieve water-sustainable cities.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and energy balance are examined to investigate the functional responses of a mature mangrove forest to a disturbance generated by Hurricane Wilma on October 24,2005 in the Florida Everglades. At the EC site, high winds from the hurricane caused nearly 100% defoliation in the upper canopy and widespread tree mortality. Soil temperatures down to 50 cm increased, and air temperature lapse rates within the forest canopy switched from statically stable to statically unstable conditions following the disturbance. Unstable conditions allowed more efficient transport of water vapor and CO2 from the surface up to the upper canopy layer. Significant increases in latent heat fluxes (LE) and nighttime net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were also observed and sensible heat fluxes (H) as a proportion of net radiation decreased significantly in response to the disturbance. Many of these impacts persisted through much of the study period through 2009. However, local albedo and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) data (the Enhanced Vegetation Index) indicated a substantial proportion of active leaf area recovered before the EC measurements began 1 year after the storm. Observed changes in the vertical distribution and the degree of clumping in newly emerged leaves may have affected the energy balance. Direct comparisons of daytime NEE values from before the storm and after our measurements resumed did not show substantial or consistent differences that could be attributed to the disturbance. Regression analyses on seasonal time scales were required to differentiate the storm's impact on monthly average daytime NEE from the changes caused by interannual variability in other environmental drivers. The effects of the storm were apparent on annual time scales, and CO2 uptake remained approximately 250g C m(-2) yr(-1) lower in 2009 compared to the average annual values measured in 2004-2005. Dry season CO2 uptake was relatively more affected by the disturbance than wet season values. Complex leaf regeneration dynamics on damaged trees during ecosystem recovery are hypothesized to lead to the variable dry versus wet season impacts on daytime NEE. In contrast, nighttime CO2 release (i.e., nighttime respiration) was consistently and significantly greater, possibly as a result of the enhanced decomposition of litter and coarse woody debris generated by the storm, and this effect was most apparent in the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. The largest pre- and post-storm differences in NEE coincided roughly with the delayed peak in cumulative mortality of stems in 2007-2008. Across the hurricane-impacted region, cumulative tree mortality rates were also closely correlated with declines in peat surface elevation. Mangrove forest-atmosphere interactions are interpreted with respect to the damage and recovery of stand dynamics and soil accretion processes following the hurricane. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Drained thaw lake basins (DTLB's) are the dominant land form of the Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska. The presence of continuous permafrost prevents drainage and so water tables generally remain close to the soil surface, creating saturated, suboxic soil conditions. However, ice wedge polygons produce microtopographic variation in these landscapes, with raised areas such as polygon rims creating more oxic microenvironments. The peat soils in this ecosystem store large amounts of organic carbon which is vulnerable to loss as arctic regions continue to rapidly warm, and so there is great motivation to understand the controls over microbial activity in these complex landscapes. Here we report the effects of experimental flooding, along with seasonal and spatial variation in soil chemistry and microbial activity in a DTLB. The flooding treatment generally mirrored the effects of natural landscape variation in water-table height due to microtopography. The flooded portion of the basin had lower dissolved oxygen, lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and higher pH, as did lower elevation areas throughout the entire basin. Similarly, soil pore water concentrations of organic carbon and aromatic compounds were higher in flooded and low elevation areas. Dissolved ferric iron (Fe(III)) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas and responded to the flooding treatment in low areas, only. The high concentrations of soluble Fe(III) in soil pore water were explained by the presence of siderophores, which were much more concentrated in low elevation areas. All the aforementioned variables were correlated, showing that Fe(III) is solubilized in response to anoxic conditions. Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas, but showed only subtle and/or seasonally dependent effects of flooding. In anaerobic laboratory incubations, more CH4 was produced by soils from low and flooded areas, whereas anaerobic CO2 production only responded to flooding in high elevation areas. Seasonal changes in the oxidation state of solid phase Fe minerals showed that net Fe reduction occurred, especially in topographically low areas. The effects of Fe reduction were also seen in the topographic patterns of pH, as protons were consumed where this process was prevalent. This suite of results can all be attributed to the effect of water table on oxygen availability: flooded conditions promote anoxia, stimulating dissolution and reduction of Fe(III), and to some extent, methanogenesis. However, two lines of evidence indicated the inhibition of methanogenesis by alternative e- acceptors such as Fe(III) and humic substances: (1) ratios of CO2:CH4 evolved from anaerobic soil incubations and dissolved in soil pore water were high; (2) CH4 concentrations were negatively correlated with the oxidation state of the soluble Fe pool in both topographically high and low areas. A second set of results could be explained by increased soil temperature in the flooding treatment, which presumably arose from the increased thermal conductivity of the soil surface: higher N mineralization rates and dissolved P concentrations were observed in flooded areas. Overall, these results could have implications for C and nutrient cycling in high Arctic areas where warming and flooding are likely consequences of climate change.

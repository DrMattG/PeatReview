AB A Typha-dominated marsh bordering Lake Ontario had a strong hydraulic connection with the lake during spring 1991, when the water level was more than 10-20 cm above the marsh surface.  During this period, water-level changes were dominated by the general decline of Lake Ontario, by short-term fluctuations caused by seiche activity (1.7 h periodicity) and by setup (diurnal).  These were transmitted into the marsh at 65-135 m h-1.  The water surface profile was generally flat over the marsh during this period but water depth was uneven owing to peat surface adjustment.  High buoyancy of the surface in the 30 m margin adjacent to the lake minimized water depth there.  By 21 June, water depth at the margin was essentially zero, but elsewhere was 0.07-0.1 m; all water exchanges between the marsh and lake were thereafter constrained to relatively slow subsurface flow (approximately 10(-3)-10(-4) m h-1).  Short-term fluctuations caused by lake-level variability were then restricted to the margin.  The Lake Ontario water level then dropped faster than that on the marsh, as did the water table on the adjacent mineral terrain, resulting in an upwardly convex water surface profile on the marsh, where water flow was away from the marsh.  Between 14 June and 6 August, 116 mm of rain and 264 mm of evapotranspiration resulted in 30 mm of lateral water loss from the marsh centre; only 1 mm was lost at the marsh margin, reflecting the frequent reversals of hydraulic gradient there.

AB Vegetation-environment relationships were investigated in fens of the Trebon basin (Czech Republic), which are enriched by nutrients and calcium from intensively managed and limed fishponds to test the hypothesis of altered gradient structure after long-term nutrient enrichment in fens. Water-table depth, pH, conductivity, N-NH4+, N-NO3-, 4 total P, SO42-, K, Ca, Mg and Fe were measured four times in 30 vegetation plots of 16 m(2) during the 2004 vegetation season. Both constrained and unconstrained ordination (DCA, CCA) were used to relate environmental factors to the species composition of the vegetation. The relationships among particular factors were revealed using PCA. Four fen vegetation types obtained by TWINSPAN classification were compared with measured factors using repeated measures ANOVA. Vegetation types differed significantly in water-table depth, water pH and Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and N-NO3- content. The concentration of major nutrients fluctuated noticeably during vegetation season and displayed large variation within vegetation types. Temporarily the concentration of different nutrients reached extremely high values. However, high nutrient supply has not altered the gradient structure of the vegetation. Water pH and water-table depths were found to be two major determinants of species variation in fishpond-margin fens, as in the majority of other environments studied throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Species richness of both vascular plants and bryophytes was partly explained by pH. However, the extent of variation in total mineral richness and potassium concentration were the next two most important variables determining bryophyte species richness. Water in flooded poor-fen vegetation, directly affected by water from limed fishponds, had calcium and magnesium concentration similar to fishpond water. The calcium concentrations of about 20 mg l(-1) in typical poor-fen vegetation have no analogy in the ecological literature. High phosphorus level presumably buffers the effect of calcium by enhancing bryophyte biomass depositing superfluous calcium. In conclusion, extremely high long-term nutrient supply to fishpond-margin fens have not altered gradient structure, but shifted chemical limits of plant communities.

AB Analyses of plant macrofossils, peat humification and testate amoebae were used to reconstruct a proxy climate record spanning the last 7500 years from an ombrotrophic bog, Temple Hill Moss, in southeast Scotland. The plant macrofossil data were subjected to detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) which modelled effectively the significant wet shifts within the record. A mean water table depth transfer function was applied to the testate amoebae data to provide quantifiable changes. The three proxy records show coherent phase changes which are interpreted as variability in past effective precipitation. Two tephra horizons (Glen Garry and Lairg A) were used in conjunction with radiocarbon dates to construct an age/depth model, producing a robust geochronology from which a time series was calculated. The palaeoclimatic reconstruction identified major wet shifts throughout the Holocene, with specific events occurring around cal. 6650, 5850, 5300, 4500, 3850, 3400, 2800-2450, 1450-1350 and 250-150 BP. Spectral analysis of the plant macrofossil DCA and colorimetric humification data produced a millennial scale periodicity of 1100 years. The same periodicity has also been found in a palacoclimatic reconstruction from a site in Cumbria (Walton Moss), and may be linked with millennial scale periodicities found in oceanic palaeoclimatic records.

AB Monitoring peatland restoration can be labour intensive, and monitoring activities can result in further disturbance, suggesting that remote sensing can play an important role in assessing ecosystem responses to restoration efforts. In this study, we assessed the response of plant phenological parameters for Burns Bog, a highly disturbed peatland in Western Canada, to restoration efforts. We evaluated the potential for rewetting of disturbed areas to reverse impacts from prior drainage by assessing hydroclimatic controls of precipitation and water table height fluctuations in concert with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) parameters obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer platform. Three transects, at different stages of rewetting were used in this study: a control transect with undisturbed native bog vegetation, and transects over disturbed areas with rewetting efforts begun in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, impacts from a fire event occurring in one of the rewetted transects were investigated. Results showed that rewetting was an efficient restoration procedure for Burns Bog, with both water table height and peat coverage increasing in the rewetted areas. Both rewetted transects are exhibiting characteristics in line with increased Sphagnum coverage in response to rewetting, with NDVI values ranging from 0.5 during the wet season to 0.9 during the growing season and with ET around 450mm y(-1). Additionally, changes in NDVI and ET were strongly correlated to precipitation, temperature and the change in water table height at each transect. We found that NDVI was more effective than ET for investigating the impacts of disturbance events (e.g., fires in the bog), whereas ET provided a better index to monitor the ecohydrological functioning of the bog in response to restoration efforts.

AB The Everglades of south Florida is a patterned peatland that has undergone major hydrologic modification over the last century, including both drainage and impoundment. The Everglades ridge and slough patterns were originally characterized by regularly spaced elevated ridges and tree islands oriented parallel to water flow through interconnected sloughs. Many areas of the remaining Everglades have lost this patterning over time. Historical aerial photography for the years 1940, 1953, 1972, 1984, and 2004 provides source data to measure these changes over six decades. Maps were created by digitizing the ridges, tree islands, and sloughs in fifteen 24 km(2) study plots located in the remaining Everglades, and metrics were developed to quantify the extent and types of changes in the patterns. Pattern metrics of length/width ratios, number of ridges, and perimeter/area ratios were used to define the details and trajectories of pattern changes in the study plots from 1940 through 2004. These metrics characterized elongation, smoothness, and abundance of ridges and tree islands. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was used to categorize these 75 maps (15 plots by 5 years) into five categories based on a suite of metrics of pattern quality. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling, an ordination technique, confirmed that these categories were distinct with the primary axis distinguished primarily by the abundance of elongated ridges in each study plot. Strong patterns like those described historically were characterized by numerous, long ridges while degraded patterns contained few large, irregularly shaped patches. Pattern degradation usually occurred with ridges fusing into fewer, less linear patches of emergent vegetation. Patterning improved in some plots, probably through wetter conditions facilitating expression of the underlying microtopography. Trajectories showing responses of individual study plots over the six decades indicated that ridge and slough patterns can degrade or improve over time scales of a decade or less. Changes in ridge and slough patterns indicate that (1) patterns can be lost quickly following severe peat dryout, yet (2) patterns appear resilient at least over multi-decadal time periods; (3) patterns can be maintained and possibly strengthened with deeper water depths, and (4) the sub-decadal response time of pattern changes visible in aerial imagery is highly useful for change detection within the landscape. This analysis suggests that restoration of some aspects of these unique peatland patterns may be possible within relatively short planning time frames. Use of aerial photography in future Everglades restoration efforts can facilitate restoration and adaptive management by documenting sub-decadal pattern changes in response to altered hydrology and water management.

AB We investigated: a) the hydrology of a small Sphagnum mire located in a transitional climate in Eastern Europe, and b) the relationships between the local climate and hydrology of the mire. We hypothesized that temperature is the most important factor determining water table changes in this type of peatland in an exceptional biogeographic setting. Research on the Linje mire revealed that the groundwater table was predominantly influenced by air temperature, which determines the rate of evapotranspiration, particularly in summer. Another important physical factor that significantly influences the variation in groundwater table of the mire is the permeability of the surface deposits. Moreover, the vegetation (especially Sphagnum) also has a modifying influence. Our study is the first of this kind in the young glacial area of Poland as well as in Eastern Europe. There is a need to improve precision of the study by installing automatic data loggers, as well as to intensify monitoring of the mire and its surroundings in order to obtain a better picture of the relationships between the mire and forest management in its vicinity. Furthermore, in the future we plan to extend the monitoring to hydrochemistry and microbial indicators (e.g. testate-amoebae and bacteria) to use the ecosystem approach in management of this valuable site.

AB Strategies for sustainable water resources management require integration of hydrological, ecological and socioeconomic concerns. The "Water for all" project has sought to develop a multi-disciplinary science case for innovative management of water levels and flows in a lowland catchment in Scotland. Water demands of arable agriculture, protection from flood risk and conservation needs of lowland mesotrophic wetlands needed to be considered. Water management strategy focused on the outlet zone of Balgavies lake in Eastern Scotland, where the Lunan Water discharges into a partially confined common channel (lade). Water releases to a mill, to the downstream river, and to floodplain wetlands (Chapel Mires) are partially controlled by an existing weir. Based on observations of management of this weir, we postulated that upgrading hydraulic management in this zone could reduce upstream flood risk, help protect mesotrophic wetlands and facilitate downstream water supply at low flows. We considered potential for: (a) installing a remotely operated tilting weir, for improved management of release and routing of flows from the common lade; (b) dredging of the common lade in combination or instead of the tilting weir. Rapid ecological assessment and mixing analysis of the Lunan Water with waters in Chapel Mires showed a gradient of trophic status across the wetlands linked to impact of river-borne nutrients. Stage-discharge relationships, derived from steady-state approximations of the in-channel hydraulics, showed that the proposed tilting weir had potential to divert seasonal nutrient rich water from the upstream Lake away from Chapel Mires. Significant impact of the proposed weir on upstream flood risk was not demonstrated, but carrying out dredging of the channel reduced the current observed probability of upstream flooding. The proposed weir could help to maintain these dredging benefits. Survey and interviews with catchment stakeholders and residents showed constructive interest in the scheme, with half of the respondents willing to pay to support its implementation. The survey also revealed concerns about the proposed project, especially its long-term governance. The lessons learned have wider relevance to development of an integrated approach to water ecosystem services provision, especially where benefits are uncertain and thinly spread across a range of users.

AB The distribution patterns of epiphytic diatom assemblages in three montane mires in central China were investigated to examine their relationships with selected environmental variables (pH and depth to water table, DWT). Two of the mires are considered to be in good ecological condition (Dajiuhu and Qizimeishan Mires) while Erxianyan Mire is extensively affected by acid deposition and human activities. A total of 206 taxa belonging to 56 genera were found in 44 Sphagnum samples. Multivariate analysis revealed that pH and DWT were significantly correlated with diatom distribution. In Erxianyan Mire, the characteristic taxa (Eunotia minor and Eunotia intermedia) had lower pH optima and may therefore be useful indicators of highly-acidic conditions. In Dajiuhu Mire, the dominant species had higher pH optima, and abundant xerotolerant taxa (Hantzschia amphioxys, Pinnularia borealis, Luticola mutica and Diadesmis contenta) were observed. In the partial canonical correspondence analyses with mire location as a covariable, the correlation between diatom data and pH was insignificant, likely because pH differences between mires were greater than those within mires. In contrast, diatom data were significantly correlated with DWT, suggesting that diatoms are good sensors of hydrological variability along the hollow to hummock gradient. Together, these data can expand current autecological information for these potential diatom indicator species, which is critical for refining our interpretations of bio-monitoring and palaeolimnological studies in montane mires.

AB Hydrochemical patterns across groundwater-fed wetlands, especially carbonate and redox gradients, can influence phosphorus (P) availability by controlling its distribution among different soil pools. We explored these linkages by comparing shallow (5-20 cm) soil properties along groundwater flowpaths in two rich fens, a marl fen, and a poor fen. Organic matter content, bulk density, and total elemental content varied more with depth to underlying drift materials than with water table fluctuation, but also were influenced by groundwater discharge, which stabilized water table elevations and controlled redox conditions. Total sulfur and calcium content increased where pore-water chemistry indicated active iron and sulfate reduction. Calcium mineral dynamics, however, did not appear to influence P availability: first, calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) accounted for < 2% of the soil composition, except in the marl fen where it accounted for 20-25% of the soil composition. Second, Ca-bound P pools, determined from hydrochloric extraction of wet soil samples, accounted for < 25% of the inorganic soil P pool. In contrast, iron-bound P determined from bicarbonate-buffered dithionite solution, accounted for 50-80% of the inorganic soil P, and increased where there was evidence of groundwater mixing, as did P release rates inferred from incubated anion resin bags. The total carbon and phosphorus content of organic-rich soils as well as available and labile P pools were strongly correlated with pore-water iron and alkalinity concentrations. Groundwater discharge and resulting hydrochemical gradients explained significant variation in soil composition and P availability across each site. Results highlight the importance of conducting biogeochemical studies in the context of a site's shallow geologic setting and suggest mechanisms supporting the diverse plant species unique to groundwater wetlands.

AB The loss of phosphorus (P) from agricultural soils can lead to serious eutrophication of surface water. Within the large river delta areas in Northern Belgium, The Netherlands and North-West Germany, a number of representative soil textures are found (sandy, peaty and clayey soils), each with its own specific combination of pathways for P loss. Based on a literature review, this paper describes for these areas the main eutrophication issues and the factors affecting P loss from these agricultural soils. Aspects of P input, legislation and water quality are discussed. On sandy soils, intensive animal production systems have led to the localized build-up of P in the soil profile with subsequent leaching to shallow groundwaters, and seepage into surface waters. Regulations for production and application of manure on these soils have led to improvements in surface water quality in the last decade, but P concentrations are still too high to maintain satisfactory ecological standards in water. On peat soils, the mineralization of organic matter in the topsoil or in the subsoil can release large amounts of P, leading to high concentrations of P in surface water. However, large P losses can also occur in seepage water from peat deposits in marine sediments containing easily-soluble calcareous P minerals. On clays, incidental losses of P are dominant: surface runoff or preferential flow can lead to loss of freshly applied P, even from soils that are known to have a large retention capacity for P.

AB Soil surface CO2 flux was measured in hollow and hummock microhabitats in a peatland in north central Minnesota from June to October in 1991. We used a closed infrared gas exchange system to measure soil CO2 flux. The rates of CO2 evolution from hummocks (9.8 +/- 3.5 g m-2 d-1, [mean +/- SE]) were consistently higher than those from hollows (5.4 +/- 2.9 g m-2 d-1) (the hummock values included the contribution of moss dark respiration, which may account for 10-20% of the total measured flux). The soil CO2 flux was strongly temperature-dependent (Q10 almost-equal-to 3.7) and appeared to be linearly related to changes in water table depth. An empirical multiplicative model, using peat temperature and water table depth as independent variables, explained about 81% of the variance in the CO2 flux data. Using the empirical model with measurements of peat temperature and estimates of hollow/hummock microtopographic distribution (relative to water table elevation), daily rates of ''site-averaged'' CO2 evolution were calculated. For the six-month period (May-October), the total soil CO2 released from this ecosystem was estimated to be about 1340 g CO2 m-2.

AB The importance of soil heterogeneity for methane emission from a wetland soil is assessed by in situ point measurements of depth-specific O-2 and CH4 concentrations and simultaneous soil CH4 fluxes at contrasting water levels. Profile measurements, and associated assumptions in their interpretation, were validated in a controlled mesocosm drainage and saturation experiment applying planar O-2 optodes and membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Results show that peat soil is heterogeneous containing dynamic macropore systems created by both macrofauna and flora, which facilitate preferential flow of water, O-2 and CH4 and vary temporally with changes in the moisture regime. The O-2 content above the water table after drainage varied horizontally from 0 to 100% air saturation within few mm. Oxic zones were observed below the water level and anoxic zones were observed in layers above the water level in periods up to days after changes in the water level. This study shows that although water table position is a competent proxy of soil CH4 fluxes at larger spatio-temporal scales, it becomes inadequate at higher spatial resolution, i.e. at the scale of the soil pedon and below. High resolution O-2 measurements using planar O-2 optodes have great potential to enhance our understanding of the effect of the water table position on O-2 dynamics on scales of several cm to mm in wetland soils.

AB Monitoring high latitude wetlands is required to understand feedbacks between terrestrial carbon pools and climate change. Hydrological variability is a key factor driving biogeochemical processes in these ecosystems and effective assessment tools are critical for accurate characterization of surface hydrology, soil moisture, and water table fluctuations. Operational satellite platforms provide opportunities to systematically monitor hydrological variability in high latitude wetlands. The objective of this research application was to integrate high temporal frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and high spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) observations to assess hydroperiod at a mire in northern Sweden. Geostatistical and polarimetric (PLR) techniques were applied to determine spatial structure of the wetland and imagery at respective scales (0.5 m to 25 m). Variogram, spatial regression, and decomposition approaches characterized the sensitivity of the two platforms (SAR and LiDAR) to wetland hydrogeomorphology, scattering mechanisms, and data interrelationships. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART), based on random forest, fused multi-mode (fine-beam single, dual, quad pol) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and LiDAR-derived elevation to effectively map hydroperiod attributes at the Swedish mire across an aggregated warm season (May-September, 2006-2010). Image derived estimates of water and peat moisture were sensitive (R-2 = 0.86) to field measurements of water table depth (cm). Peat areas that are underlain by permafrost were observed as areas with fluctuating soil moisture and water table changes.

AB Decomposition of organic substances is one of the main processes responsible for the signatures of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in soils and peats. However, the applicability of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures at the natural abundance level as indicators of the degree of peat decomposition is still debatable. We evaluated delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth patterns of peat cores sampled at nine sites in two nearby Alpine peat bogs with varying degree of organic matter degradation. Based on water table depths and past drainage intensities, the peat cores were divided into three degradation classes. We found similar overall depths patterns of delta C-13 and delta N-15 across the nine depth profiles and distinct differences between aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. Considerable differences in stable C and N isotope signatures of same depths were detected between profiles of the three classes, whereas depth profiles of peat cores with similar degree in peatland degradation were nearly identical. In the aerobic peat layers, delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased with depths at all study sites from 2.6 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.2 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15 compared to the initial signatures of the plant biomass. Standardised delta C-13 of aerobic layers differ distinctly between slightly degraded pests at the open peat bog area, intermediately degraded peats at the tree-covered edge areas and strongly degraded pests at the former peat-cutting site. delta C-13 signatures of aerobic layers of strongly degraded pests were markedly more negative compared to the slightly degraded peats because of the selective C-12 losses by microbial respiration. delta N-15 were more positive at strongly degraded than at slightly degraded sites in both, aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. The uniform stable isotope ratios in the anaerobic layers deeper than the local maxima of the isotopic signatures support the assumption that minor C-13 fractionation occurs under anaerobic conditions. delta C-13 slightly declining with depth in the waterlogged layers of strongly degraded peat reflects the preferential utilisation and loss of labile organic compounds enriched in C-13. delta N-15 of strongly degraded pests was higher compared to well-conserved peat The close relationship between the measured delta N-15 to delta N-15 modelled based on C:N ratios and bulk densities supports the assumption that the delta N-15 signature is the result of isotopic fractionation by peat decomposition. We conclude that peat decomposition strongly affects the delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth profiles of peat bogs and most likely overrides other factors, such as differences between plant species, litter components, atmospheric delta C-13 shift during peat formation, temperature effects, or type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

AB We studied the effect of ditch blocking on vegetation composition and water-table depths in a blanket peatland. Measurements were made for a period of four years (water tables) and five years (vegetation) in the inter-ditch areas of three experimental treatments: (i) open ditches, (ii) ditches blocked with closely-spaced dams and (iii) ditches partially infilled with peat and blocked with dams. It is often assumed that ditch blocking will lead to an increase in the abundance of Sphagnum and, potentially, a reduction in the abundance of sedges, particularly the cotton grasses. However, our data show no treatment effects on the abundance of either group. We did find an effect of time, with the abundance of both sedges and Sphagnum spp. varying significantly between some years. For the sedges there was no systematic change over time, while for the Sphagnum spp. abundance tended to increase through the study period. This systematic change was not related to a measure of the vigour of the sedges, although vigour was lower towards the end of the study compared to the beginning. Our vegetation data are consistent with our water-table data. As with plant type abundance, we did not find any statistically significant differences in water-table depths between treatments, both for annual averages and summer averages. We comment on why ditch blocking does not seem to have affected water tables and vegetation composition at our study site.

AB Peatlands are a large natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4), and the sedge Carex rostrata plays a critical role in the production, oxidation, and transport of CH4 in these systems. This 4 year clipping experiment examined the changes in CH4 emissions from a temperate peatland after removing all aboveground C. rostrata biomass. Methane fluxes, dissolved CH4, and environmental variables were measured during spring, summer, and fall from 2008 to 2011. Clipping and removing the C. rostrata leaves and stems caused an immediate decrease in CH4 emissions that persisted over 4 years of this study. There was a strong seasonal trend in CH4 flux, with the largest treatment effects occurring during the fall months when the sedges were senescing. As expected, there was a strong positive correlation between C. rostrata green-leaf area and CH4 flux, implying that the presence of C. rostrata increases CH4 emissions from this peatland. Large interannual variability in vegetation distribution and biomass, water table depth, and temperature was observed in this study, indicating the importance of multiyear studies for understanding the interactions among these factors to determine how they could be incorporated into biogeochemical models to predict CH4 emissions under changing environmental conditions.
   Key Points
   Clipping aboveground sedge biomass decreases methane emissions from wetlands Carex rostrata has greatest impact on methane emissions during fall senescence

TI IODINE AND MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS IN AN ORGANIC SOIL
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Iodine-129 in groundwater discharging from a geologic disposal vault could accumulate in wetlands by chemical sorption onto low pH, highly organic solid surfaces or by direct or indirect microbial processes. Previous work indicated that saturation of anion sorption sites, microbial toxicity, or swamping of the I reduction/oxidation reaction decreased the retention of a wetland sphagnum for iodine with increased iodine porewater concentrations. Bog water and peat of an iodine-rich bog were studied to elucidate the role of micro-organisms in the retention and accumulation of iodine in a temperate wetland.
   Agar plate culture of a wide spectrum of microbes, including yeasts and moulds, with bog groundwater showed anaerobes to be more sensitive to high iodine concentrations than aerobes. Toxicity to anaerobes may occur at 110 mg Ilitre(-1) groundwater. Although iron-related and slime-forming bacteria were not affected at 2000 mg Ilitre(-1), iodine was toxic to sulphate-related bacteria (SRB), as indicated by Biological Activity Reaction Tests. A 50% reduction in the SRB population occurred at groundwater concentrations of 75 mg Ilitre(-1). Microbe enumeration in iodine-rich bog groundwater, using acridine orange staining, showed that the native wetland microbe population was sensitive to concentrations in excess of 200 mg Ilitre(-1) groundwater. Three independent experiments confirm the toxicity threshold concentration for anaerobic and native microbes is similar to 100 mg Ilitre(-1) groundwater. Iodine sorption to fresh peat was slightly slower and more limited under anoxic conditions. Autoclaving the peat, reinoculation following autoclaving and a sucrose addition all inhibited iodine sorption. These results suggest that microbes may only play a minor and indirect role in iodine sorption through the decomposition of organic matter.

AB A detailed examination of the brown coal fades preserved in the Latrobe Valley Morwell 1B seam indicates that the type of peat-forming environment and the associated hydrological regime are the main factors influencing the development of lithotypes in brown coal deposits. New palynological data from the Morwell 1B seam suggests that each respective lithotype in the lightening-upwards lithotype cycles was deposited in a particular depositional environment that was characterised by a distinct floral community. The laminated dark lithotype represents a fire-prone emergent marsh that grew on the margins of a coastal lagoon and/or freshwater swamp. This fades grades into the dark lithotype, representing the transition from a meadow marsh to a periodically flooded ombrogenous forested bog. The medium and lighter lithotypes are interpreted as being deposited in an angiosperm-dominated ombrogenous forest bog that was intolerant of fire. These peat forming environments are interpreted as being largely controlled by moisture and relative depth to water table. Each environment produces distinct lithotypes and lightening-upwards cycles are interpreted as terrestrialization cycles. As the peat grew upwards and above the water table, less moist conditions prevailed and lighter lithotypes were produced. The observed change in colour, from darker to lighter lithotypes, results from the environment evolving from anaerobic/inundated to less anaerobic/less moist settings via terrestrialization. The thin and laterally extensive light and pale lithotypes that top the cycles are interpreted to represent a residual layer of concentrated, oxidation resistant peat-forming elements that result from intense weathering and aerobic degradation of the peats. At a generic level, modern lowland bogs of South Westland in New Zealand have remarkably similar floral/ecological gradients to those of the Oligo-Miocene Morwell 1B brown coal cycles in Australia. This suggests that modern New Zealand bogs can be used as floral/ecological analogues in order to better understand these Oligo-Miocene peatland environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Water discolouration is a major management problem for UK water companies as a proportion of the supply relies on runoff from peat-covered catchments. Many peats have been drained using surface ditches but this has been shown to lead to more severe water discolouration. Drain-blocking is now actively encouraged in UK peatlands to promote peatland habitats and water companies are considering funding drain-btocking if water colour benefits can be demonstrated. However, there is concern that rewetting of the peat may lead to a sudden flush of water colour from the peat causing problems for water treatment works downstream. This study tested different drain-blocking techniques in an upland peat catchment and evaluated the impact of drain-blocking on water colour production immediately after drain-blocking. The study started sampling prior to the blocking of the drains and continued for 10 months afterwards. It was shown that drain-blocking significantly increased water tables in the vicinity of the drains. Drain-blocking approximately doubled water colour within blocked drains, a difference that was sustained across the entire study period. Whenever runoff occurred from a blocked drain it was always more discoloured than prior to blocking. However, during the 10 months following drain-blocking no catchment scale change in river water colour could be determined. No drain-blocking technique was demonstrably better or worse than any other with respect to water colour and percentage of time for which there was flow in the drain. Therefore, if more drain-btocking is undertaken then the most economical methods, using peat turves, should be adopted. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The storage of low level radioactive waste in trenches overlying an unconfined groundwater how system in sands has generated a contaminant plume (with chemical characteristics of dilute sanitary landfill leachate) containing C-14 both as dissolved inorganic and organic C. In the groundwater, dissolved organic compounds account, on average, for 22% of the total C and 10% of the C-14. Approximately 300 m from the waste management site, the groundwater discharges to the surface in a wetland containing up to 3 m of peat and an extensive tree cover. Drainage from the wetland passes through a gauged stream. Radiocarbon input to the groundwater discharge area in 1991 was determined to be between 3.3 and 4.2 GBq, based on data from a line of sampling wells along the groundwater input boundary of the wetland, with control provided by water and tritium balance data. During the 1991 study year, only 1.5-2% of both the inorganic and organic C-14 inputs left the wetland in surface water drainage. Vegetation growth in the wetland during the study year contained 8-10% of the released radiocarbon. If the rate of C accumulation in the peat has been constant, 7-9% of the annual radiocarbon input has been retained in the organic soil. Much of this soil accumulation can be attributed to litter from standing vegetation, making distribution coefficients an inappropriate model for C-14 partitioning between groundwater and soil. The plant/soil C-14 concentration ratio was 24 to 33, but application of a concentration ratio to describe the transfer of radiocarbon to plants is also believed to be inappropriate. This study indicates that over 80% of the groundwater radiocarbon is rapidly lost to the atmosphere when the groundwater comes to surface, and we infer that most of the C-14 accumulation in vegetation occurs by CO2 transfer from the air to the plant.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought is projected to increase within the boreal region under future climatic conditions. Peatlands are widely considered to regulate water loss under drought conditions, increasing surface resistance (r(s)) and reducing evaporative losses. This maintains peat moisture content, increasing the resilience of these globally important carbon stores. However, the magnitude and form of this important negative feedback response remains uncertain. To address this, we monitored the response of r(s) to drought within four peat cores under controlled meteorological conditions. When the water-table was dropped to a depth of 0.30m and the humidity reduced to <= 40%, a step shift in r(s) from similar to 50 s m(-1) up to 1000 s m(-1) was observed within burned and unburned peat, which virtually shuts down evaporation, limiting water loss. We show that measured near-surface tension cannot be used to directly calculate this transition in peat surface resistance. However, empirical relationships that account for strong vertical variations in tension through the near-surface and/or disequilibrium between pore air and near-surface pore water pressure provide the potential to incorporate this negative feedback response into peatland ecohydrological models. Further observations are necessary to examine this response under dynamic atmospheric conditions. We suggest that the link between surface temperature and evaporation provides potential to further examine this feedback in either burned peatlands or peatlands with a low vascular vegetation cover.

AB Black spruce (Picea mariana) is the most abundant tree species in the boreal biome. but little is known about how climate warming may change recruitment in peatlands, especially those affected by permafrost thaw. We used results from a seven-year study in northern Manitoba, Canada, to address the following questions: (1) What is the relative importance of early life history transitions oil P. mariana recruitment? (2) How are these transitions mediated by biological and environmental factors, including competition, facilitation, disease, herbivory, water table depth, and soil nutrients'? (3) Do interactions among these factors create additional recruitment limitations beyond those imposed by environmental factors changing with climate warming, Such as hydrology? Seed rain was measured over six years on forested permafrost plateaus and in neighboring collapse sear bogs. Seed germination and seedling survival' and growth were measured over 4-5 years in collapse scars and assessed across a three-level water table treatment. Survival and growth experiments examined additional combinations of above- and belowground vascular plant competition and fertilizer addition. Results showed that failure of germination and survival on growing moss surfaces and reduced survival of seedlings in wetter microsites were primary constraints. Seed influx was significantly lower in collapse scars but likely did not limit recruitment. Biological and environmental factors mediating these life history transitions also differed in relative importance, and interactions among them tended to amplify recruitment limitation. Seedling survival was most strongly controlled by fast-growing mosses in wet microsites but also was influenced by apparent drowning, in wet plots, herbivory, and loss of foliage caused by a fungal pathogen. Seedling growth was strongly controlled by water table depth, nutrient and competition levels, and fungal pathogens. Multiple, interacting factors will affect P. mariana establishment in boreal peatlands during climate warming. Generalizations about recruitment relying on few environmental gradients sensitive to climate change, such as water table, may therefore not fully capture the complexities of establishment.

AB Testate amoebae are routinely used as paleoenvironmental indicators. However, considerable variability occurs in test morphology, even within commonly identified taxa. Relationships between morphological variability and environmental conditions might be useful in paleohydrological studies of peatlands, assuming good preservation of characteristics. Hyalosphenia papilio is a common taxon, well preserved in Sphagnum peatlands, that displays variability in the number of pores on the broad side of the test. We assessed whether variability in pore number was related to substrate moisture by comparing the abundance of individuals with different numbers of pores to measured water-table depths at 67 sites in North America. Results indicated that the abundance of individuals with higher numbers of pores increased in wetter conditions. Individuals with 2 pores were relatively widespread, although they dominated drier habitats. Transfer functions developed with and without pore-number quantification suggest that when communities contain abundant individuals with greater than 2 pores, water-table depth reconstructions can be improved by including pore-number information. Results have implications for peatland paleohydrological studies and suggest that greater exploitation of morphological variability could improve testate amoeba-based reconstructions of past environmental change.

AB The prediction of methane emissions from high-latitude wetlands is important given concerns about their sensitivity to a warming climate. As a basis for the prediction of wetland methane emissions at regional scales, we coupled the variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrological model (VIC) with the biosphere-energy-transfer-hydrology terrestrial ecosystem model (BETHY) and a wetland methane emissions model to make large-scale estimates of methane emissions as a function of soil temperature, water table depth, and net primary productivity (NPP), with a parameterization of the sub-grid heterogeneity of the water table depth based on TOPMODEL. We simulated the methane emissions from a 100 km x 100 km region of western Siberia surrounding the Bakchar Bog, for a retrospective baseline period of 1980-1999 and have evaluated their sensitivity to increases in temperature of 0-5 degrees C and increases in precipitation of 0-15%. The interactions of temperature and precipitation, through their effects on the water table depth, played an important role in determining methane emissions from these wetlands. The balance between these effects varied spatially, and their net effect depended in part on sub-grid topographic heterogeneity. Higher temperatures alone increased methane production in saturated areas, but caused those saturated areas to shrink in extent, resulting in a net reduction in methane emissions. Higher precipitation alone raised water tables and expanded the saturated area, resulting in a net increase in methane emissions. Combining a temperature increase of 3 degrees C and an increase of 10% in precipitation to represent climate conditions that may pertain in western Siberia at the end of this century resulted in roughly a doubling in annual emissions.

AB The evaporation regimes of two northern New Zealand raised peat bogs with vegetation dominated by the restionaceous rush Sporadanthus traversii were investigated. One of the bogs is unmodified while the other is affected by the drainage practices of surrounding agricultural land. Measurements of the latent heat flux obtained concurrently with Bowen ratio and eddy covariance techniques were in close agreement, and good energy balance closure was demonstrated when there was adequate fetch. Evaporation rates and energy partitioning behaviour were similar for the two bogs despite differences in water table elevation and peat moisture content. Evaporation rates averaged 2.9 mm day(-1), equivalent to 55% of the equilibrium evaporation rate. Energy balance partitioning favoured the sensible heat flux, and Bowen ratios of around 2 were common. The importance of the latent heat flux in the energy balance depended on the state of canopy wetness following frequent rainfall events. When the canopy was completely wet, evaporation rates approximated, or exceeded, the equilibrium evaporation rate. Evaporation rates were evidently constrained by a combination of plant physiological and canopy structural factors which combined to prevent high rates of evaporation from the moist peat surface. These findings provide evidence of strong canopy-hydrological feedbacks within the raised peat bogs of northern New Zealand which result in conditions favourable for peat formation.

AB Fluxes of the three main greenhouse gases (GHG) CO2, CH4 and N2O from peat and other soils with high organic carbon contents are strongly controlled by water table depth. Information about the spatial distribution of water level is thus a crucial input parameter when upscaling GHG emissions to large scales. Here, we investigate the potential of statistical modeling for the regionalization of water levels in organic soils when data covers only a small fraction of the peatlands of the final map. Our study area is Germany. Phreatic water level data from 53 peatlands in Germany were compiled in a new data set comprising 1094 dip wells and 7155 years of data. For each dip well, numerous possible predictor variables were determined using nationally available data sources, which included information about land cover, ditch network, protected areas, topography, peatland characteristics and climatic boundary conditions. We applied boosted regression trees to identify dependencies between predictor variables and dip-well-specific long-term annual mean water level (WL) as well as a transformed form (WLt). The latter was obtained by assuming a hypothetical GHG transfer function and is linearly related to GHG emissions. Our results demonstrate that model calibration on WLt is superior. It increases the explained variance of the water level in the sensitive range for GHG emissions and avoids model bias in subsequent GHG upscaling. The final model explained 45% of WLt variance and was built on nine predictor variables that are based on information about land cover, peatland characteristics, drainage network, topography and climatic boundary conditions. Their individual effects on WLt and the observed parameter interactions provide insight into natural and anthropogenic boundary conditions that control water levels in organic soils. Our study also demonstrates that a large fraction of the observed WLt variance cannot be explained by nationally available predictor variables and that predictors with stronger WLt indication, relying, for example, on detailed water management maps and remote sensing products, are needed to substantially improve model predictive performance.

AB This work describes laboratory experiments aimed at evaluating the feasibility of removing heavy metals from metal-contaminated water in flow-through microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with peat moss as a source of organic carbon. MECs were assembled in upflow glass columns containing granular activated carbon (GAC) bioelectrodes preceded by a layer of peat moss. The MECs were fed with metal-contaminated surface water collected at a firing range. At hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 4-6 days, up to 99 % removal of Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe was observed. The removal efficiency of Zn and Cu declined at an HRT of 1.7 days, while effluent Pb concentration remained below the detection limit for all of the HRTs tested. Metal extraction from MEC compartments showed an accumulation of metals in both the peat moss layer and the GAC cathode, i.e., the removal was achieved by a combination of anaerobic and bioelectrochemical pathways of metal reduction. A proliferation of sulphate reducing bacteria in the peat moss layer and electroactive species in GAC electrodes was confirmed by biomolecular analysis. The proposed flow-through system, which combines sulphate-reducing and electroactive microbial activities to achieve near-complete metal removal, can be used for removing a broad range of heavy metals from contaminated water in a low-cost passive flow treatment system.

AB Plant succession triggered by drainage, which results in the expansion or invasion of vascular plants, has been reported from many peatlands. However, the effects of the vascular plant's expansion on evapotranspiration (ET), which is a key component of the water balance of ombrotophic bog, are still contradictory. To investigate the effects, ET was measured at a Sphagnum-dominated bog and an adjacent transition peatland dominated by Sasa, dwarf bamboo, in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, using the eddy covariance technique during the four growing seasons from 2007 through 2010. Cumulative gap-filled ET during a snow-free period of 6.5 months was 362(2008) and 374 mm (2010) at the Sphagnum site and 300 (2008) and 372 mm (2010) at the Sasa site. In the mid-growing season (late June to mid-September) with the highest leaf area index (LAI) at the Sasa site, ET was 2.14 +/- 0.03 (mean 1 standard deviation of the four years) and 1.92 +/- 0.19 mm d(-1), respectively, at the Sphagnum and Sasa sites. ET was smaller at the Sasa site, except for 2010 with an unusual hot wet summer; mean air temperature and precipitation were higher than their 30-year normal values by 1.75 degrees C and 172 mm, respectively. At the Sphagnum site, ET was stable despite such interannual variation in meteorological conditions. However, ET increased significantly at the Sasa site in 2010 probably because of LAI increase due to the enhanced growth of Sasa plants. The ET increase at the Sasa site suggests that ET will increase at the Sasa-dominated area, if the future warming environment accompanies more precipitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Even after the drastic decrease in the application of mineral fertilizers at the beginning of the 1990s, the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in many rivers remained at undesirable and unexpectedly high levels. The investigation showed that drained peat soils are an important source of nitrogen export to the surface waters. Runoff of nitrogen from drained peat soils is, on average, 1.5-fold higher than from agricultural lands in Estonia.

AB Peatlands cover 3% of the earth's land surface but contain 30% of the world's soil carbon pool. Microbial communities constitute a crucial detrital food web for nutrient and carbon cycling in peatlands. Heterotrophic protozoans are considered top predators in the microbial food web; however, they are not yet well understood. In this study, we investigated seasonal dynamics in the community and the trophic structure of testate amoebae in four peatlands. Testate amoebae density and biomass in August were significantly higher than those in May and October. The highest density, 6.7 x 10(4) individual g(-1) dry moss, was recorded in August 2014. The highest biomass, 7.7 x 10(2) mu g Cg(-1) dry moss, was recorded in August 2013. Redundancy analyses showed that water-table depth was the most important factor, explaining over one third of the variance in fauna communities in all sampled seasons. High trophic position taxa dominated testate amoebae communities. The Shannon diversity index and community size structure index declined from August to October in 2013 and from May to October in 2014. These seasonal patterns of testate amoebae indicated the seasonal variations of the peatlands' microbial food web and are possibly related to the seasonal carbon dynamics in Northeast Chinese peatlands.

AB Significant volumes of terrigenous organic matter can be preserved to form coals only when and where the overall increase in accommodation approximately equals the production rate of peat, Accommodation is a function of subsidence and base level, For mires, base level is very specifically the groundwater table, In paralic settings, the groundwater table is strongly controlled by sea level and the precipitation/evaporation ratio. Feat accumulates over a range of rates, but always with a definite maximum rate set by original organic productivity and space available below depositional base level (groundwater table).
   Below a threshold accommodation rate (nonzero), no continuous peats accumulate, due to falling or low groundwater table, sedimentary bypass, and extensive erosion by fluvial channels. This is typical of upper highstand, lowstand fan, and basal lowstand-wedge systems tracts. Higher accommodation rates provide relatively stable conditions with rising groundwater tables. Mires initiate and thrive, quickly filling local accommodation vertically and expanding laterally, favoring accumulation of laterally continuous coals in paralic zones within both middle lowstand and middle highstand systems tracts, If the accommodation increase balances or slightly exceeds organic productivity, mires accumulate peat vertically, yielding thicker, more isolated coals most likely during of late lowstand-early transgressive and late transgressive-early highstand periods, At very large accommodation increases, mires are stressed and eventually inundated by clastics or standing water (as in middle transgressive systems tracts),
   These relations should be valid for mires in all settings, including alluvial, lake plain, and paralic, The tie to sea level in paralic zones depends on local subsidence, sediment supply, and groundwater regimes, These concepts are also useful for investigating the distribution of seal and reservoir facies in nonmarine settings.

AB A model framework for national greenhouse gas emission and removal estimation for Canadian peatlands (CaMP v2.0) was developed and tested. It provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) developed to eventually replace the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) as the core model in Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System. The CaMP (v2.0) provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories. It tracks the growth, turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components (foliage, branches, stems, and roots of trees, shrubs, sedges and mosses). It uses a Q(10) relationship to model peat C pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature, and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth. The CaMP takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally-available Canadian Fire Weather Index Drought Code to predict long-term and annual water table depth. The CaMP (v2.0) provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version. Model behavior and sensitivity were assessed, and evaluated against observed flux data. Results suggest that the CaMP (v2.0) provides an appropriate structure for large spatial- and temporal-scale estimation of emissions, owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables, and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals. Methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites), and by 8 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 12 sites, >= 3 years of data per site). The model overestimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 20 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites), and by 2 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 11 sites, >= 3 years of data per site), and results demonstrate that inter-site variation is greater than temporal variation across NEE measures. Several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer-scale emission estimates. Recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re-calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize NPP rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types, as well as developing a national annual-scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature (Q(10)) decay relationship currently used in the CaMP (v2.0). Data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual-scale meta-data. Future work is required to include permafrost dynamics, as well as additional natural, and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Peatlands are found around the world and cover similar to 3.4% of the Earth's surface. In the UK, peatlands cover 17.2% or similar to 1.58 Mha of the land surface and occur mainly in upland areas covering the headwaters of most major British rivers. However, large areas are now subject to prescribed vegetation burning despite policy guidance that recommends a strong presumption against burning on deep blanket peat. Wildfires occur sporadically but are forecast to increase in frequency in the future. This paper provides a synthesis of current knowledge about how UK peatland-dominated river catchments respond to fires caused by prescribed vegetation burning and uncontrolled wildfire. We provide insight into the effects of fire on the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biota of peatland river ecosystems, and the peatland-soil-driven controls on these effects at the catchment scale. Burning increases the depth to water table and water-table variability, although some small-scale studies indicate shallower water table in some places. More work is needed on fire effects on peatland river flow, but recent results suggest a complex response with smaller flow peaks for burned systems associated with most rainfall events, but enhanced peaks compared to unburned systems for the top quintile of rainfall events with the largest total rain. Evidence from biogeochemical studies suggests that fire leads to increased dissolved organic C concentrations in rivers. River biota responses primarily include significant reductions in the density of grazing mayflies but increases among detritivores including Chironomidae and Baetis mayflies. We provide a conceptual synthesis that links the main responses of terrestrial and aquatic systems to fire, and we summarize some major research gaps that should be prioritized to inform future policy around peatland management.

AB Rooting depth, watertable depth and oxygen regime were measured in plots of Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and a 50% mixture of each species planted on a deep unflushed blanket peat.  The water-table was about 10 cm deeper and roots occurred about 2 cm deeper under the pine than under the spruce or the mixture.  In addition the mean concentration of oxygen at 50 cm depth was significantly larger under the pine and the mixture than under the spruce, showing that the rapid early growth of the pine had started to dry the peat.  There was no evidence of any improvement in the growth of the spruce in the mixture compared to the pure Sitka spruce, suggesting that the expected nursing benefit had not occurred.

AB Wetlands are a major contributor to the global methane (CH4) budget, currently there is a consensus view that drought restrains CH4 emissions from wetlands. However, a 6-year field experiment investigating the effects of persistent summer water table drawdown on a gully mire in mid-Wales, U.K. demonstrated a 2-year "boom and bust" cycle of CH4 emissions followed by a recovery during the third year, when compared with emissions from a control wetland in which the water table remained at or above the peat surface. This cyclical trend was subsequently replicated by the control wetland following natural summer drought. The experimental wetland was affected less by this natural drought following previous water table drawdown. Depth profiles of CH4 production suggested that consecutive water table drawdown resulted in a translocation of peak methanogen activity lower down the peat profile, where emissions were affected less by subsequent drawdown. These findings suggest that wetland CH4 flux models need to consider the possibility that methane emission-water table relationships are dependent on the pattern and frequency of drought events.

AB The external drivers and internal controls of groundwater flow in the thawed "active layer" above permafrost are poorly constrained because they are dynamic and spatially variable. Understanding these controls is critical because groundwater can supply solutes such as dissolved organic matter to surface water bodies. We calculated steady-state three-dimensional suprapermafrost groundwater flow through the active layer using measurements of aquifer geometry, saturated thickness, and hydraulic properties collected from two major landscape types over time within a first-order Arctic watershed. The depth position and thickness of the saturated zone is the dominant control of groundwater flow variability between sites and during different times of year. The effect of water table depth on groundwater flow dwarfs the effect of thaw depth. In landscapes with low land-surface slopes (2-4%), a combination of higher water tables and thicker, permeable peat deposits cause relatively constant groundwater flows between the early and late thawed seasons. Landscapes with larger land-surface slopes (4-10%) have both deeper water tables and thinner peat deposits; here the commonly observed permeability decrease with depth is more pronounced than in flatter areas, and groundwater flows decrease significantly between early and late summer as the water table drops. Groundwater flows are also affected by microtopographic features that retain groundwater that could otherwise be released as the active layer deepens. The dominant sources of groundwater, and thus dissolved organic matter, are likely wet, flatter regions with thick organic layers. This finding informs fluid flow and solute transport dynamics for the present and future Arctic.
   Plain Language Summary Groundwater flow in permafrost watersheds is potentially a key component of global carbon budgets because permafrost soil stores vast amounts of carbon that could be mobilized due to a warming climate and the corresponding increase in soil thaw. In addition to carrying carbon, groundwater can supply important nutrients and solutes to surface waters. However, we do not yet understand the factors that control groundwater flow in soils above permafrost because saturation changes rapidly and continuously, and soil hydraulic properties are largely unknown. We created measurement-informed calculations of groundwater flow from areas of permafrost with different characteristics and found that soil types, which vary based on the slope of the land surface, are the most important control. Near-surface soils were identical in hillslopes and valleys, whereas deeper soils in hillslopes allowed for less groundwater flow than in valleys. In early summer, when only the near-surface soils were thawed, groundwater flows in the hillslopes and valley were similar. In late summer, when the deeper soil was thawed, groundwater flow in the valley remained high, but flow in the hillslope was negligible. Our observations also showed that small mounds on the land surface caused groundwater to be trapped behind underground ice dams.

AB Weekly monitoring of surface water chemistry took place over a one-year period in a small boggy sub-catchment of the River Thurso, northern Scotland. Monitoring started 6 months after the felling to waste of plantation conifers. The chemistry of ground surface waters was monitored at four bog sites situated in former forestry plots as well as one control site situated in an intact bog. The chemistry of the receiving stream (Sleach Water) was monitored at seven points along a 2 km stretch.
   Dissolved organic carbon and metals were very significantly affected by seasonal factors. On land, seasonal variations accounted for between 35% (Al) and 80% (Fe) of the total variance in the data at the intact bog site, with similar seasonal effects observed at the impacted sites. The amplitude of the seasonal signal was generally much higher at the impacted sites than at the control site.
   Except for dissolved Al and Mn, the chemical composition of the stream was only marginally influenced by surface runoff from the felled plantation despite evidence of intense seasonal mobilisation of e.g. DOC. K or Fe at or near the ground surface within the felled plots. This was attributed to the presence of a buffer zone between the plantation and the stream. On the other hand, surface inputs from former forestry plots caused measurable increases in stream water (Al) and [Mn]. The likely sources of Al and Mn were the disturbance of the mineral soil that had taken place some 20 years previously as a result of forestry ground preparation and the leaching from the recently felled conifer material, respectively. Such inputs occurred in late autumn or winter for Al and in summer for Mn, thus intensifying their natural seasonal patterns in this peat draining stream. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
ID FLOWS; WALL
AB The problem of conjugate heat transfer involving mired convection laminar ascending flow of water in inclined circular tubes uniformly heated on their outer surface has been studied numerically using a unified formulation for the solid and fluid domains. The highly coupled governing equations were discretized using the control volume approach, and solved according to the SIMPLER algorithm. Results have clearly demonstrated that the conduction within the tube wall has an important influence on both the hydrodynamic and thermal fields. High wall thermal conductivity or large thickness reduces the temperature stratification within the fluid and intensifies the secondary motion, consisting of two symmetrical vortices. The effects of wall conduction are particularly significant for horizontal tubes for which the average Nusselt number is bounded by two limits corresponding to the cases of infinite wall thermal conductivity and zero wad thermal conductivity. For Gr = 2 x 10(5) these limits are 10.42 and 9.03, respectively. These effects are negligible for tubes inclined at 30 degrees and for Grashof number below 3 x 10(4).

AB Analyses of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were used to assess variation in community structure and total microbial biomass in two boreal peatlands in Sweden, The total PLFA concentration in peat ranged from 0.16 to 7.0 nmol g of wet peat(-1) L (median, 0.70 nmol g of wet peat(-1)). Principal-component analysis of PLFA data revealed that the degree of depth-related variation in PLFA composition was high among peatland habitats, with general differences between wet sites, with water tables within a few centimeters of the moss surface, and dry sites, with water tables >10 cm below the moss surface, However, variation in PLFA composition over the growing season was negligible, In the principal-component analyses, most PLFAs were determined to be parts of clusters of covarying fatty acids, suggesting that they originated in the same functional groups of microorganisms, Major clusters were formed by monounsaturated (typical of gram-negative eubacteria), terminally branched (gram-positive or anaerobic gram-negative eubacteria), methyl-branched and branched unsaturated (sulfate-reducing bacteria and/or actinomycetes), omega 8 monounsaturated (methane-oxidizing bacteria), and polyunsaturated (eucaryotes) PLFAs, Within the clusters, PLFAs had rather distinct concentration-depth distributions, For example, PLFAs from sulfate-reducing bacteria and/or actinomycetes and those from methane-oxidizing bacteria had maximum concentrations slightly below and at the average water table depth, respectively.

AB Ecological restoration has great potential for reversing anthropogenic degradation, as it aims at the simultaneous recovery of several ecosystem functions and services. However, it can be challenging to evaluate multiple restoration targets based on a high number of indicators, and this calls for a multifunctionality approach. Multifunctionality is an integrated measure of the relative supply of multiple ecosystem functions or services. As temporal aspects are of key importance for ecosystem recovery, we analyzed multifunctionality against time since restoration. We used rewetted peatlands in a mountainous region in Central Germany as a study case. Restored peatlands are expected to become multifunctional, while their recovery is rather slow. We investigated to what extent rewetted peatlands recover, and how time since restoration controls the simultaneous development of multiple ecosystem properties. We studied restored peatlands with respect to plant diversity, water table, peat decomposition, water holding capacity, and nutrient level using a chronosequence of 0-18 yr after restoration. We analyzed the development of individual properties and of a combined index. We further compared the recovery of restored sites at different ages to an intact reference peatland and to a theoretical optimum value, defined as the mean of the eleven most desirable values observed. Eleven out of 13 peatland properties and the combined index significantly evolved with time since restoration. Nevertheless, we could not observe a consistent trend of multiple properties if aiming at highest levels of functioning, whereas there was progress with time if low or intermediate functioning is targeted. Our results show that not all functions of restored peatlands can recover to the most desirable extent within 18 yr. However, the average functionality and some individual properties achieved levels comparable to the reference site, highlighting that improvement is possible. While the integrated assessment informs about the degree of ecosystem recovery, an additional analysis of individual properties helps understanding ecosystem-specific dynamics, which are needed for making decisions on potential future management.

AB The vegetation within an ombrotrophic mire expanse in SE Norway is studied in detail. Presence/absence of species and depth to the water table are recorded for 6976 plots (4 x 4 cm). The cumulative probability distributions along the water-table gradient are calculated for 24 species, and inter-transect variability tested. Shifts in realised depth to the water table (niche shifts) are frequent for most species. It is concluded that interactions are of minor importance for species in the field layer. The Sphagnum spp. possess some attributes indicating equilibrium, while others indicate ongoing competition. The patchy distribution of hepatics and lichens depend on chance and successional stage, and coexistence within these guilds depend on creation of new naked peat patches.

AB [1] In the last two decades the beneficial aspects of constructed treatment wetlands have been studied extensively. However, the importance of restored wetlands as a best management practice to improve the water quality of storm water runoff has only recently been appreciated. Furthermore, investigating surface water/groundwater interactions within wetlands is now acknowledged to be essential in order to better understand the effect of wetland hydrology on water quality. In this study, the development of a general comprehensive wetland model Wetland Solute Transport Dynamics (WETSAND) that has both surface flow and solute transport components is presented. The model incorporates surface water/groundwater interactions and accounts for upstream contributions from urbanized areas. The effect of restored wetlands on storm water runoff is also investigated by routing the overland flow through the wetland area, collecting the runoff within the stream, and transporting it to the receiving water using diffusion wave routing techniques. The computed velocity profiles are subsequently used to obtain water quality concentration distributions in wetland areas. The water quality component solves the advection-dispersion equation for several nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, and it also incorporates the surface water/groundwater interactions by including the incoming/outgoing mass due to the groundwater recharge/discharge. In addition, output from the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) is incorporated into this conceptual wetland model to simulate the runoff quantity and quality flowing into a wetland area from upstream urban sources. Additionally, the model can simulate a water control structure using storage routing principles and known stage-discharge spillway relationships.

AB There are not many studies that report water movement in freezing peat. Soil column studies under controlled laboratory settings can help isolate and understand the effects of different factors controlling freezing of the active layer in organic covered permafrost terrain. In this study, four peat Mesocosms were subjected to temperature gradients by bringing the Mesocosm tops in contact with subzero air temperature while maintaining a continuously frozen layer at the bottom (proxy permafrost). Soil water movement towards the freezing front (from warmer to colder regions) was inferred from soil freezing curves, liquid water content time series and from the total water content of frozen core samples collected at the end of freezing cycle. A substantial amount of water, enough to raise the upper surface of frozen saturated soil within 15 cm of the soil surface at the end of freezing period appeared to have moved upwards during freezing. Diffusion under moisture gradients and effects of temperature on soil matric potential, at least in the initial period, appear to drive such movement as seen from analysis of freezing curves. Freezing front (separation front between soil zones containing and free of ice) propagation is controlled by latent heat for a long time during freezing. A simple conceptual model describing freezing of an organic active layer initially resembling a variable moisture landscape is proposed based upon the results of this study. The results of this study will help in understanding, and ultimately forecasting, the hydrologic response of wetland-dominated terrain underlain by discontinuous permafrost.

AB Nitrate leaching from agricultural land leads to oxidiation of FeSx in FeSx-containing subsoils resulting in SO42- mobilisation. Pollution of the groundwater with SO42- causes a higher availability of o-PO43-, eutrophication and loss in biodiversity in groundwater fed fens with stagnating surface water. Under natural conditions, fens along the river Meuse are continuously fed by groundwater that besides SO42- mostly also contains high concentrations of NO3- and bivalent cations (Ca2+ and mg(2+)). During summer groundwater input is restricted resulting in periodic drought. Under these conditions no SO42- induced o-PO43- eutrophication occurs. Periodic drought and a high discharge of NO3-, have a strong effect on S and P biogeochemistry in sulphate-rich fens. NO3- inhibits SO42- reduction and concomitant o-PO43- mobilisation in fen sediments by being an energetically more favourable electron acceptor. In addition, NO3- is capable of oxidising reduced Fe compounds, including FeSx, increasing the amount of oxidised Fe in the sediment capable of binding o-PO43- Periodic drought is important in reincreasing the concentration of oxidised Fe in the top layer of S-rich sediments preventing o-PO43- mobilisation and an undesirable vegetation development. Damming of surface water, in order te restore desiccated sulphate-rich fens, prevents periodic drought and decreases groundwater input. This leads to NO3- depletion, stimulation of SO42- reduction, Fe depletion, o-PO43- mobilisation and, in contrast to what was hoped for, in massive growth of algae, lemnids and fast growing wetland grasses. Therefore discharge of NO3--rich groundwater and the fluctuation of the water table are vital for successful restoration of desiccated sulphate-rich fens. Successful rewetting of these type of fens, without causing stagnation of surface water and without preventing periodic drought, can be achieved by raising the water table to levels below the potential groundwater table using a controllable dam.

AB Drained peatlands aremajor sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet the effects of land management and hydrological extremes have been little-studied at spatial scales relevant to agricultural enterprises. We measured fluxes of CO2 using the eddy covariance (EC) technique at two adjacent dairy farms on a drained peatland in Aotearoa New Zealand with remaining peat depths 5.5-8 m. One site (SD) had shallow surface drains and mean water table depth (WTD) -657 mm, while the other site (BD) had deep field border drains and mean WTD -838 mm. Net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) was similar at the two sites when the soils were moist but diverged during late-summer drying, with site BD having 4.56 t C ha(-1) greater CO2 emission than site SD over the four-month dry period. Soil drying reduced gross primary production (GPP) at both sites, while ecosystem respiration (ER) was reduced at site SD but not at site BD. The low dry season respiration rates at site SD contributed to near-zero annual NEP, while higher respiration rates at site BD led to annual CO2 loss of -4.95 +/- 0.59 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Accounting for other imports and exports of carbon, annual net ecosystem carbon balances were -2.23 and -8.47 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) at sites SD and BD, respectively. It is likely that the contrasting dry season respiration rates resulted from differences in soil physical properties affecting soil moisture vertical redistribution and availability to plants and microbes rather than from the relatively small differences in WTD. These differences could be caused by soil physical disturbances during pasture renewal or paddock recontouring, or time since initial drainage. Therefore, improved soil management might provide practical mitigation against excessive CO2 emissions during dry conditions, including droughts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The anastomosing system of the upper Narew River consists of a network of interconnected channels. The channels are relatively deep (width/depth ratio 2-10), straight to sinuous, and they lack natural levees. They are characterised by a low water slope and very low stream power. The river is distinctly bedload-dominated and the transport of suspended clastic fines is minimal. Channel deposits consist almost exclusively of medium- to coarse-grained sand. Laterally extensive interchannel areas are flat and covered with,peat-forming vegetation. These stable wetlands are flooded for many weeks during high water stages. Except for the channels, the valley fill consists of peat layer reaching 4 m in thickness. The rate of vertical aggradation of the peat deposit is estimated at 1-1.5 mm/year. The radiocarbon dating indicates that the peat layer is predominantly late Holocene in age. The impact of vegetation on the system is overwhelming. Vegetation produces an erosion-resistant peat layer, stabilizes channel banks and slows down the. water flow. Vegetation also stimulates aggradation of bedload material on the channel bottom, and contributes to avulsion by blocking the channels. The channel network owes its origin to repeated though infrequent avulsion. Avulsion in the,studied system is a small-scale, gradational and slow process. New channels evolve very slowly because of unfavourable hydrologic conditions and the presence of a resistant peat substratum. A new channel eventually intercepts only a part of the flow, while the old channel is still active, though to a limited extent. Although newly formed channels might subsequently be abandoned, long-lasting ones predominate within the system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands in the mid-Atlantic outer coastal plain region contain obligate hydrophyte species which were harvested and replaced by facultative tree species. The Great Dismal Swamp was drained from the colonial era until 1974, when water levels were partially restored. In September 2013, further restoration consisting of two large weirs followed extensive peat-burning fires. This study evaluated depth-to-water-table and vegetation structure both prior to and following weir operation. Wells were installed and depth-to-water-table was recorded continuously from 201.3 to 2015 within six of the 16 forested stands where vegetation species dominance was quantified for tree, shrub, herb, and vine strata. Following weir installation in 2013, water tables rose an average of 28.08 cm in 2014 and 32.69 cm in 2016, during the June-July peak of the growing season. Most water levels were too low to meet the federal regulatory indicator of wetland hydrology or the seasonally flooded, saturated hydrologic regime typical of peatlands. After restoration, species dominance and frequency, as well as metrics based on hydrophyte dominance and floristic quality in study plots, were unchanged. Ordinations detected no directional shift in plant community composition among pre- and post-weir periods. Although insufficient time may have passed for shifts in plant communities, additional increases in water level above those reported here appear necessary to restore a pre-disturbance hydrologic regime and plant community structure. However, above some threshold water level, planted trees will exhibit increased mortality and limit reestablishment.

AB Seven samples of coal seam 1 and oil shale 1 from the fault-controlled Hangxiang Basin have been analysed by coal petrographic and geochemical methods. High huminite ratios and high contents of sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids indicate that coal seam 1 and oil shale 1 are predominantly composed of terrestrial higher plant material. Two ternary diagrams of "facies diagnostic" macerals and biomarkers were used to interpret the depositional environments of organic matter in coal seam 1 and oil shale 1. In both diagrams coal seam 1 is plotted in the forest moor zone, but the top sample of coal seam 1 shows an influence of transgressed sea water. Oil shale 1 is plotted in a transition zone from forest moor to open moor. This indicates an increased abundance of lower plants and algal derived organic matter in oil shale I relative to coal seam I. The boundary faults controlled the sedimentation in Huangxian basin. When the faults ceased to move, the peat of coal seam 1 was formed. When the faults became active again and the basin began to sink, sea water flowed into the swamps at which time oil shale 1 was deposited. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Question: In Dutch fens, species that colonize open water and induce the formation of floating peat mats have become rare. Many such riparian pioneer species occur predominantly on shorelines sheltered from the wind, whereas the majority of seeds tend to be deposited on exposed shorelines, as seeds are dispersed via wind-driven waves and currents. Do differences in germination and seedling survival between sheltered and exposed shorelines explain this difference? Location: The fen reserve ` De Westbroekse zodden' (52 10' N; 5 07' E) Methods: With a sowing experiment, the germination, seedling survival and overall recruitment of Berula erecta, Calla palustris, Comarum palustre, Glyceria maxima and Mentha aquatica were studied on sheltered and wind-exposed banks in eight fen ponds. Temperature, light availability, water level, wave impact, litter and seed deposition and vegetation height were recorded over 16 wk. The probability of washing away was quantified with small seed mimics. With a greenhouse experiment, we separately examined the effects of environmental differences between sheltered and exposed banks. Results: In the field, compared to sheltered shorelines, exposed shorelines had a higherwave impact, higher light availability in spring andmore litter and seeds deposited on them. In the greenhouse experiment, only litter addition decreased germination. This effect was overridden in the field, where the higher light availability on exposed banks increased germination. In the field, the number of seedlings decreased strongly over time, and eventual recruitment was determined by the degree to which seeds and seedlings were washed away by wave action. The probability of being washed away was highest on exposed shorelines (where waves were larger), which resulted in higher recruitment on sheltered shorelines. Conclusions: The recruitment of colonizing species to fen pond shorelines is limited by the probability that seeds and seedlings may be washed into the open water. This process can eventually cause more successful recruitment on upwind or lee-side shorelines despite lower seed inputs there.

AB Soil porewaters are a vital component of the ecosystem as they are efficient tracers of mineralweathering, plant litter leaching, and nutrient uptake by vegetation. In the permafrost environment, maximal hydraulic connectivity and element transport from soils to rivers and lakes occurs via supra-permafrost flow (i.e. water, gases, suspended matter, and solutes migration over the permafrost table). To assess possible consequences of permafrost thaw and climate warming on carbon and Green House gases (GHG) dynamics we used a "substituting space for time" approach in the largest frozen peatland of theworld. We sampled stagnant supra-permafrost (active layer) waters in peat columns of western Siberia Lowland (WSL) across substantial gradients of climate (-4.0 to -9.1 degrees C mean annual temperature, 360 to 600 mm annual precipitation), active layer thickness (ALT) (N300 to 40 cm), and permafrost coverage (sporadic, discontinuous and continuous). Weanalyzed CO2, CH4, dissolved carbon, and major and trace elements (TE) in 93 soil pit samples corresponding to several typical micro landscapes constituting theWSL territory (peat mounds, hollows, and permafrost subsidences and depressions). We expected a decrease in intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from soil and vegetation litter to the suprapermafrost waterwith increasing permafrost coverage, decreasing annual temperature and ALT along a latitudinal transect from 62.3 degrees N to 67.4 degrees N. However, a number of solutes (DOC, CO2, alkaline earth metals, Si, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates, and micronutrients (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, V, Mo) exhibited a northward increasing trend with highest concentrations within the continuous permafrost zone. Within the "substituting space for time" climate change scenario and northward shift of the permafrost boundary, our results suggest that CO2, DOC, and many major and trace elements will decrease their concentration in soil supra-permafrost waters at the boundary between thaw and frozen layers. As a result, export of DOC and elements from peat soil to lakes and rivers of the WSL (and further to the Arctic Ocean) may decrease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Golf courses represent an agricultural activity wherein grass is intensively cultivated using large quantities of fertilizers. In the present study, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching was analyzed over two years in an experimental green under actual field conditions. The green contained four plots with distinct amendments (P1: hydrogel + peat, P2: peat, P3: hydrogel, and P4: no amendment). The applied doses of nitrogen ranged from 5 to 103 kg/ha and of phosphorus from 9 to 31 kg/ha. The irrigation level varied as a function of the rainfall regime and the water requirements of grass; overall water intake varied from 1550 to 2080 mm/year. Daily, leached water volume was calculated, and samples were taken for chemical analysis. Nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances were calculated for different periods based on the collected data.
   The plot amended with peat and hydrogel (P1) had reduced water flow: the percentage of drainage water varied from 8.4 to 29%. As a result, the dissolution and leaching of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were the lowest in comparison to the other plots. According to the calculated mass balances, the lowest leaching values were also recorded in this plot (P1), ranging from 0.5 to 6.3% for N and from 0.8 to 20.9% for P. The plot without amendment (P4) drained the most water (25.9-44.8%) and leached the highest quantities of N and P. ranging from 9.1-45.7%, and 6-35.9%, respectively. The use of double amendments (hydrogel and peat) therefore represented optimal operating conditions for the green. Moreover, a relationship was found between increasing rates of fertilization and increasing percentages of N and P leaching as well as between higher irrigation levels and greater leaching.

AB Testate amoebae that inhabit peat are sensitive indicators of water table position. In this study, we used testate amoebae in sediments from a mire in the western Alps (Lac du Thyl) to: (1) reconstruct the hydrology of the site over the last 7,000 years, (2) determine how hydrological changes affected testate amoebae diversity and (3) infer past trophic state shifts. The study site is located in one of the driest valleys of the Alps and is thus very sensitive to hydrological changes. Our study revealed that the water table depth increased (dry conditions) between 5,800 and 4,000 cal year BP. This triggered establishment of a Sphagnum-type peat and acidic conditions from 5,700 to 4,000 cal year BP. These processes were independent of ongoing transformations of the terrestrial vegetation and soil in the catchment area. After 1,690 cal year BP, the depth to the water table decreased (wetter conditions) and a minerotrophic fen developed. At the same time, the diversity of testate amoebae increased, probably as a result of deforestation that supported the expansion of grassland. Climate and land use were apparently more important factors controlling the lake hydrology than were changes in vegetation and soil in the catchment. Testate amoebae diversity was linked to land cover. Changes in pH were controlled indirectly by external forcing (climate), but more directly by fluctuations in the level of the water table (internal forcing) and autogenous expansion of Sphagnum.

TI Runoff generation and water table fluctuations in blanket peat: evidence
   from UK data spanning the dry summer of 1995
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE blanket peat hydrology; water table; runoff; drought; north pennines
ID CATCHMENT; DROUGHT
AB Understanding of the hydrology of upland blanket peatlands has been limited both by the logistical difficulties of obtaining data from such environments and by technical difficulties with plot scale investigations of peat hydrology. The relative importance of infiltration-excess and percolation-excess as runoff generating mechanisms as opposed to the saturation-excess mechanism remains unclear. This study uses catchment-scale runoff data, in combination with monitoring of water table levels, to identify the relative importance of these mechanisms for an upland peat catchment within the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK. Mean runoff coefficients for the catchment are 0.4 and the hood hydrographs are flashy. Monitored water table in the catchment is within 5 cm of the surface (i.e. within the acrotelm) 93% of the time. High stream flows always occur at times of high water table suggesting that overland and near surface runoff is controlled by saturation of the catotelm rather than by infiltration capacity. Depressed rates of water table recovery at the end of a prolonged period of low water table in 1995 suggest possible physical changes once the peat has dried out. The likelihood that such periods of low water table will become more common under global warming scenarios raises concern over the impact of such changes: increased erosion, water discoloration and increased CO2 flux may result.

AB The shrinkage behavior of soils does not only affect the aggregate formation but also it alters pore size distribution and pore functions like water and gas permeability. In order to quantify this shrinkage effect both with respect to the intensity and orientation (isotropy or anisotropy) undisturbed organic and mineral soil samples (sedge peat, peat-clay, half-bog and glacial clay) in Northern Germany were analyzed. In addition to the registration of the vertical volume change during drying by means of height change measurements assuming shrinkage isotropy, digital photography and image analysis were used to consider horizontal shrinkage components including crack formation in order to calculate the 3 dimensional shrinkage geometry (=kind of anisotropy).
   The organic substrates show the highest shrinkage potential according to the COLE (coefficient of linear extensibility) with values between 0.26 and 0.43. Maximum volume decreases from saturation to complete desiccation of up to 66 vol.% (peat-clay) were calculated. In contrast to the mineral soils, the investigated sedge peat did not exhibit residual or zero shrinkage. Moreover, the soil volume decrease during desiccation partly even exceeded the water loss in case of the organic substrates (sedge peat, peat-clay) which can be attributed to mineralization.
   Shrinkage-dependent volume changes at initial desiccation were determined to be almost exclusively vertical (geometry factor r(s) = 1). During further drying, however, shrinkage led to isotropy (r(s) = 3) followed by a slight dominance of the horizontal shrinkage component. These results are true not only for shrinking mineral, but also for the tested organic soils.
   These results underline that a general assumption of a rigid pore system is hardly true. Moreover, the exclusive measurement of the shrinkage-induced soil height changes assuming shrinkage isotropy leads to a distinct overestimation of the actual shrinkage particularly at initial desiccation. Although the calculated COLE values were quite close to each other the actual shrinkage behavior differed depending on the kind of substrate and degree of initial structure.
   Thus, the consequences of the shrinkage pattern led to large differences of the moisture retention characteristics of the studied mineral and organic soils particularly at more negative matric potential values. Furthermore, the changes of the pore continuity due to shrinkage are intensely altered too and affect water flux modeling results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Late Holocene; Little Ice Age; Medieval Climate Anomaly
AB Climatic expressions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) vary regionally, with reconstructions often depicting complex spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change. The characterisation of these spatial patterns helps advance understanding of hydroclimate variability and associated responses of human and natural systems to climate change. Many regions, including north-eastern North America, still lack well-resolved records of past hydrological change. Here, we reconstruct hydroclimatic change over the past millennium using testate amoeba-inferred peatland water table depth reconstructions obtained from fifteen peatlands across Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Quebec. Spatial comparisons of reconstructed water table depths reveal complex hydroclimatic patterns that varied over the last millennium. The records suggest a spatially divergent pattern across the region during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Southern peatlands were wetter during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whilst northern and more continental sites were drier. There is no evidence at the multi-decadal sampling resolution of this study to indicate that Medieval mega-droughts recorded in the west and continental interior of North America extended to these peatlands in the north-east of the continent. Reconstructed Little Ice Age hydroclimate change was spatially variable rather than displaying a clear directional shift or latitudinal trends, which may relate to local temporary permafrost aggradation in northern sites, and reconstructed characteristics of some dry periods during the Little Ice Age are comparable with those reconstructed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The spatial hydroclimatic trends identified here suggest that over the last millennium, peatland moisture balance in north-eastern North America has been influenced by changes in the Polar Jet Stream, storm activities and sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic as well as internal peatland dynamics.

AB Depth to water table (DWT, the depth from the water surface to the top of the peat surface) is one of the most important environmental variables related to the habitat types and distribution of vegetation within a subalpine peatland. The distribution of phytolith assemblages and basic environmental data from 43 surface soil samples with significant ecological and hydrological gradients were investigated to generate transfer functions for quantitative reconstruction of paleoenvironmental changes in Dajiuhu peatland, central China. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were employed to explore the relationship between main environmental variables and phytolith morphotypes and distributions. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of phytoliths was significantly correlated with the DWT (25% variance), total organic carbon (TOC, 10% variance) and magnetic susceptibility (chi, 7% variance). We established the transfer functions for the significant variables based on modern analogue technique (MAT), weighted averaging techniques (WA) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS), and model performance was assessed using bootstrap cross-validation. The high correspondence of the predicted DWT results based on phytolith-environment calibration data with observed data reflects that the phytolith-based WA-PLS is a reliable effective calibration method for the quantitative DWT reconstruction of ombrotrophic (rain-fed) subalpine peatland.

AB The impacts of blanket peatland management on water tables, near-surface macropore flow and saturated hydraulic conductivity were investigated using automated dipwells and mini-disc tension infiltrometers. Three neighbouring hillslopes which were undisturbed, drained and restored by drain blocking were studied. Mean water table depths at the undisturbed sites were slightly shallower than at the restored site and water tables at both sites were significantly shallower relative to the drained treatment. Through time, however, the water table at the restored treatment behaved in a markedly different way to that at the undisturbed site. Water tables reached the peat surface for only 2% of the time for the drained and restored treatments compared to 18% for the undisturbed treatment. The proportion of runoff flowing through macropores in the near-surface layers of the peat was found to be large (>= 60%) across all three treatments, yet functional macroporosity was found to be significantly greater in the undisturbed peat relative to the two other treatments. Meanwhile, saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to be significantly higher at the restored treatment relative to the two other treatments, with mean conductivities ca. 1.5 times greater, suggesting a form of heightened soil-water interaction. Combined, the results indicate that although restoration by ditch blocking may result in a relatively successful water table recovery, there may not be the full reinstatement of peatland hydrological processes.

AB While many wetlands form along floodplains of rivers, streams, lakes, and estuaries, others have developed in depressions far removed from such waters. Depressional wetlands completely surrounded by upland have traditionally been called "isolated wetlands." Isolated wetlands are not confined to basins, as some occur on broad flats and others form on slopes. The term "geographically isolated wetlands" better describes these wetlands, since many are hydrologically connected to other wetlands and waterbodies through ground-water flows or by intermittent overflows (spillovers). Numerous types of geographically isolated wetlands occur throughout the United States. They may be naturally formed or the result of human action. Naturally formed types include prairie pothole wetlands, playas, Nebraska's Rainwater Basin and Sandhills wetlands, West Coast vernal pools, sinkhole wetlands, Carolina bays, interdunal and intradunal wetlands, desert springs, terminal basins in the Great Basin, and kettle-hole bogs in glaciated regions. Human-caused isolated types may be intentionally built, such as ponds designed for various purposes and wetlands built on mined lands, or they may be accidentially created (e.g., natural wetlands that were once connected to rivers and streams but are now isolated by roads, railroads, and other development or isolated by altered river hydrology). Many of the functions and benefits attributed to non-isolated wetlands are present in isolated wetlands.

AB This paper deals with the evaluation of soil water retention in two small catchments, which are used in different ways. Both catchments are located in the headwater area of the Blanice River (Sumava Mts., Czech Republic). The experimental catchments of the Zbytinsky Brook and the Tetrivci Brook are the matter of a comparative paired catchment research aimed to runoff response monitoring in prevailing forest and meadow habitats. The evaluation of soil components is based on a detailed hydropedological research and on laboratory analyses with the use of the soil classification HOST and a dominant direction of water flow according to the DHF system. Then, potential and current retention for each soil type in both catchments were calculated. The calculations were compared with the antecedent precipitation index (API) and with runoff response. A higher retention capacity was discovered in the non-forest Zbytinsky Brook catchment with the correlation of causal conditions of about 30-40 mm. The diverse conditions of both catchments and different soil water retention of disadvantageous forested catchment are connected with historic changes in a land use and drainage arrangements. The study proves that forest should be assessed as a complex of interactive factors when only a mere land cover does not have any direct impact on the runoff in the catchment.

AB Palaeoecological analyses of Falkland Island peat profiles have largely been confined to pollen analyses. In order to improve understanding of long-term Falkland Island peat development processes, the plant macrofossil and stable isotope stratigraphy of an 11,550 year Falkland Island Cortaderia pilosa ('white-grass') peat profile was investigated. The peatland developed into an acid, whitegrass peatland via a poor fen stage. Macrofossil charcoal indicate that local fires have frequently occurred throughout the development of the peatland. Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate changes in the intensity of burning which are likely to be related to changes in fuel types, abundance of fine fuels due to reduced evapotranspiration/higher rainfall (under weaker Southern Westerly Winds), peat moisture and human disturbance. Stable isotope and thermogravimetric analyses were used to identify a period of enhanced decomposition of the peat matrices dating from similar to 7020 cal yr BP, which possibly reflects increasing strength of the Southern Westerly winds. The application of Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses to the Falkland Island peat profile identified changes in fire intensity and decomposition which were not detectable using the techniques of macrofossil charcoal and plant macrofossil analyses.

AB The relative importance of global versus local environmental factors for growth and thus carbon uptake of the bryophyte genusSphagnum-the main peat-former and ecosystem engineer in northern peatlands-remains unclear. We measured length growth and net primary production (NPP) of two abundantSphagnumspecies across 99 Holarctic peatlands. We tested the importance of previously proposed abiotic and biotic drivers for peatland carbon uptake (climate, N deposition, water table depth and vascular plant cover) on these two responses. Employing structural equation models (SEMs), we explored both indirect and direct effects of drivers onSphagnumgrowth. Variation in growth was large, but similar within and between peatlands. Length growth showed a stronger response to predictors than NPP. Moreover, the smaller and denserSphagnum fuscumgrowing on hummocks had weaker responses to climatic variation than the larger and looserSphagnum magellanicumgrowing in the wetter conditions. Growth decreased with increasing vascular plant cover within a site. Between sites, precipitation and temperature increased growth forS. magellanicum. The SEMs indicate that indirect effects are important. For example, vascular plant cover increased with a deeper water table, increased nitrogen deposition, precipitation and temperature. These factors also influencedSphagnumgrowth indirectly by affecting moss shoot density. Synthesis. Our results imply that in a warmer climate,S. magellanicumwill increase length growth as long as precipitation is not reduced, whileS. fuscumis more resistant to decreased precipitation, but also less able to take advantage of increased precipitation and temperature. Such species-specific sensitivity to climate may affect competitive outcomes in a changing environment, and potentially the future carbon sink function of peatlands.

AB Transfer functions are valuable tools in palaeoecology, but their output may not always be meaningful. A recently-developed statistical test ('randomTF') offers the potential to distinguish among reconstructions which are more likely to be useful, and those less so. We applied this test to a large number of reconstructions of peatland water table depth based on testate amoebae. Contrary to our expectations, a substantial majority (25 of 30) of these reconstructions gave non-significant results (P > 0.05). The underlying reasons for this outcome are unclear. We found no significant correlation between randomTF P-value and transfer function performance, the properties of the training set and reconstruction, or measures of transfer function fit. These results give cause for concern but we believe it would be extremely premature to discount the results of non-significant reconstructions. We stress the need for more critical assessment of transfer function output, replication of results and ecologically-informed interpretation of palaeoecological data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

DE peat; wetting; soil water movement; storage
AB Air-dried milled peat (0.45 g g(-1), wet weight basis) is used as an electricity generating fuel in Ireland. It is stored on pear bogs in triangular section stockpiles. These stockpiles comprise of milled peat of varying types, classified by poured density, and are subject to rewetting during storage which incurs an economic penalty. A water applicator uas constructed to study the nature of resetting mechanisms in laboratory-scale milled pear stockpiles, and to assess some potential protection strategies. Results indicated that there were few consistent short-term mechanisms linked to milled pear type. Over a longer period, low density milled pear stored most water, high density milled peat generated most runoff from the stockpile surface, and under certain conditions, throughflow was very important in all milled pear types. The industrial implications of the findings conclude that protection strategies should focus on lower density stockpiles.

AB Organic carbon solution and transport processes which occur during periods of heavy rainfall and periods or little or no rainfall, can exert a significant control over a systems' annual organic carbon budget. In addition, either or both extremes can be key contributors to contaminant release, water discolouration, flood risk or vegetation growth. Although there is an increasing body of work studying hydrological responses to peatland restoration, there are very little available data on the performance of restored peatlands during these key periods. This study builds on previous work from an upland peatland in Wales that has been restored through drain-blocking, and presents evidence from a landscape scale experimental study at the site. A comparison of sampling scales within the study demonstrates the necessity of larger spatial scales, in combination with high resolution datasets, in assessing catchment level responses. Our results suggest that drain blocking leads to higher and more stable water tables that are able to better resist drought periods, and thus lead to more stable discharge from the system. The shallower water tables and pooling in drains also appear to reduce the production and transport of fluvial organic carbon, and thus less organic material is available to be released as during peak flow or dry periods. Despite restoration apparently reducing the available water storage within the peat, the increase in overland flow and in pooling within blocked drains appears to have led to a less flashy system. Peak flow responses in both drains and upland streams are less severe, with more rainfall being retained within the bog. We suggest that restoration leads to a more buffered system, with more moderate responses to extreme events, and reduced release of both dissolved and particulate organic carbon. We discuss the implications of this for fluxes of fluvial organic carbon and sediment loss. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Appalachian mountain alluvial wetlands include floodplain forests interspersed with fens or bogs. This study evaluates the water table dynamics of an Appalachian mountain floodplain which includes a depressional fen. Water table wells and piezometers documented seasonal patterns of the water table and the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) in the floodplain and fen areas. Additional water table wells determined the potential sources of water from adjacent hillslopes to the fen area. The water table of the floodplain and the fen exhibited distinct regular seasonal fluctuations. The water table remained near the surface of the fen from late winter through late spring and dropped 20 to 80 cm during the summer between precipitation events. The water table of the floodplain fluctuated more but followed similar patterns and was typically within 40 cm of the surface during late winter and early spring months and greater than 60 cm during the summer months. The water table of the floodplain was more often correlated to precipitation than the water table of the fen. The VHG in the floodplain was highly variable although seasonal patterns of upwelling of water in fall and downwelling in winter were common. The VHG of the fen showed a consistent downwelling of water and suggested that the fen serves as a recharge area for an aquifer. Principal sources of water for the fen appeared to be precipitation, inflow from a shallow aquifer on an adjacent slope plus increased interflow associated with precipitation events from another adjacent slope. The influence of soil texture on water dynamics of the fen or floodplain was not fully ascertained but ii; appeared to influence horizontal flow from hillslopes and the depth of the water table in the fen.

AB Temperate wetland species often require light and warm temperatures for seed germination. However, recent studies indicate that species which specialize on permanently saturated wetlands that are maintained by groundwater discharge (fens, seeps and mountain springs), rather than wetlands with surface-water-driven hydrologic regimes, diverge from the typical wetland germination niche by germinating at cool temperatures and lacking photoblastic seeds. We conducted laboratory experiments that manipulated stratification conditions (non-stratified versus cold stratification in light and darkness), thermal regime (15/6, 25/15 and 35/20 degrees C), and light (14 h photoperiod versus continuous darkness) to test whether seeds of the North American calcareous fen specialist Parnassia grandifolia diverged from the typical temperate wetland germination niche. After 30 d, fresh seeds were conditionally dormant and could only germinate to high percentages in light at 25/15 degrees C. During 16 weeks of incubation, non-stratified seeds germinated to low percentages (<40%) at all thermal regimes in darkness. In contrast, cold-stratified seeds germinated to high percentages in both light and darkness at all thermal regimes, although germination was incomplete (no cotyledon emergence) at 35/20 degrees C. Further, seeds did not require light during cold stratification to germinate to high percentages when incubated in light or darkness. Thus, seeds diverged from the typical temperate wetland germination syndrome in lacking a light and warm temperature requirement for germination. Our results reinforce previous work from European fens and Mediterranean wetlands. This indicates that multiple germination strategies are found in fen wetlands that are maintained by the continuous or near-continuous discharge of cool groundwater.

AB Understanding the sources and removal mechanisms for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is critical to determining the importance of peatlands in influencing streamwater DOM concentrations. Soil saturation and soil temperature are the primary factors that influence DOM cycling in soils, but the relationships among these factors vary by soil type and climate. Despite the extent of peatlands that occur within Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) watersheds, there is little information describing how DOM storage and export patterns are related to soil saturation and temperature in the region. We measured soil water tables, soil temperatures and redox potential and compared these measurements to fluctuations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations in a forested wetland and sloping bog in southeast Alaska to address this key information gap. DOC concentrations ranged from 5 to 140 mg C l(-1) in wetland soils, 11 to 46 mg C l(-1) in streams, and varied greatly in response to changes in water table, redox potential and soil temperature. Similarly, DON concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 2.4 mg N l(-1) in wetland soils, 0.2 to 0.6 mg N l(-1) in streams and concentrations also reflected seasonal changes in physical measures. Depth to water table and soil temperature were significant factors related to the concentration of DOC in forested wetland soils and streams, while soil temperature was a significant factor that influenced stream DOC and DON concentrations. Comparing soil solution and stream DOM concentrations indicated that N is retained in bogs, while both dilution and biotic/abiotic retention mechanisms control DOM export in forested wetlands. The relationships among soil saturation, temperature and concentrations of DOC and DON provide preliminary models for estimating DOM fluxes from wetland soils in the CTR. Furthermore, these results can help calibrate regional watershed carbon flux models to predict the potential impacts of climate shifts and management activities on future wetland soil and stream DOM concentrations in CTR watersheds.

AB 1. Growth in length and weight of three species of Sphagnum (S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. fallax) was studied in a glasshouse experiment. The Sphagnum mosses were cultivated at natural density on cores of five different peat types, representing a gradient of increasing disturbance. Two water levels were controlled and maintained to simulate natural and drained situations.
   2. Significant differences in the growth of the three Sphagnum species were observed. Canonical multivariate analyses showed decreasing influence by explanatory variables in the order: species > water level > peat-type.
   3. S. fallax was more sensitive both to water table depth and to peat properties. Yet, in the Swiss Jura Mountains, it is the most widespread species in paludification processes of drained bogs after the cessation of peat mining or harvesting. This apparent paradox is discussed.
   4. Feat type was influential only when the water table was maintained at a low level (-40 cm), simulating drained conditions. Results of analyses taking into account peat physical and chemical properties show that drained sites undergo a strong chemical disturbance, which, in turn, affects the growth of Sphagnum mosses. However, depending on the evolution of the peat, a particular combination of chemical and physical properties may favour the growth of Sphagnum mosses even at a low water table.
   5. In setting priorities for bog restoration, S. fallax should be favoured as a pioneer to stimulate a rapid colonization and recovery of Sphagnum lawns on which other species, more characteristic of the ombrotrophic bog environment, can re-establish.

ID 1870S AVULSION; RIVER; PATTERNS; VEGETATION; FORM
AB An avulsion of the lower Saskatchewan River in the 1870s inundated a large segment of peat-covered floodplain that subsequently has become aggraded with a broad (500 km(2)) belt of alluvium deposited by the redirected flow. Routing of water and sediment discharge through the avulsion-affected area has been accomplished mainly by networks of sandy bedded anastomosed channels that have formed, evolved, and abandoned as the alluvial belt prograded down the floodplain slope. These processes continue today, though at a much-reduced rate. New channels, formed by crevassing and basinward extension of distributaries, are initially small and shallow, with bottom elevations situated within the avulsive alluvium but above the preavulsion peat (floodplain) surface. Subsequent enlargement and downcutting of many of these channels eventually uncovers the underlying peat layer whose resistance to erosion exerts significant influence on cross-sectional shape and further channel development. Peat-floored channels tend to have rectangular cross-sections, high ratios of average to maximum depth (D/D-max), and a large range of width-to-depth ratios. If the channel continues to enlarge, the peat layer eventually becomes breached, commonly leading to temporarily irregular cross-sections caused by localized scouring at the breach sites. Eventually, the peat layer is completely eroded from the channel floor by undercutting and slumping, after which channel shape becomes governed mainly by other perimeter characteristics. Channels unaffected by peat, either before the peat layer is encountered during early channel development or after it is entirely removed, tend to have low width/depth ratios and a large range of D/D-max values.

AB We use paleoecological techniques to investigate how Canadian High Arctic wetlands responded to a mid-twentieth century increase in growing degree days. We observe an increase in wetness, moss diversity, and carbon accumulation in a polygon mire trough, likely related to ice wedge thaw. Contrastingly, the raised center of the polygon mire showed no clear response. Wet and dry indicator testate amoebae increased concomitantly in a valley fen, possibly relating to greater inundation from snowmelt followed by increasing evapotranspiration. This occurred alongside the appearance of generalist hummock mosses. A coastal fen underwent a shift from sedge to shrub dominance. The valley and coastal fens transitioned from minerogenic to organic-rich wetlands prior to the growing degree days increase. A subsequent shift to moss dominance in the coastal fen may relate to intensive grazing from Arctic geese. Our findings highlight the complex response of Arctic wetlands to warming and have implications for understanding their future carbon sink potential.
   Plain Language Summary The response of Arctic wetland ecosystems and carbon stores to climate change is uncertain. We investigate the response of wetland ecosystems in the Canadian High Arctic to twentieth century climate warming. We use proxies for changes in vegetation (plant macrofossils) and wetness (testate amoebae) preserved in the wetland soil in combination with radiocarbon dating to reconstruct the past ecology of these wetlands. This approach allows us to explore beyond the timeframe of monitoring studies. Our results suggest that wetland type is an important determinant of the response of ecological, hydrological, and soil carbon accumulation to climate warming. Our findings highlight the clear but complex response of Arctic wetlands to twentieth century warming. This has important implications for understanding the future carbon sink potential of these ecosystems.

AB Methodological advances are essential for robust ecological research. Quantitative reconstructions of environmental conditions using testate amoebae rely on sound taxonomy. While the taxonomy of large species is relatively well resolved, this is not the case for most small taxa (typically <45 mu m long). In New Zealand, peatlands contain a diversity of both cosmopolitan and characteristic large southern endemic taxa, but also have a high abundance of small taxa. The latter are often lumped into morphotypes reducing their value as ecological indicators. In this study, we demonstrate how (a) lumping small taxa versus splitting them into unique types, and (b) including or excluding them from community analysis influenced their ecological inference. We assessed testate amoeba composition in six peat bogs from New Zealand, three that were moderately-to-highly impacted, and three that were non-impacted. Environmental variables were measured at each sampling site and the surface testate amoeba community patterns and community-environment relationships compared. We found a clear division between impacted and non-impacted sites. Several distinct small taxa were more strongly related to water-table depth and conductivity, while the larger taxa were more correlated to pH. These results show that improved taxonomic resolution of small taxa can provide more informed environmental assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the testate amoeba communities of a large peatland in Central China. The ecology and seasonal variability of testate amoeba communities were studied during 2009-2010. Investigation of environmental controls using ordination showed that the relationship between testate amoeba communities and depth to water table (DWT) and pH are extremely weak. The small proportion of variance explained by water table depth here (only 1.9% in the full data) shows that the hydrological control is weaker than we expected in this peatland, and weaker than any study we are aware of using a similar methodology. Attempts to develop species-environment (transfer function) models or identify indicator species for future palaeoecological studies were unsuccessful. Previous large-scale studies of peatland testate amoeba ecology have been largely restricted to Europe and North America and results have been relatively consistent among studies. Our results contrast with this consensus and suggest that at least in minerotrophic peatlands in China testate amoeba communities may be primarily controlled by different environmental variables. In China, testate amoebae have been relatively little studied but may prove to be valuable for a variety of applications in palaeoecology and biomonitoring and much further work is required.

AB The H-3 concentration and stable isotope ratio of hydrogen and oxygen, delta H-2 and delta O-18, of waters extracted from a Sphagnum-dominant raised bog in Lyngmossen, Sweden, were measured in order to understand where the precipitation is retained and how mobile it is. Three types of waters, which were defined by extractability, were collected from the peat. Two waters were extracted by compressing samples with different pressures (SQW1 and SQW2). The other water was obtained by distilling the compressed samples (DW). H-3 was detected in all types of water from depths of 0-50 cm: the concentrations in SQW1, SQW2 and DW ranged 1.17-3.07 Bq/L, 0.98-2.03 Bq/L, and 1.02-1.54 Bq/L, respectively. The maximum H-3 concentrations of SQW1, SQW2 and DW were all detected at a depth of around 15 cm, whose C-14 age covers the year of the atomic bomb experiments. The H-3 results of SQW1/2 indicate that SQW consists of at least two waters of different mobility, water flowing rapidly downward and immobile water. Sphagnum hyaline cells may be responsible for the immobile water.
   The delta O-18 and delta H-2 relationship exhibited independent trends between SQW and DW. The distinct difference observed between the two waters at the surface (0-5 cm) indicates that the two waters may be supplied by precipitation at different times of the year, or alternatively that DW comprises plant water taken in from hyaline cells. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of both SQW and DW in the shallow layer increased with increasing depth, and in the layer around 30 cm depth, those of SQW showed a distinct decrease with depth. Isotope fractionation caused by evaporation and/or plant utilization of water at the surface layer are considered to be the main causes of such isotopic variation at the surface. Evaporation is likely to take place in much drier conditions for DW than for SQW, probably through stems by capillary action. In SQW freezing may be a possible cause for the decrease of delta O-18 and delta H-2 around 30 cm depth. DW is isotopically very well separated from two SQW1/2.
   Integrating all isotopic information, we conclude the presence of three different waters: least mobile water at shallow depth perhaps in hyaline cells, which can be extracted by squeezing peat with low pressure; most mobile water in a deeper layer than 30 cm, extracted also by squeezing peat; mobile but least extractable water, which is likely water inside plant tissues.

AB In peatlands, poorly maintained baseflows mean that network expansion during storm events can be rapid and pronounced, resulting in large changes in catchment connectivity. This has implications for the timing and magnitude of material fluxes from these environments, understanding of which is becoming increasingly important due to peatlands' significance as global carbon stores. In this study, electrical resistance (ER) technology has been used to create sensors capable of detecting the presence and absence of flow in ephemeral portions of the channel network. These sensors provide data on the patterns of network variation in the Upper North Grain research catchment, a small peatland headwater in the South Pennines, UK. Networks of around 40 sensors were deployed in autumn 2007 and summer 2008, giving a total of almost four months of high-resolution monitoring data. Drainage density in the catchment was found to vary between 1.4 and 30.0 km/km(2), suggesting significant differences in connectivity between the expanded and contracted networks. Water table depth was identified as the key factor determining the temporal pattern of streamflow at both the site- and catchment-wide scales. Spatially, network expansion and contraction occurred in a disjointed manner, following a similar pattern between events, suggesting that localized controls are important for flow generation. Spatial controls on flow generation relate to local water table levels, and include drainage area, local dissection, channel slope and gully morphology. The importance of water table as the key control on catchment connectivity suggests that potential future change in catchment water tables, associated with projected climate change or with peatland restoration by rewetting, will modify the frequency of full catchment connectivity.

AB Aim
   Propagule size and ecological requirements are believed to be major factors influencing the passive dispersal of free-living terrestrial protists. We compared the colonization potential of three closely related testate amoeba species (Assulina muscorum, A. seminulum, A. scandinavica, ranging from 40 to 100 mu m in length).
   Location
   Europe.
   Methods
   We collected individual Assulina species cells from Sphagnum peatlands across Europe. We sequenced a 550-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) to estimate the within-species variability, as a proxy for gene flow. We reviewed existing ecological and palaeoecological data to assess the ecological tolerance of Assulina species and how rapidly they colonized developing peatlands.
   Results
   We obtained COI sequences for 30 individuals of A. seminulum from eleven sites, for 39 of A. muscorum from six sites, and for six of A. scandinavica from two sites. We observed three haplotypes for A. seminulum and two for A. muscorum, often co-existing in the same sites. The sequences of A. scandinavica from the two sites were identical. Assulina muscorum and A. seminulum haplotypes varied by only 1-2 nucleotides, resulting in > 99.5% similarity. Genetic diversity within A. seminulum was higher than that within A. muscorum. Ecological and palaeoecological records showed that A. muscorum was much more frequent and abundant than A. seminulum, and had a somewhat broader ecological tolerance for pH, moisture and water-table depth. Assulina muscorum always appeared early during the developmental history of peatlands, either before or simultaneously with A. seminulum.
   Main conclusions
   The lack of genetic structure observed with a variable marker such as COI suggests high gene flow between the sites and thus rapid transport (at an evolutionary scale) over large distances, in agreement with the palaeoecological records. Thus, geographical distance alone does not seem to prevent the dispersal of testate amoebae, at least within Europe. Nevertheless, genetic diversity was significantly lower within A. muscorum than within A. seminulum, suggesting that its smaller size and abundance and/or broader ecological tolerance influence its effective dispersal capacity. These results are in agreement with the often earlier colonization of peatlands by A. muscorum and its broader ecological tolerance.

AB New data were obtained from the sedimentary sequence study of Lieporiai palaeolake, Northern Lithuania, employing a multi-proxy abiotic approach, for the description of the Lateglacial-Early Holocene palaeoenvironmental dynamics in the basin. The study reveals significant differences in sediments deposited in the Lateglacial, at the end of Lateglacial/Early Holocene and in the Late Holocene time periods. Six main environmental stages are described. After glacial retreat, the formed landscape was re-organized by very fast currents that might have appeared later than previously thought. Rapid water flow stabilized and lacustrine sedimentation began together with the appearance of scarce pioneer vegetation shortly before 14 600 cal yr BP, (GI-le). The development of the lake with mostly undisturbed sedimentation continued up to the final stages of the Lateglacial Interstadial. The warm period caused maximum precipitation of Ca and Sr carbonates, which strongly affected sediment saturation with other components. Increase in humidity in the later Lateglacial Stadial (GS-1) period is indicated by the abrupt appearance of the coarser-sized mineral matter accompanied by weathering elements, i.e. Ti, Al, Si, Mg, and the early immigration of Picea. About 11 500 cal yr BP, the mineral matter input started decreasing, and stabilization of the climate regime began about 10 200 cal yr BP. (A)biotic proxies highlight slow sedimentation mechanisms that recover shallow- and trophic-lake stages. The Lieporiai palaeolake record clearly shows the sedimentation hiatus between the Early and the Middle Holocene. Further stages are characterized by paludification processes. Finally, peat accumulation was interrupted by humans.

AB The study was aimed at evaluating the lead, zinc, chromium, nickel, copper, cobalt, iron, and manganese contents in river water as well as identifying their origin. An attempt to predict these element concentrations in surface waters of the upper Narew river was also undertaken. The study was carried out during 3 years (July 2005-October 2007). Accepting the element concentrations in waters corresponding to particular quality classes of surface water as their quality criteria, it can be suggested that lead, zinc, chromium, nickel, copper, and manganese in the studied rivers were within the range corresponding to quality class I. Cadmium concentration, in the majority of samples, corresponded to quality class II. Due to methodological restrictions, precise determination of cadmium contamination level was not possible in all cases. Iron contents corresponded to II and III quality classes. Its elevated concentrations can be attributed to peat-bog character of river Narew valley. Economic and living activity, influence of local transport, and surface runoffs were sources of the studied trace elements in river waters, which was confirmed by statistical analyses.

AB Bitumen extraction via surface mining in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region results in permanent alteration of boreal forests and wetlands. As part of their legal requirements, oil companies must reclaim disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems. Despite considerable work establishing upland forests, only two pilot wetlandpeatland systems integratedwithin a watershed have been constructed to date. Peatland reclamation is challenging as it requires complete reconstruction with few guidelines or previous work in this region. Furthermore, the variable sub-humid climate and salinity of tailings materials present additional challenges. In 2012, Syncrude Canada Ltd. constructed a 52-ha pilot upland-wetland system, the Sandhill FenWatershed, which was designed with a pump and underdrain system to provide freshwater and enhance drainage to limit salinization from underlying soft tailings materials that have elevated electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+. The objective of this research is to evaluate the hydrochemical response of a constructed wetland to variations in hydrology and water management with respect to water sources, flow pathways and major chemical transformations in the three years following commissioning. Results suggest that active water management practices in 2013 kept EC relatively low, with mostwetland sites <1000 mu S/cmwith Na+ concentrations <250mg/L. With limitedmanagement in 2014 and 2015, the EC increased in the wetland to N1000 mu S/cm in 2014 and >2000 mu S/cm in 2015. The most notable changewas the emergence of several Na+ enriched zones in the margins. Here, Na+ concentrations were two to three times higher than other sites. Stable isotopes of water support that the Na+ enriched areas arise from underlying process-affected water in the tailings, providing evidence of its upward transport and seepage under a natural hydrologic regime. In future years, salinity is expected to evolve in its flow pathways and diffusion, yet the timeline and extent of these changes are uncertain. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Hamatocaulis vernicosus, a rare moss species, was monitored in 33 fens in the Czech Republic for five to six years. Population size, vitality and trends of population development were recorded. Water chemistry, water level fluctuation, vegetation type and cover, as well as mowing regime were assessed and the effect of these potential predictors on the species populations was examined. Populations of H. vernicosus were affected mainly by the density of vascular plants, the species thrived best in habitats with sparse herb and abundant "brown moss" cover. Other important factors included water table fluctuation and water concentration of iron. Populations were more vital and prospered better in sites with a stable water table and more iron-rich conditions. Dependence of population parameters on other measured characteristics of water chemistry was not detected.

AB The restoration of peatland function and services on damaged peatland sites is seen as an increasingly important goal for ecological, environmental and societal reasons. Restoration monitoring often places fauna as secondary in importance to water table depth and vegetation, and when carried out, it often focuses on taxonomic indices. The use of functional traits, however, can be a complementary approach that clarifies mechanistic links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   This study was conducted in large blanket bog site in northern Scotland, using a space-for-time-substitution of restoration sites from which conifer plantations had been removed 2-18 years previously. Carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in each of three treatments (undamaged bog, restored, afforested). Functional trait data were summarised from available literature.
   The study found that sites under forestry had different functional traits than blanket bog, and that restoration initially shifted the suites of functional traits away from both forested and open blanket bog. However, no other change in functional traits was observed, and after two decades, restoration sites continue to support carabid communities with higher dispersal capacity and more diurnal activity than the open bog. On the other hand, the functional diversity measures used in this study failed to differentiate the different treatments and further analyses suggest that environment, rather than traits, better explain carabid beetle composition following restoration of formerly afforested blanket bog. In particular, the lack of recovery of typical blanket bog vegetation and microhabitat following felling to waste and drain blocking appear to limit carabid functional recovery.

AB A procedure and instrument for determining the air permeability of peat soil while regulating its bulk density are described.  A relation is obtained between the air content and air permeability of soil samples and their bulk density at different moisture contents.  Satisfactory aeration conditions prevail in a moderately decomposed peat soil with an ash content up to 20%, and a bulk density of about 1 g/cm3, and the soil structure becomes sufficiently stable and wind resistant.

AB Restoration management frequently focuses on recreating suitable environmental conditions for a 'target vegetation'. This approach neglects the importance of habitat diversity and spatial configuration for individual species. Here, we investigate the role of environmental heterogeneity in a restoration context and report the response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to rewetting measures, which were taken to mitigate desiccation in a bog landscape. Because only parts of the study area were affected by re-wetting measures, changes in aquatic macroinvertebrates could be compared between re-wetted and non-rewetted parts. In addition, species were grouped into life-history strategies to test whether the invertebrate response differed between functional species groups. Total species numbers declined in the re-wetted parts and invertebrate assemblages became more similar both in terms of species and life-history strategies. These results indicate that large-scale re-wetting caused a functional homogenization. Changes in environmental conditions following re-wetting could be consistently related to changes in strategy composition. Retention of rainwater decreased the influence of groundwater. Here species increased that are adapted to physiological stress as well as those employing risk spreading, which indicates that environmental conditions had become harsher and less predictable. In contrast, reduced drainage locally increased groundwater influence, with life-history strategies indicating enhanced predictability of environmental conditions. Importantly, such conditions also characterise lagg zones and transitional mires in pristine raised bog landscapes, which are hotspots for biodiversity. Thus, while large-scale re-wetting decreased environmental heterogeneity, increasing the supply of groundwater seems a more promising restoration strategy for aquatic invertebrates in degraded peatlands.

AB The Holocene hydrological changes of fen peatland in northern Mongolia were reconstructed using diatom fossils with an aid of Sphagnum leaf fossils. Analyses were conducted on three cores taken across the basin and reconstructed water environments were compared to find basin-wide hydrological changes and climate anomalies. The peatland has been covered by sedges during most of its 10 thousand years history, but all cores showed common peatland hydrosere processes from fluvial environment in the early Holocene period, shallow marsh to present acidic fen peatland. The establishment of fen peatland at 6.8-6.4 cal ka BP was marked synchronously by the shift of diatom and Sphagnum taxa assemblages and this period was inferred as the onset of the mid-Holocene dry climate which is widely observed around Mongolia. The dry environment lasted until around 2.8 cal ka BP with a temporal wetter condition at 4.4-3.5 cal ka BP. Short term diatom trend shifts indicated temporal wetter environments at 8.7-8.4, 8.0-7.6, 2.4-2.1, 1.2-0.5 cal ka BP and a dry environment at 0.4-0.2 cal ka BP. These periods of hydrology changes were correlative with other studies in Mongolia and East Siberia, so they would represent climate-induced hydrological changes, and those regions might share the same response to long term insolation changes or global climate anomalies. However, disagreements of climate data even within northern Mongolian region suggest large influence of regional geography and the balance of evapotranspiration on climate behaviors as shown by recent dendrological paleoenvironment researches. Coherent differences of main taxa compositions between three cores were attributed to core site-specific local hydrology mainly in terms of relative wetness from wettest core site accompanied by abundant planktonic diatom taxa to driest site with acidic peat indicator taxa. Timings and manners of temporal diatom trend shifts were also largely different between cores suggesting significant difference in each core site sensitivity to basin-wide hydrology changes, confirming the necessity of using multiple cores and proxies in peatland sediments to detect climate-induced environmental changes.

AB Peatlands have been widely developed for pasture usage through drainage and with the introduction of forage grasses; however, the effects of drainage and plant community change on methane (CH4) emission have not yet been well addressed. In this study, CH4 emissions, environmental factors, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were investigated across a disturbance gradient (i.e., the natural peatlands, the drained peatlands, and an abandoned peatland pasture). Our results show that in addition to temperature and water table, the substrate availability (DOC as a proxy) is also an important regulator of CH4 emission. For example, DOC, peat temperature at 5 cm depth (T-5), and water table depth (WTD) jointly explained 53% of the temporal variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux for the hollows. Also, DOC was observed to be significantly correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux for each land form. After the data were split into wet and dry seasons based on the water table, we observed that the T-5 was the main driver of the CH4 flux during the wet season (R-2 = 0.13), while VVTD replaced it during the dry season (R-2 = 0.23) for the general peatland system (i.e., all plots taken together). For the hummocks, both and WTD together explained 31% of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the wet season, and peat temperature at 20 cm depth explained 16% of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the dry season, while neither T-5 nor WTD was correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux across the whole season. These results imply that the relationships between environmental factors and CH4 flux depend on the water table and land forms. Our results indicate that water table drawdown is the main driver of the CH4 emission decrease at the non-inundated sites, and it explained 72% of the variance in seasonal mean CH4 emission among sites. The drainage ditches of the drained peatlands and the abandoned pasture, in spite of covering only 5% of the land area, contributed 15% and 32% of the CH4 emission of the land use type, respectively, and therefore represent a "hot spot" of CH4 emissions. High CH4 emission rates from the ditches, especially of the abandoned pasture, can be attributed to the higher production and export of DOC as a result of the rigorous vegetation growth. Spatially weighted CH4 emissions from May to October were 1.87 +/- 0.68 g CH4 m(-2) for the natural peatlands, 1.08 +/- 0.35 g CH4 m-2 for the drained peatlands, and 1.40 +/- 0.28 g CH4 m(-2) for the abandoned pasture. Our results suggest that it is critical to measure the CH4 emission from the drainage ditches, where fresher substrate with a higher quality is transferred from the vegetated portion of the drained peatlands, in order to accurately evaluate the effects of agricultural development on the CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands.

AB The aim of the study was to assess the hydrological and microclimatic parameters in the areas at different stages of succession after the discontinuation of peat extraction relative to the conditions on a natural raised bog (Orawa-Nowy Targ Basin, Poland). Understanding these conditions is necessary for the effective reclamation of degraded peatlands. Three measurement points were designated in the study area: one on the non-degraded dome of the bog and two in post-mining areas in different stages of succession (Sector A with pine and birch woodland; Sector B with cotton-grass and ericaceous shrubs). Continuous measurements of the water table level, precipitation and air temperature and humidity were performed between May and October in the year 2016. The air temperature throughout the warm half of the year significantly influenced the groundwater levels, as it is the main factor directly affecting evapotranspiration. The effect of the amount of rainfall on the water level proved significant in the post-mining areas, but not significant for the dome of the bog. Under the conditions of an undegraded peat bog, the upper layer, consisting of live and partially decomposed Sphagnum mosses, limits the water level fluctuations by reducing the evaporation from the surface during periods of low water levels, which is caused by a high water storage capacity and reduced infiltration. In advanced stages of secondary forest succession, trees reduce the evapotranspiration from the surface, which reduces fluctuations in the water level: however. by taking up a large amount of water from the deeper layers, they lower it significantly. The greatest effect of the weather conditions on the water level fluctuations occurs at the stage in which the bog is overgrown by shrubs, when there is no natural peat layer. and the impact of shrubs is much smaller than that of trees.

AB Although the majority of coastal sediments consist of sandy material, in some areas marine ingression caused the submergence of terrestrial carbon-rich peat soils. This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 +/- 14 wt%), alternately supplied with oxygen-rich brackish water from above and oxygen-poor, low-saline GW from below. The low-saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (delta C-13(DOC) - 26.9 parts per thousand to - 27.7 parts per thousand), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate (SO42-) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42--reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42- concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) during a 14-day, low-saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our study illustrates the strong dependence of carbon cycling in shallow coastal areas with submerged peat deposits on the flow and mixing dynamics within the subterranean estuary.

AB The present study suggests that many soils in the Netherlands may be water repellent to some degree, challenging the common perception that soil water repellency is only an interesting aberration. When dry, water repellent soils resist or retard water infiltration into the soil matrix. Soil water repellency can lead to the development of unstable wetting and preferential flow paths. The persistence of water repellency was examined in topsoils using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test. The severity of water repellency measured on dried soil samples, the so-called "potential" water repellency, can be used as a parameter for comparing soils with respect to their sensitivity to water repellency. Measurement of the "actual" water repellency on field-moist samples determines the soil fraction excluded from direct solute and water flow. However, preferential Row is a dynamic process, which is why the ratio between water repellent and wettable soil is time dependent. The "critical soil water content", below which the soil in the field is water repellent and above which the soil is wettable, was found to be a useful parameter in water repellency studies. Spatial and temporal variability in volumetric soil water content was studied in vertical transects by intensive sampling with 100 cm(3) steel cylinders. Spatial variability in soil water content under grass cover was high, due to fingered flow. On arable land, vegetation and microtopography appeared to play a dominant role. This study provides examples of uneven moisture patterns in water repellent sand, loam, clay and peat soils with grass cover, and in cropped, water repellent sandy soils.

AB Increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in lakes, rivers and streams in northern mid latitudes have been widely reported during the last two decades, but relatively few studies have dealt with trends in DOC export. We studied the export of DOC from Finnish rivers to the Baltic Sea between 1975 and 2010, and estimated trends in DOC fluxes (both flow normalised and non-normalised). The study encompassed the whole Finnish Baltic Sea catchment area (301,000 km(2)) covering major land use patterns in the boreal zone. Finnish rivers exported annually over 900,000 t DOC to the Baltic Sea, and the mean area specific export was 3.5 t km(-2). The highest export (7.3 t km(-2)) was measured in peat dominated catchments, whereas catchments rich in lakes had the lowest export (2.2 t km(-2)). Inter-annual variation in DOC export was high and controlled mainly by hydrology. There was no overall trend in the annual water flow, although winter flow increased in northern Finland over 36 years. Despite the numerous studies showing increases in DOC concentrations in streams and rivers in the northern hemisphere, we could not find any evidence of increases in DOC export to the northern Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments since 1975.

AB In this study, six approaches were used to characterize hydrological changes in the Cepkeliai wetland complex (southeast Lithuania), namely (i) local water-table measurements (WTM), (ii) testate amoebae analysis, (iii) tree-ring width (TRW) series, (iv) peat stratigraphic data, (v) (hydro-) meteorological data (precipitation and river runoff), and (vi) a diachronic analysis of aerial photographs as well as historical maps. This multi-proxy framework provides complementary information on the hydrological evolution of the peatland and offers a unique opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of each approach. Local water-table measurements, for example, generated monthly resolved and precise ( +/- 0.01 m) hydrological information, but were limited to a 16-year period. On the other hand, the TRW data generated annually-resolved information linked to hydrological shifts over the period 1848-2018, but did not allow reconstruction of the amplitude of hydrological variations. Amongst the proxy records, the testate amoebae distribution is the only approach that gives a direct measurement of changes in water-table depths. At the same time, the approach is limited by chronological inaccuracies and weaker resolutions, similar to peat stratigraphic records. The meteorological data are theoretically representing the most highly resolved records. However, due to hydrological lags and feedbacks in peatlands, it was difficult to link regional changes observed in meteorological records to local changes in the peatland. The aerial photographs and historical maps offered an opportunity to document large-scale vegetation changes, which is useful for upscaling local results, but they may not capture rapid changes. Despite all these limitations, at Cepkeliai, most of the proxy records are in agreement with each other and suggest relatively moist conditions with water levels close to the peat surface during the late 1800s and early 1900s, followed by more detailed information towards the present showing shifts towards drier peat surface conditions during the 1930s and 1940s. The 1960s were dry, followed by a short, moist episode during the 1970s, and returning to drier conditions during the 1980s. A gradual change towards moister conditions was recorded over the 1990s and 2000s. The last decade in our records started with relatively wet conditions to end with lower water levels over the most recent years.

AB We studied the relationship between testate amoebae (Protozoa) communities and the depth to the water table (DWT), pH, conductivity, and microhabitat type in Sphagnum dominated peatlands of north-western Poland and built predictive (transfer function) models for inferring DWT and pH based on the testate amoebae community structure. Such models can be used for peatland monitoring and paleoecology. A total of 52 testate amoebae taxa were recorded. In a redundancy analysis, DWT and pH explained 20.1% of the variation in the species data and allowed us to identify three groups of taxa: species that are associated with (1) high DWT and low pH, (2) low DWT and low pH, and (3) high pH and mid-range DWT. Our transfer function models allow DWT and pH to be estimated with mean errors of 9.89 cm and 0.71 pH units. The prediction error of the DWT model and the tolerance of the species both increase with increasing dryness. This pattern mirrors the ecology of Sphagnum mosses: Species growing in wet habitats are more sensitive to change in water table depth than the species growing in drier microhabitats. Our results are consistent with studies of testate amoeba ecology in other regions, and they provide additional support for the use of these organisms in paleoecological and biomonitoring contexts.

AB Peatlands often experience turbulent sheltering from their surrounding upland forests, which results in spatially variable surface-atmosphere exchanges of momentum, heat, and moisture produced by flow-separation dynamics, which suppresses the transport of such scalars in the sheltered region while promoting transport in the reattachment zone. With evapotranspiration being the dominant source of water loss in the Boreal Plains, it is necessary to understand the dynamics and controls on evapotranspiration within these peatlands. We used the regional atmospheric forest large-eddy simulation (RAFLES) model to study the impact of flow separation and surface roughness on microclimates leeward of a forest-to-peatland roughness transition. We parametrized our simulation with observed vegetation characteristics and meteorological data from three natural peatlands to accurately estimate natural ranges of peatland roughnesses and energy dynamics. Our simulations show that changes to peatland roughness do not affect the distances required for flow reattachment, and therefore the size of the sheltered region. However, increasing the surface roughness produces greater surface turbulence, quicker flow recovery, and decreased flow reversals within the sheltered region. Further, substantial microclimatic differences are observed throughout the flow regions of the roughness transition. Our results show that turbulence, aerodynamic resistance, and the microclimate vary throughout the backward-facing step transition and should be taken into account when estimating the spatial dynamics of evaporative demand leeward of a roughness transition. Furthermore, increasing the surface roughness of a peatland minimizes the spatial variability of turbulent drivers of evapotranspiration across a roughness transition. That is, flow separation and the surface roughness of the peatland should be accounted for when estimating the spatial variability and total evaporative potential across a peatland.

AB Mires (peat-accumulating wetlands) occupy 8.1% of Russian territory and are especially numerous in the western Siberian Lowlands, where they can significantly modify atmospheric heat and water balances. They also influence air temperatures and humidity in the boundary layers closest to the earth's surface. The purpose of our study was to incorporate the influence of mires into the SL-AV numerical weather prediction model, which is used operationally in the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia. This was done by adjusting the multilayer soil component (by modifying the peat thermal conductivity in the heat diffusion equation and reformulating the lower boundary condition for Richard's equation), and reformulating both the evapotranspiration and runoff from mires. When evaporation from mires was incorporated into the SL-AV model, the latent heat flux in the areas dominated by mires increased strongly, resulting in surface cooling and hence reductions in the sensible heat flux and outgoing terrestrial long-wave radiation. Presented results show that including mires significantly decreased the bias and RMSE of predictions of temperature and relative humidity 2 m above the ground for lead times of 12, 36, and 60 h from 00 h Coordinated Universal Time (evening conditions), but did not eliminate the bias in forecasts for lead times of 24, 48, and 72 h (morning conditions) in Siberia. Different parameterizations of mire evapotranspiration are also compared.

AB Saline springs can provide clues as to the nature of groundwater flow, including how it relates to subsurface wastewater storage and the distribution of solutes in the landscape. A saline-spring peatland neighboring a proposed in-situ oil facility was examined near Fort McMurray, Alberta (Canada). The study area is situated just north of a saline groundwater discharge zone, which coincides with the erosional edge of the Cretaceous Grand Rapids Formation. Na+ (mean 6,949 mg L-1) and Cl- (mean 13,776 mg L-1) were the dominant salts within the peatland, which increased by an order of magnitude in the opposite direction to that of the local groundwater flow. Rivers and freshwater wetlands within the study area had anomalously high salinities, in some cases exceeding 10,000 mg L-1 total dissolved solids within deeper sediments. Saline-spring features were observed as far as 5 km from the study area. A low-permeability mineral layer underlying the peatland restricted vertical groundwater exchange (estimated to be less than several mm over the 4-month study period). Sand and gravel lenses underlying the fen's high-salinity zone may function as areas of enhanced discharge. High Cl/Br ratios point to halite as a potential source of salinity, while delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures in groundwater were lower than modern-day precipitation or Quaternary aquifers. The complex connectivity of saline-spring wetlands within the landscape has implications for industry and land-use managers, and justifies incorporating them into monitoring networks to better gauge the magnitude and flow history of natural saline discharge in the oil sands region.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
DE surface water hydrology; wetlands; New Jersey Pine Barrens; peatlands
AB Rosgen analysis, developed for assessing channel stability in streams from the western United States, is applied to the Oswego River watershed in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The Rosgen method requires calibration to local conditions due to the impact of peat substrates on channel morphology. In particular, the presence of peat induces low width to depth ratios and greater channel confinement, reversing typical downstream morphologic trends observed in other rivers. Therefore peat is added to those substrates already evaluated by Rosgen. A consistent sequence of Rosgen stream types develops along the Oswego River and its tributaries created by spatially overlapping processes of water table emergence, peat development, and channel formation. This sequence delineates a "natural" transition of stream channel morphology downslope through the watershed. First, as the water table reaches the surface of dry sloughs, Sphagnum growth is stimulated and peat substrates result. These substrates have lower permeability than the underlying gravelly sands. Next, surface runoff, through braided pathways over the peat, eventually erodes mainly anastomosing channels into the peat. Finally, single-thread channels develop in underlying gravelly sands further downslope. This downslope sequence, expressed as Rosgen stream types, begins generally with DA7 streams arising from dry sloughs. These pass to E7, C7 or DA5 stream types that in turn pass to B5c, C5 and C4 stream types. Departures from the "natural" stream type sequence occur along the course of the Oswego and its tributaries due to human activities such as the construction of dams, bridges and drainage ditches, stream bank erosion at streamside camping and picnic areas and the clear-cutting of adjacent stands of Atlantic white cedar.

AB The depth of the water table was measured before and after the digging of drainage ditches with 20-, 40-, and 60-m spacings in a black spruce wild holly bog. The peat is mesic with the exception of the top 10 cm which is fibric. The hydraulic conductivity of the 20- to 40-cm layer is low in relation with other Quebec sites under study. The extremely low conductivity under the 40-cm depth and the impermeable mineral soil layer at the bottom of the ditches creates the horizontal profile between ditches. The mean water table depths during the 3 years of the study were 42, 29, and 22 cm, respectively, for the 20-, 40-, and 60-m spacings. The corresponding lowering of the water table was in the order of 25, 13, and 6 cm. The water table was maintained 100, 70, and 40% of the time below the 20 cm deep root zone for the 20-, 40-, and 60-m spacings respectively, compared with 23% for the undrained situation (by simulation). The water table is significantly lowered below the 40-cm threshold for the 20-m spacing only.

AB The water content of the topsoil is one of the key factors controlling biogeochemical processes, greenhouse gas emissions and biosphere - atmosphere interactions in many ecosystems, particularly in northern peatlands. In these wetland ecosystems, the water content of the photosynthetic active peatmoss layer is crucial for ecosystem functioning and carbon sequestration, and is sensitive to future shifts in rainfall and drought characteristics. Current peatland models differ in the degree in which hydrological feedbacks are included, but how this affects peatmoss drought projections is unknown.
   The aim of this paper was to systematically test whether the level of hydrological detail in models could bias projections of water content and drought stress for peatmoss in northern peatlands using downscaled projections for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in the current (1991-2020) and future climate (2061-2090). We considered four model variants that either include or exclude moss (rain)water storage and peat volume change, as these are two central processes in the hydrological self-regulation of peatmoss carpets. Model performance was validated using field data of a peatland in northern Sweden.
   Including moss water storage as well as peat volume change resulted in a significant improvement of model performance, despite the extra parameters added. The best performance was achieved if both processes were included. Including moss water storage and peat volume change consistently reduced projected peatmoss drought frequency with >50%, relative to the model excluding both proces'ses. Projected peatmoss drought frequency in the growing season was 17% smaller under future climate than current climate, but was unaffected by including the hydrological self-regulating processes.
   Our results suggest that ignoring these two fine-scale processes important in hydrological self-regulation of northern peatlands will have large consequences for projected climate change impact on ecosystem processes related to topsoil water content, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

DE Peat Bog; groundwater level; the Sumava Mts.; Peat Bog restoration
AB The paper evaluates measures taken to restore mountain Peat Bogs and their effect on hydrological regime, with the main focus on groundwater levels. The level of groundwater is a key factor in maintaining the character of mountain Peat Bogs and the main objective of restoration is to increase and stabilize the groundwater level in disturbed Peat Bogs. At the same time, the paper provides a complex overview of the topic, which is being often discussed nowadays, mostly due to a big retention potential of mountain Peat Bogs. The paper is based on detailed measurements of groundwater levels in a selected experimental drainage ditch in the catchment of the Rokytka stream. Basic statistical characteristics, the equation of Penman-Montheit or antecedent precipitation index were used to show the dependence of groundwater level on precipitation or evapotranspiration. The results show a positive influence of the restoration measures on Peat Bogs. In this case it has been confirmed that restoration measures cause increase of groundwater level and decrease its fluctuation in the Peat Bog.

AB Replicate soil cores were collected at adjacent peatland and mineral soil sites in an area of low Chernobyl fallout. Three individual cores were collected at the mineral site and nine cores, subsequently bulked to give three composite samples, were taken from the peatland site. Data are reported on the vertical distribution of Cs-137 and Cs-134 at 25 mm intervals to a depth of 225 mm. The integrated Cs-137 deposition from nuclear weapons testing, calculated as 8344 (s.e. 513) Bq m-2, shows good agreement with a value of 7950 Bq m-2 predicted from previous correlations with rainfall. Analysis of variance showed a highly significant (P<0.001) difference in the Cs-137 retention capacity of the two different soils. The profile distribution of Cs-137 was also affected by soil type. Significant depletion of Cs-137, representing 62.5% of the nuclear weapons fallout and 47% of the Chernobyl deposition, was observed in the peatland soils. Surface run-off rather than vertical migration of Cs-137 was considered to be the dominant factor in losses from the ecosystem in the months immediately following deposition while, in later years, the radioactive half-life was the controlling influence. A two-compartment decay with effective half-lives of about 8 and 22 years, respectively, was calculated.

AB The use of air biofiltration for the degradation of dichlorobenzenes (1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB) was studied at a refinery site. At this plant, 93 m(3)/h of contaminated groundwater, used in a cooling system and containing a maximum of 2 ppm of dichlorobenzenes, had to be treated. Stripping of the DCBs followed by biofiltration was selected as the most suitable technology to avoid volatilization in ambient air as expected with a wastewater aerobic treatment system. A stripper of 15 m height and 1.27 m diameter was designed as a first step treatment to volatilize DCBs with 3400 m(3)/h of air. Two full-scale biofilters of 70 m(3) each were built and filled with 45 m(3) of filtering media for the adsorption and biodegradation of the DCBs in the gasphase. Filtering media was composed mainly of peat moss, with animal manure, wood chips and DCBs contaminated soil. Air to be treated was also contaminated with naphthalene, Laboratory tests showed an effective microbial activity in the contaminated soil and in the filtering media for DCBs degradation. Degradation of naphthalene induced slower degradation of DCBs. Full-scale operation was studied during four months. Water flow and DCBs content in the water entering the stripper were lower than expected with only 57 m(3)/h and a maximum concentration of only 240 ppb. Effective desorption was obtained in the stripper in the full-scale operation (more than 99% removal). Full-scale biofilters maintained a DCB concentration of less than 1 ppmv in the air outlet, but removal efficiency varied between 0 and 79% because of the low DCB inlet concentrations, load variations and sporadic naphthalene presence.

AB Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.)
   Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. They emit CH4 because decomposition of soil organic matter in waterlogged anoxic conditions produces CH4, in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2). Production of CH4 and how much of it escapes to the atmosphere depend on a multitude of environmental drivers. Models simulating the processes leading to CH4 emissions are thus needed for upscaling observations to estimate present CH4 emissions and for producing scenarios of future atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Aiming at a CH4 model that can be added to models describing peatland carbon cycling, we composed a model called HIMMELI that describes CH4 build-up in and emissions from peatland soils. It is not a full peatland carbon cycle model but it requires the rate of anoxic soil respiration as input. Driven by soil temperature, leaf area index (LAI) of aerenchymatous peat-land vegetation, and water table depth (WTD), it simulates the concentrations and transport of CH4, CO2, and oxygen (O-2) in a layered one-dimensional peat column. Here, we present the HIMMELI model structure and results of tests on the model sensitivity to the input data and to the description of the peat column (peat depth and layer thickness), and demonstrate that HIMMELI outputs realistic fluxes by comparing modeled and measured fluxes at two peatland sites. As HIMMELI describes only the CH4-related processes, not the full carbon cycle, our analysis revealed mechanisms and dependencies that may remain hidden when testing CH4 models connected to complete peatland carbon models, which is usually the case. Our results indicated that (1) the model is flexible and robust and thus suitable for different environments; (2) the simulated CH4 emissions largely depend on the prescribed rate of anoxic respiration; (3) the sensitivity of the total CH4 emission to other input variables is mainly mediated via the concentrations of dissolved gases, in particular, the O-2 concentrations that affect the CH4 production and oxidation rates; (4) with given input respiration, the peat column description does not significantly affect the simulated CH4 emissions in this model version.

TI Restoration of blanket peat moorland delays stormflow from hillslopes

   blocking; Water tables; Peatland hydrology
AB Over the past 15 years there has been a proliferation of projects aiming to restore the structure and function of UK upland blanket mires, primarily by revegetation of bare peat and the blocking of erosion gullies. These restoration measures have potential to alter stormflow responses and contribute to Natural Flood Management, but their impacts on storm hydrographs are poorly quantified. This paper reports a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) study from three experimental headwater micro-catchments in the South Pennines (UK) representing the first rigorous experimental assessment of the impact of blanket peat restoration on catchment runoff. We evaluate the hydrological impacts of two standard restoration interventions; revegetation of bare peat, and revegetation of bare peat with additional gully blocking. Following revegetation there was a significant decrease in depth to water table and an increase in the prevalence of hillslope overland flow production. There were no significant changes in storm runoff coefficient following either restoration treatment. Storm hydrographs following revegetation had significantly longer lag times (106% increase relative to the control), reduced peak flows (27% decrease relative to the control), and attenuated hydrograph shapes. With the addition of gully blocking the effect is almost doubled. Lag times increased by a further 94% and peak flows reduced by an additional 24% relative to the control. We argue that the primary process controlling the observed changes in storm hydrograph behaviour is retardation of overland stormflow due to increased surface roughness. The significant changes to lag times and peak flow provide evidence that the restoration of degraded headwater peatlands can contribute to Natural Flood Management and the reduction of downstream flood risk, subject to wider catchment scale effects and sub-catchment storm hydrograph synchronicity.

AB Hydrological disturbances could increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports through changes in runoff and leaching, which reduces the potential carbon sink function of peatlands. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of hydrological restoration on hydrological processes and DOC dynamics in a rehabilitated Sphagnum-dominated peatland. A conceptual hydrological model calibrated on the water table and coupled with a biogeochemical module was applied to La Guette peatland (France), which experienced a rewetting initiative on February 2014. The model (eight calibrated parameters) reproduced water-table (0 : 1 < NS < 0 : 61) and pore-water DOC concentrations (2 < RMSE < 11 mg L-1) in a time series (1 April 2014 to 15 December 2017) in two contrasting locations (rewetted and control) in the peatland. Hydrological restoration was found to impact the water balance through a decrease in slow deep drainage and an increase in fast superficial runoff. Observed DOC concentrations were higher in summer in the rewetted location compared to the control area and were linked to a difference in dissolved organic matter composition analyzed by fluorescence. Hydrological conditions, especially the severity of the water-table drawdown in summer, were identified as the major factor controlling DOC-concentration dynamics. The results of the simulation suggest that the hydrological restoration did not affect DOC loads, at least in a short-term period (3 years). However, it impacted the temporal dynamics of DOC exports, which were the most episodic and were mainly transported through fast surface runoff in the area affected by the restoration, while slow deep drainage dominated DOC exports in the control area. In relation to dominant hydrological processes, exported DOC is expected to be derived from more recent organic matter in the top peat layer in the rewetted area, compared to the control area. Since it is calibrated on water-table and DOC concentration, the model presented in this study proved to be a relevant tool in identifying the main hydrological processes and factors controlling DOC dynamics in different areas of the same peatland. It is also a suitable alternative to a discharge-calibrated catchment model when the outlet is not easy to identify or to monitor.

AB Boreal peatlands have significant emissions of non-methane biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Climate warming is expected to affect these ecosystems both directly, with increasing temperature, and indirectly, through water table drawdown following increased evapotranspiration. We assessed the combined effect of warming and water table drawdown on the BVOC emissions from boreal peatland microcosms. We also assessed the treatment effects on the BVOC emissions from the peat soil after the 7-week long experiment. Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, other reactive VOCs and other VOCs were sampled using a conventional chamber technique, collected on adsorbent and analyzed by GC-MS. Carbon emitted as BVOCs was less than 1% of the CO(2) uptake and up to 3% of CH(4) emission. Water table drawdown surpassed the direct warming effect and significantly decreased the emissions of all BVOC groups. Only isoprene emission was significantly increased by warming, parallel to the increased leaf number of the dominant sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. BVOC emissions from peat soil were higher under the control and warming treatments than water table drawdown, suggesting an increased activity of anaerobic microbial community. Our results suggest that boreal peatlands could have concomitant negative and positive radiative forcing effects on climate warming following the effect of water table drawdown. The observed decrease in CH(4) emission causes a negative radiative forcing while the increase in CO(2) emission and decrease in reactive BVOC emissions, which could reduce the cooling effect induced by the lower formation rate of secondary organic aerosols, both contribute to increased radiative forcing.

AB (1) Cylindrical cores, 30 cm diameter by 40 cm deep, were cut from the living surface of a raised bog and installed in buckets of the same diameter. The cores were kept outdoors, and their natural water levels maintained with distilled water, until transfer to constant temperature rooms for experiments. Gas fluxes and concentration profiles were measured by quadrupole mass spectrometry. (2) Concentration profiles show that there is an intense source of CH4 about 15 cm below the watertable, and that peaks in the profile move up and down with the watertable. The source can be turned on and off in a few hours. (3) The efflux of CHL depends exponentially on (Celsius) temperature, and is 20% greater in light than it is in the dark, even when the surface vegetation is Sphagnum moss without any vascular plants. (4) Efflux from hollow, lawn, and hummock microhabitats depends negatively and linearly on the depth of the watertable. The slope of the relation is almost the same in ail three microhabitats. (5) When Menyanthes trifoliata (bogbean) is present in hollows the efflux is greater than when only Sphagnum is present. The movement of argon shows that the roots and shoots of Menyanthes provide a high-conductance route between the peat and the atmosphere. (6) Field temperature, precipitation and watertable were recorded for a hydrological (Oct-Sept) year on a raised bog in southwest Scotland. Expected efflux of CH4 was calculated using the experimentally determined relations and the measured temperature and watertable. The mean of these calculated values agreed with the mean of measured values, though individual points were scattered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water managers, policy makers, and farmers need tools to estimate the impact of water management on agricultural yields, economic benefits, and environmental effects to be able to make strategic and operational decisions. Historically, relationships between groundwater level and crop yields were used to calculate the reductions in crop yield due to suboptimal water status of fields. Nowadays, state-of-the-art deterministic models for water flow and crop production can be coupled to simulate the effects of changing water management. For dairy farms, an integral management model has been developed and applied to simulate decisions on grazing and cutting, and calculate farm economics. Soil physical conditions, crop yields, and farm management are simulated for a number of years, based on daily weather data. For a dairy farm in a peat district in the central part of The Netherlands, a rise of the ditch water level from 60 till 40 cm below the soil surface resulted in wetter conditions in the topsoil and a lower bearing capacity; a reduction of 0.8 tonnes/ha grass production and EUR222 ha(-1) lower economic benefit. Higher ditch water levels increase also the variation in farm economic results between years, and thus lead to higher economic risks for the farmers. Increased phosphorous leaching to surface waters is another risk when ditch water levels are raised. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil hydraulic properties are frequently obtained from evaporation experiments. Different methods exist to infer soil hydraulic properties from these experiments. Commonly proposed is the 'direct method' (or 'Simplified Evaporation Method') by which soil hydraulic properties are calculated analytically. An alternative is given by inverse parameter optimization (Inverse method'). Although soil hydraulic properties are frequently estimated by the 'direct method', only very few studies have focused on the question how accurate derived parameters can reproduce laboratory measurements. This can be achieved by modeling the water flow with a processed based numerical forward model, e.g. with HYDRUS-1D. Here, we applied the 'direct method' and 'inverse method' to a large dataset of evaporation experiments on 431 organic soil samples. The derived soil hydraulic parameters were used in HYDRUS-1D simulations and their performance in reproducing measured states and fluxes was compared. As an additional analysis, we tested how water contents at the permanent wilting point can aid stabilizing parameter estimation by adding information on water retention in the dry range. For all methods, soil hydraulic properties were determined with the soil hydraulic functions of van Genuchten-Mualem and Peters-Dumer-Iden.
   The results show that parameters derived with the 'direct method' do often not well reproduce measured pressure heads over the complete pressure head range of the evaporation experiments when they were used for HYDRUS-1D simulations (mean objective function value 0.05831). Parameters derived by the 'inverse method' provided a better performance in the HYDRUS-1D simulations if the full pressure head range of the evaporation experiments was considered (mean objective function value 0.00099), but a weaker performance when focusing on wet conditions (pressure heads > - 100 cm). Constraining the 'inverse method' by additional soil moisture measurements at permanent wilting point improved the prediction of the soil moisture at dry conditions. For the full pressure head range, the hydraulic functions of Peters-Durner-Iden performed better than the ones of van Genuchten-Mualem.

AB The distribution of stable water isotopes provides valuable insight into runoff generation processes in subarctic wetland regions of the Mackenzie River basin, a major freshwater contributor to the Arctic Ocean and the focus of intensive hydrological research as part of Canada's contribution to the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX). This article describes a streamflow hydrograph separation analysis carried out over three complete annual cycles (1997-1999) for five subarctic catchments ranging in size from 202 to 2050 km(2) situated near the confluence of the Liard and Mackenzie rivers. This heterogeneous landscape, characterized by extensive wetlands (fen and bog), shallow lakes and widespread discontinuous permafrost, is representative of vast flow-contributing areas of the upper Mackenzie Valley, and is suspected to be highly sensitive to climate variability and change. We document seasonal patterns and interannual variability in the isotopic composition of local streamflow, attributable to mixing of three distinctly labelled flow sources, namely groundwater, surface water plus rain, and direct snowmelt, and apply these isotopic signals to partition sources and their temporal variability. Although groundwater input is the dominant and most persistent streamflow source in all five catchments throughout the year, direct snowmelt runoff via surface and shallow subsurface pathways (during spring freshet) and surface waters from lakes and wetlands situated in low-lying areas of the basins (during summer and fall) are also significant seasonal contributors. Catchment-specific differences are also apparent, particularly in the generation of snowmelt runoff, which is more attenuated in fen-dominated than in bog-dominated catchments. The data set additionally reveals notable interannual variability in snow isotope signatures and snow water equivalent, apparently enhanced by the 1998 El Nino event.

AB The ice core recovered from Prospector Russell Col on Mt Logan (5.4 km a.s.l.), in the Yukon spans over 20 000 years. This unique record offers a Pacific view of the stable isotope and chemical record from the Lateglacial to the present. The timescale is based on seasonal counted years, the largest known volcanic acid signatures and the major shift in stable isotopes and chemistry at the end of the Younger Dryas. There are large and sustained changes in the stable isotopic record that are anti-correlated with marine and continental chemistry series. The oxygen-18 in this area is not a proxy for palaeotemperature but rather for source region. The last major isotope shift in AD 1840 in delta(O-18) and chemistry is compared with the Quinn's ENSO record. During periods of more frequent La Nina (stronger tropical easterlies) there is more zonal flow of water vapour transport to the Pacific Northwest, delta(O-18) values are larger and the deuterium excess d smaller. These periods coincide with periods of lower accumulation/precipitation in southern Yukon. The Holocene delta(O-18) record indicates many large shifts between the meridional (strong El Nino) and zonal (La Nina). Comparison of the Logan isotopic record and the moisture/temperature-sensitive time series of peat bog inception dates for the Northwest shows a strong correlation (0.36) that points to high accumulation rates coincident with low delta(O-18) and enhanced meridional flow. Major changes in the core at 4200 BP and 7000-8000 BP point to enhanced meridional flow, which coincide with big changes in the Pacific palaeorecords of the balance between El Nino and La Nina. 4200 BP seems to have inaugurated the 'modern' ENSO world.

AB Coal seams preserve continuous and high-resolution records of paleoenvironments and wildfire events during peat accumulation. In order to elucidate wildfire characteristics and terrestrial climate changes during the time of peat accumulation, petrographic characteristics of coals in the Lower Cretaceous Yimin Formation (Albian) in the Jiuqiao Sag, Hailar Basin, NE China were studied. Coal petrology analysis shows that the studied coal seams are characterized by dominant huminite (average 80.0 vol.%, mmfmineral matter free), secondary inertinite (average 19.9 vol.%, mmf), and a very low mineral content (average 0.8 vol.%). These results suggest that the coal developed under waterlogged conditions in raised, ombrotrophic mires. The occurrence of moderate inertinite values in the coals implies that wildfires were frequent during the Albian. Burning temperature, ranging from 273 to 379 degrees C inferred from inertinite reflectances, indicates that wildfires during the Albian were ground fires because of low plant heights. Vertical trends in inertinite and huminite compositional changes within the coal seams may reflect localscale, cyclic fluctuations in wildfire occurrence during the development of the peat mires. The likely cause of these fluctuations was changes in temperature and rainfall. The presence of significant levels of inertinite in the coals and inferred high atmospheric oxygen levels suggest that the Albian was a highly fire-prone period in the Hailar Basin. The recurrent occurrences of palaeo-wildfires events in the studied succession in the Hailar Basin reinforce that fire was an important element affecting wetland biodiversity during the Albian, while diversification and spread of angiosperms was taking place globally. Increased surface runoff and erosion after the palaeo-wildfires in the Jiuqiao Sag during the Albian may have enhanced the flux and availability of nutrients and sediments washing into the fluvial, lacustrine, and marine systems, further contributing to the Albian dysoxic-anoxic events.

AB There is increasing concern regarding how to sustainably meet the basic needs of a growing population with a continuously decreasing resource base. This study analyses the water-energy-food nexus in Burundi. The country experiences challenging demographic pressures which increase the demand for food, energy, and freshwater. Yet strategies developed to meet requirements lead to natural resource depletion and degradation. Being a resource-poor country, the population depends mainly on agriculture for food, labor, and income. In order to increase food production, agriculture was intensified using traditional methods, mainly by clearing new, mostly marginal land, increasing cultivation cycles per year. The overexploitation of land decreased the soil fertility and yields, and increased deforestation and soil erosion. This has resulted in mass impoverishment of farmers and a growing malnutrition rate in the countryside. On the other hand, poverty often correlates directly with the type of energy supply and food security. Energy is provided mainly by biomass through firewood, charcoal, peat, and agricultural residues, which implies further deforestation. These factors increase the pressure on existing forest areas both for the reclamation of new agricultural land and for the production of firewood and charcoal. Finally, Burundi is classified by the UN as a country with economic water scarcity due to the population growth rate, low level of education, and a high poverty rate. The economic water scarcity is closely linked to energy production and to agriculture. More hydropower could reduce the extent of deforestation. The high deforestation rate reduces the infiltration rate (less groundwater recharge) and increases surface run-off. The latter is leading to higher erosion and loss of soil fertility, thus influencing agriculture and food security negatively. (C) 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Testate amoebae are a diverse and abundant group of protozoa that constitute a large proportion of biomass in many ecosystems and probably fill important roles in ecosystem function. These microorganisms have attracted the interest of paleoecologists because the preserved shells of testate amoebae and their known hydrological preferences enable reconstruction of past hydrological change. In ombrotrophic peatlands, surface wetness reflects hydroclimate, so testate amoebae can play an important role in reconstruction of Holocene climate change. Previous studies, however, have been geographically restricted, mostly to North America and Europe. We studied the ecology of testate amoebae in peatlands from central China in relation to hydrology, pH and metal concentrations. We found that testate amoeba community structure was correlated with depth to water table (DWT) and that the hydrological preferences of species generally matched those of previous studies. We developed a weighted average DWT transfer function that enables prediction of water table depth with a cross-validated mean error of < 5 cm. Our results demonstrate the potential for using testate amoebae to reconstruct paleohydrology in China. Such studies could contribute to our understanding of Holocene climate changes in China, particularly regarding past Asian monsoon activity.

AB Peatland pipes are large natural macropores that contribute significantly to streamflow and represent a potentially important transport pathway between terrestrial and aquatic/atmospheric systems. Our study aimed to estimate the contribution of pipe flow to catchment-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) losses (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in a British peatland using a combination of fortnightly spot and continuous sensor measurements. Interpipe variability was high for all GHGs. Mean pipe water concentrations ranged from 0.70 to 6.51 mg C L-1, 0.90 to 897 mu g C L-1, and 0.36 to 1.36 mu g N L-1 for CO2, CH4, and N2O, respectively. High-resolution CO2 data showed temporal changes in the connectivity between pipes and the surrounding peat, with connectivity greatest when water table was high and lowest at low water table depths when discharge was associated with deeper, CO2-enriched sources. Total downstream export from the eight studied pipes represented 3%, 38%, and 3% of CO2, CH4, and N2O export at the catchment outlet, while contributing only similar to 2% of total catchment runoff. Direct degassing of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere was evident from an intensively monitored pipe outlet. Upscaling evasion estimates from the pipe outlets gave conservative catchment-scale emission rates of 7.08 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1) and 50.2 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1) for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Although the catchment-scale estimates contain significant uncertainty, they highlight the potential importance of pipes as a pathway for the release of terrestrially produced GHGs to the atmosphere.

TI SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF METHANE FLUX IN A MINNESOTA PEATLAND MEASURED

AB Methane flux was measured using the micrometeorological eddy correlation technique during 62 days in mid-May through mid-October 1991 in a peatland ecosystem in north central Minnesota. Application of this technique allows measurement of spatially integrated fluxes. The distribution of methane flux consisted of a gradual pattern with several episodic emissions superimposed. The gradual (nonepisodic) pattern of methane flux (daytime average) exhibited an increase from 30-120 mg m-2 d-1 in late May to early July to 125-160 mg m-2 d-1 in mid-July to mid-August and then a decline to 100-35 mg m-2 d-1 in early September to mid-October. Peat temperature (at 0.1 m depth) and water table depth accounted for about 70% of the variance in the methane flux data. The episodic emissions were associated with drops in atmospheric pressure and a declining water table. Generally, the hourly values of daytime methane flux were fairly stable, perhaps with a slight depression during the midday. However, on days with episodic emissions, the daytime methane flux had a peak during the midafternoon, and its pattern appeared to be similar to those of the standard deviation of atmospheric pressure fluctuations and mean horizontal wind velocity. The ratio of soil CO2 to methane fluxes (during nonepisodic emission periods) increased with increasing water table depth in a manner similar to that observed in a laboratory study of peat columns from different wetland types in Quebec. The annual methane emission for this ecosystem was estimated to be about 16-19.5 g m-2 yr-1.

AB Saline wetlands represent potential natural analogs for reclaimed wetlands in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR). Thus, an understanding of the drivers of salinity changes in natural wetlands can provide insight into how reconstructed peatlands in the AOSR may evolve given that they are constructed with saline oil sands reclamation materials. Here, we investigate the nature of salinity changes from the analysis of sediment cores at three ponds situated within a saline peat-forming wetland near Fort McMurray (Alberta). Past changes in salinity were reconstructed using weighted-averaging transfer functions based on diatoms and an environmental dataset from 32 saline boreal ponds. Results reveal complex "precipitation-surface water-groundwater" interactions associated with differences in the hydrologic functioning of the studied ponds, and their connectivity with shallow groundwater aquifers and adjacent wetlands. Relationships between cumulative departure from mean precipitation and DI-salinity suggest that precipitation may control salinity both directly and indirectly. In ponds recharged predominantly by meteoric water, precipitation may govern salinity directly by dilution of salt content in water, so that rises in precipitation result in a salinity decline. In ponds situated within a saline groundwater discharge zone, salinity may be influenced by precipitation indirectly through recharge of the saline aquifer, so increases in precipitation lead to rises in salinity. Our study suggests that complex salinity response to precipitation change, coupled with notable range of salinity fluctuation within natural saline fens should be considered while designing saline constructed wetlands and predicting their potential resilience under climate change.

   VARIABILITY
AB Peat cores were taken from eight primary and one secondary raised bog sites throughout the United Kingdom in order to determine the pathways of succession between the microform (hummock, ridge, lawn, hollow, and pool) plant communities of the mid to late Holocene. All of these sites have undergone drainage and/or cutting in the recent past, at least. The plant communities were reconstructed by using plant macrofossil analysis, and they are defined primarily by the dominant species of Sphagnum. While plant macrofossils may be used to infer hydrological conditions, an alternative proxy, using testate amoebae, was utilized. This group of organisms was used to avoid circular arguments when relating the vegetation changes to hydrological events. Consequently, a conceptual model of late Holocene succession on British raised mires is constructed that elucidates succession between the microform plant communities according to changes in the water table depth, its stability, quality, and physical disturbance of the vegetation cover. The general sequence of ombrogenous communities was elucidated to be, with increasing height above the water tables, S. cuspidatum and S. auriculatum > Sphagnum sect. Cymbifolia taxa > Sphagnum sect. Acutifolia taxa > a return of Sphagnum sect. Cymbifolia taxa > non-Sphagnum mosses.
   A major pathway toward degradation of the mire is apparent in modern times, and recovery is typically via a phase of dominance by S. tenellum prior to the establishment of either S. magellanicum or S. papillosum. Although this disturbance is of a large magnitude, it was found that equable or more severe perturbations to the water table had occurred in the past, especially at coastal sites where marine regression led to the establishment of Sphagnum-poor communities dominated by Calluna and Eriophorum vaginatum. The long-term persistence of hummock-hollow vegetation communities is demonstrated, but the appearance of persistent, more homogeneous phases suggests that this surface topography is not always well developed.

AB The testate amoebae communities living among different species of mosses in Sphagnum peatlands in eastern Poland were studied. Sampling was done on a monthly basis from April to November 2005-2007. To assess the importance of the vertical distribution of testate amoebae within the mosses, each sample was cut into two parts: the upper living part (1-5 cm) and the lower dead part (5-10 cm). The highest species richness occurred in hollows dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium, Sphagnum flexuosum and Sphagnum palustre. Lower numbers of taxa were observed in hummocks dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum, Polytrichum strictum and Polytrichum commune. There was a distinct horizontal micro-zonation of the abundance of testate amoebae occurring among Sphagnum mosses, but only a small difference ascertained among Polytrichum. The number of testate amoebae was significantly greater in the deeper samples. The results demonstrated that depth to water table, pH and total organic carbon can strongly regulate the abundance and taxonomic composition of testate amoebae.

AB We used a relatively simple two-layer, coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry model to simultaneously simulate streamflow and stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in a small lead and arsenic contaminated upland peat catchment in northwestern Germany. The model procedure was informed by an initial data mining analysis, in combination with regression relationships of discharge, DOC, and element export. We assessed the internal model DOC processing based on stream DOC hysteresis patterns and 3-hourly time step groundwater level and soil DOC data for two consecutive summer periods in 2013 and 2014. The parsimonious model (i.e., few calibrated parameters) showed the importance of nonlinear and rapid near-surface runoff generation mechanisms that caused around 60% of simulated DOC load. The total load was high even though these pathways were only activated during storm events on average 30% of the monitoring time-as also shown by the experimental data. Overall, the drier period 2013 resulted in increased nonlinearity but exported less DOC (115 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) +/- 11 kgCha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to the equivalent but wetter period in 2014 (189 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) +/- 38 kgCha(-1) yr-1). The exceedance of a critical water table threshold (-10 cm) triggered a rapid near-surface runoff response with associated higher DOC transport connecting all available DOC pools and subsequent dilution. We conclude that the combination of detailed experimental work with relatively simple, coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry models not only allowed the model to be internally constrained but also provided important insight into how DOC and tightly coupled pollutants or trace elements are mobilized.
   Plain Language Summary Peat soils act as important carbon sinks, but they also release large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the aquatic system. The DOC export is strongly tied to soluble heavy metals and other pollutants, which can pose a threat to human health. However, limited knowledge exists as to how much of these substances are mobilized, how they are mobilized in terms of flow pathways, and under which hydrometeorological conditions. In this regard, models can be useful and here we present a simple, conceptual model coupling the element export to hydrology. We could identify the nonlinear and rapid nature of the runoff generation mechanisms and their overwhelming influence on DOC (>60%) and element export in our small peat catchment. Furthermore, only, if all DOC pools were connected above a certain soil water level, such rapid near-surface flow paths developed. We concluded that simple models coupling the hydrology to biogeochemistry allowed to gain important insight into how DOC and tightly coupled heavy metals are mobilized in peat soil catchments.

AB A seasonal study of radium-derived submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and associated nitrogen fluxes was carried out in a salt marsh estuary between 2001 and 2003 (Pamet River Estuary, Massachusetts). Twelve-hour time series of salinity and radium at the estuary inlet were used to determine the relative importance of fresh versus saline SGD, respectively. The distinct radium (Ra-228: Ra-226) isotopic signature of marsh peat pore water and aquifer-derived brackish groundwater was used to further partition the Ra-derived SGD estimate. Of these three groundwater sources, only the marsh-derived groundwater was constant across time. The ratio of brackish to fresh SGD was inversely correlated with water table elevation in the aquifer, suggesting that Ra-derived SGD was enhanced during dry periods. The various SGD fluxes were responsible for an average annual dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) input of between 1.7 mol m(-2) yr(-1) and 7.1 mol m(-2) yr(-1) and a soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) flux of 0.13-0.54 mol m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately 30% of the SGD-derived DIN and SRP flux is exported to coastal waters (Cape Cod Bay), whereas 70% is retained by the salt marsh ecosystem.

AB To evaluate the effect of vegetation change on greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from a wetland ecosystem, the CO2, CH4 and N2O budgets from whole area (21.5 ha) of the Bibai Wetland, where dwarf bamboo (Sasa) or Ilex has invaded into original Sphagnum dominated vegetation, located in Hokkaido, Japan were estimated. The original Sphagnum-dominated vegetation was changed from a sink to a source of CO2 by invasion of short-Sasa (50 cm > height), while the invasion of tall-Sasa (50 cm < height < 150 cm) or Ilex increased CO2 uptake. Annual CH4 emission was decreased by the invasion of Sasa or Ilex. The annual N2O emission was slightly increased by invasion of Ilex only. These GHG budgets were correlated with the environmental factors related to the water table depth. The distribution of vegetation and environmental factors was estimated from satellite image bands, and the GHG budget of the entire wetland was estimated. The whole wetland area was considered to be a sink for GHG (-113 Mg CO2-eq y(-1)) and CO2 uptake by tall-Sasa occupied 71% of the GHG budget. The vegetation change due to the lowering of the water table depth currently increases the rate of carbon accumulation in the ecosystem by about 5 times.

AB Peatlands are the dominant landscape element in many northern watersheds where they can have an important influence on the hydrology of streams. However, the capacity of peatlands to moderate stream flow during critical dry periods remains uncertain partly due to the difficulty of estimating discharge from extensive peat deposits. We therefore used two different approaches to quantify diffuse pore water contributions from peatlands to a creek within a small watershed in Southcentral Alaska. A sensitivity analysis of a water budget for a representative peatland within this watershed showed that a substantial surplus of pore water may remain available for subsequent discharge during a dry period after accounting for water losses to evapotranspiration. These findings were supported by end member mixing analysis (EMMA), which indicated that 55% of the stream flow during a dry period originated from the near-surface layers of peatlands within the watershed. Contributions from peatlands to stream flow in northern coastal regions may therefore provide an important buffer against the potentially harmful effects of changing climatic conditions on commercially important fish species.

AB Emissions of b ogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from dry ecosystems at high latitudes respond strongly to small increases in temperature, and warm canopy surface temperatures drive emissions to higher levels than expected. However, it is not known whether emissions from wetlands, cooled by through-flowing water and higher evapotranspiration show similar response to warming as in drier ecosystems. Climate change will cause parts of the Arctic to experience increased snow fall, which delays the start of the growing season, insulates soil from low temperatures in winter, and increases soil moisture and possibly nutrient availability. Currently the effects of increasing snow depth on BVOC emissions are unknown. BVOC emissions were measured in situ across the growing season in a climate experiment, which used open top chambers to increase temperature and snow fences to increase winter snow depth. The treatments were arranged in a full factorial design. Measurements took place during two growing seasons in a fen ecosystem in west Greenland. BVOC samples collected by an enclosure technique in adsorbent cartridges were analysed using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was measured with a closed chamber technique, to reveal any immediate effect of treatments on photosynthesis, which could further influence BVOC emissions. Isoprene made up 84-92% of the emitted BVOCs. Isoprene emission increased 240 and 340% due to an increase in temperature of 1.3 and 1.6 degrees C in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Isoprene emissions were 25 times higher in 2015 than in 2014 most likely due to a 2.4 degrees C higher canopy air temperature during sampling in 2015. Snow addition had no significant effect on isoprene emissions even though GEP was increased by 24%. Arctic BVOC emissions respond strongly to rising temperatures in wet ecosystems, suggesting a large increase in arctic emissions in a future warmer climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spring-fed fen deposits (peat-tufa sequences) from northern Poland were investigated for Holocene environmental reconstruction (climate and hydrology) using multi-proxy analysis (lithofacies, molluscs, pollen, plant macrofossils, geochemistry, and stable oxygen- and carbon-isotopes). The main aims of these studies were: (1) comparison of several similar sites with the same type of groundwater supply and sedimentation on a widespread space scale, (2) detailed reconstruction of their long-term development, assessing their sensitivity to climate change, (3) verification of the synchronicity of the record of different proxies in distant sites in the context of Holocene climate changes in relation to specific well-known global and/or regional climate events (so-called Bond events), and (4) discussion on permafrost degradation as a driver of spring-fed fens development.
   Based on our palaeogeographical data, we have distinguished an asynchronicity of the beginning of the development of spring-fed fens in the eastern and western parts of the studied region that is associated with different times of ascending groundwater supply unblocking after complete permafrost degradation. Therein, asynchronicity of permafrost degradation was brought about by multiple climatic, geological and structural conditions. Our results also indicate significant differences in the trends of succession (ecological and lithological) caused by the geographical location of the studied sites. Asynchronicity of the occurrence of wet and dry phases, as well as significant differences in their duration were noted. This depended upon the influence of oceanic (western part) or continental climates (eastern part). Warm and humid oceanic climate promoted the domination and longer duration of wet phases (especially in the Eo- and early Mesoholocene), while the harsh continental climate promoted the more frequent occurrence of dry phases, with short episodes of increased humidity. From the middle Mesoholocene, this marked regional diversification becomes less pronounced. Results also allowed for the recognition of several palaeoclimatic events on a regional scale. Four main cold episodes (Bond events 8 -5): during LG/H transition (11.5 ky cal BP), Eo- (similar to 10.25 ky cal BP, similar to 9.4 ky cal BP) and at the beginning of the Mesoholocene (similar to 8.2 ky cal BP) are well-documented by multiple proxies at all study sites. Other cold episodes (Bond events 4-0) are slightly less documented and are not clear for interpretation. The results of our study demonstrate the importance of spring-fed fen deposits for detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstruction on a regional scale. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fine root production and its relationships to aboveground plant components and environmental drivers such as water table have been poorly quantified in peatland ecosystems, despite being the primary input of labile carbon to peat soils. We studied the relationship between fine root (< 1 mm) production, aboveground biomass and growing season water table within an ombrotrophic peatland in eastern Ontario. We installed 80 in-growth bags (10 cm diameter) to measure fine root production over the full range of 40 cm in water table depth. The point-intersect method was used to estimate peak aboveground biomass components (total, leaf and stem) for the 0.36 m(2) area surrounding each in-growth bag. Mean fine root production was 108 +/- 71 g m(-2) y(-1) and was strongly related to both aboveground biomass and water table. Linear regression analysis showed strong allometric relationships between fine root production and aboveground biomass for shrubs (r (2) = 0.61, p < 0.001), suggesting that fine root production estimates can be approximated using aboveground biomass data. Water table had a significant effect on the allocation of biomass to fine roots, leaves and stems with a deeper water table significantly increasing both fine root production at depth and at each depth increment. Shrub biomass allocation to leaves and stems similarly shifted, with greater investment in stems relative to leaves with a deeper water table. As a result, greater fine root biomass was produced per unit leaf biomass in areas with a deeper water table, illustrating an important tradeoff between leaf and fine root tissues in drier conditions. Our results indicate that any drop in water table will likely increase aboveground biomass stocks and the influx of labile carbon to peat soils via fine roots and leaves.

AB Twelve wetland complexes were buried and/or drained by golf course and ski area development in the Colorado Rocky Mountains in the 1980s and early 1990s. We restored all or portions of each wetland, including fens, wet meadows and riparian areas, during 1997-2002. Intensive pre- and post-construction monitoring was used to develop restoration plans and evaluate their success. We revisited the sites to analyze long-term restoration processes in 2013-2016. Prior to construction the depth to the water table was measured weekly in monitoring wells installed through the fill, and into the wetland surfaces during and following restoration. Reference sites for each wetland type were used to characterize water tabledepth and vegetation for each wetland type. Restoration included removal of fill material and drains to create land surfaces with water table depth and dynamics similar to the reference areas for each wetland type. We planted each site with nursery grown sedges, willows and herbaceous dicots. Post restoration monitoring of water table depth, vegetation composition, sedge shoot density and willow growth was analyzed.
   The water table depth and dynamics of each restored wetland was similar to suitable reference sites on short and long time scales, indicating a stable hydrologic regime. Carex utriculata reached its maximum shoot density 4-5 years after planting indicating rapid growth and high production. Willow stems were still increasing in height 15 years after planting and basal stem density was also increasing. Most planted herbaceous dicots disappeared, indicating the difficulty of establishing them from plantings. Exotic (nonnative) plants have invaded all three wetland types, with their highest cover in riparian areas. Critical factors that led to success were careful hydrological analysis of reference and restoration sites prior to earthwork, creating appropriate land/ground water interactions, and establishing clonal rhizomatoussedges and native willows.

AB Hydrological conditions play a key role in the carbon cycle of northern peatlands. This study examines the evapotranspiration (ET) dynamics and its impact on the water and energy balance in response to differing meteorological conditions during the exceptionally dry year 2006 and the normal wet year 2007 at a boreal peatland in Finland. Energy and water vapor fluxes were determined continuously using the eddy covariance approach. Daily ET rates varied considerably during the growing season and averaged 2.23 +/- 0.15 mm d (1) and 1.59 +/- 0.07 mm d (1) in the dry and wet year, respectively. Synoptic weather conditions as reflected by incoming radiation and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the key factors controlling ET. Differences in the precipitation patterns and summer temperature also accounted for some of the observed differences in ET between the 2 years. No evidence was found for a relationship between ET rates and water table level, probably due to the relatively high water table level even in the dry year. Latent heat flux dominated the energy balance, particularly in the dry year 2006 with 60% of cumulative precipitation returned to the atmosphere through ET. In the wet year 2007, runoff dominated the water loss, and only 36% of the cumulative precipitation was returned to the atmosphere through ET. While the annual water balance regime of the peatland was mainly regulated by the precipitation pattern, daily measured ET was closely related to potential evaporation, and latent heat flux could be well modeled by the Penman-Monteith approach, suggesting two feasible schemes for ET prediction in peatlands under well watered conditions.

Nowhere is this more prevalent than within high latitude regions where peatlands have, over millennia, accumulated legacy carbon stocks comparable to all human CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Drying increases rates of peat decomposition and associated atmospheric and aquatic carbon emissions. The degree to which severe wildfires enhance drying under future climates and induce instability in peatland ecological communities and carbon stocks is unknown. Here we show that high burn severities increased post-fire evapotranspiration by 410% within a feather moss peatland by burning through the protective capping layer that restricts evaporative drying in response to low severity burns. High burn severities projected under future climates will therefore leave peatlands that dominate dry sub-humid regions across the boreal, on the edge of their climatic envelopes, more vulnerable to intense post-fire drying, inducing high rates of carbon loss to the atmosphere that amplify the direct combustion emissions.

AB Preferential flow of water through soil macropores is known to contribute to groundwater and surface water contamination as well as stream bank instability. However, research on the mechanisms and extent of soil macroporosity is limited due to the lack of a practical technique to study macropores in situ without disrupting the site's ecological function. In this paper, we present a ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-based methodology for detecting soil macropores smaller than 10 cm in diameter within 1 m of the soil surface and then creating a computerized tomogram of the macropore network. Manual and automated algorithms for macropore detection were tested for scan data collected using a 900-MHz radar antenna in a field experiment with a silt-loam soil. Buried polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes were used to simulate soil macropores of different diameters and fill contents intersected by GPR scan lines at four different angles. Pipes >= 3.00 cm in diameter were clearly detectable regardless of the scan line orientation relative to the target, and pipes with diameters as small as 1.85 cm were detected at perpendicular angles of intersection. In a second field experiment, PVC pipes of varying dimensions were buried at different depths to simulate a macropore network of preferential flow pathways. A branch-node algorithm was developed that referenced GPR scan line detections to create an accurate computer-generated three-dimensional map of the pipe network.

AB Species-rich plant communities characteristic for succession from mesotrophic open water to fen are very rare in The Netherlands. These vegetation types used to occur in turf ponds in the low lying peatland area, created by pear dredging and filled with water due to seepage of mesotrophic, well-buffered groundwater. One of the goals of the National Nature Policy Plan is to create new opportunities for the initial terrestrialization communities through ecological engineering, e.g., restoration and creation of open water habitats. Restoration of the abiotic conditions in acidified floating fen communities is only possible by a combined measure of removal of the Sphagnum-layer and superficial drainage of surplus rain water. New turfponds have been excavated. This study showed that the abiotic conditions (i.e., water depth and water chemistry) are favorable for the development of aquatic communities characteristic of mesotrophic conditions. The aquatic plant species found in the new ponds also point in this direction, e.g., Chara major and Ch. delicatula are very abundant as are seven Potamogeton species. It is concluded that a constant discharge of groundwater and a good connectivity between the ponds and the existing remnants of plant communities desired in the area are essential for the conservation and development of these species-rich plant communities.

AB Methane fluxes were measured on vegetated surfaces ( 2003) and pools ( 2004) of three peatlands (LG1-LG2-LG3) located 30, 100, and 200 km along a transect from the James Bay coast, in the La Grande Riviere watershed, James Bay lowland, Quebec, Canada. Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent the biotypes characteristic of each peatland, from hummocks with a water table 35 cm below the surface to pools 100 cm deep. Average CH4 fluxes for the biotypes on vegetated surfaces sampled during summer 2003 ranged from 3.5 to 197 mg m(-2) d(-1), while summer 2004 average floating chamber pool fluxes ranged between 6.2 and 3165 mg CH4 m(2)(-) d(-1). Seasonal average daily CH4 fluxes on vegetated surface were strongly correlated with average water table depth, greater fluxes occurring where the water table was close to the surface, and with vegetation cover, particularly the aboveground biomass of sedges. Within the summer, increasing CH4 fluxes from vegetated surfaces were correlated with rising peat temperature. Pool fluxes from the LG1 and LG2 peatlands decreased with increasing pool depth, but not at LG3. Estimated growing season CH4 emissions for the three peatlands were of 44 +/- 21 ( standard error), 21 +/- 9.4 and 52 +/- 17 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) for the LG1, LG2, and LG3 peatlands, respectively. Estimated annual release of CH4 is 3.8 g m(-2) with the winter contributing to 13% of the overall emission, based on wintertime measurements at LG2.

AB The nutrients dynamics and groundwater flowpaths were studied in a riparian zone of the Narew River valley (NE, Poland). On the monthly basis a transect of monitoring wells extending across cropland, a row of trees, grass belt and mire up to a river were sampled for NO3-, SRP, Cl-, K+, Fe2+/3+. The Groundwater Modelling System (GMS) was used to assume the spatial and temporal aspects of groundwater movement. The highest concentration of nitrate, potassium and chloride were observed under the fertilized cropland. Their content diminished abruptly towards the wetland and the river. The soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations were highest in groundwater of deeper peat horizons and in alluvial sands beneath the peat. Our results revealed that water infiltrating from the field is diverted into alluvial sands beneath the riparian soils and probably below the range of plants roots. Thus, the removal of agrochemicals does not take place in shallow, organic-rich sediments or soils of the riparian zone, but it occurs in sandy aquifer in the valley. Although tree and grassland strips do not play significant role in diminishing of groundwater pollutant transport they are important barrier for sediment-bound P transported from cropland with erosion and surface runoff.

AB We studied phenol oxidase (PO) activity in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands and a Carex-dominated freshwater marsh during a strong summer drought in Central New York, USA to determine whether PO activity might respond to expected climatic changes. Feat was sampled at different depths and within distinct vegetation types within the marsh. Carer-derived peat supported substantially higher PO activity (average = 0.030, range = 0.011-0.051 mu MOL diqc min(-1) mg dry peat(-1), at soil pH 5.5) than Sphagnum peat (average = 0.006, range = 0.001-0.015 mu MOL diqc min(-1) mg dry peat(-1), at soil pH 3.8). In both peat types, PO activity showed a strong exponential increase with increased solution pH. Phenol oxidase activity in Sphagnum peat did not vary significantly during the drought, suggesting that PO activity may be constrained by low pH and enzyme inhibitors. Conversely, PO activity in the marsh pent varied with peat type and sample date but not as a consistent function of water-table depth. As a result, PO activity in Sphagnum peat appears to be regulated less by aeration and more by pH and possibly enzyme inhibitors. When pH is favorable, PO activity depends more on wetland vegetation type and botanical composition of the peat than climatic factors.

AB Peatlands are among the largest reservoirs of terrestrial carbon in the northern hemisphere. Understanding how this reservoir will respond to climate changes is critical to assessing potential climate feedbacks. Peatland carbon accumulation rates (PCAR) are controlled by the difference between production and decomposition, which is affected by local and climatic factors including hydrology and temperature. To better understand how local controls can influence the response of PCAR to climate change, we investigated modern hydrology, paleohydrology, and PCAR at two nearby Sphagnum-dominated peatlands with different surficial geology (lowland and moraine settings) in Southcentral Alaska. Modern hydrological data indicated a higher rate of subsurface drainage at the lowland site, suggesting greater hydrologic sensitivity to prolonged dry periods of the past. We investigated past responses of these peatlands to well-documented climatic changes, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) at similar to 1000-600 cal yr BP and Little Ice Age (LIA) at similar to 600-200 cal yr BP, using water-table depth (WTD) inferred from testate amoebae and PCAR calculated from loss-on-ignition and C-14-dating analyses. Our results indicate that WTD and PCAR remained relatively stable at the moraine site throughout the last 1100 years, including the MCA and LIA. However, the lowland site experienced relatively stable WTD and higher PCAR during the MCA, but highly variable WTD and lower PCAR during the LIA. These differences suggest that hydrology and likely decomposition were the primary control on PCAR at these peatlands. Our results highlight the importance of local-scale controls, like surficial geology, in mediating the response of peatland hydrology and carbon accumulation to climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Naturally-occurring wetlands perform such functions as flood control, pollution filtration, nutrient recycling, sediment accretion, groundwater recharge and water supply, erosion control, and plant and wildlife preservation. A large concentration of wetlands is located in Eastern Europe. A significant amount of Eastern European wetlands has been converted to agricultural use in the past, and remaining wetlands are subject to agricultural drainage. Drained wetlands are used as prime agriculture lands for a variety of food crops. Other agricultural uses of wetlands range from growing Phragmites australis (common reed) for thatch and livestock feed, to collecting peat for heating and cooking fuel. Altered hydrologic regimes due to global climate change could further exacerbate encroachment of agricultural land use into wetlands.
   The vulnerability and adaptation studies of the U.S. Country Studies Program are used to analyze where climate change impacts to agriculture may likewise impact wetland;areas. Scenarios indicate higher temperatures and greater evapotranspiration altering the hydrologic regime such that freshwater wetlands are potentially vulnerable in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Russia, and that coastal wetlands are at risk in Estonia. Runoff is identified as a key hydrological parameter affecting wetland function. Since wetland losses may increase as a result of climate-change-induced impacts to agriculture, precautionary management options are reviewed, such as establishing buffer areas, promoting sustainable uses of wetlands, and restoration of farmed or mined wetland areas. These options may reduce the extent of negative agricultural impacts on wetlands due to global climate change.

AB In many freshwater ecosystems, the contents of NO3- and SO42- have increased, whereas O-2 has been depleted due to the increased acid and nutrient loads. These changes may. affect carbon turnover and the dynamics of the major greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O. We studied the effects of O-2, NO3-, and SO42- availability on carbon mineralization, and fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the sediments of hypermeutrophic Lake Kevaton, Finland. Undisturbed sediment cores from the deep (9 m) and shallow (4 m) profundal were incubated in a laboratory microcosm with oxic and anoxic water flows with NO3- or SO42- concentrations of 0, 30, 100, 300, and 2000 muM. The carbon mineralization rate (i.e., the sum of released CO2-C and CH4-C) was not affected by the oxidants. However, the oxidants did change the pathways of carbon degradation and the release of CH4. All of the oxidants depressed CH4. fluxes in the shallow profundal sediments, which had low organic matter content. In the deep profundal sediments rich in organic matter, the CH4 release was reduced by O-2 but was not affected by SO42- (the effect of NO3- was not studied). There was an increase in N2O release as the overlying water NO3- concentration increased. Anoxia and highly elevated NO3- concentrations, associated with eutrophication, increased drastically the global warming potential (GWP) of the sedimentary gases in contrast to the SO42- load, which had only minor effects on the GWP.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins cover large areas of northern high latitude lowlands. However, the importance of peat accumulated in these drained basins to carbon (C) cycling is poorly understood. Results are presented here from a permafrost sediment core aimed at investigating site history, lake drainage, apparent carbon accumulation, and paleohydrology in a thermokarst basin on the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska. The results show that a thermokarst lake existed for about 2300 years before it drained and a peatland established in the early 1600s. Average apparent C accumulation rate (CAR) was 12 gC/m(2)/yr over the 2300 years before lake drainage, but increased to 120 gC/m(2)/yr following peatland initiation. After transitioning to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland at similar to 1700 AD, CAR reduced gradually before more than doubling from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. This abrupt increase in CAR was possibly in response to a Pacific climate regime shift in the late 1970s, a transition characterized by a nearly 1.5 degrees C increase in regional average annual temperature. Even after considering the differential decay of recent peat, there was an increase in C accumulation after 1977. Reconstructed water-table depths from subfossil testate amoebae show little change throughout the past three centuries, but there was a pronounced shift in testate amoeba composition after the 1977 temperature change (e.g., absence of Phryganella acropodia type and increase in Hyalosphenia elegans). If the results from peatlands in other drained thermokarst lake basins are consistent with the results from this study, then the C accumulated in these vegetated drained basins under current warming might help offset some of the C released from thawing permafrost and thermokarst features in northern regions.

   the Chateauguay River Watershed, Quebec
SO CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID CANADA
AB Groundwater recharge, groundwater-surface water interaction, and protection and management of the groundwater resource are strongly constrained by the geological nature of the substratum. A grid-oriented technique has been developed in order to build a 3D stratigraphic model of the Quaternary sediments overlying a regional fractured rock aquifer. The technique is based on the integration of the surficial sediments map and borehole logs with the use of GIS and grid-calculator software Vertical Mapper. The applied methodology focused on estimating the thickness of the stratigraphic units rather than the elevation of the contacts. First, a regular grid was generated over the study area with 30 x 30 m cells. The bulk thickness of the Quaternary sequence for each grid cell was computed as the difference between the terrain digital elevation model and the rock surface krigged over more than 5000 drillers' logs available. Two computation methods for estimating the discrete thicknesses are discussed and evaluated: the absolute method, in which the thickness of a given unit is computed as an independent value, and the relative method, in which the thickness is computed as a fraction of the bulk thickness. The simplified Quaternary stratigraphy consists, from top to bottom, of organics (peat), alluvium, lacustrine, aeolian, coarse marine, marine clay and fine silt, fine sandy and silty glacio-fluvial, coarse sandy and gravelly glacio-fluvial, and glacial (silty clayey till) sediments. Their spatial distribution respects filly the surficial sediments map and contacts. At locations with missing stratigraphic data, the borehole logs database was improved with the addition of control points representing the anticipated variation of the successive layers. With the absolute method, derivation of the thicknesses of the layered strata in zones of irregular bedding proved to be difficult. The relative computation method gives more consistent results for various stratigraphic settings and allows rapid, internally consistent estimation of the overburden stratification.

TI Modeling water fluxes through containerized soilless substrates using

SO VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL

ID GROWING MEDIA
AB Containerized crop production can enhance plant health and ensure environmental sustainability, yet proper management requires improved understanding of water fluxes and storage within soilless substrates. Numerical simulation tools developed to simulate water movement in porous media, such as HYDRUS-3D, may help to quantify effective hydraulic properties of soilless substrates but have not yet been tested in this capacity. Therefore, this study had three main objectives: (a) to assess the accuracy of HYDRUS-3D for simulating water flow through peat- and bark-based soilless substrates by comparing measured and modeled drainage and water storage; (b) to determine sensitivity of model outputs to individual hydraulic parameters; and (c) to compare model parameterization using three laboratory characterization methods (instantaneous profile sorption, instantaneous profile desorption, and evaporation) vs. inverse modeling with HYDRUS. The results showed that the modeled water contents and drainage timing and amounts were most sensitive to saturated volumetric water content (theta(s)) and least sensitive to saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s). With regard to parameterization methods, the inverse modeling approach provided the most accurate water balance simulations for both substrates, followed by the sorption method. These two methods estimated lower peak water contents and greater drainage compared with simulations parameterized using desorption and evaporation measurements. Overall, the study results showed that the Richards equation, as calculated using HYDRUS, can provide accurate simulations of water flux through containers when properly calibrated, though sorption-derived parameters may suffice when model optimization is impractical.

AB Drained and cultivated fen soils are characterised by continuous alteration of soil structure, which considerably complicates the precise simulation of soil water dynamics. Recently estimated van Genuchten parameters considering the gradient of moorsh-forming process were tested by hydrological modelling using HYDRUS-1D. Simulation was conducted for altogether four fen soil profiles of two peatland test sites varying in profile structure, land-use history and climate. Two parameter sets were applied to characterise the hydraulic properties of the fen soil profiles. The first one consisted of so far available or locally measured parameters, the second one of the new parameters, respectively. The quality of model output was assessed by comparing simulated and observed soil water contents or pore water pressure heads in consideration of the applied parameter sets. Model performance varied considerably for the fen soil profile under grassland use, where the mean normalised root mean square error (RMSEN) was 16.0% for the original parameters and 52.9% for the optimised ones. Contrasting results appeared due to the complex stratigraphy at the corresponding plot. For the rewetted plot formerly used as grassland, both parameter sets achieved comparable simulation results for all observation depths (RMSEN = 17.4%, 18.4% and 23.6%). When the locally measured hydraulic parameters were applied to the unused fen soil profiles solely influenced by drainage RMSEN decreased in average from 38.5% to 27.4% and 30.5% to 25.7%, respectively. However, for specific observation depths model's performance improved by using the optimised parameters. The problem of wettability of moorshified fen soil horizons was identified for one soil profile. Additionally, the new parameters created a more robust reaction in simulation when the residual water content was adjusted.

AB In boreal-drained peatland forests, tree growth is retarded by the gradual deterioration of drainage ditch networks. In order to avoid the development of suboptimal growth conditions, ditch network maintenance (DNM) operations (ditch cleaning and/or complementary ditching) are annually conducted on an area of about 70,000 ha in Finland. The previous studies indicate that the depth of the water table prior to DNM may influence the magnitude of the growth response to DNM. Tree growth does not necessarily increase after DNM at sites with large stand volume and subsequent low water levels due to tree stand evapotranspiration. We investigated how the pre-treatment water table depth (pre-WTD) in late summer relates to the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands after the DNM operation in 12 field experiments. The increase in mean annual volume growth caused by DNM was negatively related to the pre-WTD, with the highest growth response in stands where the pre-WTD was less than 25-30 cm. DNM did not clearly increase stand growth in sites where the pre-WTD was more than 35-40 cm below the soil surface. There was a high variation in growth response to DNM between the water levels from 20 to 35 cm below the soil surface, indicating that factors other than water table depth are also needed as decision criteria for assessing the appropriate timing of ditch network maintenance.

AB Floating fen ecosystems are home to several protected habitats and species. Their development and conservation require special attention regarding water management. Although they are known to be heterogeneous and partially buoyant, their root mats are simulated in hydrological models as homogeneous, static systems. The objective of this study is to quantify root mat heterogeneity and buoyancy and to assess their effects on groundwater flow and transport, and to determine if these factors need to be taken into account in modelling.
   We conducted field measurements of root mat heterogeneity and buoyancy in the 'Nieuwkoopse Plassen', the Netherlands. We found that hydraulic conductivity varied over four orders of magnitude and negatively correlated with degree of decomposition, resulting in a zonation of high conductivity near the surface and low conductivity in the deeper layers. Also, we found that the root mat moved vertically with the surface water. It became more buoyant with higher temperatures, but less buoyant with increasing groundwater levels relative to the surface.
   We implemented the findings in a semi-steady state hydrological model of a floating fen to compare the effects with other parameters. The profound heterogeneity had a limited effect on the water budget, but a clear effect on the flow lines and thus should be taken into account when modelling transport processes in floating fens. Although buoyancy affected the relative groundwater level near the root mat edge, it did not affect the water budget or the flow lines and may therefore be neglected in water budget modelling.

AB Three scales of temporal variability were present in methane (CH4) flux data collected during a 2.5 year (mid-1990-1992) study at a small, poor fen in southeastern New Hampshire. (1) There was a strong seasonality to the fluxes (high in summer); monthly average fluxes range from 21.4 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (February 1992) to 639.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (July 1991). Annual fluxes were 68.8 g CH4 m(-2) (1991) and 69.8 g CH4 m(-2) (1992). (2) There was interannual variability; distribution of flux intensity was very different from 1991 to 1992, particularly the timing and rapidity of the onset of higher fluxes in the spring. (3) There was a high degree of variability in CH4 flux during the warm season; four successive weekly flux rates in July 1991 were 957, 1044, 170, and 491 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Fluxes were correlated with peat temperature (r(2)=0.44) but only weakly with depth to water table (r(2)=0.14 for warm season data). Warm season fluxes appeared to be suppressed by rainstorms. Along with methane flux data we present an analysis of this temporal variability in flux, using a peatland soil climate model developed for this site. The model was driven by daily air temperature, precipitation, and net radiation; it calculated daily soil temperature and moisture profiles, water table location, and ice layer thickness. Temperature profiles were generally in good agreement with field data. Depth to water table simulations were good in 1992, fair in 1990, and poor in the summer of 1991. Using model-simulated peat climate and correlations to methane flux developed from the field data, simulated methane fluxes exhibited the same three modes of temporal variability that were present in the field flux data, though the model underestimated peak fluxes in 1990 and 1991. We conclude that temporal variability in flux is significantly influenced by climate/weather variability at all three scales and that rainfall appears to suppress methane flux for at least several days at this site.

AB Lake Zuvintas, located in southern Lithuania in the Dovine River basin, is one of the largest lakes and oldest nature reserves in the country. However, changes in the hydrology of the Dovine River basin, caused by large-scale land reclamation and water management works carried out in the 20th century, have resulted in a significant decrease in the biodiversity of the lake and surrounding wetlands. In order to halt the ongoing deterioration of the lake and wetlands, solutions have to be found at the basin level. Using the SIMGRO model, various measures were therefore analysed to evaluate their impact on the water management in the Dovine River basin. The results show that it is impossible to fully restore the water dynamics and flow pattern in the Dovine River to their original state. However, a good measure for improving the hydrological conditions is to block drainage ditches and remove bushes and trees from the wetlands.

AB Boreal peatlands are significant natural sources of methane and especially vulnerable to abrupt climate change. However, the controlling factors of CH4 emission in boreal peatlands are still unclear. In this study, we investigated CH4 fluxes and abiotic factors (temperature, water table depth, active layer depth, and dissolved CH4 concentrations in pore water) during the growing seasons in 2010 and 2011 in both shrub-sphagnum-and sedge-dominated plant communities in the continuous permafrost zone of Northeast China. The objective of our study was to examine the effects of vegetation types and abiotic factors on CH4 fluxes from a boreal peatland. In an Eriophorum-dominated community, mean CH4 emissions were 1.02 and 0.80 mg m(-2) h(-1) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. CH4 fluxes (0.38 mg m(-2) h(-1)) released from the shrub-mosses-dominated community were lower than that from Eriophorum-dominated community. Moreover, in the Eriophorum-dominated community, CH4 fluxes showed a significant temporal pattern with a peak value in late August in both 2010 and 2011. However, no distinct seasonal variation was observed in the CH4 flux in the shrub-mosses-dominated community. Interestingly, in both Eriophorum- and shrub-sphagnum-dominated communities, CH4 fluxes did not show close correlation with air or soil temperature and water table depth, whereas CH4 emissions correlated well to active layer depth and CH4 concentration in soil pore water, especially in the Eriophorum-dominated community. Our results suggest that CH4 released from the thawed CH4-rich permafrost layer may be a key factor controlling CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands, and highlight that CH4 fluxes vary with vegetation type in boreal peatlands. With increasing temperature in future climate patterns, increasing active layer depth and shifting plant functional groups in this region may have a significant effect on CH4 emission.

AB We have developed a novel and simple approach that can be used to derive effective in situ soil water retention characteristics from field monitoring time series in peatlands. The simplicity of the approach is given by the very limited data requirements, which comprise only precipitation, water table, and, if relevant, microrelief data. Our approach is built on two main assumptions: (i) for shallow groundwater systems, the soil moisture profile is always close to hydrostatic equilibrium; and (ii) during short time periods of high precipitation, the water storage change due to lateral fluxes is small compared with the precipitation input. Given these assumptions, the height of a water table rise due to a precipitation event mainly depends on the soil water retention characteristics, the precipitation amount, the initial water table depth, and, if present, the microrelief. In this study, this dependency was used to determine the effective van Genuchten parameters by Bayesian inversion assuming a uniform soil profile. We applied our concept to field data from a peatland with microrelief. Results indicated that observations of water table rises caused by precipitation events can contain sufficient information to constrain the soil water retention characteristics around monitoring wells in peatlands to plausible ranges. In principle, the approach should also be applicable to other shallow groundwater systems. Application limits and potential systematic errors are discussed.

AB In the sub-humid Western Boreal Plains of Alberta, where evapotranspiration often exceeds precipitation, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) uplands often depend on adjacent peatlands for water supply through hydraulic redistribution. Wildfire is common in the Boreal Plains, so the resilience of the transfer of water from peatlands to uplands through roots immediately following wildfire may have implications for aspen succession. The objective of this research was to characterize post-fire peatland-upland hydraulic connectivity and assess controls on aspen transpiration (as a measure of stress and productivity) among landscape topographic positions. In May 2011, a wildfire affected 90,000 ha of north central Alberta, including the Utikuma Region Study Area (URSA). Portions of an URSA glacio-fluval outwash lake catchment were burned, which included forests and a small peatland. Within 1 year after the fire, aspen were found to be growing in both the interior and margins of this peatland. Across recovering land units, transpiration varied along a topographic gradient of upland midslope (0.42 mm hr(-1)) > upland hilltop (0.29 mm hr(-1)) > margin (0.23 mm hr(-1)) > peatland (0.10 mm hr(-1)); similar trends were observed with leaf area and stem heights. Although volumetric water content was below field capacity, P. tremuloides were sustained through roots present, likely before fire, in peatland margins through hydraulic redistribution. Evidence for this was observed through the analysis of oxygen (delta O-18) and hydrogen (delta H-2) isotopes where upland xylem and peat core signatures were -10.0 parts per thousand and -117.8 parts per thousand and -9.2 parts per thousand and -114.0 parts per thousand, respectively. This research highlights the potential importance of hydraulic redistribution to forest sustainability and recovery, in which the continued delivery of water may result in the encroachment of aspen into peatlands. As such, we suggest that through altering ecosystem services, peatland margins following fire may be at risk to aspen colonization during succession.

TI VARIABILITY IN METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS AT NORTHERN TREELINE NEAR
   CHURCHILL, MANITOBA, CANADA
SO ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID HUDSON-BAY LOWLANDS; TUNDRA; SOILS; FENS
AB This paper reports on a 2-yr study of methane emissions to the atmosphere made in a high subarctic wetland region at treeline near Churchill, Manitoba. Emissions were monitored from a treed bog, tundra fens, a coastal marsh and shallow ponds, which are wetland terrain types that dominate the region. There were substantial emissions from the fens, marsh, and ponds but very small emissions from the bog. Variability was large, both spatially and temporally. This included variability in measurements at a specific site, between sites, over the course of a single season and between years. Such variability was a response to edaphic factors which control methane production and consumption, differences in ground water levels and pond depths which determine whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic, and variability in air and soil temperatures. During the cool, moist summer of 1990 there were moderate to strong correlations of log normalized methane emissions with depth to water table or pond depth and with air temperature. In the warmer and drier summer of 1989 correlations were more weakly developed. Some of this behavior is explainable by the relation between methane production under anaerobic conditions and consumption under aerobic conditions. During 1990, the methane production on a site by site basis was comparable to coincident measurements made in the southern Hudson Bay Lowland and in the mid-boreal region of Ontario. In 1989, the emissions were about three-fold less than in 1990.

AB The spatial and temporal variability of a low-centred polygon on the eastern floodplain area of the lower Anabar River (72.070 degrees N, 113.921 degrees E; northern Yakutia, Siberia) has been investigated using a multi-method approach. The present-day vegetation in each square metre was analysed, revealing a community of Larix, shrubby Betula, and Salix on the polygon rim, a dominance of Carex and Andromeda polifolia in the rim-to-pond transition zone, and a predominantly monospecific Scorpidium scorpioides coverage within the pond. The total organic carbon (TOC) content, TOC/TN (total nitrogen) ratio, grain size, vascular plant macrofossils, moss remains, diatoms, and pollen were analysed for two vertical sections and a sediment core from a transect across the polygon. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the formation of the polygon started at least 1500 yr ago; the general positions of the pond and rim have not changed since that time. Two types of pond vegetation were identified, indicating two contrasting development stages of the polygon. The first was a well-established moss association, dominated by submerged or floating Scorpidium scorpioides and/or Drepanocladus spp. and overgrown by epiphytic diatoms such as Tabellaria flocculosa and Eunotia taxa. This stage coincides temporally with a period in which the polygon was only drained by lateral subsurface water flow, as indicated by mixed grain sizes. A different moss association occurred during times of repeated river flooding (indicated by homogeneous medium-grained sand that probably accumulated during the annual spring snowmelt), characterized by an abundance of Meesia triquetra and a dominance of benthic diatoms (e. g. Navicula vulpina), indicative of a relatively high pH and a high tolerance of disturbance. A comparison of the local polygon vegetation (inferred from moss and macrofossil spectra) with the regional vegetation (inferred from pollen spectra) indicated that the moss association with Scorpidium scorpioides became established during relatively favourable climatic conditions, while the association dominated by Meesia triquetra occurred during periods of harsh climatic conditions. Our study revealed a strong riverine influence (in addition to climatic influences) on polygon development and the type of peat accumulated.

AB While fens provide a host of ecosystem services, those located at the base of river terraces are under threat from upgradient agricultural activities. We investigated a fen located along the boundary of the highly agricultural terrace and modern floodplain of the Cedar River in southeast Iowa using a transect of groundwater and surface water monitoring points. During the three-year monitoring period, the water table level in the terrace fluctuated 55 cm in the terrace, but hydraulic head in the fen varied only 18 cm during a severe drought that occurred in the region. Fen water table levels were significantly related to those measured in the adjacent terrace but groundwater flow to the fen from regional aquifer sources appeared to provide resilience against large fluctuations in fen water table levels. Terrace groundwater discharging into the fen from a spring at the terrace base had NO3-N concentrations as high as 16 mg/l, averaging approximately 8 mg/l during the study. Concentrations were significantly lower in fen groundwater, likely due in part to denitrification occurring in the organic-rich fen deposits. PO4-P concentrations were less variable (ranging from 0.04 to 0.1 mg/l) but were significantly higher (1.2 mg/l) in the low-redox fen groundwater. Conservation of these unique and high-value terrace-fen ecosystems should be made a priority through additional hydrologic investigation and local land management.

AB Recent studies have suggested that the hydrologic connectivity of northern headwater catchments is likely controlled by antecedent moisture conditions and land cover patterns. A water storage model (EWS), based on water levels (WLs), specific yield (Sy) and surface elevation (SE) changes, was compared with a basic water budget of a small, boreal, patterned fen (13ha) during the ice-free period. Results showed that the EWS model reproduced well storage variations derived from the water budget. These results suggest that storage variations can be properly represented by the fluctuations of WLs when we consider the heterogeneous soil properties. However, storage deviations occurred at the daily scale and could be explained by a lack of information on water retention in unsaturated layers, canopy interceptions and preferential flows. Despite the significant impact of SE changes on the different peatland cover storage budgets (strings and lawns), using Sy mean values had a low impact on storage estimations. This can be explained by the large proportion of pools and high WLs throughout the fen. At the fen scale, high storage in the pools seemed to reduce the Sy difference between strings and lawns. The results of this study provide new insights about the complex hydrological behaviour of northern catchments and allow for conceiving new hydrological modelling perspectives.

AB This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the heavy metal removal performance by a laboratory scale wetland based on the design of a constructed wetland treating surface runoff. Laboratory scale gravel-substrate subsurface-flow wetlands in a continuous recirculating mode were studied regarding the removal of Cu, Pb and Zn from contaminated water. After establishing the flow characteristics, the wetland was planted with Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris and In's pseudacorus. The wetland system was dosed with increasing concentrations (1, 5 and 10mg/l) of Cu, Pb and Zn. Finally a shock load of metals (concentration 20 mg/l) was introduced to simulate a storm event. In each experiment water samples collected from the outlet at timed intervals were analysed and loadings calculated in order to assess the metal removal efficiency of the system. The removal efficiences and rates for these different doses ranged from 81.7% to 91.8% and 36.6 to 372.7 mg/m(2)/d for Cu, 75.8% to 95.3% and 30.8 to 387 mg/m(2)/d for Pb and 82.8% to 90.4% and 33.6 to 362.1 mg/m(2)/d for Zn respectively. Results for the storm simulation showed that in the time taken for the water level to subside to its original level (just below the substrate surface) at established outlet flow rates, the metal loadings leaving the system remained very low with the wetland system retaining over 99% of the metals. These results indicate the ability of the system to act as an efficient sink for heavy metals. The macrophytes were collected and segregated by species and subsurface tissue type (rhizomes, roots and root tips) and analysed for Cu, Pb and Zn. The results are discussed with respect to the surrounding peat substrate, biomass accumulation and the overall removal performance of the laboratory scale wetland. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

AB The concentration of different fractions of Al were measured in seven micro (3-4 m2) discharge areas using extraction methods on the upper layer of the soil. The areas were situated in two catchments subjected to different levels of acidic deposition. The Al fractions were determined by separate extractions with 1 M KCl, 0.5 M CuCl2 and 0.2 M (NH4)2C2O4. The fractions associated with the different extraction reagents are preferentially exchangeable, organically bound and amorphous hydroxide, although a complete separation cannot be made. The total amount of Al was determined after dry ashing. The results show that the levels of total Al in the peat were high when compared to ombrotrophic peatlands. The quantity and characteristics of the organic material and the acidity of the soils in the discharge zone could be decisive in determining which fractions of A 1 occur. The high levels of total Al in the soil indicate that the discharge zone could be an important trap for the element.

AB Testate amoebae are unicellular micro-organisms whose hydrological sensitivity and good preservation in peats make them valuable proxies for past peatland surface wetness, and therefore climate. Previous testate amoebae transfer functions have been spatially restricted with no studies from Asia. To derive a transfer function, a sequence of samples was extracted from an ombrotrophic peatland in Turkey and amoebae counted. The internal structure of the data was explored using principal components analysis and relationships with the environmental data tested by redundancy analyses. Transfer function models were developed using a variety of techniques. As in other regions, depth to water table is the most important control on amoebae community composition. Transfer function performance was initially poor, primarily due to the inclusion of samples from areas of the site that had been heavily affected by peat cutting and had distinctly different amoebae communities. Model performance is improved by selective sample exclusion, reducing jack-knifed root mean square error of prediction to 7.1 cm. The model was tested using an initial palaeoecological data-set. Overlap with the training set was limited, although a hydrological reconstruction using this model produces similar results to a transfer function derived from northern European peatlands. This study provides the first testate amoebae transfer function from Asia and demonstrates that hydrological preferences of many of the key taxa are consistent across a large area of the Northern Hemisphere. The transfer function will allow detailed palaeoclimate reconstruction from this peatland, adding to our knowledge of Holocene climatic change in southwest Asia.

AB The concentration of atmospheric methane is strongly linked to variations in Earth's climate. Currently, we can directly reconstruct the total atmospheric concentration of methane, but not individual terms of the methane cycle. Northern wetlands, dominated by Sphagnum, are an important contributor of atmospheric methane, and we seek to understand the methane cycle in these systems. We present a novel method for quantifying the proportion of carbon Sphagnum assimilates from its methanotrophic symbionts using stable isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers. Carbon isotope ratios of Sphagnum compounds are determined by two competing influences, water content and the isotope ratio of source carbon. We disentangled these effects using a combined hydrogen and carbon isotope approach. We constrained Sphagnum water content using the contrast between the hydrogen isotope ratios of Sphagnum and vascular plant biomarkers. We then used Sphagnum water content to calculate the carbon isotope ratio of Sphagnum's carbon pool. Using a mass balance equation, we calculated the proportion of recycled methane contributed to the Sphagnum carbon pool, "PRM." We quantified PRM in peat monoliths from three microhabitats in the Mer Bleue peatland complex. Modern studies have shown that water table depth and vegetation have strong influences on the peatland methane cycle on instrumental time scales. With this new approach, delta C-13 of Sphagnum compounds are now a useful tool for investigating the relationships among hydrology, vegetation, and methanotrophy in Sphagnum peatlands over the time scales of entire peatland sediment records, vital to our understanding of the global carbon cycle through the Late Glacial and Holocene.

AB Climate warming has inevitable impacts on the vegetation and hydrological dynamics of high-latitude permafrost peatlands. These impacts in turn determine the role of these peatlands in the global biogeochemical cycle. Here, we used six active layer peat cores from four permafrost peatlands in Northeast European Russia and Finnish Lapland to investigate permafrost peatland dynamics over the last millennium. Testate amoeba and plant macrofossils were used as proxies for hydrological and vegetation changes. Our results show that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), Russian sites experienced short-term permafrost thawing and this induced alternating dry-wet habitat changes eventually followed by desiccation. During the Little Ice Age (LIA) both sites generally supported dry hummock habitats, at least partly driven by permafrost aggradation. However, proxy data suggest that occasionally, MCA habitat conditions were drier than during the LIA, implying that evapotranspiration may create important additionaleco-hydrological feedback mechanisms under warm conditions. All sites showed a tendency towards dry conditions as inferred from both proxies starting either from ca. 100 years ago or in the past few decades after slight permafrost thawing, suggesting that recent warming has stimulated surface desiccation rather than deeper permafrost thawing. This study shows links between two important controls over hydrology and vegetation changes in high-latitude peatlands: direct temperature-induced surface layer response and deeper permafrost layer-related dynamics. These data provide important backgrounds for predictions of Arctic permafrost peatlands and related feedback mechanisms. Our results highlight the importance of increased evapotranspiration and thus provide an additional perspective to understanding of peatland-climate feedback mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pristine peatlands have generally low nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions but drainage and management practices enhance the microbial processes and associated N2O emissions. It is assumed that leaving peat soils from intensive management, such as agriculture, will decrease their N2O emissions. In this paper we report how the annual N2O emission rates will change when agricultural peat soil is either left abandoned or afforested and also N2O emissions from afforested peat extraction sites. In addition, we evaluated a biogeochemical model (DNDC) with a view to explaining GHG emissions from peat soils under different land uses. The abandoned agricultural peat soils had lower mean annual N2O emissions (5.5 +/- A 5.4 kg N ha(-1)) than the peat soils in active agricultural use in Finland. Surprisingly, N2O emissions from afforested organic agricultural soils (12.8 +/- A 9.4 kg N ha(-1)) were similar to those from organic agricultural soils in active use. These emissions were much higher than those from the forests on nutrient rich peat soils. Abandoned and afforested peat extraction sites emitted more N2O, (2.4 +/- A 2.1 kg N ha(-1)), than the areas under active peat extraction (0.7 +/- A 0.5 kg N ha(-1)). Emissions outside the growing season contributed significantly, 40% on an average, to the annual emissions. The DNDC model overestimated N2O emission rates during the growing season and indicated no emissions during winter. The differences in the N2O emission rates were not associated with the age of the land use change, vegetation characteristics, peat depth or peat bulk density. The highest N2O emissions occurred when the soil C:N ratio was below 20 with a significant variability within the measured C:N range (13-27). Low soil pH, high nitrate availability and water table depth (50-70 cm) were also associated with high N2O emissions. Mineral soil has been added to most of the soils studied here to improve the fertility and this may have an impact on the N2O emissions. We infer from the multi-site dataset presented in this paper that afforestation is not necessarily an efficient way to reduce N2O emissions from drained boreal organic fields.

AB Studies across a range of spatial and temporal scales are needed to discern multiple forces structuring communities. Subtidal prop roots of red mangroves host diverse assemblages of sessile marine epibionts that provide a model system for examining community development and maintenance at a variety of discrete spatial scales. During 1991-1992 we twice surveyed 11 sites at four cays in Belize, Central America, to quantify spatial variability and temporal change in distribution and abundance of root-fouling organisms at five sampling scales: (1) fronts and backs of roots (1-cm scale); (2) roots close to and extending away from peat bank (0.5-m scale); (3) along linear transects parallel to shore (1-50 m scale); (4) on leeward and windward shores of cays (0.5-km scale); and (5) among cays (1-10 km scale). Although epibiont community structure differed widely among sites, all cays surveyed had similar seasonal values of water salinity, pH, and temperature. Within cays, windward sites had higher dissolved oxygen levels and water flow rates than leeward sites. At still smaller scales, outer roots and fronts of roots received significantly more light and were subject to higher water flow rates than inner roots and backs of roots. Species richness, diversity, and mosaic diversity patterns indicated that epibiont assemblages were distributed non-randomly in space: leeward sites were more speciose than windward sites, and fronts of roots were more speciose than backs. Jaccard's index of similarity, cluster analysis, and Kendall's coefficient of concordance showed hierarchical patterns of decreasing similarity with increasing sampling distance. Significant spatial autocorrelation among Jaccard values occurred at 2-3 m intervals, possibly reflecting mean larval dispersal distances. Analysis of mosaic diversity among sites indicated the absence of a clear environmental gradient and supported the hypothesis that species distributions may reflect patterns of dispersal from initial source populations. While precise identity of species was unpredictable among roots, species groups based on taxonomy, morphology, and life history showed very consistent distributions among sites that may reflect variability in local root environments: algae were most prevalent in well-lit areas and on windward sites, while sponges and ascidians predominated in leeward areas. Relative importance and dominance of both individual species and species groups changed substantially between 1991 and 1992. Representatives of four species groups were transplanted across three spatial scales to assess whether post-settlement dynamics limit distributions of these taxa. All transplants survived well for the first 6 wk of the experiment. After 6 mo, all transplants exhibited similarly high levels of mortality regardless of treatment. Overall, the results indicate that larval supply may shape epibiont community composition on short time scales and small and very large spatial scales, while variation in physical factors may influence distributions over the long term and at intermediate spatial scales.

AB We studied multiple variables in a sediment core from Lake Kipojarvi, northern Finland, to investigate Holocene ecosystem changes in relation to catchment characteristics and known climate variations. We focused on a forested catchment because previous paleolimnological studies conducted in Fennoscandia focused mainly on subarctic lakes within a range of shifting treeline(s). Data on aquatic macrophytes, diatoms, Cladocera, C:N ratio, organic matter (LOI) and regional vegetation (pollen), revealed a three-phase limnological development. The early Holocene, species-rich, mesotrophic lake was transformed into an oligotrophic, species-poor aquatic ecosystem by the early middle Holocene, ca. 7,500 cal years BP, earlier than has generally been reported. The transition involved considerable changes in aquatic macrophytes. Changes in the Cladocera and diatom communities appear to have been linked to aquatic macrophyte development, which in turn, was probably regulated by catchment development and hydrology, and a consequent decrease in nutrient input from the catchment. During the more humid late Holocene, surface flow from the catchment probably increased, but the lake's nutrient status remained oligotrophic. Possible reasons for low nutrient concentration in the late Holocene include: 1) slower biogeochemical cycling due to cooler climate, 2) a new hydrologic outlet and associated shorter water-retention times, and 3) accelerated peatland development in the catchment that affected water flow patterns and nutrient cycling.

AB Urban runoff contains a mixture of both particulate and non-particulate organic pollutants (OPs). Hydrophobic OPs such as higher petroleumhydrocarbons, phthalates, and polycyclic organic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are not exclusively bound to particles, but also present in runoff in colloidal and truly dissolved forms. These hydrophobic compounds can also form nano- and microsized emulsions that may carry pollutants in stormwater. Hence, it is of great importance to develop treatment technologies such as sorption filters that can remove non-particulate OPs fromcontaminated stormwater. A pilot plant using column bed-filters of sand as a pre-filter, in combination with granulated activated carbon, Sphagnum peat or Pinus sylvestris bark, was used to investigate the removal of non-particulate OPs from urban stormwater. Samples from the filter effluents were collected weekly; during or after rain events; and during stress tests when incoming water was spiked with contaminated sediment and petrol or diesel. All sorption filters showed efficient reduction of aliphatic diesel hydrocarbons C-16-C-35, benzene, and the PAHs phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene during most of the operation time, which was 18 months. During the stress test events, all sorption filters showed 100% reduction of PAH-16, petrol and diesel aliphatics C-5-C-35. All sorption filters released DOC and nanoparticles, which may explain some of the transportation of OPs through the filter beds. The recommendation is to use a combination of sand pre-filtration and all the studied sorption materials in stormwater filters in series, to achieve effective removal of different types of OPs. It is also important to improve the hydraulic conditions to obtain sufficient water flows through the filters. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Associated with the development of the oil sands resource in northern Alberta, Canada are elevated emissions of NOx and SOx from diesel-fueled vehicle and upgrader stack emissions. Ultimately these emissions are returned to regional terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the form of elevated atmospheric N and S deposition. About 30 % of the regional landscape is covered with peatlands, including ombrotrophic bogs that receive nutrient inputs solely from the atmosphere. From 2009 to 2014 we examined the effects of N and S deposition on Sphagnum fuscum growth and on recent net accumulation of C, N, and S in peat in six bogs, located between 11 and 251 km from the oil sands industrial center. Averaged across all sites and years, average deposition of NH4 (+)-N, NO3 (-)-N, DIN, SO4 (2-)-S, Ca2+, Mg2+, and ortho-P was 0.52, 0.64, 1.17, 7.70, 10.04, 3.29, and 0.15 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Deposition of NO3 (-)-N, DIN, SO4 (2-)-S, Ca2+, and Mg2+ decreased exponentially with distance from the industrial center. Averaged across all sites and years, vertical growth and NPP of S. fuscum was 16.6 +/- 0.6 mm and 259 +/- 9 g m(-2) per growing season, increasing exponentially with proximity to the industrial center. Correlations suggested that climatic factors, and in particular late growing season precipitation and the growing season Aridity Index (potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio) may be more important than the chemistry of atmospheric deposition in affecting S. fuscum growth. Across all sites and years, net C, N, and S accumulation in peat over the most recent 25 years averaged 67, 1.29, and 0.30 g m(-2) year(-1) and increased with proximity to the industrial center. Over the past 25-50 years, net C, N, and S accumulation in peat was lower than in surface peat, with only net S accumulation exhibiting an increase with proximity to the industrial center. In a region where bogs have persisted on the landscape for millennia with low atmospheric deposition of elements, changing precipitation chemistry, and in particular elevated deposition of N, S, Ca and Mg, related to oil sands development is influencing bog function, as evidenced by S. fuscum growth and biogeochemical responses.

AB Solute transport and storage processes in wetlands play an important role in biogeochemical cycling and in wetland water quality functions. In the wetlands of the Everglades, there are few data or guidelines to characterize transport through the heterogeneous flow environment. Our goal was to conduct a tracer study to help quantify solute exchange between the relatively fast flowing water in the open part of the water column and much more slowly moving water in thick floating vegetation and in the pore water of the underlying peat. We performed a tracer experiment that consisted of a constant- rate injection of a sodium bromide ( NaBr) solution for 22 hours into a 3 m wide, open- ended flume channel in Everglades National Park. Arrival of the bromide tracer was monitored at an array of surface water and subsurface samplers for 48 hours at a distance of 6.8 m downstream of the injection. A one- dimensional transport model was used in combination with an optimization code to identify the values of transport parameters that best explained the tracer observations. Parameters included dimensions and mass transfer coefficients describing exchange with both short ( hours) and longer ( tens of hours) storage zones as well as the average rates of advection and longitudinal dispersion in the open part of the water column ( referred to as the " main flow zone''). Comparison with a more detailed set of tracer measurements tested how well the model's storage zones approximated the average characteristics of tracer movement into and out of the layer of thick floating vegetation and the pore water in the underlying peat. The rate at which the relatively fast moving water in the open water column was exchanged with slowly moving water in the layer of floating vegetation and in sediment pore water amounted to 50 and 3% h(-1), respectively. Storage processes decreased the depth- averaged velocity of surface water by 50% relative to the water velocity in the open part of the water column. As a result, flow measurements made with other methods that only work in the open part of the water column ( e. g., acoustic Doppler) would have overestimated the true depth- averaged velocity by a factor of 2. We hypothesize that solute exchange and storage in zones of floating vegetation and peat pore water increase contact time of solutes with biogeochemically active surfaces in this heterogeneous wetland environment.

AB At sites with either peat or mineral soils in large areas of boreal forests, high soil-water contents hamper tree growth and drainage can significantly increase growth. Hence, areas covering about 15 x 10(6) ha of northern peatlands and wet mineral soils have been drained for forestry purposes. Usually ditches gradually deteriorate, thus reducing their functionality as drains, and ditch-network maintenance (DNM) might be needed to maintain stand growth rates enabled by the original ditching. This article reviews current knowledge on establishing the need for DNM in boreal forest stands, subsequent growth responses, and the financial outcome of the activity. The issues covered in the review are: (i) ditching, changes in ditches over time and the need for DNM; (ii) interactions between soil water and both stand properties and stand management; (iii) ground-water level (GWL) and tree growth responses to DNM; and (iv) financial viability of DNM. Conclusions about the current understanding of issues related to DNM are drawn and implications for DNM in practice are summarized. Finally, gaps in knowledge are identified and research needs are suggested.

AB Stable isotopes are used to decipher hydrological processes in watershed research. A two-year monthly monitoring of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in a temperate catchment in Norther Europa, Latvia was undertaken. Isotope ratios in common water types - raised bog, confined groundwater, unconfined groundwater and surface water - were measured. We found characteristic signatures of isotope ratios for each of these four water types. The average isotope ratios of different water types ranged from -80.8 to -68.3 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and -11.46 to -8.76 parts per thousand for delta O-18, with standard deviations from 18 to 25 parts per thousand and 0.10 to 1.59 parts per thousand, respectively. The isotope ratios of the stream base flow were consistent with the groundwater isoscape and seasonally enriched by evaporation. Most enriched water are found in raised bogs and large lakes. The most depleted water is found in a spring discharging phreatic groundwater in a forest site with sandy soil. The most enriched water was associated with significant short-lived precipitation events, resulting in impoundment of water on the land surface and its enrichment due to evaporation. The novelty of this study is that this enriched isotope signal is propagated throughout the hydrological system, temporarily albeit significantly shifting isotope ratios of phreatic groundwater and surface runoff. Further case studies are needed to affirm if this is a regionally significant mechanism controlling isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water. The observed difference between the average delta O-18 of phreatic groundwater at two locations was 0.9 parts per thousand. We suggest that the differences are due to different land use and soil conditions.

AB The theory of conductive heat transfer cannot explain different attenuations of the daily amplitude of peat temperatures (T-S) in hummocks (detectable below the 20-cm depth) and hollows (disappearing above the 10-cm depth). Large readily drained macropores in the upper fibric peat determine a large air permeability and hence may enhance heat transfer by air convection in porous media, driven by temperature gradients between hummock sides and interiors. In this study, the ecosys model was used to simulate a peat thermal regime at Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada. It was hypothesized that adding the air-convective heat transfer to conductive plus water-convective heat transfers would improve simulations of T-S. The results for T-S, ground hear fluxes, G, and sensible heat fluxes, H, modeled with and without air-convective heat transfer were tested with continuous hourly measurements from 2000 to 2004 using thermocouples, heat flux plates, and eddy covariance. Simulated air-convective heat transfer caused an average increase in G and a corresponding decrease in H of similar to 20 W m(-2) from the simulated conductive plus water-convective heat transfer. Hastened soil warming in hummocks resulted in better agreement between measured and simulated hummock T-S values with (RMSD of 2.23 degrees C) than without air-convective heat (RMSD of 2.54 degrees C). Enhanced hummock T-S caused an indirect increase in hollow T-S in the model with (RMSD of 1.68 degrees C) compared to without air-convective heat (RMSD of 1.82 degrees C). Our results suggest that air convection is probably an important mechanism of heat transfer in peat hummocks and should be included in peatland biogeochemical models.

Grassy Pond, in Litchfield, New Hampshire, is a seasonally flooded basin marsh situated in sandy soils. It is a depressional wetland consisting of three connected basins; it has no surface-water inlets or outlets. This acidic, low-nutrient wetland contains several rare species and represents an uncommon ecosystem type in New England. A network of wells and piezometers monitored from 1996 to 1999 established that the wetland receives an average of 95.4% of its growing season inputs from precipitation and the rest from shallow ground water flowing through the wetland; as a result, it experiences large fluctuations in water levels. Vegetation in the wetland fell into five major elevation zones. Variation in plant diversity within each zone, and differences between adjacent zones, result in part from differences in depth of organic layer, trampling by hikers, all-terrain vehicles, and native wildlife, and the extent of water-level fluctuations. Several of the low basin species are more likely to be found in trampled areas. Shrub invasion of the open basin areas is prevented by trampling in some areas and by high water levels in others. Variability in hydrology resulted in temporal, as well as spatial, variability in the plant community, as dry years yielded significantly greater diversity, including a large increase in tree seedlings. Both hydrologic variability and trampling are external factors that explain a significant portion of the variation in vegetation on a large scale and connect this geographically isolated wetland to the surrounding landscape. On a smaller scale, however, autogenic forces related to soil formation and plant species interactions may be more important in explaining the plant diversity in the wetland.

AB A multiproxy study based on sedimentology, mineralogy, magnetic susceptibility, organic geochemistry and fossil content allowed to establish the sedimentary evolution of palustrine basins and to study the interplay between tectonic and climatic forcings in the sedimentation and facies arrangement that can be extrapolated to other coal-bearing basins. The reinterpretation of the data from 18 cores allowed to determine the facies distribution and to model the sedimentary evolution of the Padul Basin, with the longest continuous continental Quaternary record in the Southwestern Mediterranean region. The Padul Basin sediment record and facies successions provide an outstanding example of tectonically and environmentally controlled sedimentation. The sedimentary characteristics of the cores and thickness distribution revealed that recent tectonics was a more important forcing than other processes (e.g. climate). The influence of recent tectonics was determinant in facies arrangement, that is to say that the activity of a rotated fault produced a differential subsidence, causing more than 100 m of palustrine deposits to stack. On the basis of the sedimentological record combined with data on the mineralogy, fossil content, magnetic susceptibility and total organic carbon, three main sedimentary units were identified, linked to diverse subsidence rates and paleoenvironmental oscillations. The magnetic susceptibility was likely to have been controlled by the organic matter content (TOC values), linked to oxic/anoxic conditions. In the lower part of the record, Unit A (107.0-68.7 m), shallow lacustrine conditions were dominant, with an important influx associated with considerable runoff from active alluvial fans, linked to a higher subsidence rate. Unit B (68.7-37.6 m) had a transitional character, with a considerable decrease in the influence of the alluvial fan system. The lake recharge through overland flow markedly diminished and pre-existing groundwater recharge was dominant. A sudden change to peaty materials indicated that surface runoff was directly diverted to the recently excavated Durcal River gorge, thereby precluding the basin from becoming a swampy environment with stagnant waters. Unit C (upper 37.6 m) was almost exclusively fed by bicarbonate groundwater and subsurface runoff through the highly permeable coarse alluvial fan deposits. Within these main sedimentary units, minor mud-peat shallowing-upward sequences were identified.

AB Polygonal peatlands are carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems that will likely be significantly affected by climate change. However, studies are often constrained to one measurement per day, which impedes assessments of the temporal variability in carbon fluxes. For this reason, we measured ecosystem respiration (ER) of CO2 in a polygonal peatland underlain by continuous permafrost over an entire growing season to determine the effects of temperature and water table depth on the temporal variability of ER. We used four automated closed chambers to measure ER under varying temperature and soil moisture regimes. Temporal variability was approximately the same for the four plots, on both a diurnal and a seasonal scale. Both diurnal and seasonal variations in ER were strongly controlled by changes in soil surface temperature. Fluctuations of the water table depth associated with important rainfall events was also an important factor affecting ER on the seasonal scale. We found that water table level fluctuations below 20-25 cm did not significantly affect ER and that most soil respiration took place in the top 10 cm, likely in the surface 2 cm. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring future changes in tundra hydrology, which will determine the depth of organic matter available for aerobic decomposition.

AB Coastal wetlands are characterized by continued human influence, e.g. with drainage ditches, coastal dikes or landscape restoration. In addition, it is important to understand the complex interactions with the sea to predict impacts of further development. In the present study the aim was to analyze surface and subsurface flow in a coastal wetland located at the Baltic Sea coastline near Warnemunde (Germany) to quantify water exchange with the Baltic Sea and analyze the effect of a storm flood event on saline intrusion. A 3-D transient groundwater model and a one-dimensional surface water model were set up and calibrated by using hydraulic head measurements. The results indicate that in addition to ditch flow, groundwater discharge to the Baltic Sea often has a significant influence on the overall water budget of the fen. From the transient modelling it became evident that water exchange between groundwater in the fen and the Baltic Sea depends on sea level and very often fluctuates between seaward and landward flow directions on daily to weekly time scales.

TI C-14 dating of Gorleben groundwater
SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY; CARBON; AQUIFER; AGES
AB Previous attempts to apply C-14 for dating of groundwater in the Gorleben aquifer system has given results with conflicting H-3 and stable isotope data and hydrological estimates. C-14 model ages of 1-10 ka have been found for H-3 containing recharge water, up to 31 ka for groundwater with Holocene stable isotope signatures and 6-10 ka for groundwater at 35 m depth. In this paper it is shown, that the reasons are assumption of to high C-14 concentration in recharge groundwater and not correcting for the influence of C-14 dilution by dissolved inorganic C (DIC) from microbiologically mediated mineralization of organic components in deep sediments. To overcome these difficulties a new approach is applied evaluating the site-specific C-14 source term (including the influence of nuclear atmospheric testing), and the already previously used overall dilution of DIC. Closed system conditions are assumed and no isotopic fractionation is considered. For most of the groundwaters, the C-14 ages achieved by the present method are in agreement with H-3, stable isotopes and hydrological estimates. It is shown that down to approximately 140 m depth no C-14 decay can be detected. Situations are also discussed, either where the 14C method is not applicable (shallow peat-bog like groundwater) or does not yield reliable groundwater ages (brines at < 200 m depth).

AB In the article, the main results of the study of dissolved greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colloidal trace elements-metals in surface and soil waters of hollows, depressions, permafrost subsidences are considered. These waters were sampled in areas with active and stable permafrost thawing in Western Siberia. It is found that these zones of active termokarst are mainly located on the slopes and the bottoms of the upper reaches of rivers, which drain the interfluve. Active thawing of flat mound bogs leads to the appearance of numerous hollows, depressions and thermokarst subsidences, especially on the border between forest and fens. This is related to the additional heat input from the flowing water and causing the thawing deep permafrost on the edges of ridges occupied by the forest. Increase in specific conductivity (S.C.) in the smallest water bodies and supra-permafrost water is accompanied by a significant increase in concentrations of DOC, P, K, Cu, Zn, Mo and Ba. It has been found that small hollows and subsidence (<10 -100 M-2) are characterized by much higher concentrations of DOC and CO2 (p < 0.05) in comparison with large depressions and thermokarst water bodies. There is also a decrease of CH4 concentration with an increase in the size of water bodies (p < 0.05), despite the fact that the data dispersion reaches 3 orders in small (<100 -300 m(2)) water bodies of the where located zones active termokarst landscape, concentrations of DOC, CO2 and CH4 are significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the previously studied water bodies formed under conditions of a stable state of permafrost in areas of Nojabrsk and Khanymey. Waters of the active thawed of permafrost peat landscapes are usually rich in oxygen (saturation in the range of 30 <= O-2 <= 105 %) and approximately 0.5 unit's pH more acidic than areas with a stable state of permafrost. Many major and trace elements show a statistically significant decrease in concentration from very small water bodies (<10 m (2)) to larger thermokarst waters. By the results of carried out research we can say that in the landscapes with active termokarst there will be direct mobilization of soil water in the hydrological network (rivers and lakes) with a minimal transformation of the water composition within the catchment area.

AB Hydrological behavior of an ombrogenous raised peat bog has been observed and described in many studies; however, not in complexity with other soils. This research deals with the hydrological function of peat bog in a catchment where peat bog (formed by Histosol or other hydromorphic soils) covers only a part of the area (40-60%). Two soil types, creating two main hillslopes of the experimental catchment in this study, form the dominant soil types (Podzol and Histosol) in the Sumava Mountains, Czechia. A modified HBV model was used to estimate the contribution of each soil type to common outflow and for the estimation of the water balance. According to previous research and field observations, dominant hydrological processes were described for each hillslope (soil). The HBV model was used for the quantification of a ratio between fast and slow flow at Peat bog hillslope and Podzol hillslope. At Peat bog hillslope, the majority of outflow (67%) was formed from the upper soil layer (Acrotelm). In the mineral soil hillslope, a larger portion of runoff was generated from the lower soil layers or bedrock interface (61%). Peat bog contributes to a stream mainly during rainfall events; however, the model showed also significant deep percolation at the Peat bog hillslope and considerable contribution to baseflow during a year. Generally, more precipitation water was turned by the model into runoff at the Peat bog hillslope, which was also exhibited by a lower rate of actual evapotranspiration (21% of precipitation), compared to 29% in the case of Podzol hillslope. If we consider land-use changes in this locality in terms of expanding or reducing peat areas (draining, drains damming, droughts, etc.), this model could sufficiently estimate the hydrological behavior of local streams and thus can be potentially used in hydrological planning by local authorities.

AB Calcareous fens are wetlands fed by calcareous groundwater and with predominantly low (< 1 m) vegetation. They are critical habitat for rare species, and development of tall vegetation alters this habitat. Our purpose was to better understand how human activities influence the fen habitat. In 1997 in eastern New York and northwestern Connecticut we located 25 fens using soil maps and field surveys, and delimited these sites using 73 indicator plants classified a priori as fen species, disturbance species, or non-fen woody species. In three plots in each fen we measured species cover, water table depth, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, groundwater pH and conductivity, and described land use on and within 100 m of each fen to identify the conditions that may lead to fen degradation. Total inorganic nitrogen correlated most significantly with plant species composition. Fen-species richness was negatively correlated with nitrogen, whereas non-fen woody species richness and cover were positively correlated with nitrogen, suggesting that nitrogen inputs contribute to dominance of tall vegetation in fens. Richness of disturbance indicator species was negatively correlated with soil organic matter. Thus, fens with mineral soil layers may be more susceptible to dominance by non-fen species. Percent cover of disturbance indicator species was greater in fens near public roads. Cover of Lythrum salicaria, an invasive weed, was positively correlated with land-use intensity and was greater near public roads. The use of soil maps, indicator plant richness and cover, inorganic nitrogen, water table, and soil organic matter may be an efficient method for locating, delimiting, and assessing the ecological status of fens.

AB Measurements of micrometeorological variables were made for two snow-free periods at a Restored vacuum harvested and non-restored (Comparison) section of a peatland in eastern Quebec, Canada. Measurements of evapotranspiration and surface heat fluxes were obtained using an eddy correlation energy balance system at the Restored site and a combination Priestley-Taylor and lysimeter approach at the Comparison site. At the ecosystem scale, the energy, water and gas exchange processes are strongly coupled. Through harvesting, a peatland may lose most of its surface vegetation cover, altering the thermal regime of the peat, while the drier conditions required for the harvesting drastically alters the system's hydrology. The measurements indicate that the adopted restoration practices (blockage of drainage ditches and the spreading of a surface mulch layer) reduce the loss of water from the peat leading to the regrowth of natural vegetation at the Restored site. The Restored site lost approximately 13 and 8% less water to evapotranspiration than the Comparison site in 2000 and 2001, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland decomposition may be altered by hydrology and plant functional groups (PFGs), but exactly how the latter influences decomposition is unclear, as are potential interactions of these factors. We used a factorial mesocosm experiment with intact 1 m(3) peat monoliths to explore how PFGs (sedges vs Ericaceae) and water table level individually and interactively affect decomposition processes. Decomposition was measured using litter bags at three depths filled with cellulose strips to mimic decomposition of a simple plant-derived structure, and Sphagnum tissue to simulate decomposition of the most abundant recalcitrant material in peatlands. We also analyzed the potential activity of five hydrolytic extracellular enzymes at an intermediate depth. We found lowered water table reduced activity of several enzymes and increased cellulose and Sphagnum decomposition. Presence of Ericaceae reduced decomposition of the recalcitrant Sphagnum tissue, whereas higher activity of chitinase was found in the combined presence of sedges and Ericaceae. We found no relationship between any potential enzyme activity and Sphagnum decomposition rate. Overall our results showed a dominating role of water table controlling decomposition processes, as well as support for the hypothesis that the presence of mycorrhizal Ericaceae can slow decomposition processes of complex plant tissues in peatlands.

AB Nitrate removal from runoff from agricultural land is in general required to reach a "good chemical status" of surface and groundwater bodies according to the European Water Framework Directive. Removing nitrates via heterotrophic denitrification is highly effective but requires stable anoxic environmental conditions as well as available organic carbon as electron donator. Constructed wetlands (CWs), established on peat soils, through which the nitrate-loaded water is routed, may provide denitrification favorable conditions. To study nitrate turnover, hydraulic properties and possible negative side effects of CWs on formerly drained fens, we developed a mesocosm experiment with vertical flow and an open water surface. The first flushing of nitrate during the exchange of the initial pore volume was quantified with 0.58 g NO3-N kg(-1) organic substance. Both nitrate and sulfate were released faster and in higher concentrations than DOC and with a ratio corresponding to the composition of the peat. Redox potential measurements revealed that denitrifying conditions established in certain soil depths after roughly 40 days of continuous flux. Transport properties were obtained from analyzing tracer breakthrough curves. It could be demonstrated that the degraded peat had a dual porosity structure. Subjected to nitrate enriched water for two years, the immobile pore water fraction increased from 40 to 80% probably because of physical consolidation processes and microbial activity and subsequent clogging of pores. This was not considered as negative since denitrification processes are believed to preferably operate in immobile, oxygen depleted water regions. We concluded that the first flushing of mineralized nitrate upon rewetting after onset of flux may compromise any positive clean up and nitrate removal effects occurring during long-term operation of peat-wetlands. It is thus advisable to recycle the water during early stages of the establishment of constructed wetlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the future management and sustainable use of boreal forests, it is crucial to consider the rate and strength of tree responses to an elevated water table and the concurrent oxygen limitations, especially in peatlands. We examined the response dynamics of 7-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings to a 5-week waterlogging (WL) treatment during a growing season in a root lab (dasotron) experiment. WL took place after shoot elongation had ended but while growth of the trunk diameter was still in progress. Trunk sap flow and needle water potential started to decrease immediately after the onset of WL, while the first signs in needle gas exchange - seen as decreases in the potential efficiency of photosystem II, the rates of light-saturated net assimilation and transpiration, and increased needle respiration-were observed after 3 weeks of WL. New needles responded to WL more strongly than the old ones. Drainage with consequent re-oxygenation of the soil caused a further decrease in sap flow. We conclude that through negative feedback on transpiration and net photosynthesis, WL during the growing season is harmful for Scots pine, leading to potential growth losses or even dying of trees within a few weeks of WL.

AB A numerical study demonstrates the effects of flooding on subsurface hydrological flowpaths and nitrate removal in anoxic groundwater in riparian zones with a top peat layer. A series of two-dimensional numerical simulations with changing conditions for flow (steady state or transient with flooding), hydrogeology, denitrification, and duration of flooding demonstrate how flowpaths, residence times, and nitrate removal are affected. In periods with no flooding groundwater flows horizontally and discharges to the river through the riverbed. During periods with flooding, shallow groundwater is forced upwards as discharge through peat layers that often have more optimal conditions for denitrification caused by the presence of highly reactive organic matter. The contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the sand aquifer and the overlying peat layer, as well as the flooding duration, have a significant role in determining the degree of nitrate removal.

AB Restoration measures (ditch blocking, bund construction, etc.) were applied to a cutover part of the Boisdes-Bel (BdB) bog peatland in autumn 1999; since then a near complete cover of Sphagnum rubellum (similar to 15 cm) has developed over the old cutover peat, along with a suite of bog vegetation. This research assesses the restored site's (RES) hydrological condition after 10 growing seasons (May 15th-August 15th, 2010) through comparison with an adjacent unrestored site (UNR) and a natural site (NAT) located elsewhere in the peatland. Evapotranspiration (ET) from RES (242 mm) has not noticeably changed since the first 3 years post-restoration (2000-2002) still maintaining lower ET rates than UNR (290 mm). The highest ET occurred at NAT (329 mm), dissimilar to RES despite similar vegetation cover. UNR generates more runoff (37 mm) than RES (7 mm), similar to the initial assessments. However, since the initial assessments the average water table has continued to rise, from -35.3 (+/- 6.2) cm (2000-2002) to -27.3 (+/- 14.9) cm (2010) below the cutover peat surface but still fluctuates predominantly within the cutover peat and not the regenerated Sphagnum. The regenerated Sphagnum at RES has increased the surface elevation by similar to 15-20 cm, and with respect to its surface the average water table was at similar to-42.3 ( +/- 20.9) cm. However, its water table was still lower (and more variable) than at NAT (33.2 +/- 9.0 cm), with respect to the moss surface. Average soil water pressures in 2010 were similar to the early post-restoration condition at depths of 10 cm (-43.0 +/- 12.2 and -44.1 +/- 13.1 mb) and 20 cm (-41.4 +/- 13.0 and -40.6 +/- 10.5 mb) below the cutover surface at RES and UNR, respectively. Volumetric soil moisture contents (theta) at 2.5, 7.5 and 17.5 cm depths were higher in the Sphagnum moss at NAT (0.23, 0.31, and 0.71) compared to RES (0.12, 0.11, and 0.23), where the underlying cutover peat had a relatively high theta of 0.74. The low moisture content in the new moss overlying the relatively moist cutover peat indicates there was restricted connectivity between the two layers. Ten years following the implementation of restoration measures and the development of a near complete 15 cm thick Sphagnum moss layer, further time is required for the moss layer to develop (increase in thickness and bulk density, hence water retention capacity) and more consistently host the water table, so that the average water content more closely mimics NAT.

AB Warming conditions across Canada's subarctic and arctic regions are causing permafrost landforms to thaw, resulting in rapid land cover change, including conversion of peat plateaus to wetland and thermokarst. These changes have important implications for northern ecosystems, including shifting controls on carbon uptake and release functions, as well as altering evapotranspiration (ET) rates, which form feedbacks with climatic change. Four landforms (peat plateau, sedge lawn, channel fen, and a thermokarst shoreline collapse scar) in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Manitoba, were instrumented for weekly chamber measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor flux over a summer season (May to September 2014). Relative to other landforms, thermokarst CO2 exchange was characterized by high respiration rates early in the season, which decreased and were offset later in the season by CO2 uptake driven by sedge productivity. For all landforms, ET peaked post-snowmelt during rapid active layer thaw, and decreased throughout the growing season, controlled primarily by atmospheric vapor deficits. This work shows distinct differences in CO2 exchange and ET between intact and thawing permafrost features. While representative of small-scale processes in a single study region over one growing season, the results presented in this study have important implications for our understanding of ecohydrological and biogeochemical functioning of subarctic landscapes under future climates.

AB Vegetation communities in floodplain wetlands in montane valleys are adapted to seasonal flooding, and natural and anthropogenic barriers to seasonal flooding can lead to changes in plant community structure. We assessed the plant community structure, species richness, and environmental variables in each of 3 river I ne, beaver-impounded, and railway-impounded floodplain marshes of the Athabasca River in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. We hypothesized that these variables differ significantly among the marsh types in response to varying degrees of disturbance from river flooding. Using a TWINSPAN analysis, we defined 8 plant communities in the 3 marsh areas. Regular flooding in the riverine marshes (no barriers to flood waters) led to very distinct plant community types characterized by Eleocharis palustris, Utricularia minor, and Carex saxatilis. Beaver-impounded marshes (low barriers to flood waters) were defined by 2 distinct community types, both dominated by Carex aquatilis, Carex utriculata, and Equisetum fluviatile, Dominant plant species in the railway-impounded marshes (most extreme barriers to flood waters) were C. aquatilis, E. fluviatile, and Drepanocladus aduncus. Two of the 3 railway-impounded sites had higher moss cover (43-48% versus 29%) and lower emergent cover (51-56% versus 77%), pointing to a Succession to a fen. Overall, we identified 95 vascular and bryophyte species in the 3 wetland areas; species richness was highest in the beaver-impounded marshes (66 species), the railroad-impounded marshes (48 species), and lowest in the riverine marshes (37 species). Plant communities of these marshes were significantly correlated with water conductivity, water depth, organic content of the sediment, and absence/presence off hummocks. In addition, NO3- concentrations in the water had a significant inverse relationship oil marsh species richness. Most of these marshes were N-limited, with N:P quotients below 7. Overall, we showed that natural and anthropogenic barriers to water flow significantly affected plant community composition and species richness, water chemistry, and water levels in these riverine ecosystems.

AB Temperatures at the soil-atmosphere interface influence ecosystem function by driving nonlinear terrestrial biogeochemical, ecohydrological, and micrometeorological processes. Whilst climate, soil and vegetation controls on spatially average ecosystem temperatures are recognised, how interacting and heterogeneous ecosystem layers create spatio-temporal complex thermal ecosystems has not been determined. Such thermal hot spots and hot moments may underpin the capability of ecosystems to support biological and biogeochemical diversity and control the likelihood of tipping points in system-regulating feedbacks being locally exceeded. This is of notable importance in peatlands, where soil temperatures control the storage of their associated globally important carbon stocks. Here, through the application of high spatio-temporal resolution surface temperature data and peat thermal modelling, we assess the impact of system heterogeneity (spatio-temporal impact of the following system layers: tree, shrubs, microtopography, groundcover species and sub-surface ice) on surface temperature regimes. We show (a) that peat-surface thermal hotspot intensity and longevity is linked to system heterogeneity and (b) that not all system layers have an equal influence over the peat-surface thermal regime and extreme temperatures; thermal heterogeneity increases up to a maximum of five layers of heterogeneity and decreases thereafter. The results crucially demonstrate that such changes in the spatio-temporal thermal dynamics and extremes may occur without significant changes in median temperatures. This is important to the conceptual understanding of peatland responses and ecosystem resilience to disturbance. It emphasises the need to determine the potential for transitions in magnitude, longevity and locality of small-scale thermal extremes to induce functional transitions that propagate through given ecosystems, and to characterise the impact of such small-scale spatio-temporal complexity on ecosystem scale biogeochemical and ecohydrological function.

AB Transfer functions are now widely available to infer past environmental conditions from biotic assemblages. Existing transfer functions are based on species assemblages but an alternative is to characterize assemblages based on functional traits, characteristics of the organism which determine its fitness and performance. Here, we test the potential of trait-based transfer functions using testate amoeba functional traits to reconstruct peatland water-table depths.
   A total of seven functional traits with linkages to peat moisture content were identified and quantified as community weighted-means for each of 43 taxa in a training set from Tierra del Fuego, South America. Transfer functions based on (multiple) linear regression and partial least-squares were produced, validated using cross validation and an independent test set, and applied to three core records. Trait-based models performed remarkably well. Model performance based on cross-validation and an independent test set was only marginally weaker than for models based on species and reconstructed down-core trends were extremely similar. Trait-based models offer considerable potential for paleoecological reconstruction particularly in no-analogue situations, where no species transfer function is available and for inexperienced analysts. The approach deserves further validation and testing for both testate amoebae and other groups of microfossils. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB To evaluate the coexistence of agricultural managements and wetland ecosystem conservation, the Bibai mire, an ombrotrophic mire in Hokkaido, Japan, was selected as an experimental site that had been affected by neighboring agricultural managements. Since the lowering of the level of the groundwater table in the peripheral area of the mire had threatened indigenous vegetations, keeping the groundwater table shallow by trench irrigation seemed to be an effective measure to recover the original vegetation. The objective of the present study was to quantify the amount of water and the effective area of trench irrigation required in a bamboo-invading area in a pristine mire. We constructed a trench 28 m long and irrigated at the rate of 2.22 m(3) d(-1) in a bamboo-invading area in the mire. And to analyze the hydro-meteorological conditions under the trench irrigation, we measured the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the peat layer (3.8 X 10(-3) cm S-1), the evapotranspiration rate (2.80 mm d(-1)), the depth of the non-irrigated groundwater table (0.15 m) and the surface gradient (0.00493). In addition, using the mass conservation equation and Darcy's law, we derived a steady state model of the level of the groundwater table formed by trench irrigation, which required the five parameters mentioned above. The irrigated water spread over a distance of only about 15 in to both sides of the trench. The model also estimated that the distance for the irrigated area was 14.6 m and we concluded that the irrigated area was limited within a distance of 20 m distances to both sides of the trench and that the irrigation rate per unit trench length did not exceed 0.12 M-2 d(-1) for realistic values of the evapotranspiration rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity in peatland.

AB Unfertilized buff er strips (BS) are widely accepted to reduce nitrogen (N) loads from agricultural land to surface water. However, the relative reduction of N load or concentration (BS eff ectiveness, BSE), varies with management and local conditions, especially hydrogeology. We present novel experimental evidence on BSE for 5-m-wide grass BS on intensively drained and managed plain agricultural lowland with varying hydrogeology. We selected characteristic sites for fi ve major hydrogeological classes of the Netherlands and installed paired 5-m-wide unfertilized grass (BS) and reference (REF) treatments along the ditch. Th e REF was managed like the adjacent fi eld, and BS was only harvested. Treatments were equipped with reservoirs in the ditch to collect and measure discharge and fl ow proportional N concentration for 3 or 4 yr. In addition, N concentration in upper groundwater was measured. We found a statistically signifi cant BSE of 10% on the peat site. At the other sites, BSE for N was low and statistically insignifi cant. Low BSE was explained by denitrifi cation between adjacent fi eld and ditch, as well as by the site-specifi c hydrologic factors including low proportion of shallow groundwater fl ow, downward seepage, low residence time in the BS, and surface runoff away from the ditch. We emphasize that a REF treatment is needed to evaluate BSE in agriculture and recommend reservoirs if drainage patterns are unknown. Introduction of a 5-m-wide BS is ineff ective for mitigating N loads from lowland agriculture to surface waters. We expect more from BS specifi cally designed to abate surface runoff

AB During the last decades of the 19th century, a great worry arose about forest landscape paludification in Northern Sweden. This was the original impetus for forest hydrological research in Sweden, and the Swedish Institute of Experimental Forestry established the first field research site in 1905 at Rokliden, close to Pitea in North Sweden. It comprised 8.64ha located 2km down a 3-km-long gently sloping (similar to 4%), north facing Norway spruce covered till slope, interspersed with small mires. By 1931, it was concluded that paludification was not spreading across Northern Sweden at an appreciable rate. Within the Rokliden research site, 22 groundwater wells were installed and levels measured weekly until 1926. A map with 0.5m equidistance, ten vegetation classes, and soil profiles was established. Groundwater flow velocity was estimated by tracing added sodium chloride. Hydraulic conductivity was measured on undisturbed soil cores, while mechanical and chemical analyses were carried out on other samples. Groundwater was collected and analysed for dissolved compounds including oxygen. Hydrology was found important for soil types and vegetation development. The necessary profile drainage for podzol soil development was identified as vein drainage at the bedrock surface. Modern measurements in the re-established groundwater observation network and re-analysis of old data confirmed the plausibility of these original conclusions. Partial catchment area could explain rates of both groundwater level rise and recession. Revisiting this field study reveals that many issues in contemporary hillslope hydrology were already established a century ago, even though the provenance of that knowledge is not generally recognized.

AB Tomasz Mieczan (2012) Distributions of testate amoebae and ciliates in different types of peatlands and their contributions to the nutrient supply. Zoological Studies 51(1): 18-26. The influence of plant communities on the structure, abundance, and biomass of testate amoebae and ciliates were investigated in bog and fens in eastern Poland. Samples were collected in belts of Sphagnum, Phragmites, Carex, Utricularia, and Calliergonella. Sampling was done on a monthly basis from Apr. to Nov. 2009. Comparisons of species numbers, abundances, and biomass levels of testate amoebae and ciliates between Sphagnum mosses did not show statistically significant differences. In carbonate fens, the average species numbers, abundances, and biomass levels of testate amoebae and ciliates for Sphagnum, Calliergonella, and Utricularia were higher than those for Phragmites and Carex. Based on differences in plant stem structure, 2 groups of habitats were distinguished. The 1st group consisted of 2 vegetated zones with a sparse stem structure (Phragmites and Carex), while the 2nd group consisted of plant species with a decidedly more-complicated structure (Sphagnum, Calliergonella, and Utricularia). The results demonstrated that water table depth, pH, and concentrations of total phosphorus and total organic carbon strongly regulated the taxonomic composition and abundances of protozoa. Rates of excretion of ammonia-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus proportionally decreased with an increase in body weight. In experiments dominated by small protozoa, excreted amounts were significantly higher than in experiments dominated by higher taxa. Average net excretion rates per protozoon of nitrogen ranged 1.0 x 10(-5) - 3.72 x 10(-5) mu g/h and of phosphorus ranged 6.5 x 10(-6) - 1.2 x 10(-5) mu g/h. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.1/18.pdf

   EUROPEAN PLEISTOCENE THERMOKARST
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB Mineral palsas with thin peat covers are described from the continuous to discontinuous permafrost transition zone. They are up to 4 m high and are developed in a clast rich fine grained diamict. Their development post dates the land emergence ca. 4.3 ka BP following isostatic uplift. Morphological and vegetational data suggest a growth and decay cycle from small, emergent, Sphagnum covered mounds to mature palsas with heath and forest taxa and finally arcuate ridges marking the outline of degraded palsas, separated by bogs and open water. It is speculated that long-term ground water supply within a complex talik structure and allied ice segregation through cryosuction are crucial formative processes. Field features diagnostic of these mineral pal sas are frost-heaved erratic blocks, surficial sliding of peat blocks, seeps of thawed diamict, and a complex pattern of thermokarst landforms. The palsa fields may be analogues for relict complex thermokarst landforms in parts of western Europe formerly subject to permafrost and previously interpreted as relict pingos.

TI The ecohydrology of forested peatlands: Simulating the effects of tree

AB Forested peatlands represent an important global carbon pool, storing 48.0 Pg of carbon within continental western Canada alone. Peatland hydrology regulates the carbon dynamics and future stability of this carbon store and provides a critical control on regional water dynamics. Drying associated with land-use change and climate change has the potential to increase tree growth, modifying the density, size, and spatial arrangement of trees. This can reduce peatland evaporation and offset the associated increase in transpiration. To determine the magnitude of this negative ecohydrological feedback, we simulated spatial variations in radiation, turbulent energy fluxes, and temperatures in peatlands with real and idealized tree densities and distributions. For a random tree distribution, an increase in tree density from 0 to 4 trees per m(2) reduced available energy at the peat surface, decreasing average evaporation by 25%. At higher tree densities, feather moss species covered a larger fraction of the ground because of lower light availability. In combination with the lower energy availability, this change in moss composition reduced evaporation by similar to 70%. The reduction in evaporation was greater (83%) when the effects of increased canopy cover on peatland aerodynamic properties were incorporated. Additionally, we found that evaporation was dependent on the spatial arrangement of trees, with evaporation being higher when trees were clustered. Overall, our model showed that the trade-off between reduced evaporation and increased transpiration with increasing tree densities reduced landscape variation in evapotranspiration, with simulated evapotranspiration remaining approximately constant across a broad range of peatland ecosystems despite varying canopy densities.

AB We characterized soil and the concentrations of solutes in soil solutions and in stream water in and around a wetland located within a first-order stream in a forested watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, USA). We hypothesized that the in-stream wetland would retain solutes in stream water, especially Ca2+, H+, and strong acid anions (NO3, SO42-). Rather, the wetland had subtle impact on stream water chemistry causing slightly greater Na+ concentrations and lesser concentrations of HI and dissolved inorganic C (DIC). We expected anaerobic microbial denitrification and SO42- reduction in wetland soils to consume the strong acid anions and account for less H+, but Na+ release was responsible. The wetland soil produced dissolved organic C (DOC) but did not export it into stream water. The DOC was saturated with monomeric Al, suggesting a sink rather than source for Al. Soil extracted with 1 M NH4Cl yielded much larger amounts of Ca2+ and Mg2+ than in the surrounding mineral forest soil, whereas NH4+, K+, and Na+ budgets were smaller in the wetland soil than in the forest soil. Characterization of soil surface charge and organic matter fractions revealed distinct differences between wetland soil organic matter (SOM) and forest soil SOM. Our results suggest that the wetland behaves much like gelatin: the organic matrix holds water tightly, such that stream water flows mostly over the matrix rather than entering and forcing much of the old water into runoff. The subtle biogeochemical role of the wetland adds to the complex interactions that control solute mobility in small watersheds.

ID SCALING BEHAVIOR; PEATLAND; REGIME; RECORD
AB Atmospheric pollutants and environmental indicators are often used to reconstruct historic atmospheric pollution from peat, as it accumulates over time by decomposing plant material, thus recording a history of air pollution. In the present study, three key parameters related to the peat bogs' surface wetness dynamics in European Russia during the Holocene were investigated using modern statistical analysis. These parameters are: (i) the water table depth (WTD) in relation to the surface, which is reconstructed based on the community structure of the subfossil testate amoeba assemblages; (ii) the peat humification estimated as absorption of alkaline extract that directly reflects moisture at which the peat was formed; (iii) the Climate Moisture Index (CMI) and the Aridity Index derived from pollen-based reconstructions of the mean annual temperature and precipitation and classifying moisture conditions as the ratio between available annual precipitation and potential land surface evapotranspiration. All these parameters provide useful information about the paleoclimate (atmospheric moisture component) dynamics. High values of WTD and peat humification appear to comply with Gutenberg-Richter law. It is noteworthy that this law also seems to reproduce the high values of the modeled climate moisture and aridity indices. The validity of this new result is checked by replacing "conventional time" with "natural time". On this basis, a new nowcasting tool is developed to more accurately estimate the average waiting time for the extreme values of these climate parameters. This will help to understand climate variability better to address emerging development needs and priorities by implementing empirical studies of the interactions between climatic effects, mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable growth.

AB As part of a wider project on European climate change over the past 4500 years, a 4.5-m peat core was taken from a lawn microform on Mannikjarve bog, Estonia. Several methods were used to yield proxy-climate data: (i) a quadrat and leaf-count method for plant macrofossil data, (ii) testate amoebae analysis, and (iii) colorimetric determination of peat humification. These data are provided with an exceptionally high resolution and precise chronology. Changes in bog surface wetness were inferred using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and zonation of macrofossil data, particularly concerning the occurrence of Sphagnum balticum, and a transfer function for water-table depth for testate amoebae data. Based on the results, periods of high bog surface wetness appear to have occurred at c. 3100, 3010-2990, 2300, 1750-1610, 1510, 14 10, 1110, 540 and 3 10 cal. yr BP, during four longer periods between c. 3170 and 2850 cal. yr BP, 2450 and 2000 cal. yr BP, 1770 and 1530 cal. yr BP and in the period from 880 cal. yr BP until the present. In the period between 1770 and 1530 cal. yr BP. the extension or initiation of a hollow microtope occurred, which corresponds with other research results from Mannikjarve bog. This and other changes towards increasing bog surface wetness may be the responses to colder temperatures and the predominance of a more continental climate in the region, which favoured the development of bog microdepressions and a complex bog microtopography. Located in the border zone of oceanic and continental climatic sectors, in an area almost without land uplift, this study site may provide valuable information about changes in palaeohydrological and palaeoclimatological conditions in the northern parts of the eastern Baltic Sea region.

AB Scenarios modeling can be a useful tool to plan for climate change. In this study, we help Everglades restoration planning to bolster climate change resiliency by simulating plausible ecosystem responses to three climate change scenarios: a Baseline scenario of 2010 climate, and two scenarios that both included 1.5 degrees C warming and 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and differed only by rainfall: either increase or decrease by 10%. In conjunction with output from a water-use management model, we used these scenarios to drive the Everglades Landscape Model to simulate changes in a suite of parameters that include both hydrologic drivers and changes to soil pattern and process. In this paper we focus on the freshwater wetlands; sea level rise is specifically addressed in prior work. The decreased rainfall scenario produced marked changes across the system in comparison to the Baseline scenario. Most notably, muck fire risk was elevated for 49% of the period of simulation in one of the three indicator regions. Surface water flow velocity slowed drastically across most of the system, which may impair soil processes related to maintaining landscape patterning. Due to lower flow volumes, this scenario produced decreases in parameters related to flow-loading, such as phosphorus accumulation in the soil, and methylmercury production risk. The increased rainfall scenario was hydrologically similar to the Baseline scenario due to existing water management rules. A key change was phosphorus accumulation in the soil, an effect of flow-loading due to higher inflow from water control structures in this scenario.

AB [ 1] We used a simple hydrological-biogeochemical mixing model to test the hypothesis that export of total organic carbon occurring mainly during spring in taiga and tundra watersheds might be compensated by production and export of bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) from groundwater during the rest of the year. The investigated watersheds are located in northern Sweden close to the Arctic Circle. An elevated spring flow peak due to snowmelt characterizes the hydrology of boreal and arctic river systems. During this snowmelt, total organic carbon (TOC), previously stored as soil carbon, is flushed and exported from the watersheds, and can be released to the atmosphere via heterotrophic remineralization during riverine transport to the sea, thereby contributing to atmospheric CO(2). The TOC yields of the watersheds investigated increased with vegetation and peat cover and ranged across watersheds from 0.5 to 2.8 tons km(-2) yr(-1). During frozen periods, streamflow is dominated by "old'' groundwater. This water has percolated through the soils and is rich in DSi and bicarbonate; that is, atmospheric carbon that has been "consumed'' in chemical weathering processes is partly exported as bicarbonate to the sea, where carbon is stored as CaCO(3) for geological time. The bicarbonate export of the watersheds investigated was between 0.4 and 1.2 tons C km(-2) yr(-1) corresponding to 15 - 73% of the TOC export. Very likely, global warming will affect water flow through the soils in taiga and tundra ecosystems and thus will have an effect on watershed carbon budgets. This bicarbonate export may compensate for significant amounts of the exported TOC, thereby reducing the positive feedback to atmospheric CO(2).

AB Climate warming increases evapotranspiration (ET) more in boreal peatlands than in forests. Observations show that peatland ET can exceed forest ET by up to 30%, indicating a stronger warming response in peatlands. Earth system models do not fully account for peatlands and hence may underestimate future boreal ET.
   The response of evapotranspiration (ET) to warming is of critical importance to the water and carbon cycle of the boreal biome, a mosaic of land cover types dominated by forests and peatlands. The effect of warming-induced vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increases on boreal ET remains poorly understood because peatlands are not specifically represented as plant functional types in Earth system models. Here we show that peatland ET increases more than forest ET with increasing VPD using observations from 95 eddy covariance tower sites. At high VPD of more than 2 kPa, peatland ET exceeds forest ET by up to 30%. Future (2091-2100) mid-growing season peatland ET is estimated to exceed forest ET by over 20% in about one-third of the boreal biome for RCP4.5 and about two-thirds for RCP8.5. Peatland-specific ET responses to VPD should therefore be included in Earth system models to avoid biases in water and carbon cycle projections.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE

ID CHEMICAL SEDIMENTATION; SOUTHERN AFRICA; TRANSPORT; FIRES; SWAMP; AIR
AB The role of water- and airborne sediments and nutrients is examined in the nearly closed system of the Okavango Delta. The total annual sediment load carried by the Okavango River into the delta is estimated at 620 000 tonnes. Annual deposition on the delta from the atmosphere under anticyclonic conditions only is estimated at 250 000 tonnes. Nutrient supply to the delta system from these two sources is estimated for the papyrus-dominated habitats of the permanent swamps. Maximum and minimum waterborne and aerosol contributions are determined for potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen species. On an annual basis, atmospheric inputs range from 6-60% of the total. The existence of large reservoirs of nutrients in the peat cannot account for the observed variability in papyrus productivity on the channel fringes and in the backswamp areas, due to low rates of mineralisation (8.1 and 0.12 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively). Enhanced productivity exists on channel fringes due to flowing water; more even distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus over the delta comes from the atmosphere. Aerosol inputs of 3.9 and 0. 13 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, are compared with corresponding aquatic supplies of 108 and 2.25 kg ha(-1)yr(-1). The effect of these contributions on papyrus productivity is discussed. The results obtained for the Okavango Delta suggest that atmospheric supply of nutrients may be equally important in more complex southern African ecosystems.

AB The present study aims to elucidate the depositional environment of Seam I in the Megalopolis Basin, Southern Greece, using existing geological data supported by maceral and mineralogical analyses, as well as by natural radioactivity determinations. Very high pyrite and uranium contents and a very low tissue preservation index usually suggest a marine influence during deposition. In Seam 1, however, these features are most probably the result of a karstic aquifer supplying the palaeomire with sulphate-rich, neutral to weakly alkaline water. The pyrite formation and the U precipitation are attributed to the anaerobic conditions, which prevailed during peat accumulation. The petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data of the studied profile point to several changes in the surface runoff and the supply of clastic material during deposition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel design of lysimeter for use in mires (peatlands) with shallow water tables is described. It employs an hydraulic mechanism for the automatic equilibration of soil moisture distribution between the outside and the inside of the lysimeter tank but uses no electronic components or electrical power; and it can be installed with minimal disturbance in surfaces with poor load-bearing capacity. The system was deployed on a mire in northern Scotland to investigate the distribution of shallow seepage associated with catenary arrays of different types of surface (microtopes). During the three-year period 15 November 1988 to 19 November 1991, the fraction of rainfall dispersed as seepage was 52% in a pool system; 62% in ridge-furrow microtopography; and 59-67% in unpatterned sloping mire. The data provide preliminary confirmation of the hypothesis of K. E. Ivanov that different microtopes within the same mire differ in their hydrological norms; and suggest that the range of ecohydrological differences at the study site may be similar to those obtained by Ivanov in western Siberia. Details of lysimeter design, construction, installation and operation are appended together with a discussion of the theory of the lysimeter.

AB Temperate wetlands are generally net retainers of sulphate (SO4-2). However, recent research indicates that some wetlands may export SO4-2 during drought conditions. In temperate wetlands, the susceptibility to drought will depend on wetland-stream and groundwater-surface water interactions. Here we present results of summer SO4-2 dynamics in a confined and unconfined stream within a temperate swamp.
   At the confined transect, the water table levels dropped greatly (-55 cm) and groundwater flow patterns reversed in response to summer drought. Although high porewater SO4-2 concentrations (36.4 mg l(-1)) were measured, no downstream export of SO4-2 was observed. A SO4-2 mass balance analysis on this stream reach indicated near zero retention. At the unconfined transect, water flowed from the stream to the wetland throughout most of the summer, maintaining relatively high water table levels (-25 cm). Sulphate porewater concentrations were significantly lower (9-2 mg l(-1)) than in the confined transect. Downstream discharge decreased to zero within this reach during extreme drought conditions, resulting in 100% SO4-2 retention for a three-week period. Upon rewetting stream SO4-2 levels increased to 161.7 mg l(-1) resulting in a large net export Of SO4-2. This study demonstrates that while water table position was an important control on SO4-2 dynamics within the wetland, the degree of hydrologic connectivity between the wetland and the stream was the main control on episodic SO4-2 release following summer drought.

AB Peatlands are complex ecosystems driven by many physical, chemical, and biological processes. Peat soils have a significant impact on water quality, ecosystem productivity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the extent of peatlands is decreasing across the world, mainly because of anthropogenic activities such as drainage for agriculture or groundwater abstractions in underlying aquifers. Potential changes in precipitation and temperature in the future are likely to apply additional pressure to wetland. In this context, a methodology for assessing and comparing the respective impacts of groundwater abstraction and climate change on a groundwater-fed wetland (135 km(2)) located in Northwest France, is presented. A groundwater model was developed, using flexible boundary conditions to represent surface-subsurface interactions which allowed examination of the extent of the wetland areas. This variable parameter is highly important for land management and is usually not considered in impact studies. The model was coupled with recharge estimation, groundwater abstraction scenarios, and climate change scenarios downscaled from 14 GCMs corresponding to the A1B greenhouse gas (GHG) scenario over the periods 1961-2000 and 2081-2100. Results show that climate change is expected to have an important impact and reduce the surface of wetlands by 5.3-13.6%. In comparison, the impact of groundwater abstraction (100% increase in the expected scenarios) would lead to a maximum decrease of 3.7%. Results also show that the impacts of climate change and groundwater abstraction could be partially mitigated by decreasing or stopping land drainage in specific parts of the area. Water management will require an appropriate compromise which encompasses ecosystem preservation, economic and public domain activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present paper discusses water level fluctuations in different parts of boreal mire complexes (eleven localities), mainly aapa mire complexes, on the basis of measurements performed by means of shallow observation wells and a few deeper observation tubes (piezometers) in the coastal half of the southern aapa mire zone in Finland. The sites represented intact vegetation from 12 different habitat types (communities), which were divided a priori into habitats with a stable surface moisture status (stable habitats) and into habitats with an unstable surface moisture status (unstable habitats). In stable habitats water level fluctuations took place according to the acrotelm-catotelm model, but the unstable habitats clearly deviated from the general pattern: water level fluctuations in them were not at all concentrated to the surficial, porous peat layer. Direct gradient analysis was used for arranging the communities along the water level fluctuation gradient. Variability of the water table, using 80% amplitude of water table residence, was used for the arrangement. The gradient was split into three groups: (1) habitats with a slightly fluctuating water table, (2) habitats with a considerably fluctuating water table and (3) habitats with an extremely fluctuating water table. The last group nearly corresponded to aro wetlands, and represented a very special habitat type. Indirect gradient analysis (NMDS ordination) also revealed the water level fluctuation gradient along with the gradient of traditional water level categories. According to the results of direct and indirect gradient analysis, the water level fluctuation seems to be an independent and important vegetation gradient. In peatlands, it occurs alongside with the traditional gradient of water level categories reflecting the mean water table. The responses of species to the range of water level fluctuations seem to reflect their tolerance to disturbances and evidently to seasonal drought. Most Sphagnum species are absent or in poor condition in habitats with extremely fluctuating water table. Vascular plant species that experienced most extreme water level fluctuations (Carex nigra, Juncus filiformis) have earlier been regarded as disturbance indicators. In addition, the difference between the piezometric water level and simultaneously measured water table depth reached the highest values within the habitats of those species (i.e., within Polytrichum commune aro wetlands) showing the downward direction of water movement in sandy mineral soil.

AB Elevated nitrogen deposition and climate change alter the vegetation communities and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands. To address this issue we developed a new process-oriented biogeochemical model (PEATBOG) for analyzing coupled carbon and nitrogen dynamics in northern peatlands. The model consists of four submodels, which simulate: (1) daily water table depth and depth profiles of soil moisture, temperature and oxygen levels; (2) competition among three plants functional types (PFTs), production and litter production of plants; (3) decomposition of peat; and (4) production, consumption, diffusion and export of dissolved C and N species in soil water. The model is novel in the integration of the C and N cycles, the explicit spatial resolution belowground, the consistent conceptualization of movement of water and solutes, the incorporation of stoichiometric controls on elemental fluxes and a consistent conceptualization of C and N reactivity in vegetation and soil organic matter. The model was evaluated for the Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, with regards to simulation of soil moisture and temperature and the most important processes in the C and N cycles. Model sensitivity was tested for nitrogen input, precipitation, and temperature, and the choices of the most uncertain parameters were justified. A simulation of nitrogen deposition over 40 yr demonstrates the advantages of the PEATBOG model in tracking biogeochemical effects and vegetation change in the ecosystem.

AB Landscape-scale reconstruction and prescription of soil cover systems following oil sands mining is challenging due to the quality of available reclamation materials and the subhumid climate of the Boreal Plains of Canada. In an experimental reclaimed watershed (Sandhill Fen Watershed), basin-scale upland landforms (i.e., hummocks) were designed to provide groundwater to adjacent lowlands, necessitating adequate recharge following establishment of forest vegetation. Volumetric water contents, soil water pressure heads, and groundwater levels were monitored for four years throughout the watershed and used to calibrate and verify numerical models in IIYDRUS. Using a variably saturated two-dimensional domain, we identified a threshold-like relationship between recharge (or upflux) and upland hummock height, where upland hummocks not tall enough to limit root water uptake from the saturated zone decreased recharge or resulted in net upflux. Recharge varied with soil cover texture (higher in coarser-textured) and associated soil hydraulic parameters. Furthermore, scenario tests indicated the importance and relative influence that maximum rooting depths, forest floor placement thicknesses, and leaf area indices (all associated with forest development) had on recharge. Simulations utilizing a historical climate record indicated that interannual climatic variability was as influential as variation in soil cover texture in determining recharge. Reclamation practitioners should recognize that the water balances of reconstructed landscapes are largely influenced by the trade-off between optimizing forest productivity and sourcing water to downgradient landscape positions.

AB The present study focuses on two Baltic-type peat bogs in Slowinski National Park, namely that at Zarnowskie and at Kluki, located in the Lake Lebsko catchment and both characterised by a centrally located dome with a very marshy fringe area featuring an emerging marshy coniferous forest (Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetum). The Zarnowskie bog is under active protection. A total of 24 flow barriers were installed in drainage ditches during the years 2006 and 2007. The purpose of these barriers was to put a halt to water outflow. In addition, 30 hectares of young pine forest were cleared in order to decrease loss of water via evapotranspiration.
   Kluki peat bog is only partially protected by Polish law. The lack of efforts to prevent outflow via the canal is due to the fact that the canal is utilised to drain meadows in the vicinity of the village of Lokciowe outside of the national park. Peat formation no longer occurs in this peat bog. The hydrological condition of the bog is catastrophic as a result of its main canal, referred to as Canal C9, which is 2.5 to 3.0 m deep and 10 m wide in places.
   Both peat bogs are monitored for fluctuations in groundwater. Research has shown that changes in water levels fluctuate based on season of the year and geographical location, which is illustrated quite well using the two studied peat bogs.
   The water retention rate of the Zarnowskie peat bog may be considered fairly high and is likely to improve due to protective measures enabled by Polish environmental laws. The water retention rate of the bog is consistently improving thanks to these measures, fluctuations in water level are small and the water level does not drop under 0.5 m below ground level even under extreme hydrometeorological conditions. This yields optimum conditions for renewed peat formation in this area. One potential threat is the Krakulice peat extraction facility, which is located in the southern part of the bog close to the boundary with the national park.

AB Peatlands and forests cover large areas of the boreal biome and are critical for global climate regulation. They also regulate regional climate through heat and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere. Understanding how land-atmosphere interactions in peatlands differ from forests may therefore be crucial for modelling boreal climate system dynamics and for assessing climate benefits of peatland conservation and restoration. To assess the biophysical impacts of peatlands and forests on peak growing season air temperature and humidity, we analysed surface energy fluxes and albedo from 35 peatlands and 37 evergreen needleleaf forests-the dominant boreal forest type-and simulated air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over hypothetical homogeneous peatland and forest landscapes. We ran an evapotranspiration model using land surface parameters derived from energy flux observations and coupled an analytical solution for the surface energy balance to an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. We found that peatlands, compared to forests, are characterized by higher growing season albedo, lower aerodynamic conductance, and higher surface conductance for an equivalent VPD. This combination of peatland surface properties results in a similar to 20% decrease in afternoon ABL height, a cooling (from 1.7 to 2.5 degrees C) in afternoon air temperatures, and a decrease in afternoon VPD (from 0.4 to 0.7 kPa) for peatland landscapes compared to forest landscapes. These biophysical climate impacts of peatlands are most pronounced at lower latitudes (similar to 45 degrees N) and decrease toward the northern limit of the boreal biome (similar to 70 degrees N). Thus, boreal peatlands have the potential to mitigate the effect of regional climate warming during the growing season. The biophysical climate mitigation potential of peatlands needs to be accounted for when projecting the future climate of the boreal biome, when assessing the climate benefits of conserving pristine boreal peatlands, and when restoring peatlands that have experienced peatland drainage and mining.

TI ECOLOGY OF TESTACEANS (PROTOZOA, RHIZOPODA) IN MIRES IN SOUTHERN FINLAND
   .2. MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS
SO ARCHIV FUR PROTISTENKUNDE
LA English
DT Article
AB The distribution of 41 testacean species (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) and a rotifer, Habrotrocha angusticollis (Rotifera: Bdelloidea) was analyzed in relation to 12 environmental variables by multivariate numerical techniques. Statistical analyses were performed using absolute numbers of testaceans estimated from 90 representative microsite types in six mires in the raised bog region of southern Finland.
   Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and both indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA) gradient analysis indicated that individual testaceans and certain assemblages of testaceans were dependent upon more than a single environmental factor, with soil moisture content being the most important. In microsite types where soil moisture content was not strongly affecting testaceans, the trophic status and DOC of the water proved to be important.
   The 12 environmental variables included in our survey accounted for 69.1 % of the total variance according to the CCA-ordination. In decreasing order of importance were depth of water table, soil moisture content, trophic status of the site, C/N ratio of the peat, water pH, depth of testacean sample, and DOC of water.
   The agglomerative cluster analysis by means of VAN DER MAAREL'S similarity index recognized nine testacean groups, which are comparable to groups identified by TWINSPAN along ecological gradients from dry to wet and from oligotrophic to eutrophic microsites.

AB Peatlands offer the potential for high resolution records of water balance over Holocene timescales, yet this potential is under-exploited in many areas of the world. Within Europe, peatlands are mostly confined to areas north of 55 degrees N, but several areas of southern and eastern Europe contain small peatlands which may be suitable for palaeoclimatic reconstruction. In this paper we test the potential of peatlands in the Carpathian region for deriving quantified estimates of water table changes using testate amoebae analysis. A training set for palaeohydrological reconstruction from testate amoebae assemblages was obtained by collecting surface samples from 13 peatlands, including 9 from Hungary and 4 from Transylvania (Romania). Using a simple measure of mean annual water tables estimated from staining of PVC tape, we found that some peatlands were heavily influenced by runoff and groundwater, and were therefore not suitable as modern analogues of ombrotrophic climatically sensitive sites. The relationship between the testate amoebae assemblages in the modern samples and the environmental variables was explored using CCA. The CCA biplot showed that the most important variables are depth to water table and moisture content, confirming that hydrology is a key control on taxon distribution. pH was a secondary gradient. A transfer function for % moisture and depth to water table was established and applied to fossil assemblages from a sequence from Fenyves-teto, Transylvania, Romania. The reconstructed water table shows a number of variations which have parallels with other palaeoclimatic records from Europe and the North Atlantic prominent phases of higher water tables are associated with the periods 8000-8300 cal BP, 3000-2500 cal BP and after 600 cal BP. We suggest that these were periods of particular intensification of westerly airflow which affected eastern Europe as well as western and central Europe.

AB It is commonly assumed that agricultural peatlands are net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere because of lowered water tables and intensive land management altering the balance of plant productivity and respiration. Yet actual farm-scale fluxes of CO2 have been infrequently quantified. We measured net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) using a permanent and a mobile eddy covariance tower installed over dairy farms with year-round rotational grazing on deep peats in New Zealand. The permanent tower was in place for one year and the mobile tower was deployed for periods of 3-4 weeks at three other farms on peat between spring and autumn. At all sites, grazing cycles caused large variations in pasture biomass and consequent daytime NEE and we accounted for these variations using an index of photosynthesising biomass (phytomass index, Lohila et al., 2004) automatically derived from daily CO2 flux measurements. We estimated annual CO2 loss of 190 gC m(-2)yr(-1) for the permanent site, which is in broad agreement with other agricultural peatland studies. Including other farm-scale exports of C, overall net ecosystem carbon loss estimated for the permanent site was 294 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Accounting for changes in phytomass index, daytime NEE was similar for permanent-mobile site farm pairings, except when there were very large differences in water table depths between farms in autumn. In contrast, night-time respiration losses were almost identical between farms even when water tables were markedly different, suggesting that spatial differences in NEE in these agricultural peatlands are caused by reduced photosynthesis in dry periods, due to plant water stress, rather than increased respiration. Comparisons between permanent and mobile towers appeared a useful approach for determining spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from peat soils. Taken together, our results suggested that the CO2 losses measured at the permanent site were representative of CO2 losses for farmed peats in the Waikato region when the water table was within similar to 0.5 m of the surface. Where water tables were deeper net CO2 losses would be expected to be greater due to reduced pasture photosynthesis and production. Maintaining higher water tables might achieve dual benefits of increasing pasture productivity and reducing CO2 losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated patterns and controls of the seasonal and inter-annual variations in energy fluxes (i.e., sensible heat, H, and latent heat, lambda E) and partitioning of the water budget (i.e., precipitation, P; evapotranspiration, ET; discharge, Q; and soil water storage, Delta S) over five years (2001-2005) in a boreal oligotrophic fen in northern Sweden based on continuous eddy covariance, water table level (WTL), and weir measurements. For the growing season (May 1 to September 31), the 5 year averages (+/- standard deviation) of the midday (10:00 to 14:00 h) Bowen ratio (beta, i.e., H/lambda E) was 0.86 +/- 0.08. Seasonal and inter-annual variability of beta was mainly driven by lambda E which itself was strongly controlled by both weather (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, D, and net radiation, R-n) and physiological parameters (i.e., surface resistance). During the growing season, surface resistance largely exceeded aerodynamic resistance, which together with low mean values of the actual ET to potential ET ratio (0.55 +/- 0.05) and Priestley-Taylor alpha (0.89) suggests significant physiological constrains on ET in this well-watered fen. Among the water budget components, the inter-annual variability of ET was lower (199 to 298 mm) compared to Q (225 to 752 mm), with each accounting on average for 34 and 65% of the ecosystem water loss, respectively. The fraction of P expended into ET was negatively correlated to P and positively to R-n. Although a decrease in WTL caused a reduction of the surface conductance, the overall effect of WTL on ET was limited. Non-growing season (October 1 to April 30) fluxes of H, lambda E, and Q were significant representing on average -67%, 13%, and 61%, respectively, of their growing season sums (negative sign indicates opposite flux direction between the two seasons). Overall, our findings suggest that plant functional type composition, P and R-n dynamics (i.e., amount and timing) were the major controls on the partitioning of the mire energy and water budgets. This has important implications for the regional climate as well as for ecosystem development, nutrient, and carbon dynamics. Citation: Peichl, M., J. Sagerfors, A. Lindroth, I. Buffam, A. Grelle, L.

AB Study Region: We analyzed the effects of groundwater pumping on a mountain wetland complex, Yosemite National Park, California, USA.
   Study Focus: Groundwater pumping from mountain meadows is common in many regions of the world. However, few quantitative analyses exist of the hydrologic or ecological effects of pumping.
   New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Daily hydraulic head and water table variations at sampling locations within 100 m of the pumping well were strongly correlated with the timing and duration of pumping. The effect of pumping varied by distance from the pumping well, depth of the water table when the pumping started, and that water year's snow water equivalent (SWE). Pumping in years with below average SWE and/or early melting snow pack, resulted in a water table decline to the base of the fen peat body by mid summer. Pumping in years with higher SWE and later melting snowpack, resulted in much less water level drawdown from the same pumping schedule. Predictive modeling scenarios showed that, even in a dry water year like 2004, distinct increases in fen water table elevation can be achieved with reductions in pumping. A high water table during summers following low snowpack water years had a more significant influence on vegetation composition than depth of water table in wet years or peat thickness, highlighting the impact of water level drawdown on vegetation.

AB Persistence, or the tendency of a species to remain in its original position without colonizing new sites, is studied for 24 species on the ombrotrophic Northern Kisselbergmossen in SE Norway. Data sets comprise presence/absence in 436 sample plots (16cm x 16cm) and 6976 subplots (4cm x 4cm) analysed with a 5-yr interval. Persistence was calculated for both spatial scales, and the observed values were compared with null models of completely random presence/absence of species. Species characteristics (plot occurrences and persistence) were related to depth to the water table and species optima along ecologically interpreted DCA ordination axes. The observed persistence was significantly higher than predicted from the random model for all vascular plants and cryptogams at both spatial scales. All taxonomic groups showed higher persistence at the sample plot scale than at the subplot scale. No general relationship between persistence and depth to the water table was found, but for the cryptograms there was somewhat higher persistence for the less peat-producing species. The persistence of the vascular plants depended on ramet longevity, growth form and vegetative mobility. In general, the observed persistence of most cryptogams was high, probably because of their perenniality, low growth rates and high reproductive output. Differences in growth-form and life history, as well as the higher number of occurrences, are the most likely reasons for somewhat higher mean persistence of hepatics and Sphagna than of vascular plants at the subplot scale.

AB The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the largest peatland complex in North America. More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial government mandates that ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration be considered in land-use planning. Accomplishing this task requires identifying carbon indicators and assessing their responses to changing ecosystem processes, such as succession, permafrost thaw, and evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we synthesized information on peat carbon indicators and ecosystem process from the literature. Findings indicate that the long-term carbon accumulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, peat depth, and peatland age were similar (p > 0.10) between dry and wet peatland features. Furthermore, CO2 sequestration displayed the highest variability and ponds were net CO2 emitters. Recent carbon accumulation, CH4 emission, and ET were highest (p < 0.01) in wet features, with CH4 emission displaying wide variation. Increased active layer thickness (105 +/- 92 cm per 100 years) in permafrost was the most variable ecosystem process analyzed in this study, while variation in permafrost loss (53 +/- 23% per 100 years) was similar to that of carbon accumulation and ET rates. Processes creating wet and pond conditions may increase landscape-scale CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, weakening peatland carbon sinks. Dry conditions may reduce CH4 emissions but potentially increase peatland susceptibility to fire. Knowledge of these changes should be useful for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments for large landscapes. However, better understanding of variability in CO2 sequestration, CH4 emission, and permafrost dynamics is required to design such assessments for small landscapes.

AB Garland Seep is a Southern Appalachian fen that supports a population of federally endangered green pitcher plants (Sarracenia oreophila). The wetland is underlain by clayey stream deposits above fractured bedrock, is located at the base of a mountain slope, and is fed by groundwater that originates as recharge on the adjacent hillslope. Groundwater wells were installed following a hydrologic restoration in the mid-1990s and have been monitored at varying frequencies since that time. The 20+ year record provides evidence that Garland Seep can be classified as a "hypocrene fen," in which spring flow rarely reaches the ground surface because of low discharge rates and high evapotranspiration (ET). In general, water-level fluctuations followed seasonal ET patterns, with higher water levels in the winter and early spring (when ET is low) and lower levels in the summer and fall. During wetter years, the water table remained near the ground surface for much of the year, with the clay layer underlying the site retaining moisture even after water levels had dropped. The "clay wetting" period was shorter during dryer years and corresponded with a reduction in the number of pitcher plant clumps observed at the site. In addition to the geologic and climatic controls on hydrology, previous landowners used fire to maintain open space for grazing, and The Nature Conservancy has continued the practice to combat woody vegetation and to open the canopy. Prescribed burns reduce ET (at least initially), cause a rise in water levels, and have helped maintain a thriving Sarracenia population.

AB Although boreal herb-rich forests are important ecosystems for maintaining biological diversity in Fennoscandia, their ecology, flora and ecological gradients are still poorly known and their classification remains somewhat unclear. The aim here was to explore quantitatively which are the most important environmental factors related to distribution patterns in the herb-rich forest vegetation. Altogether 101 herb-rich forest stands in the Koli area, eastern Finland, were studied. In order to find out whether vascular plants (n = 165) and bryophytes (n = 100) reflect different environmental factors, they were subjected separately to Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results indicated that the most important environmental factor was site moisture, while others were soil acidity, the intensity of water flow, stoniness, land use history and exposure. Bryophyte distribution correlated better with N, Ca and soil moisture than did the distribution of vascular plants, while vascular plants were more closely reflected earlier land use, altitude and Mg. Differences between eight 'A priori' herb-rich forest site types were studied by non-parametric test. The herb-rich forests studied here can be classified in terms of moisture into: (1) sub-dry and mesic, (2) mesic-moist and (3) moist and wet sites. Sites also formed clear groups after moisture gradient, location and land use history or exposure. Traditional herb-rich forest site types did not form clear groups after environmental gradients. Deciduous stands, hemerophilous species and podsol and peat mull soils are common in the herb-rich forest studied as a result of long-term human impacts, e.g. slash-and-burn cultivation and intensive forestry.(c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB While boreal lowland bogs have been extensively studied using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique, less knowledge exists on mountainous peatlands. Hence, half-hourly CO2 fluxes of an ombrotrophic peat bog in the Harz Mountains, Germany, were measured with the EC technique during a growing season with exceptionally dry weather spells. A common biophysical process model for net ecosystem exchange was used to describe measured CO2 fluxes and to fill data gaps. Model parameters and uncertainties were estimated by robust inverse modelling in a Bayesian framework using a population-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. The focus of this study was on the correct statistical description of error, i.e. the differences between the measured and simulated carbon fluxes, and the influence of distributional assumptions on parameter estimates, cumulative carbon fluxes, and uncertainties. We tested the Gaussian, Laplace, and Student's t distribution as error models. The t-distribution was identified as best error model by the deviance information criterion. Its use led to markedly different parameter estimates, a reduction of parameter uncertainty by about 40%, and, most importantly, to a 5% higher estimated cumulative CO2 uptake as compared to the commonly assumed Gaussian error distribution. As open-path measurement systems have larger measurement error at high humidity, the standard deviation of the error was modeled as a function of measured vapor pressure deficit. Overall, this paper demonstrates the importance of critically assessing the influence of distributional assumptions on estimated model parameters and cumulative carbon fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere.

AB 1. Effects of the frequency and duration of flooding on the structural and functional characteristics of riparian vegetation were studied at four sites (n=80, 50x50cm, plots) along medium-sized naturally meandering lowland streams. Special focus was on rich fens, which due to their high species richness are of high priority in nature conservation. 2. Reed beds, rich fens and meadows were all regularly flooded during the 20-year study period, with a higher frequency in reed bed areas than in rich fen and meadow areas. In rich fens, species richness was higher in low frequency flooded areas (3year1) than in areas with a high frequency of flooding (>3year1) or no flooding, whereas species richness in reed beds and meadows was unaffected by flood frequency. 3. The percentage of stress-tolerant species was higher in low intensity flooded rich fen areas than in high intensity and non-flooded areas, indicating that the higher species richness in low frequency flooded rich fens was caused by competitive release. We found no indication that increased productivity was associated with high flooding frequencies. 4. We conclude that the restoration of morphological features in stream channels to increase the flooding regime can be beneficial for protected vegetation within riparian areas, but also that groundwater discharge thresholds and critical levels for protected vegetation should be identified and considered when introducing stream ecosystem restoration plans.

AB Losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from drained peatlands are of concern, due to the effects this has on the delivery of ecosystem services, and especially on the long-term store of carbon and the provision of drinking water. Most studies have looked at the effect of drainage in deep peat; comparatively, little is known about the behaviour of shallow, climatically marginal peatlands. This study examines water quality (DOC, Abs(400), pH, E4/E6 and C/C) during rainfall events from such environments in the south west UK, in order to both quantify DOC losses, and understand their potential for restoration. Water samples were taken over a 19 month period from a range of drains within two different experimental catchments in Exmoor National Park; data were analysed on an event basis. DOC concentrations ranging between 4 and 21 mg L-1 are substantially lower than measurements in deep peat, but remain problematic for the water treatment process. Dryness plays a critical role in controlling DOC concentrations and water quality, as observed through spatial and seasonal differences. Long-term changes in depth to water table (30 days before the event) are likely to impact on DOC production, whereas discharge becomes the main control over DOC transport at the time scale of the rainfall/runoff event. The role of temperature during events is attributed to an increase in the diffusion of DOC, and therefore its transport Humification ratios (E4/E6) consistently below 5 indicate a predominance of complex humic acids, but increased decomposition during warmer summer months leads to a comparatively higher losses of fulvic acids. This work represents a significant contribution to the scientific understanding of the behaviour and functioning of shallow damaged peatlands in climatically marginal locations. The findings also provide a sound baseline knowledge to support research into the effects of landscape restoration in the future. Crown Copyright (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier S.V.

AB Trails created by off-road vehicles (ORV) in boreal lowlands are known to cause local impacts, such as denuded vegetation, soil erosion, and permafrost thaw, but impacts on stream and watershed processes are less certain. In Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST), Alaska, ORV trails have caused local resource damage in intermountain lowlands with permafrost soils and abundant wetlands and there is a need to know whether these impacts are more extensive. Comparison of aerial photography from 1957, 1981, and 2004 coupled with ground surveys in 2009 reveal an increase in trail length and number and show an upslope expansion of a trail system around points of stream channel initiation. We hypothesized that these impacts could also cause premature initiation and headward expansion of channels because of lowered soil resistance and greater runoff accumulation as trails migrate upslope. Soil monitoring showed earlier and deeper thaw of the active layer in and adjacent to trails compared to reference sites. Several rainfall-runoff events during the summer of 2009 showed increased and sustained flow accumulation below trail crossings and channel shear forces sufficient to cause headward erosion of silt and peat soils. These observations of trail evolution relative to stream and wetland crossings together with process studies suggest that ORV trails are altering watershed processes. These changes in watershed processes appear to result in increasing drainage density and may also alter downstream flow regimes, water quality, and aquatic habitat. Addressing local land-use disturbances in boreal and arctic parklands with permafrost soils, such as WRST, where responses to climate change may be causing concurrent shifts in watershed processes, represents an important challenge facing resource managers.

AB Seepage lakes lacking surface-water inflow or outflow, but with surrounding peatlands, are important and vulnerable ecosystems with water budgets that depend largely on inputs from precipitation and groundwater discharge. We studied the sediment diversity in two such lake-wetland systems and their surrounding catchments. The lakes were located in relatively close proximity to one another within the West Polesie Transboundary Biosphere Reserve, West Polesie, East Poland. In spite of physiographic similarities, the studied lake-wetland systems and their catchments displayed considerable diversity in their underlying sediments. This was determined from data collected from several hundred geological boreholes and 164 determinations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the organic and mineral sediments (constant and falling head methods). Our research results showed that the functioning of a closed lake-wetland ecosystem is greatly influenced by the hydrogeological properties of its sediments. In the case of wetland zones surrounding lakes, especially closed-drainage seepage lakes, it is very important to identify the geological settings and the hydrogeological properties of those sediments in order to better understand groundwater influences.

AB It is widely recognized that interactions between vegetation and flow cause the emergence of channel patterns that are distinct from the standard Schumm classification of river channels. Although landscape pattern is known to be linked to ecosystem services such as habitat provision, pollutant removal, and sustaining biodiversity, the mechanisms responsible for the development and stability of different landscape patterns in shallow, vegetated flows have remained poorly understood. Fortunately, recent advances have made possible large-scale models of flow through vegetated environments that can be run over a range of environmental variables and over timescales of millennia. We describe a new, quasi-3D cellular automata model that couples simulations of shallow-water flow, bed shear stresses, sediment transport, and vegetation dynamics in an efficient manner. That efficiency allowed us to apply the model widely in order to determine how different hydroecological feedbacks control landscape pattern and process in various types of wetlands and floodplains. Distinct classes of landscape pattern were uniquely associated with specific types of allogenic and autogenic drivers in wetland flows. Regular, anisotropically patterned wetlands were dominated by allogenic processes (i.e., processes driven by periodic high water levels and flow velocities that redistribute sediment), relative to autogenic processes (e.g., vegetation production, peat accretion, and gravitational erosion). These anistropically patterned wetlands are therefore particularly prone to hydrologic disturbance. Other classes of wetlands that emerged from simulated interactions included maze-patterned, amorphous, and topographically noisy marshes, open marsh with islands, banded string-pool sequences perpendicular to flow, parallel deep and narrow channels flanked by marsh, and ridge-and-slough patterned marsh oriented parallel to flow. Because vegetation both affects and responds to the balance between the transport capacity of the flow and sediment supply, these vegetated systems exhibit a feedback that is not dominant in most rivers. Consequently, unlike in most rivers, it is not possible to predict the "channel pattern" of a vegetated landscape based only on discharge characteristics and sediment supply: the antecedent vegetation pattern and vegetation dynamics must also be known.
   In general, the stability of different wetland pattern types is most strongly related to factors controlling the erosion and deposition of sediment at vegetation patch edges, the magnitude of sediment redistribution by flow, patch elevation relative to water level, and the variability of erosion rates in vegetation patches with low flow-resistance. As we exemplify in our case-study of the Everglades ridge and slough landscape, feedback between flow and vegetation also causes hysteresis in landscape evolution trajectories that will affect the potential for landscape restoration. Namely, even if the hydrologic conditions that historically produced higher flows are restored, degraded portions of the ridge and slough landscape are unlikely to revert to their former patterning. As wetlands and floodplains worldwide become increasingly threatened by climate change and urbanization, the greater mechanistic understanding of landscape pattern and process that our analysis provides will improve our ability to forecast and manage the behavior of these ecosystems.

AB Because peat is elastic, the daily to seasonal swelling and shrinking of the peat surface not only affects water storage but also alters peatland hydraulics and the biogeochemical and thermal properties of peat. Due to different botanical origins and degrees of decomposition, we hypothesized that different peatland microforms (ridges and lawns) display a large variation in peat deformation and compressibility. Here we examined the spatial variation of peat surface movement, peat strength, and volumetric water content at a low lawn (LL), upper lawn (UL), and ridge (R) along a 5 m transect in a peatland in Quebec, Canada. The average seasonal amplitude in peat surface level was 9, 6, and 2 cm at the LL, UL, and R sites, respectively. The surface layers in each of these sites were fairly rigid with the largest changes in peat thickness occurring between 20 and 60 cm depth in the peat profile. Compressibility varied among microforms but was not correlated to other properties within the layer in individual soil layers. However, when average profile compressibility was considered, it was significantly correlated to peat depth, von Post humification, distance to hollow, and peat strength. The total water storage by dilation below the water table was about the same as the water deficit (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) for LL, while the storage deficit for UL and especially R was lower. Including changes in entrapped gas content over the season reduced estimates of changes in water storage at all sites. Because microform type and position were significant predictors of hydrophysical properties, we argue that this suggests that peatland microtopography is self-reinforcing through ecohydrological feedbacks. Including the variability in these properties in peatland ecohydrological models will be key for predicting the response of peatland ecosystems to disturbance.

AB Coastal wetlands are globally important sinks of organic carbon (C). However, to what extent wetland C cycling will be affected by accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion is unknown, especially in coastal peat marshes where water flow is highly managed. Our objective was to determine how the ecosystem C balance in coastal peat marshes is influenced by elevated salinity. For two years, we made monthly in situ manipulations of elevated salinity in freshwater (FW) and brackish water (BW) sites within Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. Salinity pulses interacted with marsh-specific variability in seasonal hydroperiods whereby effects of elevated pulsed salinity on gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) were dependent on marsh inundation level. We found little effect of elevated salinity on C cycling when both marsh sites were inundated, but when water levels receded below the soil surface, the BW marsh shifted from a C sink to a C source. During these exposed periods, we observed an approximately threefold increase in CO2 efflux from the marsh as a result of elevated salinity. Initially, elevated salinity pulses did not affect Cladium jamaicense biomass, but aboveground biomass began to be significantly decreased in the saltwater amended plots after two years of exposure at the BW site. We found a 65% (FW) and 72% (BW) reduction in live root biomass in the soil after two years of exposure to elevated salinity pulses. Regardless of salinity treatment, the FW site was C neutral while the BW site was a strong C source (-334 to -454 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)), particularly during dry-down events. A loss of live roots coupled with annual net CO2 losses as marshes transition from FW to BW likely contributes to the collapse of peat soils observed in the coastal Everglades. As SLR increases the rate of saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands globally, understanding how water management influences C gains and losses from these systems is crucial. Under current Everglades' water management, drought lengthens marsh dry-down periods, which, coupled with saltwater intrusion, accelerates CO2 loss from the marsh.

AB Peatlands are important reservoirs of carbon (C) but our understanding of C cycling on cutover peatlands is limited. We investigated the decomposition over 18 months of five types of plant litter (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Picea sitchensis and Sphagnum auriculatum) at a cutover peatland in Scotland, at three water tables. We measured changes in C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the litter and used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to investigate changes in fungal community composition. The C content of S. auriculatum litter did not change throughout the incubation period whereas vascular plant litters lost 30-40% of their initial C. There were no differences in C losses between low and medium water tables, but losses were always significantly less at the high water table. Most litters accumulated N and E. angustifolium accumulated significant quantities of P. C, N and P were significant explanatory variables in determining changes in fungal community composition but explained < 25% of the variation. Litter type was always a stronger factor than water table in determining either fungal community composition or turnover of C, N and P in litter. The results have implications for the ways restoration programmes and global climate change may impact upon nutrient cycling in cutover peatlands.

AB The primary aquifer on the Maputaland Coastal Plain in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is the principal source of water for rivers, lakes and most of the wetlands in dry periods, and is recharged by these systems in wet periods. Modelling hydrologic conditions that control regional water-table depth can provide insight into the spatial patterns of wetland occurrence and of the persistence of wet conditions that control their character. This project used a groundwater model (MODFLOW) to simulate 10-year water-table fluctuations on the Maputaland Coastal Plain from January 2000 to December 2010, to contrast the conditions between wet and dry years. Remote sensing imagery was used to map "permanent" and "temporary" wetlands in dry and wet years to evaluate the effectiveness of identifying the suitable conditions for their formation using numerical modelling techniques. The results confirm that topography plays an important role on a sub-regional and local level to support wetland formation. The wetlands' extent and distribution are directly associated with the spatial and temporal variations of the water table in relation to the topographical profile. Groundwater discharge zones in the lowland (1-50 masl) areas support more permanent wetlands with dominantly peat or high organic soil substrates, including swamp forest and most of the permanent open water areas. Most temporary wetlands associated with low-percentage clay occurrence are through-flow low-lying interdune systems characterised by regional fluctuation of the water table, while other temporary wetlands are perched or partially perched. The latter requires a more sophisticated saturated-unsaturated modelling approach.

AB Concentration of sulphate, delta S-34(SO42-), delta O-18(SO42-) and delta(18)(H2O) values, in surface waters and groundwaters from crystalline rocks in mountainous Rudawy Janowickie Massif (RJ) in SW Poland, have been analysed. The RJ is located close to the area of the biggest anthropogenic emission source of sulphur compounds in Europe called the "Black Triangle". The lowest concentration of sulphate ions dissolved in water (13 mg/l) were found in groundwaters at the highest altitude (750m asl). In the course of groundwater downward infiltration (hydraulic gradient) the concentration of sulphate ions increased with decreasing altitude. The highest concentrations of SO42- (100 mg/l in springs at metamorphic rocks and 60 mg/l in springs at granites) were observed at the foothills (altitudes 410 and 580 m asl, respectively). Likewise, the sulphur and oxygen isotope composition of sulphate ions showed systematic increasing trends with respect to the altitude decrease (from 3.45 to 11.05 parts per thousand and from -6.53 to 10.03 parts per thousand, respectively).
   Three main sources of sulphate for the surface-water/groundwater systems in RJ have been isotopically discriminated. The high delta S-34-delta O-18 sulphate showed waters from precipitation and peat bogs. The lower delta S-34-delta O-18 sulphate originated due to decomposition of organic matter. The lowest delta S-34-delta O-18 sulphates formed due to microbial (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) pyrite oxidation within the pyrite-deposit weathering zone. The highest contribution of anthropogenic sulphate have been observed at the top-hills and during low water levels at lower altitudes. The contribution of biogenic and geogenic sulphate relatively increased with the increasing distance (time?) of the water flow through rocks or/and increasing water level in springs.
   The isotope, hydrochemical and hydrogeological observations confirmed a negligible role of anthropogenic sulphur in the groundwaters analysed. This suggests significant improvement in the natural environment in the Western parts of Sudety Mountains.

AB Finnish rivers exported annually on average 1.2 M t carbon, and total organic carbon (TOC) comprised the major share (nearly 80 %) of this export. The mean area specific carbon export was 4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1). The highest organic carbon export originated from peat dominated catchments, whereas rivers draining agricultural catchments had the highest area-specific inorganic carbon fluxes. Between 1975 and 2014 total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations rose more steadily than the respective TOC concentrations. There was an overall decrease in TOC concentrations between 1975 and the mid-1990s. Decreased point source loading contributed to this pattern, although decreases were also detected in rivers without any major pollution sources. From the mid-1990s TOC concentrations started to rise and the increase was even more pronounced than the earlier decrease. The upward trend was ubiquitous, both in time and space, and it was not possible to link the changes to any specific catchment characteristics or another single driver. Warming climate, changes in hydrology and decreases in acidic deposition were the major driving factors although their contribution varied geographically. At the same time both TOC and TIC export increased slightly, but the strong upward trends in TOC concentrations were not reflected as clearly in TOC export trends. This was because changes in water flow had a dominant influence on TOC export to the sea and any changes in concentrations were masked behind the variation in flow.

AB The influence of riparian zone lithology on nitrate dynamics is poorly understood. We investigated vertical variations in potential denitrification activity in relation to the lithology and stratigraphy of five headwater riparian zones on glacial till and outwash landscapes in southern Ontario, Canada. Conductive coarse sand and gravel layers occurred in four of the five riparian areas. These layers were thin and did not extend to the field-riparian perimeter in some riparian zones, which limited their role as conduits for ground water flow. We found widespread organic-rich layers at depths ranging from 40 to 300 cm that resulted from natural floodplain processes and the burial of surface soils by rapid valley-bottom sedimentation after European settlement. The organic matter content of these layers varied considerably from 2 to 5% (relic channel deposit) to 5 to 21% (buried soils) and 30 to 62% (buried peat). Denitrification potential (DNP) was measured by the acetylene block method in sediment slurries amended with nitrate. The highest DNP rates were usually found in the top 0- to 15-cm surface soil layer in all riparian zones. However, a steep decline in DNP with depth was often absent and high DNP activity occurred in the deep organic-rich layers. Water table variations in 2000-2002 indicated that ground water only interacted frequently with riparian surface soils between late March and May, whereas subsurface organic layers that sustain considerable DNP were below the water table for most of the year. These results suggest that riparian zones with organic deposits at depth may effectively remove nitrate from ground water even when the water table does not interact with organic-rich surface soil horizons.

AB The Ore Mountains were one of the important flood source areas for several heavy floods over the last years. Reducing damages caused by floods demands sufficient information on the runoff generation processes in the catchments. The aim of this study is to provide insights into prevailing flow pathways, retention times and threshold behavior of a representative hillslope catchment with layered subsurface in the Ore Mountains. The study site is a forested headwater with gneiss as bedrock. We used hydrometrical methods, soil temperature data and sprinkler experiments. Results indicate that the hydraulic anisotropic structure of the deepest layer in 0.9-1.7 m depth is the major controlling factor for subsurface water flow paths. On one hand, this layer acts as an aquitard for seeping water because of its high bulk density. On the other hand, water within the layer is able to flow laterally because of the sandy texture and coarse clasts oriented parallel to the slope. Moreover, three pre-moisture controlled types of runoff processes were addressed. With low antecedent soil moisture, saturation overland flow dominates in the spring bog. With intermediate or high pre-moisture, interflow is generated. The measured runoff coefficients increase in a nonlinear manner with rising pre-moisture. A soil water tension threshold value near field capacity is the tipping point for nonlinear runoff response. These findings emphasize the impact of the layered structure of the subsurface and of antecedent soil moisture for runoff generation in low mountain ranges and may be useful for establishing flood warning systems.

AB The studies were conducted in a dry valley in NE Poland. They were aimed at determining the origin of this structure and tracing the processes that have shaped the dry valley in a time span of about 130 ka. The research included detailed geological mapping, including piercing of a number of boreholes and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys. The obtained material was pollen analysed, OSL dated, and the grain size distribution and the morphoscopy of sand quartz grains were investigated; additionally the organic matter (OM) content was determined. Based on the obtained results it was concluded that the structure currently occupied by sediments of the dry valley was formed during the Warta Stadial of the Odranian Glaciation (Saalian; MIS 6) as a glacial tunnel valley. Small, probably isolated depressions functioned in the dry valley bottom after the ice sheet retreat. The sediments record a full succession of climate oscillations from the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e) (pollen zones E1 to E7) through the Early Vistulian (MIS 5a-5d) to MIS 4. In the Early Vistulian, the depressions functioned as lakes, or got shallower and were replaced by peat-bogs, depending on the climate conditions. During MIS 4, the bottom of the dry valley was subjected to erosion as a result of concentrated water flow. This caused draining of the existing depressions and their incorporation within the flow. Probably during MIS 3, solifluction was activated on the slopes of the dry valley. During LGM, permafrost aggradation occurred in the study area, recorded by two generations of epigenetic sand wedges and development of aeolian processes. In contrast to analogous processes within the European Sand Belt, the latter processes acted for a short time and only locally. The final record are Holocene soils. It seems that the analysed valley is a good example of palaeoenvironmental conditions in Eastern Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between surface hydrometeorological variables and mid-tropospheric circulation was used to describe and model the synoptic controls on daily and monthly evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) measured above a peat bog near Ottawa, Ontario. The four most dominant modes of variability in daily 500 hPa geopotential height over eastern North America were defined by S-mode principal component analysis and subjected to K-means clustering in order to produce discrete patterns of 500 hPa height. A total of 10 clusters were retained, based on a compromise between the number of legitimate patterns defined in a separate manual classification scheme and the proportion of variance grouped between clusters (61%) by the K-means algorithm.
   Height patterns defined by the 10-cluster scheme exhibited differences in their control over bog ET. Pre-high anticyclonic conditions were most efficient at drying the bog, whereas conditions prior to and during the passage of cyclonic systems were the least efficient at drying the bog. The remaining seven clusters exhibited insignificant control over ET on a seasonal basis. Variability in heights directly over the study site, associated with the second principal component, exhibited the closest relationship with hydrometeorological fluxes at the bog surface. However, attempts to model daily ET based, first, on multiple linear regression using principal components and, second, on cluster analogues of ET produced unsatisfactory skill. The inability to forecast daily ET was attributed to the influence of non-linear variation in the rate at which mid-tropospheric circulation controls propagated down to the surface and also to unresolved hydrological controls at the bog surface. Days following rainfall frequently resulted in amplified ET, regardless of cluster type, indicating that the control of ET by antecedent moisture conditions was a limiting factor in downscaling ET from large-scale atmospheric predictors. On a monthly time scale, however, the circulation indices explained 64% and 45% of the variation in monthly ET and PET respectively. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB The function of peatlands as a large carbon (C) reservoir results from the net C uptake under cold, wet, and acid environments. However, in the context of global warming, the balance between C input and release is expected to change, which may further alter the C sink of peatlands. To examine the response to climate warming of a temperate Sphagnum peatland which has been invaded by vascular plants, a mesocosm experiment was conducted with open top chambers (OTCs) to simulate a moderate temperature increase. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and methane (CH4) emissions were monitored for 2 years. The CO2 and CH4 fluxes were modeled by relating to abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, water table depth (WTD), and vegetation, in order to calculate the annual C budget. Results showed that the annual cumulated GPP was significantly enhanced by the simulated warming (-602 compared to -501 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in OTC and control plots, respectively), mainly due to the increase of graminoid biomass by warming, while experimental warming had no significant effect on the annual ER and CH4 emissions (an output of 615 and 500 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for ER; 21 and 16 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 emissions in OTC and control plots, respectively). The annual NEE and C budget were not affected by the short-term experimental warming. The mesocosms under both treatments acted as a gaseous C source with 34 and 14 gC m(-2) yr(-1) output under OTC and control treatment, respectively. This C source was driven by the strong net carbon dioxide (CO2) release during a low WTD period in summer, as CH4 emissions only accounted for 0.9-2.2% of the total C fluxes. Our study identified the effect of moderate warming on the C fluxes, even on a short-term basis. Also, our findings highlighted that the response of C fluxes to warming largely depends on the WTD and vegetation composition. Thus, long-term monitoring of hydrology and vegetation change under climate warming is essential to examine their interactions in determining the C fluxes in peatlands.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SOLUTE TRANSPORT
AB The hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated peat soil is controlled by the air-filled porosity, pore size and geometric distribution as well as other physical properties of peat materials. This study investigates how the size and shape of pores affects the flow of water through peat soils. In this study we used X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), at 45 mu m resolution under 5 specific soil-water pressure head levels to provide 3-D, high-resolution images that were used to detect the inner pore structure of peat samples under a changing water regime. Pore structure and configuration were found to be irregular, which affected the rate of water transmission through peat soils. The 3-D analysis suggested that pore distribution is dominated by a single large pore-space. At low pressure head, this single large air-filled pore imparted a more effective flowpath compared to smaller pores. Smaller pores were disconnected and the flowpath was more tortuous than in the single large air-filled pore, and their contribution to flow was negligible when the single large pore was active. We quantify the pore structure of peat soil that affects the hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated condition, and demonstrate the validity of our estimation of peat unsaturated hydraulic conductivity by making a comparison with a standard permeameter-based method. Estimates of unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were made for the purpose of testing the sensitivity of pore shape and geometry parameters on the hydraulic properties of peats and how to evaluate the structure of the peat and its affects on parameterization. We also studied the ability to quantify these factors for different soil moisture contents in order to define how the factors controlling the shape coefficient vary with changes in soil water pressure head. The relation between measured and estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at various heads shows that rapid initial drainage, that changes the air-filled pore properties, creates a sharp decline in hydraulic conductivity. This is because the large pores readily lose water, the peat rapidly becomes less conductive and the flow path among pores, more tortuous.

AB Acid soil drainage is of major economic concern for the arable crop farmers and fishermen in midwestern Finland. Almost all the farmland in this region consist of acid sulfate soils developed on sulfide-bearing fine-grained marine and lacustrine sediments. During rain storms in autumn and snowmelt in spring these soils are flushed, resulting in low pH and high metal concentrations in affected watercourses. A study of 40 first- and second-order streams during the 1997 autumn high water flow event demonstrated that (1) the pH in peat/till dominated catchments is controlled by organic acids (pH > 4.5), while in streams draining acid sulfate soil pH is controlled by sulfuric acid (4.5 > pH > 3.0); (2) the delta(34)S((sulfate)) values with range of -16 to +7 parts per thousand VCDT show two populations with medians of -6.2 and +3.2 parts per thousand, the first is dominated by original sedimentary sulfide and the second is most likely related to secondary sulfide formation in the acid sulfate soils; (3) the concentrations of Al, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Na, Zn, and SO42- are considerably higher in streamwaters in the investigated area than in headwater streams from the whole country as a result of extensive leaching of the acid sulfate soils; and (4) As, Ba, Cr, Fe, Ph, Sb, and V concentrations are controlled by soil and water pH, dissolved organic matter, and suspended particles and are not like the other trace elements, significantly enriched in the streamwaters.

AB A peat core (10x10x100 cm) was removed from Etang de la Gruere, an ombrotrophic peat bog in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland. The core was sliced into 3 cm sections and the samples characterized with respect to ash content, bulk density, moisture content, and concentrations of C and H. Solid peat residues were freeze-dried, milled very finely and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Pore waters expressed from the peat slices were collected, filtered (0.2 mum membrane filters) and analyzed using fluorescence emission, excitation and synchronous-scan spectroscopy, in addition to pH. Taken together, the physical properties of the core and the ESR measurements of solid peats appear to record the variation in humification of refractory organic matter (peat). The fluorescence and FT-IR data, on the other hand, appear to characterize the extent of recent decomposition of labile organic matter. In fact, these data indicate the presence of two distinct zones in the bog: (i) the acrotelm, or zone of active decay, which may be oxygenated, depending on the season and the depth to the water table, and (ii) the catotelm which is always anoxic, and where organic matter decomposition rates are negligible.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the long term fluctuation in remains of Aegagropila linnaei associated with phytoplankton dynamics and sediment accumulation in Lake Takkobu, northern Japan. A. linnaei is a green alga requiring good light conditions (low phytoplankton production and a low density of fine sediment particles) for growth. Six lake sediment core samples were obtained, and lake sediment core samples contained two tephra layers as Ko-c2 (1694) and Ta-a (1739). Fresh tephra deposition is the source of phosphorus in the lake, and induces an increase in phytoplankton. For the period 1694-1739, low sediment accumulations and low phytoplankton productions were observed, and A. linnaei remains were low, likely due to nutrient deficiency. Ko-c2 tephra deposition had no detectable influence on phytoplankton and A. linnaei dynamics, as insufficient tephra was deposited to induce a nutrient deficiency. However, phytoplankton productivity was attributed to Ta-a tephra deposition, which was at a higher influx than that of Ko-c2, in addition to human activities, such as deforestation and agricultural development. A. linnaei remains in 1739-1898 were increased despite the enhanced phytoplankton productivity caused by Ta-a tephra deposition. This evidence indicates that a phytoplankton impact on the transparency from 1739-1898 was probably insignificant, but the released nutrient from Ta-a tephra acted as a stimulus to make the A. linnaei grow. Therefore, A. linnaei existence depends on interaction between light conditions and sediment accumulation as well as nutrient conditions. Human activities after 1898 have directly influenced increased phytoplankton productivity and sediment accumulation, and result in A. linnaei degraded. Moreover, A. linnaei remains mainly were concentrated in sediment from northern zone close to lake outflow because their spherical form and free floating filaments tend to be moved by water flow. In recent years, the distribution of A. linnaei in the lake was reduced due to the shading effect caused by the increase in phytoplankton production and the attenuation of sunlight by high sediment accumulation.

AB Melting seasonal ground ice (SGI) in western Boreal Plains (WBP) peatlands can reduce the available energy at the surface by reducing potential evapotranspiration (PET). PET often exceeds annual precipitation in the WBP. Including this effect in hydrological models may be important in assessing water deficits. However, SGI melt and the timing of ice-free conditions vary spatially, which suggests PET spatial variability could be influenced by SGI. Understanding this potential linkage can help improve site scale PET in peatland hydrological models. The objectives of this paper were (a) to quantify the effect of ice thickness and melt rate on peatland PET; (b) quantify the spatial variability of SGI thickness and melt rate across spatial scales; and (c) assess how/if spatial variability in SGI thickness/melt rate affects site scale PET. Results from the sensitivity analysis indicated that SGI thickness had a bigger impact on reducing PET compared with the melt rate. Two SGI thickness values were used that were observed on site: 0.32 m, which was measured in a more treed area, and 0.18 m, which was in a more open area. The 0.32 m had an average PET reduction of 14 mm (+/- 0.7), over the month of May, compared with 9 mm (+/- 1 mm) when there was 0.18 m of SGI, which are 13.7 and 8.8% reductions, respectively. SGI thickness and melt rate, both exhibited large- and small-scale spatial variability. At the large scale, spatial patterns in SGI thickness appeared to be influenced by extensive shading from the adjacent hillslopes. Small scale, SGI thickness may be a function of tree proximity and the snowpack. Finally, net radiation, rather than SGI, appeared to be the main driver behind PET spatial variability. This work enhances our conceptual understanding of the role of SGI in WBP peatlands. Future work can use the findings to better inform peatland hydrological models, allowing for better representation of peatlands in regional-scale models.

AB Stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating and analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils and testate amoebae were used to reconstruct the development and ecology of a small raised bog in a karst-dominated landscape in the Swiss Jura Mountains. Special focus was on past vegetation and on the history of Pinus rotundata in relation to anthropogenic and climatic influences. Testate amoebae were used to reconstruct past local soil pH and water-table depth. The inferred development of the Praz-Rodet bog typifies a classic hydroseral terrestrialization of a small basin. Two features are specific for this site. First, the bog was much wetter than today for a long period; according to our hypothesis, this only changed as a consequence of human activities. Second, two hiatuses are present at the coring location (Younger Dryas-early Preboreal, and 4700-2800 cal. yr BP), the former probably caused by low lake productivity due to cold temperatures and the latter by the erosional activity of the adjacent small river. The date of 2800 cal. yr BP for renewed peat accumulation may be related to climatic change (Subboreal-Subatlantic transition). Pollen indicators failed to show one hiatus: an apparently complete pollen sequence is therefore no guarantee of an uninterrupted sediment accumulation. Evidence of early minor human impact on the vegetation in the Joux Valley dates back to c. 6850 calendar years, congruous with the early Neolithic in the Jura Mountains. The history of Pious rotundata appears to be more complex than previously believed. Human activity is clearly responsible for the present abundance of this species, but the tree was naturally present on the bog long before the first evidence of important human disturbance of the site (1500 cal. yr BP). It is suggested that, in karst-dominated landscapes, dense forests growing on mineral soils around raised bogs may significantly reduce summer evapotranspiration by acting as windbreaks. Forest clearance results in increased evapotranspiration, causing a lowering of the water table on the bog and a modification of the vegetation cover. This hypothesis has implications for the management of similar small raised bogs in karst-dominated landscape.

AB We present a decadal (1994-2004) record of carbon dioxide flux in a 160-year-old black spruce forest/veneer bog complex in central Manitoba, Canada. The ecosystem shifted from a source (+41 g C m(-2), 1995) to a sink (-21 g C m(-2), 2004) of CO2 over the decade, with an average net carbon balance near zero. Annual mean temperatures increased 1-2 degrees during the period, consistent with the decadal trend across the North American boreal biome. We found that ecosystem carbon exchange responded strongly to air temperature, moisture status, potential evapotranspiration, and summertime solar radiation. The seasonal cycle of ecosystem respiration significantly lagged that of photosynthesis, limited by the rate of soil thaw and the slow drainage of the soil column. Factors acting over long time scales, especially water table depth, strongly influenced the carbon budget on annual time scales. Net uptake was enhanced and respiration inhibited by multiple years of rainfall in excess of evaporative demand. Contrary to expectations, we observed no correlation between longer growing seasons and net uptake, possibly because of offsetting increases in ecosystem respiration. The results indicate that the interactions between soil thaw and water table depth provide critical controls on carbon exchange in boreal forests underlain by peat, on seasonal to decadal time scales, and these factors must be simulated in terrestrial biosphere models to predict response of these regions to future climate.

AB Inorganic phosphates (ferric phosphate, calcium phosphate and aluminium phosphate) and organic forms of phosphorus (inositol hexaphosphate and beta-glycerophosphate) were tested as phosphorus (P) sources for the growth of three Carer species from fens differing in productivity and nutrient availability. Aluminium phosphate and beta-glycerophosphate were equally effective sources of P for all three Carer species as KH2PO4, which was used as a control treatment. Phosphorus from ferric phosphate and calcium phosphate was also taken up by Carer acutiformis Ehrh., a species of high productivity from eutrophic fen areas, but not by the other two species. Only Carer lasiocarpa Ehrh., a species from P-limited fens, showed a higher P-uptake when grown with inositol phosphate than in the second control treatment without P. The P-source also affected, with differences between species, the biomass allocation to the below-ground plant parts and the area of absorption surface of the roots.
   The mobilization of organic sources of P by fen Carer species found in the present study might be an important factor in the P dynamics of fens because of the high contents of organic P in the fen peat soils where these species grow. In the same way, the utilization of inorganic sources of P can play a relevant role in the P-cycle in these systems where the discharge of ground water rich in ions can lead to the fixation of P into inorganic compounds. However, the differing abilities of the various Carer species to mobilize P from P-pools does not explain clearly their preferential presence in different fens in relation to the P-availability.

AB The spatial and temporal variability of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and evapotranspiration (ET) of a karst-hole sphagnum peat mire situated at the boundary between broad-leaved and forest-steppe zones in the central part of European Russia in the Tula region was described using results from field measurements. NEE and ET were measured using a portable measuring system consisting of a transparent ventilated chamber combined with an infrared CO2/H2O analyzer, LI-840A (Li-Cor, USA) along a transect from the southern peripheral part of the mire to its center under sunny clear-sky weather conditions in the period from May to September of 2012 and in May 2013. The results of the field measurements showed significant spatial and temporal variability of NEE and ET that was mainly influenced by incoming solar radiation and ground water level. The seasonal patterns of NEE and ET within the mire were quite different. During the entire growing season the central part of the mire was a sink of CO2 for the atmosphere. NEE reached maximal values in June-July (-6.8 +/- 4.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The southern peripheral part of the mire, due to strong shading by the surrounding forest, was a sink of CO2 for the atmosphere in June-July only. ET reached maximal values in the well-lighted central parts of the mire in May (0.34 +/- 0.20 mm h(-1)) mainly because of high air and surface temperatures and the very wet upper peat horizon and sphagnum moss. Herbaceous species made the maximum contribution to the total gross primary production (GPP) in both the central and the peripheral parts of the mire. The contribution of sphagnum to the total GPP of these plant communities was relatively small and ranged on sunny days of July-August from -1.1 +/- 1.1 mgC g(-1) of dry weight (DW) per hour in the peripheral zone of the mire to -0.6 +/- 0.2 mgC g(-1) DW h(-1) at the mire center. The sphagnum layer made the maximum contribution to total ET at the mire center (0.25 +/- 0.10 mm h(-1)) and the herbaceous species on the peripheral part of the mire (0.0 3 +/- 0.03 mm h(-1)).

AB Dye tracers provide a direct means in which to visualise flow paths and interpret active wetting mechanisms in soil. Until recently it had been assumed that rewetting in milled peat took place by surface wetting front advance, but recent laboratory and field evidence has indicated that by-pass flow readily occurs. In order to investigate the mechanisms of rewetting in milled peat, a laboratory-based morphological assessment of selected milled peats was conducted using a dye tracer to examine flow paths at different water contents. The outflow/inflow ratio from specially prepared columns was recorded and thin sections of samples from selected depths produced. The staining process in peat was found to be different from that documented for mineral soil because staining of the internal peat fabric as opposed to pore/particle interfaces typically took place. This prevented accurate digital image analysis, hence point counting techniques were used to provide quantitative measures of staining. By-pass flow was identified in all milled peat types and a relationship between initial water content and percent stain was identified, although the nature of by-pass was found to be unpredictable. Pore shapes and milled peat components associated with staining were also documented.

TI Erodibility of hill peat
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE peat erodibility; sedimentology; sustainable farming
AB The energy necessary to entrain soil in water depends on the soil strength. Once entrained, the settling velocity of the eroded soil in water is of fundamental importance to the processes of sediment transport and deposition. In this paper, stream power theory and transport concepts coupled with the equation of continuity were used to derive a transport-limited peat concentration. The ratio of the log of the actual sediment concentration in surface run-off to the log of the transport-limited sediment concentration was the index of erosion used. The value of this index is a measure of the sensitivity of peat to erosion by sheet flow. Four peats were subjected to a range of overland flow rates under two slopes in a laboratory flume. The peats represented peat farmed in a sustainable manner (Leenane), overgrazed peat (Maam), peat undergoing erosion (Newport) and peat which had undergone weathering following exposure by a landslip (Croagh Patrick). Both in situ and surface damaged slabs were studied. The results indicate that shearing and remoulding of a wet peat surface (e.g., by animal treading) and weathering of exposed drained peat surfaces predispose peat to erosion. Defoliation by overgrazing is considered to be of secondary importance.

TI Modeling water table fluctuations by means of a stochastic differential
   equation
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL; BALANCE; SERIES
AB The combined system of soil-water and shallow groundwater is modeled with simple mass balance equations assuming equilibrium soil moisture conditions. This results in an ordinary but nonlinear differential equation of water table depth at a single location. If errors in model inputs, errors due to model assumptions and parameter uncertainty are lumped and modeled as a wide band noise process, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) results. A solution for the stationary probability density function is given through use of the Fokker-Planck equation. For the nonstationary case, where the model inputs are given as daily time series, sample functions of water table depth, soil saturation, and drainage discharge can be simulated by numerically solving the SDE. These sample functions can be used for designing drainage systems and to perform risk analyses. The parameters and noise statistics of the SDE are calibrated on time series of water table depths by embedding the SDE in a Kalman filter algorithm and using the filter innovations in a filter-type maximum likelihood criterion. The stochastic model is calibrated and validated at two locations: a peat soil with a very shallow water table and a loamy sand soil with a moderately shallow water table. It is shown in both cases that sample functions simulated with the SDE are able to reproduce a wide range of statistics of water table depth. Despite its unrealistic assumption of constant inputs, the stationary solution derived from the Fokker-Planck equation gives good results for the peat soil, most likely because the characteristic response time of the water table is very small.

AB Understanding the controls on soil respiration (SR) and litter decomposition (LD) rates within saline boreal fens can help in the development of wetland reclamation approaches in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), where post-mined landscapes are commonly salt-affected. This study assesses the rates of SR and LD within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) and their relationship with electrical conductivity (EC), water table depth (WTD), soil moisture (SM) and temperature (ST), and nutrient availability. SR was assessed using community-scale CO2 measurements, and LD was estimated using the litter bag technique along a salinity gradient (EC 2-55 mS cm(-1)). Significant differences in SR between slightly saline, moderately saline, strongly saline, and very strongly saline sites were observed, and ridge sites had significantly higher SR than depressions. SR was strongly positively correlated to ST and strongly negatively correlated to WTD (i.e., shallower water table - lower SR and LD) and SM within both ridges and depressions. Ridges had significantly higher mean LD rates than depressions, and significant differences in LD rates along a salinity gradient were found. Our data suggest that although SR and LD are lower under very strongly saline conditions (EC > 16 mS cm(-1)), they are mainly driven by WTD and SM. This study reveals the importance of maintaining high and stable water table to decrease decomposition and promote accumulation of organic matter. These attributes could be targeted for constructed peatlands, which are currently being tested in the AOSR.

AB This study illustrates the influences of sea-level on the depositional process during the last 1000 years of the southwestern delta, Bangladesh. Sediments of eight litho-sections from landward in upper delta plain to seaward in lower delta plain along the Rupsa-Pasur river were studied. Sedimentary facies, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, delta C-13 value, diatom assemblages, and radiocarbon dating of deposits were carried out to determine the paleoenvironments that were influenced by the relative sea-level (RSL) change over time. During the 850-1300 AD, RSL was reached up to +80 cm higher than the present level where tidal-influenced bioturbated light yellow to gray mud deposited in the upper delta plain area. RSL was dropped up to -110 cm during 1300-1850 AD, organic-rich bluish-gray mud, mangrove peat, and terrestrial influenced yellowish-gray mud were deposited successively in the lower delta plain area, and the terrace was formed at landward due to the lowering of the base level. RSL started to rise after the period 1850 AD where tidal-influenced sediments gradually increased and deposited in the upper part at seaward and terrestrial flood sediment deposited over the erosional surface at the landward part. The estimated average sedimentation rate (1.96-2.89 mm/year) is not enough to offset the effect of subsidence and present sea-level rise over the study area. The rising trend of the sea creates inundation in the lower delta plain area, also hinders upstream water flow. For that, terrestrial flood sediments settle over the erosional surface in landward, and tidal-influenced sediment gradually onlap upon it from seaward.

AB Peatland surface motion is a key property of peatland that relates to condition. However, field-based techniques to measure surface motion are not cost-effective over large areas and long time periods. An alternative method that can quantify peatland surface motion over large areas is interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Although field validation of the accuracy of this method is difficult, the value of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) as a means of quantifying peat condition can be tested. To achieve this, the characteristics of InSAR time series measured over an 18-month period at 22 peatland sites in the Flow Country northern Scotland were compared to site condition assessment based on plant functional type and site management history. Sites in good condition dominated by Sphagnum display long-term stability or growth and a seasonal cycle with maximum uplift and subsidence in August-November and April-June, respectively. Drier and partially drained sites dominated by shrubs display long-term subsidence with maximum uplift and subsidence in July-October and February-June, respectively. Heavily degraded sites with large bare peat extent display subsidence with no distinct seasonal oscillations. Seasonal oscillation in surface motion at sites with a dominant nonvascular plant community is interpreted as resulting from changes in seasonal evaporative demand. On sites with extensive vascular plants cover and falling water table, surface oscillations are interpreted as representing sustained drawdown during the growing season and subsequent recharge in late winter. This study highlights the potential to use InSAR to characterize peatland condition and provide a new view of the surface dynamics of peatland landscapes.

AB QuestionWhat is the role of wind in the dispersal of waterborne seeds in slow-flowing and stagnant water bodies at different temporal and spatial scales? (i) Is there a direct effect of wind on seed dispersal speed and distance? (ii) Are prevailing wind conditions reflected in the seed deposition patterns during a year? (iii) What are the long-term (multiple year) effects of prevailing wind conditions on the pattern and composition of shoreline seed banks?
   LocationThe Westbroekse Zodden (5210N; 507E) and De Weerribben (52 degrees 46N; 5 degrees 55E) fen reserves in The Netherlands.
   MethodsReal-time seed movement tracking experiments were conducted at different wind speeds. Additionally, we performed a seed trap experiment using artificial grass mats and carried out seed bank analyses using a seedling emergence test.
   ResultsWind speed and direction strongly determined the dispersal process and the resulting deposition patterns of floating seeds in shallow lakes or ponds. Wind speed directly influenced dispersal speed and distance. Increasing wind speed increased dispersal speed but decreased dispersal distance. Over multiple seasons, more seeds were deposited at downwind shorelines than at upwind shorelines, showing that wind-driven hydrochory resulted in directional transport according to the prevailing wind direction. The species composition of deposited seeds was also affected, with proportionally more water-dispersed seeds being deposited at down-wind shorelines. These effects of wind speed and directionality will have consequences for the colonization of riparian zones in lentic systems and, therefore, also influence management and restoration. In the long term, local seed banks in riparian zones reflected the prevailing wind conditions poorly, showing that additional processes, such as differential germination and predation, also play important roles at longer time scales.
   ConclusionsWind plays an important role in the dispersal of waterborne seeds in lentic systems and (prevailing) wind speed and direction are reflected in seed dispersal trajectories and deposition patterns.

AB High-altitude peatlands in the Andes, i.e., bofedales, play an essential role in alpine ecosystems, regulating the local water balance and supporting biodiversity. This is particularly true in semiarid Chile, where bofedales develop near the altitudinal and hydrological limits of plant life. The subterranean geometry and stratigraphy of one peatland was characterized in north-central Chile using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and core extraction. Two sounding locations, two transversal and one longitudinal profile allowed a 3D interpretation of the bofedal's internal structure. A conceptual model of the current bofedal system is proposed. Geophysical results combined with porosity measurements were used to estimate the bofedal water storage capacity. Using hydrological data at the watershed scale, implications regarding the hydrological role of bofedales in the semiarid Andes were then briefly assessed. At the catchment scale, bofedal water storage capacity, evapotranspiration losses and annual streamflow are on the same order of magnitude. High-altitude peatlands are therefore storing a significant amount of water and their impact on basin hydrology should be investigated further.

AB Peatland palaeoclimate sequences produce bog surface wetness (BSW) reconstructions which are commonly interpreted as changes in summer effective precipitation, i.e. the net balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, the latter being mainly governed by temperature. The relative roles of precipitation and temperature have been investigated previously, although over centennial and millennial timescales no conclusive relationships have as yet been established, but it has been suggested that summer temperature may play the dominant role. We aimed to test this by comparing a late-Holocene peat-based palacoclimate record from Walton Moss, northern England, with a chironomid-inferred temperature (CI-T) reconstruction from a nearby lake, Talkin Tarn. Both records showed significant changes in inferred climate over the last 3000 years with lower temperatures corresponding to increases in BSW. The CI-T reconstruction, which covered the last 6000 years, was also compared to a longer BSW record, again from Walton Moss, and the same relationships were observed. Our evidence therefore suggests that over centennial timescales summer temperatures are important drivers of the peat-based palaeoclimate record. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forestry is the largest scale human impact affecting catchments in Finland and a prominent source of diffuse pollution in many water courses. Among the forestry activities, draining of wetlands had the most pronounced impacts on sediment, nutrient, and metal loading in the past. At present, renovation of old ditches and fertilization of peatlands constitute the major risk of forestry-induced diffuse pollution. Contemporary forestry aims at decreasing this risk with various riparian buffer strip designs. Among such designs, creation of overland flow areas by plugging the outlet ditches is increasingly used. Our objectives were to evaluate the potential of constructed overland flow areas to function as riparian buffers and estimate the quality and quantity of diffuse pollution from old versus recent forest drainages. We studied retention and release of pollutants from 20 constructed, 2- to 10-m-wide overland flow areas receiving drainage water from forested peatlands. Drainage waters were sampled above and below the plugged ditches three times per year from 1998 to 1999. Chemical oxygen demand and nutrient and metal loads and concentrations varied strongly between seasons, years, and drainage areas. Areas subjected to recent ditch renovations and fertilizations had clearly elevated seasonal loads and concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), PO4, Fe, and A in comparison to old treatment areas. Especially TP loads were high above the national average values measured for forestry-induced diffuse pollution. In general, water quality above and below the buffer strips did not differ significantly. Our results indicate that plugged outlet ditches and associated narrow overland flow areas do not function as proper buffers in peatland areas. We suggest that wider buffers with extensive overland flow areas are needed in order to control diffuse pollution from forested and drained peatlands.

TI Modelling the effect of aggregates on N2O emission from denitrification

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are highly variable in time, with high peak emissions lasting a few days to several weeks and low background emissions. This temporal variability is poorly understood which hampers the simulation of daily N2O emissions. In structured soils, like clay and peat, aggregates hamper the diffusion of oxygen, which leads to anaerobic microsites in the soil, favourable for denitrification. Diffusion of N2O out of the aggregates is also hampered, which leads to delayed emissions and increased reduction of N2O to N-2. In this model simulation study we investigate the effect of aggregates in soils on the N2O emissions. We present a parameterization to simulate the effects of aggregates on N2O production by denitrification and on N2O reduction. The parameterization is based on the mobile-immobile model concept. It was implemented in a field-scale hydrological-biogeochemical model combination. We compared the simulated fluxes with observed fluxes from a fertilized and drained peat soil under grass.
   The results of this study show that aggregates strongly affect the simulated N2O emissions: peak emissions are lower, whereas the background emissions are slightly higher. Including the effect of aggregates caused a 40% decrease in the simulated annual emissions relative to the simulations without accounting for the effects of aggregates. The new parameterization significantly improved the model performance regarding simulation of observed daily N2O fluxes; r(2) and RMSE improved from 0.11 and 198 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) to 0.41 and 40 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Our analyses of the model results show that aggregates have a larger impact on the reduction than on the production of N2O. Reduction of N2O is more sensitive to changes in the drivers than production of N2O and is in that sense the key to understanding N2O emissions from denitrification. The effects of changing environmental conditions on reduction of N2O relative to N2O production strongly depend on the NO3 content of the soil. More anaerobic conditions have hardly any effect on the ratio of production to reduction if NO3 is abundant, but will decrease this ratio if NO3 is limiting. In the first case the emissions will increase, whereas in the second case the emissions will decrease. This study suggests that the current knowledge of the hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes may be sufficient to understand the observed N2O fluxes from a fertilized clayey peatland. Further research is needed to test how aggregates affect the N2O fluxes from other soils or soils with different fertilization regimes.

AB The English polymath Lewis Fry Richardson (1881-1953) made important contributions to many fields, including numerical weather prediction, finite difference solutions of partial differential equations, turbulent flow and diffusion, fractals, and the cause and evolution of conflicts. His first papers in 1908 concerned unconfined flow of water in saturated soil, arising in the design of required ditch spacing for draining peat. He developed and used a graphical method to solve this problem. This and other practical problems stimulated his interest in numerical methods and soon led him to the challenge of numerical weather prediction. In 1922 he published the book Weather Prediction by Numerical Process. He did the research for this book under difficult circumstances just before, during, and right after World War I. The book was received positively, but methods like those proposed in it were not successfully implemented until the invention of fast digital computers around 1950. Posthumously, most of Richardson's contributions in various fields received considerable attention. Important exceptions are his contributions to soil science and hydrology, on which we focus in this paper. In his 1922 book, Richardson formulated an elaborate model for transport processes in the atmosphere. For the lower boundary of his atmospheric model, he needed to understand the movement of liquid water, water vapor, and heat in the upper layer of the soil, and at the soil-atmosphere and plant-atmosphere interfaces. Finding little previous work on this, he first of all formulated the partial differential equation for transient, vertical flow of liquid water in soil. We argue that the resulting equation can rightly be called the Richardson-Richards equation. In addition he formulated equations for simultaneous transfer of liquid water and water vapor, for transfer of heat in soil, and for the balances of water and energy at the soil-atmosphere and plant-atmosphere interfaces. Finite difference versions of all the equations were incorporated in the numerical weather forecasting model. Unfortunately, his results were hardly noticed by soil physicists and hydrologists, likely because they were too effectively buried in an intimidating book on weather prediction.

AB Soil hydraulic properties of drained and cultivated fen soils vary considerably due to structural and physical alteration in the long-term. Although hydrological modelling is a key method to determine soil water conditions for a large number of aims, for instance the utilization of fen soils, general estimators of water retention that reflect the progressive nature of fen soil alteration are rare. Based on 405 horizons from 30 fen soil profiles at 12 different peatland sites in Germany soil hydraulic properties were estimated. Water retention and bulk density measurements were conducted fivefold per each horizon mapped after the German Soil Taxonomy. Considering the varying phases of moorsh-forming process, bulk densities and water retention data were clustered according to horizon category by applying the k-means method. This approach reduced the range of water contents measured at considered pressure heads (pF) and recommended their subdivision into three groups of graduated bulk density (high, moderate, low) per each horizon category. This subdivision resulted in 18 separated data sets for parameterisation of the selected van Genuchten model using the RETC software. Estimated water content at saturation ranged between 0.68 and 0.90 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 and 0.35 cm(3) cm(-3) at a pF-value of 4.2. Shape parameter a varied stronger than n, especially for the strongly altered fen soil horizons. The continuing alteration of the moorshifled, earthified, aggregated, and shrunken fen soil horizons classified by increasing bulk density levels was reflected by the estimated van Genuchten parameters. For horizons inventoried as unchanged peat substrates, less variability of bulk densities in combination with deviating van Genuchten parameters indicated the influence of additional factors on soil hydraulic properties.

AB In this study, we compared new testate amoeba records produced by the conventional water-based wet-sieving method to testate amoeba data from previous palynological analyses of two Holocene peat profiles from British Columbia, Canada. We used 132 paired samples from the same peat cores to compare the composition of testate amoeba assemblages between the two methods and evaluate the potential of palynological testate amoeba records as quantitative paleohydrological proxies in peatlands. Our results suggest that the palynological treatments (acetolysis, 10% KOH and 150 mu m sieving) substantially reduce test concentrations, diversity and richness in most pollen-slide samples. The smaller sieve size used in the palynological treatment (i.e. 150 mu m) removed only a small fraction of the total tests, but could introduce a species-specific bias in assemblage composition. However, major shifts between wet and dry conditions, as shown by the water table depth (WTD) reconstructions using wet-sieved samples, were relatively well captured by the palynological datasets in most instances. The palynological assemblages with counts of >50 tests (n = 30) provided WTD estimates similar to those inferred from the wet-sieved samples as the most dominant hydrophilous and xerophilous taxa were relatively well represented in the pollen-slide samples in the two studied peat cores. Testate amoeba data from pollen slides can provide useful paleohydrological information particularly when combined with other paleoenvironmental proxies. Nonetheless, if the goal is to generate quantitative paleohydrological reconstructions, we recommend that testate amoeba analyses be conducted using the wet-sieving method, as testate amoeba concentrations, diversity and richness are typically much lower in samples prepared with palynological treatments.

AB Denitrification as a sink of dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) was investigated in a freshwater riparian fen. In a 15-m transect extending from the hillslope and into the fen the groundwater concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) declined from 1.8 mM NO3- (25 mg N L-1) to less than 0.01 mM NO3-, dissolved oxygen (O-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) declined from approximately 110 mu M O-2 (3.5 mg O-2 L-1) and 4.0 mu M N2O-N (56 mu g N L-1), respectively, to zero and the dissolved Nt concentration increased by 589 mu M N-2-N (8.2 mg N L-1). The NO3- reduction was 0.42 mu M cm(-3) d(-1) or 7.71 mu M cm(-2) d(-1) in sediment columns with continuous upward groundwater flow through the sediment. Concomitant with NO3- reduction, N2O was produced at a rate of 5.4.4 nM N2O-N cm(-2) d-(1) in this same 18-cm narrow sediment zone. However, the N2O produced was subsequently reduced at the same rate closer to the sediment surface. In (NO3-)-N-15 experiments on chloramphenicol-treated anaerobic sediment slurries, the denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) was estimated to be 118 +/- 16.7 nmol N (N-2-N + N2O-N) g fresh weight(-1) d(-1), of which 36% accumulated as N2O. Thus, in this permanently water-covered riparian fen, denitrification served as a sink for both the dissolved N2O in groundwater recharging the ten and the N2O produced within the riparian sediment.

AB Bogs can store large amounts of lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) from atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic emissions. Pb and As are exported along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from these organic-rich systems, but it is not yet clear which hydrological (pre) conditions favor their export. This study combines a 1-year monitoring of precipitation, bog water level and pore water concentration changes with bog discharge and DOC, iron, As and Pb stream concentrations. From these data, annual DOC, As, and Pb exports were calculated. Concentrations ranged from 5 to 30 mg L-1 for DOC, 0.2 to 1.9 mu g L-1 for As, and 1.3 to 12 mu g L-1 for Pb, with highest concentrations in late summer. As and Pb concentrations significantly correlated with DOC concentrations. Fluxes depended strongly on discharge, as 40% of As and 43% of Pb were exported during 10% of the time with the highest discharge, pointing out the over-proportional contribution of short-time, high-discharge events to annual As, Pb and DOC export. Exponential increase in element export from the bog is explained by connection of additional DOC, As and Pb pools in the acrotelm during water table rise, which is most pronounced after drought. Pb, As and DOC concentrations in pore water provide evidence of an increase in the soluble Pb pool as soon as the peat layer becomes hydrologically connected, while DOC and As peak concentrations in runoff lag behind in comparison to Pb. Our data indicate a distinct bog-specific discharge threshold of 8 L s(-1), which is thought to depend mainly on the bogs size and drainage conditions. Above this threshold, element concentrations do not further increase and discharge becomes diluted. Combining pore water and discharge data shows that As and Pb exports are dependent on not only the amount of precipitation and discharge but also on the frequency and depth of water table fluctuations. Comparing the annual bog As and Pb export with element inventories indicates that As is much more mobilized than Pb, with annual fluxes accounting for 0.85 and 0.27% of total As and Pb inventory, respectively.

   In order to achieve a safe mine operation and allow extraction of lignite to considerable depths, extensive dewatering by pumping will be necessary, while at the same time it is desirable to avoid presence of overpumping conditions in the broader area. Based on stratigrafic, hydrologic and hydrogeologic data, a three-dimensional finite difference model was developed in order to simulate the dewatering process of the western part of the lignite open-cast mine in Drama and to predict both spatially and temporally the decline of ground water level down to the lignite surface. The dewatering of the part of the aquifer which underlies the mine area will influence the hydrological conditions of the broader region. The most important anticipated effects will be the abandonment of shallow wells as well as the decrease of ground water pumping rates of deep wells. Aquifer discharge towards the ditches of the study area will cease and there will be an inversion of ground water flow from the ditches towards the underlying aquifer. Dewatering activities will probably result in minor subsidence of the nearby peat deposits of Drama Philippi marshes. Moreover, sand pumping as well as the presence of gasses is likely to cause local subsidence phenomena, mainly in the pit slopes. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Predicted changes to the precipitation regime in many parts of the world include intensifying the distribution into lower frequency, large magnitude events. The corresponding alterations to the soil moisture regime may affect plant growth and soil respiration, particularly in peatlands, where large stores of organic carbon are due to gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exceeding ecosystem respiration (ER). This study uses lab monoliths corroborated with field measurements to examine the effect of changing rainfall frequency on peatland moisture controls on CO2 uptake in an undisturbed cool temperate poor fen. Lab monoliths and field plots containing mosses, sedges, or shrubs received either 2.3, 1, or 0.5 precipitation events per week, with total rainfall held constant. Decreasing rain frequency led to lower near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC), water table (WT), and soil tension for all vegetation types, with minimal effect on evapotranspiration. The presence of sedges in particular led to soil tensions of >= 100 cm of water for a sizeable duration (37 %) of the experiment. Altered rainfall frequencies affected GEP but had little effect on ER; overall, low-frequency rain led to a reduced net CO2 uptake for all three vegetation types. VMC had a strong control on GEP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the Sphagnum capillifolium monoliths, and decreasing rainfall frequency influenced these relationships. Overall, communities dominated by mosses became net sources of CO2 after 3 days without rain, whereas sedge communities remained net sinks for up to 14 days without rain. The results of this study demonstrate the hydrological controls of peatland CO2 exchange dynamics influenced by changing precipitation frequency; furthermore, they suggest these predicted changes in frequency will lead to increased sedge GEP but limit the carbon-sink function of peatlands.

AB The aim of this study is to estimate wintertime emissions of greenhouse gases CO2, N2O and CH(4)in two abandoned peat extraction areas (APEA), Ess-soo and Laiuse, and in two Oxalis site-type drained peatland forests (DPF) on nitrogen-rich sapric histosol, a Norway spruce and a Downy birch forest, located in eastern Estonia. According to the long-term study using a closed chamber method, the APEAs emitted less CO(2)and N2O, and more CH(4)than the DPFs. Across the study sites, CO(2)flux correlated positively with soil, ground and air temperatures. Continuous snow depth > 5 cm did not influence CO2, but at no snow or a thin snow layer the fluxes varied on a large scale (from -1.1 to 106 mg C m(-2)h(-1)). In all sites, the highest N2O fluxes were observed at a water table depth of -30 to -40 cm. CH(4)was consumed in the DPFs and was always emitted from the APEAs, whereas the highest flux appeared at a water table >20 cm above the surface. Considering the global warming potential (GWP) of the greenhouse gas emissions from the DPFs in the wintertime, the flux of N2O was the main component of warming, showing 3-6 times higher radiative forcing values than that of CO(2)flux, while the role of CH(4)was unimportant. In the APEAs, CO(2)and CH(4)made up almost equal parts, whereas the impact of N2O on GWP was minor.

AB The present study is a complement to the research investigating a laboratory method for measuring the saturated hydraulic conductivity of mountain forest soils, the results of which were presented in a paper by Ilek and Kucza (2014). The aim of the study is to analyse the influence of variation of particular cross sections of samples and their enlarged side surface on the hydraulic conductivity measurement. The results show that a narrowing in the upper section of the sample results in an approximately twice lower disturbance of the laminar water flow than the narrowing occurring inside the sample. For that reason, the extent of the effect of the cross-section narrowing on the hydraulic conductivity measurement error is dependent on the location of the narrowing. An enlarged side surface of a sample; as described by the coefficient of side surface development, is on average 30% larger than the surface of a sample having the same volume and the same average cross-sectional area but a regular shape. The values of the coefficient of side surface development for a given sample were adopted in the range of 1.10-1.56. Among the shape parameters of the analysed irregular soil samples, the greatest impact on the measurement error is exerted by their enlarged lateral surface, which almost entirely explains the whole error of hydraulic conductivity measurement. The variability of successive cross-sectional areas of samples appears to be of marginal importance for the occurrence of this error, whose mean value was 1.15%. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB As result of a detailed mapping work, the soil association of different geornorpholocical units of a younger-moraine area ("Stormarner Jungmordnengebiet") in Schleswig-Holstein (NW Germany) is analyzed taking into account soil development in vertical and horizontal direction. The consequences for classification of soil types and soil associations are discussed. We distinguished between different patterns of matter fluxes (unilateral coupling, mutual coupling, no coupling of soils). By morphometric analysis of the relief, five geomorpholocical units were distinguished: till-plains with dead-ice kettles (1), tongue-like basin with moraine slopes (11), terminal-push moraine (111), moraine slopes with gutter valley (IV), und terminal-push moraine valley with steep slopes (V). In the examination area with its intense agricultural land use, the regular sequence of erosion and accumulation of soils is a typical consequence of unilateral water-flow direction. Thus, the truncated Stagnic Luvisols/Anthrosols association is dominating. We suggest to classify the truncated Luvisol with a Bt horizon exposed directly to the surface at the level of soil subtypes in the German soil-classification system. Additionally soils in depressions such as Calcic Gleysols, Histosols and "subhydric soils", which are influenced by solute and solid-matter input, are frequently encountered. Within the till-plains, a compensation of the relief by (historical) soil erosion took place, recognizable by the high percentage of Anthrosols (20%). Therefore, no recent lateral transport of solid material can be found. The steep moraine slopes partly already show Regosols, thus indicating a high erosion potential (erosion rate for geornorphical unit IV: 13 t ha(-1) y(-1)). In the depressions intersected with small streams, the afflux caused by mills led to an additional peat development.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) were measured at open and treed portions of a temperate ombrotrophic bog using the eddy covariance technique to examine the potential influence of plant community characteristics on peatland carbon and water vapour exchange. The sites were located 2.7 km from each other within the same peatland complex and thus experienced similar weather. Both sites were characterized by a Sphagnum ground cover and a shrub layer with similar total biomass. However, at the treed bog, 35% of this understory vascular plant layer was made up of Picea mariana (<0.5 m tall) compared to less than 0.2% in the open bog. The treed bog was also characterized by an overstory dominated by a patchy distribution of stunted P. mariana. Over a single year, net CO2 uptake and ET was lower at the treed bog (NEE: -72 g C m(-2) year(-1) and ET: 449 mm year(-1)) than at the open bog (NEE: -104 g C m(-2) year(-1) and ET: 493 mm year(-1)). Chamber measurements revealed that P. mariana was associated with low rates of net primary productivity (NPP) compared to the relatively more productive ericaceous and deciduous shrubs. Although the presence of a P. mariana overstory increases both the total aboveground biomass and leaf area index in this peatland, P. mariana appears to be important in reducing both ecosystem-scale carbon sequestration and water vapour loss.

AB Mobile Bay, the fourth largest estuary in the USA located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, is known for extreme hypoxia in the water column during dry season caused by NH4+-rich and anoxic submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Nutrient dynamics in the coastal ecosystem point to potentially elevated microbial activities; however, little is known about microbial community composition and their functional roles in this area. In this study, we investigated microbial community composition, distribution, and metabolic prediction along the coastal hydrological compartment of Mobile Bay using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected microbial samples from surface (river and bay water) and subsurface water (groundwater and coastal pore water from two SGD sites with peat and sandy lithology, respectively). Salinity was identified as the primary factor affecting the distribution of microbial communities across surface water samples, while DON and PO(4)(3-)were the major predictor of community shift within subsurface water samples. Higher microbial diversity was found in coastal pore water in comparison to surface water samples.Gammaproteobacteria,Bacteroidia, andOxyphotobacteriadominated the bacterial community. Among the archaea, methanogens were prevalent in the peat-dominated SGD site, while the sandy SGD site was characterized by a higher proportion of ammonia-oxidizing archaea.Cyanobium PCC-6307and unclassifiedThermodesulfovibrioniawere identified as dominant taxa strongly associated with trends in environmental parameters in surface and subsurface samples, respectively. Microbial communities found in the groundwater and peat layer consisted of taxa known for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This finding suggested that microbial communities might also play a significant role in mediating nitrogen transformation in the SGD flow path and in affecting the chemical composition of SGD discharging to the water column. Given the ecological importance of microorganisms, further studies at higher taxonomic and functional resolution are needed to accurately predict chemical biotransformation processes along the coastal hydrological continuum, which influence water quality and environmental condition in Mobile Bay.

AB In the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of the Western Boreal Plain mining companies now recognize the importance of reclaiming peatlands, as they cover >50% of the pre-mined regional landscape. To date, reclamation efforts have focused on marsh and open water wetlands. However, these wetland systems are not abundant in the sub-humid climate of the WBP because of their excessive evapotranspiration (ET) losses, compared to peatland wetlands. The experimental Nikanotee Fen was constructed as part of the landscape reclamation, engineered with the intent to support natural fen vegetation and hydrologic processes. The influences of vegetation and treatment types on plot-scale energy fluxes and ET demands were examined over the 2014 growing season, one year post-construction. Actual ET and environmental variables, such as water table, soil moisture, temperature and relative humidity, were monitored in thirty-one study plots comprising control, moss and seedling plots (with and without wood-strand mulch), as well as three ponds. Actual ET was measured with weighing lysimeters and used to correct equilibrium ET, calculated using the Priestley-Taylor combination method. A roaming meteorological station was instrumented to quantify and compare available energy over different cover types. Modeled plot-scale ET was validated against continuously measured eddy covariance ET values. Cumulative ET exceeded precipitation in all plot types with average rates of 4.4, 3.2, 3.9 and 2.8 mm/day from open water, control, seedling and moss plots, respectively. Mulch reduced ET rates in both seedling and moss plots, where moss-mulch plots showed the lowest rates (2.4mm/day). The presence of mulch lowered the near-surface vapour pressure deficit, thus providing a more favorable microclimate for moss establishment by elevating near-surface relative humidity and reducing air and soil temperature by similar to 2 degrees C. Although vapour pressure deficit did not significantly control ET (p > 0.05), mulch appeared to have a greater influence on ET in moss plots than seedling plots. Water table position displayed a weak yet significant (p <0.05) control on ET in seedling plots. As these reclamation practices have not yet been well tested in the Alberta oil sands region; this study provides recommendations to reduce evaporative stress and aid in the establishment of functioning constructed peatland ecosystems.

AB A 4 m core was extracted from the center of a peatland located in the Drugeon valley (France). Thirteen radiocarbon dates were used to build a robust age model. Testate amoebae were used for reconstructing mire surface wetness. High-resolution pollen analysis of the sequence reconstructed 9 millennia of development of the peatland and its surrounding vegetation. During the early/middle Holocene (9500 to 5800 cal BP), warm conditions led to high evapotranspiration and low water levels. The vegetation history is characterized by the development of a Pinus and a mixed Quercus forest. From 5800 cal BP, testate amoebae show wetter conditions, indicating the onset of the cooler Neoglacial period. The cooling is also evidenced by the development of Abies and Fagus trees, replacing the oak forest. The first indicators of human impact appear at about 4800 cal BP, and indicators of farming activity remains very rare until ca. 2600 cal BP, at the beginning of the Iron Age. The development of the peatland responded to climatic fluctuation until 2600 cal BP, after which human impact became the main driver. The last millennium has been characterized by sudden drying and the spread of pine on the peatland.

AB The southern margin of permafrost is experiencing unprecedented rates of thaw, yet the effect of this thaw on northern water resources is poorly understood. The hydrology of the active layer on a thawing peat plateau in the wetland-dominated zone of discontinuous permafrost was studied at Scotty Creek, Northwest Territories (Canada), from 2001 to 2010. Two distinct and seasonally characteristic levels of unfrozen moisture were evident in the 0.7-m active layer. Over-winter moisture migration produced a zone of high ice content near the ground surface. The runoff response of a plateau depends on which of the three distinct zones of hydraulic conductivity the water table is displaced into. The moisture and temperature of the active layer steadily rose with each year, with the largest increases close to the ground surface. Permafrost thaw reduced subsurface runoff by (1) lowering the hydraulic gradient, (2) thickening the active layer and, most importantly, (3) reducing the surface area of the plateau. By 2010, the cumulative permafrost thaw had reduced plateau runoff to 47 % of what it would have been had there been no change in hydraulic gradient, active layer thickness and plateau surface area over the decade.

   FIELD; MODEL; REINTRODUCTION; NEWFOUNDLAND; RESTORATION
AB Mined peatlands do not readily recover their hydrological function, mainly because the dominant peat-forming plant genus, Sphagnum, cannot easily reestablish on the degraded surface peat found on cutover sites. Drainage and removal of the acrotelm can result in surface subsidence of up to 3.7 cm y(-1) m(-1) of peat shortly after drainage (compression), and long-term rates up to 0.3 cm y(-1) m(-1) (compression and oxidation). This can decrease the hydraulic conductivity by over 75%, and decrease the water retention capacity and specific yield. In old abandoned systems, drainage ditches may continue to facilitate a significant seasonal water loss. Colonization of abandoned sites by trees may increase the evapotranspirative losses by as much as 25%, and interception losses can be as high as 32% of rainfall. Without natural or planned occlusion of ditches, some peatlands become drier over time. Blocking ditchesmay largely restore water balance components, although the hydrological regime requires years to stabilise sufficiently for Sphagnum recolonization, especially where residual peat is well decomposed, having inadequate water storage capacity. Consequently, winter precipitation (Europe) and spring snowmelt (North America) are critical recharge periods. Over the long term, consolidation of the peat due to drainage and methane production (where drainage systems are blocked and soils reflooded) decreases hydraulic conductivity, thereby reducing lateral seepage losses. This may actually assist in Sphagnum recolonization. A regenerated cover of Sphagnum increases soil wetness and reduces water tension (increases pore-water pressure) in the substrate, thus ameliorating its own environment. However, natural recolonization and recovery of many hydrological and ecological processes may not occur, or may require many decades. Water management and selective plant reintroduction can accelerate this. Water management options such as blocking ditches, constructing bunds, reconfiguring the surface and managing microclimate havemet with varying degrees of success. No standard management prescription can be made because each site presents unique challenges.

AB We examined the water balance of a forested ombrotrophic peatland and adjacent burned peatland in the boreal plain of western Canada over a 3-year period. Complete combustion of foliage and fine branches dramatically increased shortwave radiation inputs to the peat surface while halting all tree transpiration at the burned site. End-of-winter snowpack was 7-25% higher at the burned site likely due to decreased ablation from the tree canopy at the unburned site. Shrub regrowth at the burned site was rapid post-fire, and shading by the shrub canopy in the burned site approached that of the unburned site within 3years after fire. Site-averaged surface resistance to evaporation was not different between sites, though surface resistance in hollows was lower in the burned site. Water loss at both burned and unburned sites is largely driven by surface evaporative losses. Evaporation at the burned site marginally exceeded the sum of pre-fire transpiration and interception at the unburned site, suggesting that evapotranspiration during the growing season was 20-40mm greater at the burned peatland. Although the net change in water storage during the growing season was largely unchanged by fire, the lack of low-density surface peat in the burned site appears to have decreased specific yield, leading to greater water table decline at the burned site despite similar net change in storage.

AB This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability in dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]), natural organic matter (-NOM) weight average molecular weight and absorptivity at 280 nm (epsilon(280), an estimator of aromaticity) at McDonalds Branch, a first-order stream that is a fen wetland. When ground-water discharge to the stream was predominant, the [DOC], M-w and were all relatively low. When soil pore water represented an important contribution to streamflow, not only was the [DOC] higher, but also the M-w and Hence, the contribution of soil pore water relative to ground water controlled not only the concentration but also the average physicochemical characteristics of the NOM. Combined field and laboratory experiments suggested that preferential adsorption of higher M-w more aromatic NOM components to mineral surfaces, most likely within the lower soil horizons, resulted in a lower M-w more aliphatic ground-water NOM pool, This process ultimately affected surface water as ground water discharged to the lower reaches of the stream. Within the stream, higher molecular weight, more aromatic components were susceptible to photo-aggregation and photo-degradation, in the presence of Fe. Results from this small watershed study provide insight into climatic effects on surface-water NOM characteristics in a small freshwater fen. Low flow periods resulted in lower M-w more aliphatic NOM derived primarily from ground-water discharge to the stream, whereas higher flow periods resulted in a higher M-w (by 150-500 Da, i.e., increased by as much as 25%), more aromatic downstream surface-water NOM pool, Hence, during future summer drought periods, as suggested by climate-change models for much of North America, surface-water NOM likely will be lower molecular weight, more aliphatic, and more hydrophilic with lesser metal binding and hydrophobic organic carbon (HOC) uptake abilities [Environ. Sci, Technol, 34 (2000) 1103]. along with decreased ability to attenuate UV radiation. Because NOM plays an important role in attenuating UV radiation, research on climate-induced effects on aquatic ecosystems needs to consider not only decreases in NOM concentration and photochemistry but also hydrology-induced changes to the NOM physicochemical characteristics.

AB The Holocene paleoenvironment in Nur sphagnum bog, northern Mongolia, was reconstructed by diatom, pollen analysis and measurement of chemical properties on a 3.7 m long peat boring sample. Development processes of peatland are well reflected in these multiproxy records, showing that peat accumulation started as early as 9 ka cal BP, and the present acidic peat bog was established no later than 6 ka cal BP. Synchronous trends in diatom and pollen assemblages revealed wetter climate in the early Holocene and extensive drought in the mid-late Holocene centered at 5900-2800 cal BP as a result of temperature increase and low precipitation. Periods of shifts in proxy data were potentially correlated with other studies in not only Mongolia and Siberia, but also the North Atlantic Ocean, and the climatic periods at 8.4 and 2.8 ka cal BP were highly significant. However, responses to climate changes seem regionally varied in time and strength, demonstrating that local differences in vegetation and orography greatly influence the balance of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Climate changes that coincided in time with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age were observed as wetter (1200-980 cal BP) and drier (370-240 cal BP) conditions, probably caused by meridional shifts of westerlies.

AB Surveys have shown that pocosins (swamp-on-a-hill) occur on the southeastern Coastal Plain of the U.S. from Virginia to north Florida and once covered more than one million hectares in North Carolina. A broad definition of pocosins (sensu lato) would include all shrub and forested bogs, as well as Atlantic white cedar stands and some loblolly pine stands on flooded soils on the Coastal Plain. A stricter definition (sensu stricto) of pocosins would only include the classic shrub-scrub (short pocosin) and pond-pine-dominated tall pocosin. Common synonyms for pocosins, including bay, bayland, bayhead, xeric shrub bog, and evergreen shrub bog, further confuse what is and is not classified as a pocosin. Over 51% of the forested palustrine wetlands in North Carolina have been disturbed, with approximately 33% of pocosins having been destroyed. Pocosins are rainfall driven and lack a well-defined stream surface-flow connection to major rivers on the landscape. However, they are often found adjacent to estuaries and have surface hydrologic connections that are linked to the regional water quality and salinity gradients found in estuarine areas along the southeastern coast. This hydrologic connection, combined with the vast continuous expanses of pocosins on the landscape, suggests that they are connected to regulated tributary waters of the United States. In addition, a survey of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel in North Carolina indicates that most pocosins are considered hydrologically connected to regional water supplies since they are the source of water flow on the landscape where they dominate. However, the potential impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2001 decision in the case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC) on the future development of pocosins is still unknown in most states. Moreover, the Bush administration's recent (January 2003) review and redefinition of the Clean Water Act's (CWA) jurisdiction over isolated wetlands may remove federal oversight on 20% of the nation's wetlands, including pocosins not immediately adjacent to estuaries. The high rate of past wetland loss, especially for pocosin wetlands, suggests that stricter wetland laws are needed at the state and local level if we are to support the concept of "no net loss" of wetlands.

AB Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations from seven boreal catchments in northern Sweden were monitored between June 1996 and May 1998 to examine spatial and temporal variations in streamwater TOC export and its relationship with catchment characteristics. The annual average export of TOC ranged between 36 and 76 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and correlated positively with the areal extent of wetlands (r(2) = 0.72; p = 0.03). The daily output of TOC was 5-11 times higher during the spring than during any other season. In total, the four week long spring period contributed between 50% and 68% of the annual TOC export from the seven catchments. The relative importance of the spring snow melt period for the annual TOC export, however, correlated negatively with the percentage of wetlands (r(2) = 0.83; p<0.01). We suggest that the smaller relative importance of the spring runoff period for the annual TOC export from wetland dominated catchments is a result of the hydrological flow paths associated with the snow melt period. While a large fraction of the spring runoff from forested areas reaches the stream via subsurface flow paths across riparian soils rich in TOC, the flow paths through wetland dominated systems include a much larger component of low-TOC snow melt water via surface flow over ice and frozen peat.

DE Chaghakhor Wetland; Gavkhuni Swamp; geotechnical properties of peat;
   Iran; peat strength
AB Because peat has high organic content and high natural water content, it is potentially problematic for civil engineering projects involving construction on peatland. Therefore, it is important to understand the physical, chemical and geotechnical properties of the peat. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the properties of two Iranian peat types. Peat and water samples were collected from sites within two extensive wetland areas (Chaghakhor Wetland and Gavkhuni Swamp) where construction works are planned. Both sites had peat layers more than three metres thick, which were sampled at depths of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 metres below ground level with four replicates per site. Degree of humification was determined in the field. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the pH of water and peat; and the natural (field) moisture content, organic content, ash content, bulk density, dry density, density of solids, liquid limit, initial void ratio, linear shrinkage, unconfined compressive strength, shear strength and falling-head permeability of each peat sample. We also investigated the elemental compositions and microstructure of the peats using X-Ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The laboratory tests of physical and geotechnical properties indicated that, for construction purposes, Chaghakhor peat is weaker than Gavkhuni peat.

AB Arctic peatlands represent a major global carbon store, but rapid warming poses a threat to their long-term stability. Testate amoebae are sensitive hydrological indicators that offer insight into Holocene environmental change in peatlands. However, in contrast to temperate peatlands, there have only been a few studies into the ecology of testate amoebae and their efficacy as environmental indicators in permafrost peatlands. We present the first study of testate amoeba ecology from peatlands in the continuous permafrost zone, based on samples from across the Alaskan North Slope. Multivariate statistical analyses show that pore water electrical conductivity (EC), a proxy for nutrient status along the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, is the dominant control on testate amoeba distribution. Water-table depth (WTD) is also a significant control on testate amoeba distribution, but is secondary to EC. We present two new testate amoeba-based transfer functions to reconstruct both EC (TFEC) and WTD (TFWTD), the first for peatlands in the continuous permafrost zone. The transfer functions are based on Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) regression and were assessed using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that both transfer functions have good predictive power. TFWTD is the best performing model (R-JACK(2) = 0.84, RMSEPJACK = 6.66 cm), but TFEC also performs well (R-JACK(2) = 0.76, RMSEPJACK, = 146 mu S cm(-1)). Our findings are similar to those conducted in peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions. The new transfer functions open the opportunity for reconstructing the Holocene dynamics of peatlands of the continuous permafrost zone in Alaska, which represent rapidly changing ecosystems.

AB A prerequisite for sustainable peatland forestry is sufficiently low water table (WT) level for profitable tree production. This requires better understanding on controls and feedbacks between tree stand and its evapotranspiration, drainage network condition, climate, and WT levels. This study explores the role of spatial tree stand distribution in the spatiotemporal distribution of WT levels and site water balance. A numerical experiment was conducted by a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrological model (FLUSH) applied to a 0.5 ha peatland forest assuming (1) spatially uniform interception and transpiration, (2) interception and transpiration scaled with spatial distributions of tree crown and root biomass, and (3) the combination of spatially scaled interception and uniform transpiration. Site water balance and WT levels were simulated for two meteorologically contrasting years. Spatial variations in transpiration were found to control WT levels even in a forest with relatively low stand stem volume (<100 m(3)/ha). Forest management scenarios demonstrated how stand thinning and reduced drainage efficiency raised WT levels and increased the area and duration of excessively wet conditions having potentially negative economic (reduced tree growth) and environmental (e.g., methane emissions, phosphorus mobilization) consequences. In practice, silvicultural treatment manipulating spatial stand structure should be optimized to avoid emergence of wet spots.

AB At-a-station and bankfull hydraulic geometry analyses of peatland channels at Barrington Tops, New South Wales, Australia, reveal adjustments in self-forming channels in the absence of sediment load. Using Rhodes ternary diagram, comparisons are made with hydraulic geometry data from self-forming channels carrying bedload in alluvial settings elsewhere. Despite constraints on channel depths caused at some locations by the restricted thickness of peat, most stations have cohesive, near-vertical, well-vegetated banks, and width/depth (w/d) ratios of similar to 2 that are optimal for sediment-free flow. Because banks are strong, resist erosion and can stand nearly vertical, and depth is sometimes constrained, adjustments to discharge are accommodated largely by changes in velocity. These findings are consistent with the model of maximum flow efficiency and the overarching least action principle in open channels. The bankfull depth of freely adjusting laterally active channels in clastic alluvium is well known to be related to the thickness of floodplain alluvium and a similar condition appears to apply to these swamps that grow in situ and are formed almost entirely of organic matter. The thickness of peat in these swamps rarely exceeds that required to form a bankfull channel of optimum w/d ratio for the transport of sediment-free water. Swamp vegetation is highly dependent on proximity to the water table. To maintain a swamp-channel and associated floodplain system, the channels must flow with sufficient water much of the time; they not only offer an efficient morphology for flow but do so in a way that enables bankfull conditions to occur many times a year. They also prevent the swamp from growing above a level linked to the depth of the channel. Once the channel attains the most efficient cross section, further growth of the swamp vertically is restricted by enhanced flow velocities and limited flow depths. This means that the volume of peat in such swamps is determined by the hydraulic efficiency of their channels. The development and maintenance of the hydraulic geometry of these swamp channels is biogeomorphic and biohydraulic in nature and yet accords to the same optimising principles that govern the formation of self-adjusting channels and floodplains in clastic alluvium.

AB In the present study, a mixture of treated wastewater and surface water was used to rewet a degraded fen peatland site during a three-year rewetting experiment. We studied the behavior and effects of micropollutants by means of hydrological, physico-chemical, microbiological and ecotoxicological monitoring. The highest concentrations of micropollutants in the treated wastewater were found for the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac, some metabolites, the sweetener acesulfame, tolyl- and benzotriazole and diatrizoate. In the underlying, shallow groundwater where treated wastewater application for rewetting had been expected to have the greatest impact due to seeping and evapotranspiration processes, only a sporadic occurrence of micropollutants was found. The influence of dilution by groundwater movements was examined by applying a geohydrological model. The sorption of micropollutants onto the peaty soil also played a role, as found for carbamazepine. Further processes such as photolysis, microbial decay under low redox conditions and plant uptake can be assumed to be relevant for the removal of many substances. Ecotoxicity tests with the soil before and after rewetting did not indicate any negative impact on the soil habitat quality by wastewater application, but clearly pointed at ecotoxicologically relevant geogenic arsenic concentrations at the study site. Although a positive effect on receiving surface water systems is expected if wastewater is applied on land instead of discharged to water bodies, the rewetted soil may turn into a sink for micropollutants in the long term. Hence, the findings of the present field study encourage further investigations in order to identify the governing processes in the elimination of micropollutants in rewetted peatlands flooded with treated wastewater.

AB Under the warmer climate, predicted for the future, northern peatlands are expected to become drier. This drying will lower the water table and likely result in reduced emissions of methane (CH4) from these ecosystems. However, the prediction of declining CH4 fluxes does not consider the potential effects of ecological succession, particularly the invasion of sedges into currently wet sites (open water pools, low lawns). The goal of this study was to characterize the relationship between the presence of sedges in peatlands and CH4 efflux under natural conditions and under a climate change simulation (drained peatland). Methane fluxes, gross ecosystem production, and dissolved pore water CH4 concentrations were measured and a vegetation survey was conducted in a natural and drained peatland near St. Charles-de-Bellechasse, Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 2003. Each peatland also had plots where the sedges had been removed by clipping. Sedges were larger, more dominant, and more productive at the drained peatland site. The natural peatland had higher CH4 fluxes than the drained peatland, indicating that drainage was a significant control on CH4 flux. Methane flux was higher from plots with sedges than from plots where sedges had been removed at the natural peatland site, whereas the opposite case was observed at the drained peatland site. These results suggest that CH4 flux was enhanced by sedges at the natural peatland site and attenuated by sedges at the drained peatland site. However, the attenuation of CH4 flux due to sedges at the drained site was reduced in wetter periods. This finding suggests that CH4 flux could be decreased in the event of climate warming due to the greater depth to the water table, and that sedges colonizing these areas could further attenuate CH4 fluxes during dry periods. However, during wet periods, the sedges may cause CH4 fluxes to be higher than is currently predicted for climate change scenarios.

AB Reactivity of atmospherically deposited nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) was investigated in three mountain forest catchments and one ombrotrophic peat bog located in the northern Czech Republic. The study sites are characterized by moderate to high N pollution rates that are currently decreasing. Monitoring of hydrodynamic data and catchment hydrochemistry (precipitation, soil solutions and runoff) was complemented by delta N-15 analyses of dissolved inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+). Measured delta N-15 data were used to calculate the extent of biogeochemical reactions and to construct N mass balances. Two-component models of runoff generation were developed using hydrological and delta O-18-H2O data on local precipitation, runoff, and soil waters collected by lysimeters. Catchment discharge was formed by groundwater (60-80%) and storm precipitation (40-20%), with minimal time lags. Groundwater had a diluting effect on reactions proceeding in the soil zone, including nitrification and denitrification. The rates of nitrification were estimated by comparing the delta N-15 values of atmospheric input and soil water, while the rates of denitrification were derived from the differences in the delta N-15 values of soil water and stream discharge. The Nu isotope effect of mineralisation of organic N was assessed by comparing delta N-15 values of soil and soil extracts. Nitrogen release from the catchments was controlled by temperature-dependent seasonality of soil reactions. Atmospheric N entered the runoff directly only during a short late winter - early spring period, accounting for approximately 10% of the total N input. Important inputs of mineralised organically cycled soil N were observed at the beginning and the end of the growing season, with measurable denitrification occurring during the same time periods. The measured apparent N isotope fractionations were significantly lower than previously published values (-3 to -14 parts per thousand vs. -30 parts per thousand for nitrification, and -3 vs. -20 parts per thousand for denitrification). Lower N-15 fractionations originated both from the dilution effect of groundwater on stream discharge and from the depletion of available ammonium during nitrification reactions. Denitrification proceeding during recharge of the groundwater body was estimated from the difference in the delta N-15 values of NO(3)(- )in precipitation and groundwater.

AB Stable isotopes of water are one of the most widely used tools to track the pathways of precipitation inputs to streams. In the past, soils have often been treated as black-boxes through which precipitation is routed to streams without much consideration of how, when, and where water is transported along soil and groundwater flow paths. Here, we use time series of stable isotopes (O-18) in precipitation, soil/groundwater, and stream water to evaluate how landscape structure and heterogeneity influence seasonal hydrological patterns characteristic of boreal headwater catchments. To do this, we collected water throughout a full year at three adjacent catchments draining forest, mire, and mire/lake ecosystems within the Krycklan Experimental Catchment of northern Sweden. Isotope time series from forest and mire groundwater piezometers showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the dominant hydrologic flow pathways connecting precipitation to stream flow at different sites. The isotopic signature of stream water suggested strong connections to the dominant landscape elements within each catchment. These connections translated into greater temporal variability in the isotopic response of streams draining lake and wetland patches, and a much more attenuated pattern in the forest-dominated catchment. Overall, seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of streams and groundwater illustrate how differences in landscape structure result in variable hydrological patterns in the boreal landscape.

AB Rotational burning of heather to improve grazing and grouse breeding is a common management practice for upland catchments in the UK. However, the effects of such practices on hydrology and water quality are not well understood because the timescale of burning rotation is typically between 7 and 20 years thus requiring long-term experiments in order to resolve the effects. Furthermore, land management, such as changes in burning or grazing practices, has been proposed as a possible strategy for the remediation of the widespread increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) observed across the northern hemisphere. This study is based on a long-term experiment on the effect of different rotational burning cycles and grazing intensities on upland vegetation and aims to understand the effects of these management strategies on hydrology and water quality. The main outcomes are:
   (i) The depth to water table in the soil showed significant differences between different burning rotations and grazing intensities. Depth to water table was greatest on plots where burning did not occur or for longer burning cycles where livestock had been excluded.
   (ii) The pH and conductivity of sampled soil water showed no significant difference between grazing treatments, with the presence of burning being the most important factor (frequency of the burning cycle was not important).
   (iii) The DOC content showed no significant difference between grazing treatments but showed a significant decrease with the presence of burning, though no direct relationship with the depth to water table could be found.
   (iv) Burn management explains only a small proportion of the variance in the composition of the DOC, rather the variation is dominated by the differences between days of sampling and seasonal variation. Therefore, this study suggests that land management controls hydrology and water quality through controlling the development of vegetation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phytometers are indicator transplants that provide information on site conditions based on plant survival, growth and reproduction. Since this is a relatively new approach, standards for its implementation remain to be defined, for example, during peatland restoration. Peatland restoration frequently aims at recovering characteristic communities, and a key attribute of successfully restored ecosystems is their capacity to sustain viable populations of target species. When not actively introduced, these species are expected to establish on their own after improving site conditions, for example by rewetting. Assessments to determine whether this goal is met require the long-term monitoring of species' presence, whereas the underlying causes of these observations, i.e. site or dispersal limitation, often remain unknown. Using phytometers within ecological restoration helps addressing this question. The goal of this study is to compare the responses of several species and traits to environmental conditions in restored peatlands. Three target species (Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum, Vaccinium oxycoccos) were planted in restored montane peatlands in central Germany, while in a greenhouse experiment, the same species were grown on peat from the field sites and exposed to two water levels. Several plant traits were measured and compared with variation in light, water and soil conditions. The response to habitat conditions was species-specific, indicating that the use of different phytometers increases the reliability of monitoring. Survival and growth traits were suitable to assess a wide range of abiotic conditions, while differences in reproductive output were more time-consuming to measure. Survival provided the most conclusive results for species sensitive to stressful habitat conditions. Biomass and other size metrics of the phytometers, as well as growth and reproductive traits were partly redundant. Thus, we suggest recording survival and biomass and use non-destructive growth measurements for repeated assessments, while the choice of the most suitable size trait should depend on the growth form. Our study stresses the potential of phytometers for monitoring the restoration outcome, while highlighting the importance of species and trait selection.

AB Water is one of the most important environmental factors defining the niche of terrestrial fungi, and fungi preserved in ombrotrophic peat deposits have the potential to indicate past variations in surface wetness and vegetation composition. This study aimed to assess the potential of fungal microfossils for palaeoclimate reconstructions. The environmental preferences of fungi were evaluated by assessing the relationships among fungal types, the peat-forming vegetation, the occurrence of fire, and water table status in fossil and modem samples from two raised bogs in northern England and Denmark.
   The microfungi which showed consistent patterns among the three datasets examined in the study were generally indicators of relatively dry (hummock-like) conditions, and the abundance of most of the abundant fungal types observed reflected the prevalent vegetation type more than the direct influence of local moisture conditions. A number of fungal microfossils were identified which can be used to consistently provide a qualitative reconstruction of past conditions on the surface of the bog, and accurately indicate shifts between relatively dry and wet local conditions. Spores, in general, provided more information about local moisture conditions than vegetative mycelia. Some of the more abundant types, particularly Type 12 spores, showed a characteristic distribution with water table depth, which was consistent between the two different sites examined in the study. These fungal types can form the basis of future quantitative reconstructions of past water table and therefore climate in ombrotrophic bogs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are an important component of the global ecoenvironment and play a significant role in runoff regulation and flood control within the global water cycle. In this paper, the impact of two types of wetland (riverine and rapirian-zone wetlands) on the hydrological cycle was discussed and a new method of assessing the impact proposed. The distributed hydrological model (SWAT) is modified, and applied to simulate the Qingdianwa depression wetland over a 25-year period. A scenario analysis of different restoration areas, ranging from 30 to 150 km(2), was performed. Results showed that natural unregulated wetlands are not effective in mitigating floods, especially during wet years. When comparing the effectiveness of riverine and rapirian-zone wetlands in the runoff regulation, riverine wetlands were clearly much more effective and able to reduce the annual average flow to 7.4 million m(3), i.e. a reduction of 30%. However, it must be noted that both kinds of wetland are important in flood control, river flow regulation, groundwater recharge, and flood reclamation.

AB Wetlands (rivers, lakes, bogs, etc.), the biodiversity hotspots, provide habitats for biology on Earth and play an important role in biodiversity protection around the world. However, they are damaged by dam construction all over the world. Many studies have been conducted on the effects of dam construction on biodiversity, but a review about it is missing. The objectives of this review are: (1) to discuss the effects of dam construction on biodiversity in freshwater wetlands; and (2) to identify the future directions for research in this field. To achieve these objectives, 347 significant publications from 2000 to 2017 were selected (based on a rigorous screening processes and a systematic literature review approach) from the ISI Web of Knowledge database. Dam construction decreased the water fungal biomass and richness in reservoirs and downstream reaches, but increased the amount of soil microorganisms in downstream lake wetlands. The studies about effects of dam on benthos mainly focused on macroinvertebrate, periphyton and mussel. Most studies about the effects on macroinvertebrate claimed that dam construction caused increases in biomass and decreases in taxa richness in downstream reaches. The studies about effects of dam on plankton mainly focused on phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktonic microorganisms and ichthyoplankton. Effects of dam on fish (including aquatic mammals) included blocking migration route, habitat fragmentation, changing from lotic to lentic water in the impounded area, release of hypolimnetic cold water of reservoir, and changes of water flow in downstream reaches. Studies about effects of dam construction on botany mainly focused on the riparian plants, but there were few studies on floating plants and submerged macrophyte and effects of dam construction on botany in downstream lake wetlands. There were only few studies that examined these effects of dam on bird. We also pointed out the future directions for research in this field. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial and temporal distribution of sulphate (SO4) concentrations in peat pore water and the outlet streams of two forested swamps was related to variations in the magnitude of upland runoff, wetland water levels and flow path. The swamps were located in headwater catchments with contrasting till depths typical of the southern Canadian Shield. Inputs of SO4 from shallow hillslope tills and streams showed little seasonal variation in either source or concentration in both swamps. Sulphate dynamics at the outlet stream reflected hydrological and biogeochemical processes within the valley wetlands, which in turn were partly controlled by catchment hydrogeology. During high runoff, maximum water table elevations and peak surface flow in the swamps resulted in upland inputs largely bypassing anoxic peat. Consequently, SO4 concentrations of 8-10 mg/l at the swamp outlets were similar to stream and groundwater inputs. During periods of low flow, concentrations of SO4 at the swamp outlets declined to less than 3 mg/l. At this time lower water table elevations resulted in increased interaction of input water with anoxic peats, and therefore, SO4 reduction. Contrasts in till depth and the nature of groundwater flow between catchments resulted in differences in SO4 dynamics between years and swamps. In dry summers the absence of groundwater inputs to the swamp in the catchment with thin till resulted in a large water table drawdown and re-oxidation of accumulated S, which contributed to maximum SO4 concentrations (up to 35 mg/l) during storm runoff. Continuous groundwater input to the swamp in the catchment with deeper till was critical to maintaining saturated surfaces and efficient SO4 retention during both dry and wet summers. A conceptual model of wetland SO4 retention and export, based on catchment hydrogeology, is developed to generalize the SO4 dynamics of valley bottom wetlands at the landscape scale.

AB Since the 1950s, large areas of upland peat have been afforested in northern European countries. Due to the poor phosphorus (P) adsorption capacity and low hydraulic permeability in blanket peat soil and increased labile P sources, harvesting these blanket peat forests can significantly increase P concentrations in the receiving aquatic systems. This paper briefly reviews the current management practices on the control of P releases from forestry in Ireland and the UK, and proposes a possible novel practice-grass seeding clearfelled areas immediately after harvesting, which should reduce P release from blanket peat forest harvesting. The study was conducted in the Burrishoole Catchment in the west of Ireland. A field trial was carried out to identify the successful native grass species that could grow quickly in the blanket peat forest. The two successful grass species-Holcus lanatus and Agrostis capillaris-were sown in three blanket peat forest study plots with areas of 100, 360, and 660 m(2) immediately after harvesting. Areas without grass seeding were used as controls. One year later, the P content in the aboveground vegetation biomass of the three study plots were 2.83, 0.65, and 3.07 kg Pha(-1), respectively, which were significantly higher than the value of 0.02 kg Pha(-1) in the control areas. The water extractable phosphorus in the three study plots were 8.44, 9.83, and 6.04 mg(kg dry soil)(-1), respectively, which were lower than the value of 25.72 mg(kg dry soil)(-1) in the control sites. The results indicate that grass seeding of the peatland immediately after harvesting can quickly immobilize significant amounts of P and warrants additional research as a new Best Management Practice following harvesting in the blanket peatland forest to mitigate P release.

AB Heat waves, which are projected to be more frequent and intense in a warmer climate, could become a serious threat to plants that rely on water surplus availability, such as bryophytes. Here, I take the advantage of the European summer 2003 climate anomaly to assess the impact of an extreme heat wave on peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum, a group of bryophytes forming the bulk of living and dead biomass in peatlands. With this aim, 20 selected bogs in the Italian Alps were checked for Sphagnum survival in the years following the heat wave. Over the study area, the period May-September 2003 was characterized by higher mean monthly air temperature (13.5 degrees C) and lower mean monthly precipitation (87 mm) compared with normal climatic conditions (11.5 degrees C and 117 mm, respectively) so that the heat wave coincided with a drought spell. As a consequence of the unusual water stress, I documented an increased mortality of peat mosses forming high hummocks. In particular, at habitat scale, the distribution of desiccated peat mosses was restricted to the hummock face receiving the greatest amount of solar irradiation. However, at regional scale, the present study identified a climatic threshold, simply defined by the ratio of precipitation to temperature (P : T), which triggered an irreversible desiccation of peat mosses when mean monthly P : T dropped below 6.5 (mm : degrees C) during May-September 2003. The absence of any sign of recovery after 4 years since the drought must be seen as a harbinger of the deleterious effects of extreme heat waves on organisms not adapted to cope with abrupt climate anomaly.

AB To improve understanding and prediction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and fluxes in northern peat-dominated catchments, we present the development and application of a parsimonious tracer-aided rainfall-runoff model coupled with a biogeochemistry subroutine able to concurrently simulate streamflow and DOC dynamics. The modeling approach which included quantitative assessment of associated uncertainties was conditioned by geochemical tracers which discriminate dominant water sources. Integration of DOC was predicated on statistical time series models which identified air temperature and streamflow as the key proxies that capture DOC supply and transport processes in two upland catchments in Scotland, UK. Conceptualizing the nonlinear partitioning of quick near-surface and slower groundwater runoff sources in combination with a DOC mass balance resulted in a coupled, low-parameter mechanistic model. Model tests showed mostly sensitive parameters and reasonable simulation results with seasonally controlled DOC supply and event-based DOC transport. Transport is facilitated even for smaller events by overland flow from saturated histosols connected to the stream network. However, during prolonged dry periods, near-surface runoff switches off and stream DOC is dominated by low concentration groundwaters. Furthermore, the model was able to explain subtle differences in DOC dynamics between the two catchments mainly reflecting the distribution of saturated soils and available storage. We conclude that tracers and statistical time series models can successfully guide the development of parsimonious yet structurally consistent water quality models. Parsimonious models provide tools for estimating DOC dynamics and loads with reduced uncertainty and potentially greater transferability.

AB The diversity of ecosystems across boreal landscapes, successional changes after disturbance and complicated permafrost histories, present enormous challenges for assessing how vegetation, water and soil carbon may respond to climate change in boreal regions. To address this complexity, we used a chronosequence approach to assess changes in vegetation composition, water storage and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks along successional gradients within four landscapes: (1) rocky uplands on ice-poor hillside colluvium, (2) silty uplands on extremely ice-rich loess, (3) gravelly-sandy lowlands on ice-poor eolian sand and (4) peaty-silty lowlands on thick ice-rich peat deposits over reworked lowland loess. In rocky uplands, after fire permafrost thawed rapidly due to low ice contents, soils became well drained and SOC stocks decreased slightly. In silty uplands, after fire permafrost persisted, soils remained saturated and SOC decreased slightly. In gravelly-sandy lowlands where permafrost persisted in drier forest soils, loss of deeper permafrost around lakes has allowed recent widespread drainage of lakes that has exposed limnic material with high SOC to aerobic decomposition. In peaty-silty lowlands, 2-4 m of thaw settlement led to fragmented drainage patterns in isolated thermokarst bogs and flooding of soils, and surface soils accumulated new bog peat. We were not able to detect SOC changes in deeper soils, however, due to high variability. Complicated soil stratigraphy revealed that permafrost has repeatedly aggraded and degraded in all landscapes during the Holocene, although in silty uplands only the upper permafrost was affected. Overall, permafrost thaw has led to the reorganization of vegetation, water storage and flow paths, and patterns of SOC accumulation. However, changes have occurred over different timescales among landscapes: over decades in rocky uplands and gravelly-sandy lowlands in response to fire and lake drainage, over decades to centuries in peaty-silty lowlands with a legacy of complicated Holocene changes, and over centuries in silty uplands where ice-rich soil and ecological recovery protect permafrost.

AB Relevance of the research is determined by a plenty of unresolved issues on estimation of water bodies condition and their long-term forecast, normalization of anthropogenous influences, sewage treatment and restoration of water bodies.
   The aim of the research is to develop a methodology for management of geochemical balance of water ecological systems in Western Siberia in various natural and anthropogenous conditions.
   Methods: landscape and geochemical, geographical and hydrological, statistical methods, methods of mathematical modelling of a water flow and chemical composition of waters.
   Results and conclusions. The authors have proposed the methodology of management of river basin geochemical balance. It consists in: 1) estimation of of water bodies condition, tendencies of its change and anthropogenous influence; 2) construction of a complex of mathematical models describing water runoff formation and chemical composition of waters; 3) development of the actions, which allow minimizing anthropogenous influence on water bodies; 4) estimation of water-security actions efficiency by comparison of results of observations and simulating. The authors developed the algorithm for defining the elements of geochemical balance of river basins and characterized the orientation of geochemical processes in water bodies in Western Siberia. The key aspects of a choice of methods of sewage treatment and restoration of the broken areas are formulated. It is shown that construction of treatment facilities is reasonable if dump of the crude sewage makes more than 5 % from a runoff in closing section. The optimum structure of sewage treatment assumes wide use of sediment basins and constructions of biological clearing with natural aeration which are desirable for combining with natural downturn of a relief in river valleys or inside bogs for condition of engineering protection of territory. Restoration can be considered effective if the difference between values of elements of balance before infringement and after restoration does not exceed 20 %.

AB The research was made on the largest (ca 500 ha) peatland complex in the western Poland ("Chlebowo" mire) (N 52 degrees 44'14.3" E 16 degrees 45'20.7"), that exists under considerable anthropogenic pressure. Species composition of testate amoebae in selected microhabitats was described. The fundamental environmental factors influencing the structure of assemblages were determined. Twenty four samples were taken from 10 sites (Sphagnum lawn, hollow and hummock) dominated by Sphagnum and brown mosses. Each of them was analysed in relation to its taxonomical composition. Nine environmental parameters (acidity (pH), conductivity; colour, NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg-2) were measured in the field and laboratory. Thirty two testate amoebae species of 13 genera were identified within the 24 sites. In most of the sites species composition was dominated by Hyalosphenia papilio Leidy, Cyclopyxis arcelloides Leidy and Hyalosphenia elegans Leidy, however the most numerous were Amphitrema flavum Archer, Hyalosphenia papilio Leidy and Cyclopyxis arcelloides Leidy. The particular parameters, i.e. pH, depth to the water table (DWT) and SO42- content significantly explained the species variability. Multivariate analyses showed that species tend to group especially along the pH gradient; to a smaller extent along the DWT and SO42-, together with pH.

AB A peatland productivity and decomposition parameter database was compiled to estimate parameters for the Canadian Model for Peatlands (CaMP); a module developed by the Canadian Forest Service to address the need for national-scale greenhouse gas emission estimates from peatlands present in the forested area of Canada. Data were compiled for 186 peatland sites from 69 sources. The SITES table contains wetland classification, tree classification, province or state, country, latitude, longitude, and an indication of coordinate accuracy. The NPP ALL table contains annual net primary productivity (NPP; gm(-2)yr(-1)) data for cases where one estimate for NPP was reported for all aboveground vegetation. The NPP SHRUB, NPP MOSS, and NPP HERB SEDGE tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their NPP (gm(-2)yr(-1)). The BIOMASS TREE, BIOMASS SHRUB, BIOMASS HERB SEDGE, and BIOMASS MOSS tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their standing aboveground biomass (g/m(2)). Shrubs in the NPP SHRUB and BIOMASS SHRUB tables were further classified into low or tall shrubs, and plants in the NPP HERB and BIOMASS HERB tables into herbs or sedges. The DECAY LITTER table contains decomposition parameters for different litter types and contains a classification of the type of decomposition study, study duration, information on experimental treatments, classification of above- or belowground plant parts, plant species, litter classification, root litter diameter, indication of hardwood or softwood, indication of evergreen or non-evergreen, litter bag depth classification, classes for bag placement relative to the water table and relative to the peat surface, water table depth, decay rate (k exponent), and mass loss values for years 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, and 23 of a decomposition study. The REFERENCES table contains complete citation information and provides links to the source reference pdf file. This data set is vital to the national Canadian peatland modeling effort and should be useful to other peatland scientists and ecosystem modelers. (c) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2018.

AB Questions: For wetland plants, dispersal by wind is often overlooked because dispersal by water is generally assumed to be the key dispersal process. This literature review addresses the role of seed dispersal by wind in wetlands. Why is wind dispersal relevant in wetlands? Which seeds are dispersed by wind and how far? And how can our understanding of wind dispersal be applied to wetland conservation and restoration?
   Methods: Literature review.
   Results and conclusions: Wind is a widely available seed dispersal vector in wetlands and can transport many seeds over long distances. Unlike water, wind can transport seeds in all directions and is therefore important for dispersal to upstream wetlands and to wetlands not connected by surface water flows. Wind dispersal transports seeds to a wider range of sites than water, and therefore reaches more sites but with lower seed densities.
   Many wetland plant species have adaptations to facilitate wind dispersal. Dispersal distances increase with decreasing falling velocity of seeds, increasing seed release height and selective release mechanisms. Depending on the adaptations, seeds may be dispersed by wind over many km or only a few m. The frequency of long-distance wind dispersal events depends on these adaptations, the number of produced seeds, the structure of the surrounding vegetation, and the frequency of occurrence of suitable weather conditions.
   Humans reduce the frequency of successful long-distance wind dispersal events in wetlands through wetland loss and fragmentation (which reduce the number and quality of seeds) and eutrophication (which changes the structure of the vegetation so that seed release into the wind flow becomes more difficult). This is yet another reason to focus on wetland conservation and restoration measures at increased population sizes, prevention of eutrophication, and the restoration of sites at short distances from seed sources.

AB The relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the acidification of soils and freshwaters by sulfate (SO42-) has been a topic of great debate over the last few decades. Most interest has focused on long-term acidification. Few have considered the influence of episodic drought-induced acidification in peatlands on DOC mobility, even through the increased acidity and ionic strength associated with the oxidation of reduced sulfur to SO42- are known to reduce DOC solubility. Reduced DOC concentrations during droughts have often been attributed to: (i) reduced hydrological export; (ii) physicochemical changes in the peat structure; or(iii) changes in the biological production and/or consumption of DOC. Our experimental drought simulations on peat cores showed that SO42- induced acidification reduced DOC concentrations during droughts, However, the relationships between SO42-/pH/ ionic strength and DOC were only apparent when the reductions in observed DOC were expressed as a fraction of the estimated DOC concentration in the absence of S 204, which were derived from soil depth, temperature, and watertable data. This analysis showed that a pH fall from 4.3 to 3.5, due to a SO42- rise from < 2.5 to 35 mg L-1, caused a 60% reduction in DOC concentrations. In contrast, poor correlations were recorded between SO42-/pH/ionic strength and the observed DOC data. As DOC both influences acidity and is influenced by acidity, the relative change in DOC needed to be considered to disentangle the effect of inputs of mineral acids into a system naturally dominated by variable concentrations of organic acids.

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

AB There is increasing evidence that drought is leading to increased loss of dissolved organic carbon from upland peats. Therefore, this study endeavours to understand the severity and frequency of the scale of drought responsible for driving the observed changes; and, by reconstructing climatic records, to understand whether such droughts are increasing in severity and frequency. The study suggests that there are two levels of drought severity important in the peatlands: a hydrological drought that causes hydrophobic effects in the upper peat profile lasting 3-4 years in duration, and a more severe biogeochemical drought that triggers new mechanisms of DOC production and decade-long effects. The study uses long term climate data from Central England and Northern England to reconstructs depth to water table for an upland peat catchment back to 1766 and shows that hydrological drought has a return period of 25 years and that biogeochemical drought has a return period of 15.5 years. Statistical modelling of the time series of annual droughts shows only weak evidence for an increasing frequency of severe droughts since 1766, but stronger evidence for the recent past. The return period of drought of sufficient severity to cause biogeochemical response is coming close to the length of effect such a drought would have, i.e. trends in drought frequency mean that peatlands may no longer be resilient to the impact of drought, with dire consequences for the storage of carbon in these environments.

AB Water table position, through the creation of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the soil profile, plays an important role in controlling CH4 flux from wetlands. A laboratory study of peat columns revealed that CH4 emission rates initially increased and then decreased as the water table was lowered from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm, with the release of CH4 trapped in pores.  There was a strong hysteresis between CH4 flux on the falling and rising water table limbs (falling > rising). When expressed as seasonal average values, there was a strong relationship (r2 0.08 - 0.74) between log CH4 flux and water table position for sites within 5 wetland regions in boreal-subarctic Canada. The regression coefficients were similar among regions (0.022 - 0.037), but there were differences in the regression constants (0.47 - 1.89). CH4 flux from drained, forested peatland soils decreased as the water table depth increased, and several sites were transformed from sources to sinks of CH4. Global CH4 emissions to the atmosphere may have been reduced by almost-equal-to 1 Tg yr-1 by peatland drainage during the last 100 yr.

AB Water table fluctuations influence the carbon balance of wetlands, but the effects are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations. Thus, we compared C mineralization in a peatland mesocosm exposed to a water table fluctuation (from 5 to 67 cm beneath the surface) with that in mesocosms with a stable high water table (2 to 6 cm depth) and with production rates obtained from flask incubations. Net turnover rates were calculated from concentration data by diffusive-advective mass-balances. Under stable, high water table conditions, net production of CO2 (6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), CH4 (2.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and DOC (15.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were vertically stratified and production and fluxes equilibrated. Lowering and raising the water table from 5 to 67 cm resulted in complex patterns of net CH4 and CO2 production. Response and equilibration times of processes upon drainage and flooding ranged from days (aerobic CO, production, CH4 oxidation, fluxes under unsaturated conditions) to months (CH4 production, fluxes under saturated conditions). Averaged over the water table fluctuation, net production of CH4 decreased to 0.36 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and that of CO2 increased to 140 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Physical disturbance through the incubation of peat strongly increased production rates of CO2, CH4 and DOC compared to in situ, steady state rates. The decoupling of production and fluxes to the atmosphere under conditions with variable water table depths potentially explains part of the frequently reported lack of correlation between environmental variables and trace gas fluxes in field investigations, and questions the applicability of predictions of gas flux based on empirical relationships established under stable average conditions.

AB The management of the UK uplands by rotational burning and grazing is a widespread practice that aims to control the development of vegetation in order to create suitable habitats for grouse and sheep. By modifying the above ground biomass it is possible that above and/or below ground hydrological regimes may be altered. This study investigates the effect burning has on various hydrological parameters of an upland blanket bog. The study was conducted on a long-term experimental site examining different combinations of managed burning and grazing intensities. The study has found that:
   (1) Although depth to water table shows strong seasonal trends, the shallowest water tables were found on those sites that were burnt every 20 years and grazed by sheep. The deepest water tables were found on those sites that had never been burnt.
   (2) In the year following a managed burn, water tables on those sites that were burnt were significantly shallower than before the burnt.
   (3) Hydraulic conductivity, as determined by dipwell slug tests, was found to be significantly lower on those plots that were burnt every 20 years.
   (4) Runoff occurrence was recorded and occurred at a significantly greater frequency on those sites that had recently been burnt.
   (5) By using antecedent weather conditions, significant parameters were found that could be used to model runoff generation.
   This paper demonstrates how the use of managed burning in upland settings can affect various hydrological responses of the peatland. These variations in hydrological response will have important consequences on DOC export through changes in water table and the partitioning of precipitation into runoff. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Leaf litter is an important source of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forested catchments. Rainwater percolating through fresh litter obtains higher concentrations of DOC and colour than from older forest floor material and organic soils. Chemical characterisation using DOC fractionation and tests of biodegradability show that natural litter percolates contain significant fractions of coloured and highly refractory hydrophobic acids (humic substances) and variable fractions of biodegradable compounds. Deciduous leaf litter imparts high DOC concentrations in the autumn, while coniferous litter and organic soils release DOC more evenly. Leaching from fresh deciduous litter may explain the seasonality in the concentration of DOC in discharge from forested catchments. Countrywide Norwegian data show very poor relationships between occurrences of mires in the catchment of lakes and water colour. High concentrations of DOC may occur in lakes where the catchment has a high proportion of surface runoff due to thin or impermeable soils or swamp areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The components of the energy budget for an open Swedish boreal bog were quantified over two growing seasons and an analysis of the influence of factors such as peat wetness, vapour deficit and radiative forcing was made, in order to understand how they can be represented by physically-based models. The presence of a pronounced micro-topography caused a variation of the surface wetness as well as the cover of vascular plants. This was reflected in the spatial variation in soil temperatures and the ground heat flux was almost twice as much in hollows as in ridges. A theoretical function of peat thermal conductance with porosity and water content agreed with calculated damping depths. The surface roughness was low (z(0) = 2-3 cm) and did not change during the season. Bluff-rough effects had to be considered for heat and vapour fluxes. Albedo changed little but significantly with development of vascular plants (from 0.11 to 0.14). The Bowen ratio did not change with temporal fluctuations in peat wetness but depended mainly on net radiation, air temperature and relative humidity. Consequently, there was a trend of falling Bowen ratio both during the day and during the season from May (monthly value 0.9) to September (monthly value 0.6). The bulk surface resistance (r(s)) to evapotranspiration was seldom close to zero and varied little (mean r(s) +/- S.D. = 160 +/- 70 s m(-1)). Its variation depended mainly on vapour pressure deficit and was not directly correlated to peat wetness. At least half the evapotranspiration was estimated to originate from the moss surface. The evapotranspiration was 60-80% of the Penman potential evaporation. The relatively large amount of non-transpiring biomass above ground gave an effect with a relatively high Bowen ratio and a large but stable r(s). It was concluded that there exists a canopy layer, within which the distribution of heat and vapour sources may vary with time. As the sources of evapotranspiration probably vary, the stable surface resistance is not caused by a constant regulation of moss evaporation but by small-scale advection effects. The low coupling to the ambient vapour deficit resulted in the evapotranspiration fitting well with the Priestly-Taylor model, with an alpha value of 0.8. Simple models may then be very effective for a surface type like this. However, the influence of different surface properties on the parameterisation needs to be investigated further. The use of more complicated, but physically sound, models demands more detailed studies of both physical properties of mosses and effects of differences in surface cover and micro-topography.

AB High Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions have been identified in hemiboreal forests in association with draining organic soils. However, the specific controlling factors that regulate the emissions remain unclear. To examine the importance of different factors affecting N2O emissions in a spruce forest on drained organic soil, a process-based model, CoupModel, was calibrated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method. The calibration also aims to estimate parameter density distributions, the covariance matrix of estimated parameters and the correlation between parameters and variables information, useful when applying the model on other peat soil sites and for further model improvements. The calibrated model reproduced most of the high resolution data (total net radiation, soil temperature, groundwater level, net ecosystem exchange, etc.) very well, as well as cumulative measured N2O emissions (simulated 8.7 +/- 1.1 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) (n =97); measured 8.7 +/- 2.7 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) (n = 6)), but did not capture every measured peak. Parameter uncertainties were reduced after calibration, in which 16 out of 20 parameters changed from uniform distributions into normal distributions or log normal distributions. Four parameters describing bypass water flow, oxygen diffusion and soil freezing changed significantly after calibration. Inter-connections and correlations between many calibrated parameters and variables reflect the complex and interrelated nature of pedosphere, biosphere and atmosphere interactions. This also highlights the need to calibrate a number of parameters simultaneously. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that N2O emissions during growing seasons are controlled by competition between plants and microbes for nitrogen, while during the winter season snow melt periods are important. Our results also indicate that N2O is mainly produced in the capillary fringe close to the groundwater table by denitrification in the anaerobic zone. We conclude that, in afforested drained peatlands, the plants and groundwater level have important influences on soil N availability, ultimately controlling N2O emissions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Soil-inhabiting invertebrates are extremely diverse in form, differ greatly in size and numbers, and are often aggregated in horizontal and vertical distribution. Methods available for assessing populations are all based on representative samples. They include field counting, use of attractant traps or pitfall traps, and assessing numbers of invertebrates in soil samples. Invertebrates can be separated from soil either by wet or dry methods based on physical principles, or by dynamic methods which use stimuli to make them leave the samples.
   Physical methods of separation include hand sorting of soil, soil washing and flotation, elutriation in an upward flow of water, use of a technique which involves passing soil over plates covered with a grease film in which the invertebrates become embedded, and centrifuging soil samples in water or dense solutions so that invertebrates come to the surface. Dynamic methods suitable for most arthropods include the use of dry funnels with, high controlled temperature and moisture gradients, and wet-funnel methods which are used mainly for nematodes and enchytraeid worms.
   Dry funnels which are easy to use are the most popular technique, but have the drawback that they do not extract eggs or resting stages. Wet funnels, which are more laborious, recover these stages, but also dead individuals. Flotation methods are best for sandy soils, whereas dry funnels are more efficient for peat or clay soils. For most soils, dry funnels are most efficient for the extraction of micro- and mesoarthropods, but flotation is usually preferable for macroarthropods.

ID CONIFER PLANTATIONS; PEATLANDS
AB Some impacts of 28-year-old South Coastal lodgepole pine forest on adjacent open blanket bog were investigated. A general rise in ground level in unplanted areas between 1966 and 1987 had been cancelled out by subsidence over most of the area by 1996. The forest plots had subsided by 40-80 cm since planting, depending on the cultivation/drainage treatment used and had an increased peat dry bulk density (0.13 Mg m(-3)) and a decreased water content (7 kg kg(-1) dry matter) compared with points more than 50 m from the forest (0.06-0.11 Mg m(-3) and 9-16 kg kg(-1) dry matter). The depth to water table in July averaged 55 cm in the forest but only 20 cm outside.
   The zone outside the forest affected by subsidence averaged 30 m wide in 1996, compared with 10-20 m in 1987, suggesting that by the end of the first rotation a 40-m wide zone will be affected. The development of a slope outside the forest by subsidence was considered to be a consequence of more rapid run-off and seepage towards the forest, rather than root spread onto the bog. Where pool systems or other vulnerable habitats are surrounded by forest, a buffer zone at least 40 m wide is needed between the edge of the habitat and the edge of the forest to safeguard the habitat during the first rotation. A narrower buffer zone may be sufficient in higher rainfall areas.

AB Coastal fens like the nature reserve "Hutelmoor und Heiligensee" (north-eastern Germany) are important landscape elements along the southern Baltic coast, which exchange fresh water and brackish water with the Baltic Sea. These exchange processes can be understood as experiments with a natural tracer, which may be used to investigate the hydrologic behaviour of these fen systems. With the establishment of coastal protection measures such as dunes and dikes, the installation of surface drainage and, more recently, also nature conservation measures, the hydrologic regime of these coastal wetlands has constantly altered over the last centuries.The rehabilitated wetland "Hutelnnoor und Heiligensee" is suitable for an analysis of hydrologic change as it has been monitored over the time period since nature conservation measures started in the 1990s. Collected data sets included observation of groundwater levels and electrical conductivities, weather data as well as discharge at the outlet of the drainage catchment. In this article, as a second part of the dual publication, processes and quantified process magnitudes have been identified that govern the salt balance of the study area including its variability in space and time. It was detected that - over the period of rehabilitation - salt water entered the catchment with an episodic storm surge by wave overtopping of dunes in 1995. The intruded brackish water was then diluted, which was a slow process extending over decades. It was governed by local groundwater recharge from precipitation and the inflow of relatively fresh groundwater from the hinterland. It is concluded that salt inputs from the Baltic Sea provide a natural tracer of hydrological processes, which can be readily monitored via electrical conductivity measurements.

AB In order to develop bioretention fillers with better phosphorus removal capacity, we built 12 bioretention columns with six kinds of modified fillers, and analyzed the operation effects of the columns under different conditions through field tests. Results show that adding water treatment residual has optimal removal rates for total phosphorus (TP) (median = 96.80%) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (median = 97.13%). The water reduction rates of the columns with improved fillers are 1.23-2.04 times that of the bioretention soil media column. The coconut chaff column has the best water storage capacity (median = 40.54%). Among the external factors affecting column operation, influent concentration of pollutants in urban surface runoff is the biggest influence factor on the removal efficiency of TP. However, there are no significant correlations between the removal efficiency of SRP and rainfall, influent concentration, and discharge ratio. The columns modified with medical stone, vermiculite, peat soil, medical stone + peat soil, green zeolite + peat soil all have good removal for phosphorus pollutant. After entering the columns, the contents of TP and SRP in most columns increased. The recommended fillers and the accumulation performance of phosphorus can help to improve purification effects in bioretention systems.

AB Mountain peatlands often have mineral horizons embedded within or buried below the peat, which affects substrate quality and soil properties in subsurface peat. However, their role in greenhouse gases (GHG) production and GHG responses to temperature and water table changes are uncertain. We conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment to assess the effect of changes in temperature and water table on two peat profiles (with and without mineral sediments) on the GHG emission and concentrations and on the microbial community structure.
   Two soil types - sedge peat/mineral/calcareous sediments (PMC) and sedge peat/moss peat (PP) were incubated for 28 days under four temperature/water table treatments: 15 degrees C/-15 cm, 25 degrees C/-15 cm, 15 degrees C/-40 cm, and 25 degrees C/-40 cm. Surface GHG emissions and GHG concentrations from four depths (surface, above water table, below water table, and above mineral contact) were monitored. Results indicated that increasing temperature had the most significant effect on overall GHG emissions. High temperature increased GHG emission (CO2 by 28%, CH4 by 133% and 178% N2O) and concentrations at surface and at depth (CO2 by 32-83%, CH4 by 200-1600% and N2O by 61-230%) in most samples. In contrast, lowering the water table decreased only CH4 emissions. Soil types also significantly affected GHG emission and concentrations: CO2 and N2O from subsurface peat were higher in PP than PMC. Moreover, there was an interaction effect of temperature and soil types for N2O: concentrations in PP were more increased by high temperature above and below the water table.
   To understand how temperature influences GHG, especially N2O production, 25 degrees C/-15 cm incubated and Background (not incubated) cores were disassembled to measure apparent enzyme activation energy (Ea), and bacterial community structure above and below the water table. Results indicated that higher Ea and less relative abundance of copiotrophs were detected in PMC than in PP, because of less labile C in PMC. High temperature treatment also changed the microbial community structure at the class level in PP but not PMC. These together resulted in less increase of N2O production with increasing temperature in PMC. Overall, our findings suggest that peat profiles with mineral horizons may produce less GHG especially N2O when temperature increases. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Large areas of upland blanket peat were afforested in the UK and Ireland before the importance of the riparian buffer areas was realized. These forests are now reaching harvestable age. In order to reduce the possible negative impact of harvesting activities on receiving water bodies, the creation of buffer areas along receiving water courses prior to the clear-felling of the main plantation has been proposed. In this study, laboratory flumes were used to assess the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) retention efficiency of the vegetated and non-vegetated blanket peatland buffer areas under different hydraulic loadings. In addition, a mini-buffer approach is proposed and tested with flumes. The idea with minibuffers is to keep P on site and reduce P transportation from harvest residues. In the grassed flumes, the DRP removal efficiencies gradually decreased from 80% to 40% and 30% to 18% when the hydraulic loadings increased from 49 to 123 mm h(-1) and 256 to 444 mm h(-1), respectively. In the non-grassed flumes, the DRP removal was about the same as for the grassed flumes when the hydraulic loading was 49 mm h(-1) but was significantly less when the hydraulic loadings increased to 123, 256 and 444 mm h(-1). The mini-buffer method could retain 88-95% (with seeded grasses) and 54-62% (without seeded grasses) of added DRP under different inflow DRP concentrations (between 0.5 and 3 mg DRP L-1). After ending the overland flow experiment, the water extractable phosphorus (WEP) and pore water P concentrations in the nongrassed flumes were significantly higher than the grassed flumes, indicating a higher risk of subsequent P release from non-grassed buffer areas after ending of P-rich overland flow. Our results indicated that the overall P retention capacity of the normal buffer areas in blanket peat catchments is low due to frequent occurrence of high flow events that significantly reduce buffer P retention efficiency. In contrast, the mini-buffer method could be a feasible means of increasing onsite P retention. This study is of particular interest currently as large areas of upland blanket peat forests without buffer areas in the UK and Ireland are being harvested or scheduled to be harvested in the near future.

AB A detailed survey was conducted to quantify the spatial distribution of C-14 in Sphagnum moss and underlying soil collected in Duke Swamp. This wetland environment receives C-14 via groundwater pathways from a historic radioactive Waste Management Area (WMA) on Atomic Energy Canada Limited (AECL)'s Chalk River Laboratories (CRL) site. Trends in C-14 specific activities were evaluated with distance from the sampling location with the maximum C-14 specific activity (DSS-35), which was situated adjacent to the WMA and close to an area of groundwater discharge. Based on a spatial evaluation of the data, an east-to-west C-14 gradient was found, due to the influence of the WMA on C-14 specific activities in the swamp. In addition, it was possible to identify two groups of sites, each showing significant exponential declines with distance from the groundwater source area. One of the groups showed relatively more elevated C-14 specific activities at a given distance from source, likely due to their proximity to the WMA, the location of the sub-surface plume originating from the WMA, the presence of marsh and swamp habitat types, which facilitated C-14 transport to the atmosphere, and possibly, C-14 air dispersion patterns along the eastern edge of the swamp. The other group, which had lower C-14 specific activities at a given distance from the groundwater source area, included locations that were more distant from the WMA and the sub-surface plume, and contained fen habitat, which is known to act as barrier to groundwater flow. The findings suggest that proximity to source, groundwater flow patterns and habitat physical characteristics can play an important role in the dynamics of C-14 being carried by discharging groundwater into terrestrial and wetland environments.

AB Fossil floras have been recovered from a unique deposit of early Permian age in North-Central Texas. The site, Kola Switch, preserves three distinct floras in different lithofacies, in a succession from a single outcrop. The sedimentary environment appears to be a floodplain channel fill of primarily siltstones and claystones. The lowermost flora, preserved in a kaolinitic siltstone, indicates active water flow. It is dominated by plants typical of well-drained substrates, dominated by Sphenopteris germanica, and contains no wetland elements. The middle flora is from a finely laminated carbonaceous claystone and is dominated by marattialean tree ferns, with no elements from habitats typical of seasonal moisture availability. It contains no roots and appears to have formed as a floating peat mat. The upper flora is a mixed assemblage of wetland taxa and those typical of well-drained soil environments or a seasonal rainfall regime. Unlike the two lower floras, it has a relatively even distribution of dominance and is the most diverse of the three assemblages. Palynofloras also were recovered from each of these beds. The palynofloras, although varying between and even within the beds, indicate a common background species pool during the time interval sampled, suggesting that these distinct floras reflect local changes in microhabitat conditions under a constant climatic background. The palynoflora from each bed has characteristics in common with the macroflora of that bed, but also distinct differences. Together, the macroflora and microflora provide an unusually broad picture of this site through time. Kola Switch compares favorably with the recently described flora from the nearby Sanzenbacher Ranch site of approximately the same age and also with floras of Rotliegend age from Central Europe.

AB This study investigates the testate amoeba communities of semi-aquatic environments in two anthropogenic wetland ecosystems within an extensive drained wetland complex in northern Israel. Aims are to add to the species record for the region, test the similarity in amoeba communities and ecology to more studied sites and regions and investigate processes of wetland development and the implications of this for conservation management. The testate amoeba community is predominantly composed of cosmopolitan taxa but the community composition is distinct from that of previous studies. Redundancy analyses show that much the strongest environmental control is hydrology (depth to water table). Surprisingly, strontium (Sr) is an important secondary control, probably representing the trophic gradient. With a few exceptions the autecology of taxa identified here agrees with their preferences indicated by previous studies. There are significant differences in species richness and community structure between the amoeba communities of the two sites. Partly the difference may be due to differences in nutrient state, although some of the difference is independent of all environmental variables tested here. The lower species richness of the more recently created site suggests the testate amoeba community may be at an earlier successional stage.

AB Continuous-cover forestry (CCF) is expected to reduce the negative environmental impacts of peatland forestry in comparison with rotation forestry (RF), but the unknown profitability of CCF on peatlands limits its application in practice. The profitability of CCF was analyzed by simulating management scenarios with a process-based ecosystem model, EFIMOD, which was complemented to describe the interplay between tree growth and water table depth, which is typical of peatland forests. A variety of harvest intervals and post-harvest basal areas for a mature Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stand was simulated on a nutrient-rich peatland site. Conventional RF was simulated for comparison. CCF provided a higher profit than RF. The best financial performance was obtained with a 15-year harvest interval regardless of interest rate, although the overall profitability of CCF depended on the interest rate used. Ditch network maintenance was needed to maintain the stand growth only when the post-harvest basal area was smaller than 10 m(2).ha(-1). There were many CCF scenarios in which the difference in the net present value of harvest revenues was within 10% compared with the best CCF scenario. Hence, there are many relatively profitable CCF harvesting alternatives for forest management in boreal spruce-dominated peatland forests.

AB Determining the discharge of ground water to Shingobee Lake (66 ha), north-central Minnesota, is complicated by the presence of numerous springs situated adjacent to the lake and in the shallow portion of the lakebed, Springs first had to be located before these areas of more rapid discharge could be quantified. Two methods that rely on the distribution of aquatic plants are useful for locating springs. One method identifies areas of the near-shore lakebed where floating-leaf and emergent aquatic vegetation are absent. The second method uses the distribution of marsh marigold (Caltha palustris L,) to locate springs that discharge on land near the shoreline of the lake, Marsh marigold produces large (2 to -1 cm diameter) yellow flowers that provide a ready marker for locating ground water springs. Twice as many springs (38) were identified using this method as were identified using the lack of near-shore vegetation, A portable weir was used to measure discharge from onshore springs, and seepage meters mere used to measure discharge from near-shore springs. Of the total 56.7 h, s(-1) that enters the lake from ground water, approximately 30% comes from onshore and near-shore springs.

AB Warming and thawing in the Arctic are promoting biogeochemical processing and hydrologic transport in carbon-rich permafrost and soils that transfer carbon to surface waters or the atmosphere. Hydrologic and biogeochemical impacts of thawing are challenging to predict with sparse information on arctic soil hydraulic and thermal properties. We developed empirical and statistical models of soil properties for three main strata in the shallow, seasonally thawed soils above permafrost in a study area of similar to 7,500 km(2)in Alaska. The models show that soil vertical stratification and hydraulic properties are predictable based on vegetation cover and slope. We also show that the distinct hydraulic and thermal properties of each soil stratum can be predicted solely from bulk density. These findings fill the gap for a sparsely mapped region of the Arctic and enable regional interpolation of soil properties critical for determining future hydrologic responses and the fate of carbon in thawing permafrost.

AB The knowledge of the subsurface down to about one hundred meters is fundamental for a variety of economic, ecological, and geoscientific tasks, particularly in coastal zones. Marine and terrestrial processes influence coastal zones and both seawater intrusion and submarine freshwater discharges may occur. The Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) conducted airborne geophysical surveys in the coastal region of the German Bight between 2000 and 2014. The helicopter-borne system used simultaneously collected electromagnetic (HEM), magnetic (HMG), and radiometric (HRD) data. An area of about 5900 km(2) was covered with parallel flight lines at 250 m line separation and additional tie-lines at larger separations. In total, about 25,000 km of data at sampling distances of 4 m (HEM, HMG) and 40 m (HRD) were acquired. The electrical resistivity (HEM), the anomalies of the magnetic field (HMG), and the exposure rate (HRD) are the resulting geophysical parameters derived from the data. The results are displayed as maps of the geophysical parameters as well as vertical resistivity sections (only HEM). Both data and products are publicly available via BGR's product center. The airborne geophysical results helped to outline the fresh-saline groundwater interface, freshwater lenses on islands, submarine groundwater discharges, buried tunnel valleys, mires, and ancient landscapes.

TI Passive groundwater control system for a motorway

DE groundwater; environmental engineering
AB Considerable public discussion was generated during the planning stages of a rural motorway in Ireland regarding the possible effects of the road drainage system on an ecologically important fen, which was about 5 km distant. To overcome this potential problem, a passive groundwater level control system was devised to limit the drawdown by maintaining the water levels 1-75 m above the road surface. This groundwater level corresponded approximately to the seasonal low water levels recorded in the aquifer prior to the construction of the motorway. This is achieved by constructing the motorway within a sealed cross-section with a permeable layer beneath this section, called the underdrainage system, which is connected to drains that outflow at the higher level. This underdrainage system controls the water pressures and flows beneath the sealed section. This paper presents the concept of the passive groundwater control system in a nonhomogeneous glacial aquifer, and analyses the effects of this control system on the groundwater around the motorway. The selection of the design criteria and site control methods for the material within the sealed section is also discussed. The results of site monitoring that show the successful performance of the system in operation are also given.

AB In boreal bogs plant species are low in number, but they differ greatly in their growth forms and photosynthetic properties. We assessed how ecosystem carbon (C) sink dynamics were affected by seasonal variations in the photosynthetic rate and leaf area of different species. Photosynthetic properties (light response parameters), leaf area development and areal cover (abundance) of the species were used to quantify species-specific net and gross photosynthesis rates (P-N and P-G, respectively), which were summed to express ecosystem-level P-N and P-G. The ecosystem-level P-G was compared with a gross primary production (GPP) estimate derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements.
   Species areal cover, rather than differences in photosynthetic properties, determined the species with the highest P-G of both vascular plants and Sphagna. Species-specific contributions to the ecosystem P-G varied over the growing season, which, in turn, determined the seasonal variation in ecosystem P-G. The upscaled growing season P-G estimate, 230 gCm (-2), agreed well with the GPP estimated by the EC (243 gCm (-2)).
   Sphagna were superior to vascular plants in ecosystemlevel P-G throughout the growing season but had a lower P-N. P-N results indicated that areal cover of the species, together with their differences in photosynthetic parameters, shape the ecosystem-level C balance. Species with low areal cover but high photosynthetic efficiency appear to be potentially important for the ecosystem C sink. Results imply that func-tional diversity, i. e., the presence of plant groups with different seasonal timing and efficiency of photosynthesis, may increase the stability of C sinks of boreal bogs.

DT Article
DE GREAT-BRITAIN; SURFACE PETROLEUM SEEPAGES; PETROLEUM IMPREGNATIONS
AB This paper documents 173 occurrences of surface petroleum seepages and impregnations in Great Britain. A brief description is given of the seven main areas where they are found. The descriptions range from pore fillings of bitumen to steady flows of oil and gas. The principal areas in which seepages are found are as follows: the Orcadian basin of north-east Scotland, the Midland Valley of Scotland, the flanks of the Pennines, the Welsh Borderlands, Cornwall, the Dorset coast of the Wessex basin and the south-eastern Weald. Stratigraphically the seepages range from Caledonide basement to Holocene peat. The principal sources for the petroleum are Devonian oil shales (Orcadian basin), Carboniferous shales and coals (Midland Valley, Pennines, Welsh Borderlands, Devon and Cornwall) and the Liassic (Wessex and Wealden basins). Several anomalous seepages are recorded from Welsh and Scottish 'basement'. There are three clearly defined styles in which the seepages occur. Many are found where permeable carrier beds unconformably overlie impermeable 'basement' around the margins of basins (Orcadian basin, Midlands Carboniferous basin); others are fault related, especially in the Wessex and Wealden basins. The seepages in the Cornish tin mines are best explained as sourced from the Culm series and drawn by the convective flow of connate waters into the thermal chimneys of the granite intrusions.

   sulphate; proton consumption; redox capacity; restoration; rich fens
AB Seven reference areas in the Netherlands were selected to trial restoration measures in acidified rich fens in discharge areas. In about half of the projects the measures that aimed to restore the high base status of the topsoil failed. The aim of the present study was to identify the key factors and processes in base regulation of rich fen systems, in order to underpin future restoration. We sampled soil and interstitial water from distinct soil horizons and analysed it for variables involved in geohydrochemical processes. We monitored interstitial water chemistry and redox potentials to calibrate and validate a chemical speciation model, that we used for the interpretation of our observations. It appeared that soil pH, Ca2+ saturation and iron contents were significantly lower at sites where restoration efforts had failed. At the same time, soils of these sites were very stratified instead of homogenous. Only soils with high iron contents recovered a high Ca2+ saturation. All sites were characterised by considerable downward water fluxes through the soil. Chemical speciation modelling was a useful tool for the interpretation of processes underlying our observations and helped elucidate the factors and processes that control the recharge of the CEC by base cations. The modelling results suggested that the main process in proton neutralisation of successful sites is the production of internal alkalinity by reduction of iron oxides. Additional redox capacity can be supplied by the ample presence of sulphates. From our results we hypothesise that the CEC will only be recharged successfully with base cations in the presence of sufficient redox capacity of the soil. It seems that redox processes facilitate the ionic exchange of protons for Ca2+ ions. Sites where restoration efforts failed changed from discharge areas to recharge areas, which caused iron depletion by leaching. We conclude that proper understanding of the pedological and geohydrochemical processes that control the base status of soils is a prerequisite for successful nature restoration. The role of soil processes cannot be ignored as it seems that the production of internal alkalinity upon reduction exceeds the external supply of alkalinity by groundwater flow.

DE Cynodon dactylon; management; peatland restoration; soil moisture; soil

AB Lake Hula and its neighbouring peatland in the upper Galilee, Israel were drained during the 1950s. For about 40 years after drainage most of the area was under continuous intensive cultivation with rain-fed winter crops and irrigated summer crops. In 1994 an area of about 110 ha of mainly peat soil was re-flooded and 350 ha surrounding it were partly taken out of intensive agricultural use. The surrounding area was still cultivated under rain-fed conditions in the cool winter season, but left fallow during the hot, dry summer. The summer vegetation was mowed periodically to promote the development of a continuous sward cover for recreation and control of wind erosion. The goal of this research was to study the relationship between dynamic changes in the soil and water conditions and the composition and species distribution of the spontaneous summer vegetation. During four consecutive years the vegetation dynamics were characterised by increasing dominance of Cynodon dactylon and Sorghum halepense. Cyperus rotundus, which was common under irrigated cultivation, partly disappeared under the new non-irrigated regime. The density and growth rate of the vegetation mainly reflected differences in the water table depth, which varied between 0.5 m and 3 m. Three years after re-flooding, soil salinity was high in areas where the water table was higher than 0.5 m and in dry patches where almost no cover of vegetation was found. In these sites the concentration of mineral nitrogen (N-NO3 and/or N-NH4) was especially high. A continuous vegetation cover developed on the peat soil in areas where the depth of the water table was between 1 m and 2 m. Mowing the vegetation periodically in summer suppressed the growth of tall, weedy species and promoted the dominance of Cynodon dactylon creating a dense, productive sward.

AB In the decade since the first pan-European testate amoeba-based transfer function for peatland palaeohydrological reconstruction was published, a vast amount of additional data collection has been undertaken by the research community. Here, we expand the pan-European dataset from 128 to 1799 samples, spanning 35 degrees of latitude and 55 degrees of longitude. After the development of a new taxonomic scheme to permit compilation of data from a wide range of contributors and the removal of samples with high pH values, we developed ecological transfer functions using a range of model types and a dataset of similar to 1300 samples. We rigorously tested the efficacy of these models using both statistical validation and independent test sets with associated instrumental data. Model performance measured by statistical indicators was comparable to other published models. Comparison to test sets showed that taxonomic resolution did not impair model performance and that the new pan-European model can therefore be used as an effective tool for palaeohydrological reconstruction. Our results question the efficacy of relying on statistical validation of transfer functions alone and support a multi-faceted approach to the assessment of new models. We substantiated recent advice that model outputs should be standardised and presented as residual values in order to focus interpretation on secure directional shifts, avoiding potentially inaccurate conclusions relating to specific water-table depths. The extent and diversity of the dataset highlighted that, at the taxonomic resolution applied, a majority of taxa had broad geographic distributions, though some morphotypes appeared to have restricted ranges.

AB Hydrologic data were collected over eleven years at a catchment situated in low permeability glacial terrain within the Boreal Plains (Alberta, Canada) to evaluate the hydrologic interactions occurring between landscape units (i.e., shallow pond, extensive peatlands, aspen forested hillslopes). Two-dimensional numerical models were developed using a fully-integrated groundwater-surface water model to evaluate key landscape features that allow these ecosystems to persist within the sub-humid climate. Study results show that the dynamic interactions between the pond and peatlands are driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration. As a result, pond and peatland water levels reflect recent climatic trends. Limited hillslope contributions to the peatlands occur, indicating they are not required within this climatic setting for long-term maintenance. Instead, the peatlands conserve water within the landscape and supply it to adjacent landscape units. By contrast, the pond and the aspen forested hillslopes are dominated by high rates of evapotranspiration, and represent net water sinks within the landscape. Further simulations indicate these hydrologic systems are sensitive to pond and peatland evapotranspiration rates, and the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying glacial till substrate.

AB We compared high-resolution reconstructions of peatland water-table depth at two raised bogs in the western Great Lakes region separated by similar to 1000 km. The sites included Minden Bog in southeastern Michigan and Hole-in-the-Bog in north-central Minnesota. Our objectives were to 1) determine whether large, decadal to multidecadal droughts of the past 2000 yrs were spatially and temporally coherent across the region, and 2) assess the underlying mechanisms of widespread droughts in the region. We found a strong correlation between bog-inferred records of moisture variability in the two regions (r=0.53). Between 2100 and 600 BP, extreme drought events centered on 1850, 1800, 1650, 1000, 800, and 700 BP are recorded in both regions. Many of these drought events were contemporaneous with large droughts already documented at sites far to the west in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. To identify potential modem climate analogues, we used empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to reveal spatial modes of variability in drought and precipitation records of North America for the past century. The first EOFs of annual precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) were similar to each other, and consistent with a pattern of widespread continental drought. Correlations between these EOFs and annual sea surface temperatures (SSTs) indicate strong relationships to SSTs in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins. We hypothesize that widespread droughts between 1000 and 700 BP were related to amplification of a spatial mode of moisture variability associated with an anomalously warm North Atlantic, a warm mid-latitude North Pacific, and an anomalously cold Tropical Pacific. A more extensive network of hydroclimate records, developed using a consistent set of methods and proxies, could be used in conjunction with high-resolution records of past SSTs to test this hypothesis.

AB Heathy Spur 1 (HS-1) is an intact alpine peatland in the Bogong High Plains, Victoria, Australia, that serves as a reference system for understanding the impacts of historical land use practices (cattle grazing, water diversion) and wildfire. The major ion chemistry in the groundwater feed and drainage water at HS-1 was studied over seasonal timescales during 'dry weather' periods; conditions that allow a simple hydrological model to be used, where the groundwater is assumed to partition between evapotranspiration and stream discharge. With this model the acid neutralising capacity (ANC) of stream discharge can be understood in terms of evapotranspiration and proton uptake associated with nitrate and sulfate removal. Stream discharge ANC is strongly partitioned towards exported dissolved organic carbon, shifting the buffering intensity to lower pH compared to the groundwater. Given the extremely low alkalinity of the regional groundwater, these alpine peatlands likely have a critical role in increasing headwater stream buffering capacity.

AB Northern peatlands and permafrost soils are associated with large carbon stocks. Rising temperatures are likely to affect the carbon balance in high-latitude ecosystems, but to what degree is uncertain. We have enhanced the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model by introducing processes necessary to simulate permafrost dynamics, peatland hydrology, and peatland vegetation. The new version, LPJ-WHy v1.2, was used to study soil temperature, active layer depth, permafrost distribution, and water table position. Modeled soil temperatures agreed well with observations, apart from a Siberian site where the soil is insulated by an extensive shrub layer. Water table positions were generally in the range of observations, with some exceptions. Simulated active layer depth showed a mean absolute error of 44 cm when compared to observations, but the error was reduced to 25 cm when the soil type for seven sites was manually corrected to mirror local conditions. A sensitivity test, in which temperature and precipitation were varied independently, showed that soil temperatures and active layer depths increased more under higher temperatures when precipitation was increased at the same time. The sensitivity experiment suggested persisting wet conditions in peatlands even under temperature increases of up to 9 degrees C as long as annual precipitation is allowed to increase with temperature to the extent indicated by climate model experiments.

AB Springs are unique and vulnerable habitats, which have always been rather out of focus of the scientist interest. Nevertheless, they frequently host very diverse and species-rich assemblages with high proportion of species more or less adapted to their unique environment and can act as biodiversity hotspots in some areas. The Western Carpathian springs are helocrene springs and represent wide variety of different habitat types, from mineral rich sparsely-vegetated or bryophytes-rich covered helocrenes to acidic peaty sites. Such diversification allows the creation of highly diverse assemblages, in which Chironomidae usually dominate in both species richness and abundance. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of chironomid assemblages inhabiting the unique environment of spring fens and factors driving the metacommunity structuring and populations of individual taxa. We examined chironomid assemblages of 62 small, treeless helocrenes sites, which are highly isolated from each other by the terrestrial environment constituting dispersal barriers such as the east-west oriented mountain ridges and valleys. The sampling was performed to cover mesohabitat heterogeneity of study sites. Two main mesohabitats were sampled, the plot with flowing water and coarser substratum near water source (the lotic mesohabitat), and water-logged soil with standing water (the lentic mesohabitat). Study sites hosted nearly 100 chironomid taxa, both mesohabitats were inhabited by chironomid assemblages similar in number of species and abundances and the local environment was proved to be the main driver of compositional changes in chironomid assemblages as expected. Moreover, the significant spatial structure of assemblages was found at the lentic mesohabitat, while biotic interactions described by the abundance of Gammarus fossarum and taxa richness and abundances of predators did not significantly contribute to compositional changes in assemblages at any mesohabitat. Nevertheless, taxa-specific responses revealed populations of many taxa significantly affected by biotic interactions, especially at the more stable lotic mesohabitat, which is in concordance with suggested greater importance of biotic interactions at stable environment. Our results emphasized the importance of multilevel approach in community ecology for proper distinction between different mechanisms of metacommunity structuring. Biotic interaction such as competition can result into the same community patterns as environmental filtering, thus the involvement of detailed analyses of species requirements and interactions is necessary.

AB Proxy-based reconstructions of climate variability over the last millennium provide important insights for understanding current climate change within a long-term context. Past hydrological changes are particularly difficult to reconstruct, yet rainfall patterns and variability are among the most critical environmental variables. Ombrotrophic bogs, entirely dependent on water from precipitation and sensitive to changes in the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, are highly suitable for such hydro-climate reconstructions. We present a multi-proxy analysis (testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, stable carbon isotopes in Sphagnum, pollen, spores and macroscopic charcoal) from an ombrotrophic peat profile from the Rodna Mountains (northern Romania) to establish a quantitative record of hydro-climatic changes. We identify five main stages: wet surface mire conditions between AD 800 and 1150 and AD 1800 and 1950, and drying of the mire surface between AD 1300 and 1450, AD 1550 and 1750 and AD 1950 and 2012. Our multi-proxy reconstructions suggest that conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) period (AD 900-1150) were considerably wetter than today, while during most of the Little Ice Age' (LIA; AD 1500-1850), they were dry. Mire surface conditions in the Rodna Mountains have dried markedly over the last 40years mainly as a result of anthropogenic climate change approaching the driest conditions seen over the last 1000years. There is a marked difference between current hydro-climatic conditions (dry mire) and those of the MCA (wet mire). This implies that for the study region, the MCA cannot provide analogous climatic conditions to the contemporary situation. Our reconstructions are in partial agreement with water table estimates elsewhere in central and eastern Europe but generally contrast with those from NW Europe, especially during LIA. We suggest that these distinctive regional differences result from fluctuations in large-scale atmospheric circulation, which determine the relative influences of continental and oceanic air masses.

AB The validation of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) for several wetland types: fen, marsh and bog was undertaken. Incorporating organic soil parameters resulted in a significant improvement in turbulent flux estimates for the vascular dominated fen and marsh wetlands, yet non-vascular bog-type wetlands are relatively poorly modelled Bog surfaces were treated as bare soil surfaces in this testing procedure since the non-vascular nature is not readily incorporated within the current CLASS model vegetation categories. CLASS does not contain a method for moisture transfer from vegetation other than transpiration by the vascular pathway of root, stem and leaf while evaporation of water from moss and lichen dominated surfaces found in bogs is presently Not included. With improved parametrization of the water table already introduced, and an additional non-vascular vegetation category, if should be possible to model accurately the range of wetland types with CLASS.

   ENGLAND; SYSTEMS; WALES; LAKES
AB Inflow of nutrient poor alkaline groundwater is generally seen as a prerequisite for the development of species rich fen vegetation. Drainage and groundwater abstraction may lead to the development of so-called rainwater lenses in the upper groundwater of fens, which prevent upward seeping alkaline groundwater from reaching the fen root zone. This threatens the conservation of the species rich vegetation. To provide insight in rainwater lens dynamics as a basis for conservation and restoration of fen biodiversity, numerical groundwater flow model simulations were performed for a hypothetical case area in the Netherlands.
   The simulations indicate that drainage canal surface water levels mainly affect the phreatic level in the fens, while groundwater inflow fluxes mainly affect the thickness of the rainwater lens. Increasing thickness of a semi-confining surface layer results in a rise in phreatic level. As the phreatic level reaches the soil surface, the rainwater lens may split in two as a result of groundwater discharge windows, which come into existence in the centre of the parcel. The effect of seasonal recharge fluctuations on the rainwater lens appears small. Spells of dry and wet years have a considerably larger effect especially on the lower boundary of the rainwater lens, resulting in thinner lenses during spells of dry years.
   Most simulations show rainwater lens thicknesses well exceeding rooting depths of fen plants. This is inconsistent with the fact that fen vegetation is found in nature reserves for which the simulations are considered representative. Chemical buffer processes in the soil may explain this inconsistency, masking an acidification process under way. As buffer capacities become exhausted over time, acidification and fen deterioration will occur at a certain future moment. To arrive at more definite conclusions about this hypothesis, our simulations of convective groundwater flow need to be supplemented by modelling of hydrochemical processes in rainwater lenses, followed by verification at actual field locations.

AB Climate warming and associated environmental changes lead to compositional shifts and local extinctions in various ecosystems. Species closely associated with rare island-like habitats such as groundwater-dependent spring fens can be severely threatened by these changes due to a limited possibility to disperse. It is, however, largely unknown to what extent mesoclimate affects species composition in spring fens, where microclimate is buffered by groundwater supply. We assembled an original landscape-scale dataset on species composition of the most waterlogged parts of isolated temperate spring fens in the Western Carpathian Mountains along with continuously measured water temperature and hydrological, hydrochemical, and climatic conditions. We explored a set of hypotheses about the effects of mesoclimate air and local spring-water temperature on compositional variation of aquatic (macroinvertebrates), semi-terrestrial (plants) and terrestrial (land snails) components of spring-fen biota, categorized as habitat specialists and other species (i.e. matrix-derived). Water temperature did not show a high level of correlation with mesoclimate. For all components, fractions of compositional variation constrained to temperature were statistically significant and higher for habitat specialists than for other species. The importance of air temperature at the expense of water temperature and its fluctuation clearly increased with terrestriality, i.e. from aquatic macroinvertebrates via vegetation (bryophytes and vascular plants) to land snails, with January air temperature being the most important factor for land snails and plant specialists. Some calcareous-fen specialists with a clear distribution centre in temperate Europe showed a strong affinity to climatically cold sites in our study area and may hence be considered as threatened by climate warming. We conclude that prediction models solely based on air temperature may provide biased estimates of future changes in spring fen communities, because their aquatic and semiterrestrial components are largely affected by water temperature that is modified by local hydrological and landscape settings.

AB The Boreal Shield and James Bay Lowland regions of Ontario have few Holocene reconstructions specific to surface moisture despite their potential importance to documenting the geographic patterns and teleconnections of Holocene pluvials and droughts, as well as their role in the global carbon cycle. We reconstructed water table depth using preserved testate amoebae in four stratigraphic peatland cores, supplemented with a literature review to investigate the effects of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) on surface moisture and long-term apparent carbon accumulation (LARCA) in the regions. A 7320 calendar years before AD 1950 (yrBP) length record registered a wet shift at 4600 yrBP in concert with the HTM and a later post-2550 yrBP shift towards wetter and more stable conditions, possibly related to the Roman Warm Period. During the late-Holocene the three most southern boreal records indicated a lack of droughts during the MCA. Medieval pluvials in boreal Ontario would be consistent with North American precipitation patterns under La Nifia conditions. Of the three wet-warm periods identified (HTM, 2550 yrBP, MCA), the 2550 yrBP shift had the most consistent positive influence on LARCA regionally. Although past precipitation was positively correlated with temperature in the region, recent drying may be indicative of a fundamental change in evaporation-precipitation balance.

AB Industrial development within Canada's boreal zone has increased in recent decades. Forest management activities, pulp and paper operations, electric power generation, mining, conventional oil and gas extraction, nonconventional oil sand development, and peat mining occur throughout the boreal zone with varying impacts on water resources. We review impacts of these industries on surface water, groundwater, and wetlands recognizing that heterogeneity in the dominance of different hydrologic processes (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and runoff generation) across the boreal zone influences the degree of impacts on water resources. Through the application of best management practices, forest certification programs, and science-based guidelines, timber, pulp and paper, and peat industries have reduced their impacts on water resources, although uncertainties remain about long-term recovery following disturbance. Hydroelectric power developments have moved toward reducing reservoir size and creating more natural flow regimes, although impacts of aging infrastructure and dam decommissioning is largely unknown. Mineral and metal mining industries have improved regulation and practices, but the legacy of abandoned mines across the boreal zone still presents an ongoing risk to water resources. Oil and gas industries, including non-conventional resources such as oil sands, is one of the largest industrial users of water and, while significant progress has been made in reducing water use, more work is needed to ensure the protection of water resources. All industries contribute to atmospheric deposition of pollutants that may eventually be released to downstream waters. Although most industrial sectors strive to improve their environmental performance with regards to water resources, disruptions to natural flow regimes and risks of degraded water quality exist at local to regional scales in the boreal zone. Addressing the emerging challenge of managing the expanding, intensifying, and cumulative effects of industries in conjunction with other stressors, such as climate change and atmospheric pollution, across the landscape will aid in preserving Canada's rich endowment of water resources.

AB The article deals with geological and geomorphological conditions of the construction and functioning of wells from the Roman period of the Iron Age in a settlement on the Amber Road. This settlement is located in Central Poland (in the vicinity of Kwiatkow village), on a flat surface of the lower terrace of the Warta River valley, among the dry channels of numerous streams cutting the terrace, which developed in three generations, from the Younger Dryas onwards. In the Holocene, the area was characterised by an abundance of flowing water in a multichannel system and the stability of the groundwater table. Among the archaeological features discovered there, the most interesting is a large complex of well-preserved wells dated to the early Roman period. The structures of the wells were based or dug in an organic series which constituted the terrace profile at a depth of between 2.0 and 2.5 m, dated to the late Allerod and the Younger Dryas. In the study, the authors focus on the purpose of locating a large number of wells within a relatively small area abundant with numerous streams. The authors used a range of methods, including lithological and textural analyses, a geochronological analysis and a geochemical examination to describe the properties of the deposits and the quality of the waters. The characteristics of the wells were provided from dendrochronological studies. The archaeological approach included an analysis of the features morphology and the stage of technological advancement, as well as the diversity of the wells' casings. The spatial and functional relationships of the locations of the wells were also given special attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Riparian zones along streams and other small wetlands perform important ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. They improve water quality by retaining nutrients and sediment from through-flowing water, sequester carbon and attenuate flood peaks at high discharge. At the same time, they have been shown to enhance biodiversity at the landscape as well as regional scale. However, there is concern about loss of biodiversity and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions where wetlands have become overloaded with nutrient-rich surface water or groundwater. This paper discusses conditions for the best performance of riparian zones and other small wetlands in agricultural landscapes in terms of nutrient and greenhouse gas retention and biodiversity.
   High nitrous oxide emissions have been identified in riparian zones used for N removal and could be a concern which would diminish their overall environmental benefit. However, it has been shown in riparian zones in the Rhine and Scheldt catchment that nitrous oxide emissions mainly occur when soil pH values are lower than 5. Such conditions occur mostly in stream headwater areas only where sandy sediments have a low buffering capacity, whereas higher-order streams and their riparian zones often have fine silty clay or loam sediments with higher pH values, supporting effective denitrification with low nitrous oxide emission.
   The question whether the nutrient attenuation service comes at the expense of biodiversity losses should be answered differently for existing, (semi-)natural wetlands and for new wetlands created in the agricultural landscape. Existing wetlands are quite vulnerable for nutrient loading, depending on their natural nutrient richness. Oligotrophic and mesotrophic wetlands such as bogs and fens are negatively affected by nutrient loadings > 4 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 0.5 g P m(-2) y(-1), which lead to loss of diversity and characteristic species. Wetlands in riparian zones are naturally more nutrient-rich and can tolerate much higher nutrient loadings without consequences for ecosystem health and diversity, their loading limits are 50 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 4 g P m(-2) y(-1). For nitrogen the relatively high limit is explained by significant denitrification activities in wetlands, transforming nitrate to mostly inert elemental nitrogen gas. There are also indications that only one of the major nutrients needs to be in short supply (i.e. below the limits indicated) in order to avoid major eutrophication problems. In agricultural areas where large numbers of wetlands have been created for N removal and biodiversity enhancement, the experience of this 'dual purpose' are generally positive, particularly in landscapes where not much of the original wetland resource remains.

AB The capability of peatland ecosystems to regulate evapotranspiration (ET) following wildfire is a key control on the resilience of their globally important carbon stocks under future climatic conditions. Evaporation dominates post-fire ET, with canopy and sub-canopy removal restricting transpiration and increasing evaporation potential. Therefore, in order to project the hydrology and associated stability of peatlands to a diverse range of post-fire weather conditions and future climates the regulation of evaporation must be accurately parameterised in peatland ecohydrological models. To achieve this, we measure the surface resistance (r(s)) to evaporation over the growing season one year post-fire within four zones of a boreal peatland that burned to differing depths, relating r(s) to near surface soil tensions. We show that the magnitude and temporal variability in r(s) varies with burn severity. At the peatland scale, r(s) and near-surface tension correlates non-linearly. However, at the point scale no relationship was evident between temporal variations in r(s) and near-surface tension across all burn severities; in part due to the limited fluctuation in near-surface tensions and the precision of r(s) measurements. Where automated measurements enabled averaging of errors, the relationship between near-surface tension and r(s) switched between periods of strong and weak correlation within a burned peat hummock. This relationship, when strong, deviated from that obtained under steady state laboratory conditions; increases in r(s) were more sensitive to fluctuations in near-surface tension under dynamic field conditions. Calculating soil vapour densities directly from near-surface tensions is shown to require calibration between peat types and provides little if any benefit beyond the derivation of empirical relationships between r(s) and measured soil tension. Thus, we demonstrate important spatiotemporal fluctuations in post-fire r(s) that will be key to regulating post-fire peatland hydrology, but highlight the complex challenges in effectively parameterising this important underlying control of near-surface tensions within hydrological simulations.

AB Permafrost covers approximately 24% of the Northern Hemisphere, and much of it is degrading, which causes infrastructure failures and ecosystem transitions. Understanding groundwater and heat flow processes in permafrost environments is challenging due to spatially and temporarily varying hydraulic connections between water above and below the near-surface discontinuous frozen zone. To characterize the transitional period of permafrost degradation, a three-dimensional model of a permafrost plateau that includes the supra-permafrost zone and surrounding wetlands was developed. The model is based on the Scotty Creek basin in the Northwest Territories, Canada. FEFLOW groundwater flow and heat transport modeling software is used in conjunction with the piFreeze plug-in, to account for phase changes between ice and water. The Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) flow model is used to calculate ground temperatures and surface water balance, which are then used as FEFLOW boundary conditions. As simulating actual permafrost evolution would require hundreds of years of climate variations over an evolving landscape, whose geomorphic features are unknown, methodologies for developing permafrost initial conditions for transient simulations were investigated. It was found that a model initialized with a transient spin-up methodology, that includes an unfrozen layer between the permafrost table and ground surface, yields better results than with steady-state permafrost initial conditions. This study also demonstrates the critical role that variations in land surface and permafrost table microtopography, along with talik development, play in permafrost degradation. Modeling permafrost dynamics will allow for the testing of remedial measures to stabilize permafrost in high value infrastructure environments.

AB We characterized the major ion chemistry of over 800 lakes on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, from a probability sample of 59 lakes (August 1988). There were two groups: alkalinity < 300 mueq/L (78% of the lakes) and alkalinity > 700 mueq/L. Low-alkalinity lakes had significantly lower concentrations of base cations and silica and significantly higher average concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than high-alkalinity lakes. Despite widespread acidic soils and bog vegetation, and resulting high DOC concentrations, none of the lakes sampled was acidic. Sulfate concentrations (approximately 3 mueq/L) were similar in the two groups, as were Cl- concentrations, which decreased with distance from the coast. High-alkalinity lakes were similar chemically to rivers and shallow aquifers in the region, suggesting that the high alkalinity is a product of the major weathering reactions in this terrain; the substantially different ratios of base cations in the two groups also indicate quantitative and qualitative weathering differences. Low-alkalinity lakes were at higher elevations than high-alkalinity lakes, presumably in groundwater recharge zones. Consequently, the chemical differences between the two lake groups appeared to be controlled by relatively small differences in local hydrologic setting, and possibly by differences in mineralogy along the groundwater flowpaths.

AB Question Fens have a well-developed bryophyte layer covering most of the ground. Non-sphagnaceous bryophytes, especially the group of so-called brown mosses, prevail over sphagna under alkaline conditions. In sub-alkaline conditions, rich fens allow the co-occurrence of both these functional groups, but sphagna are competitively superior over non-sphagnaceous bryophytes and seedlings of vascular plants, and they are currently expanding in some regions. We test whether the ratio between the two major bryophyte functional groups (bryo-ratio) accounts for the species composition of vascular plants in fens. Location Central and Eastern Europe. Methods Analysis of two existing regional- and continental-scale data sets of the vegetation- plot records and measured local factors by Canonical Correspondence Analysis with variation partitioning (community-level analysis) and Structural Equation Modelling (species-level analysis). Results At the community level, the bryo-ratio accounted significantly for species composition of fen-specialized vascular plants, more obviously in the regional-scale data set. At the species level, more fen species (50-67% according to the data set) were significantly directly affected (adjusted p < 0.05) by the bryo-ratio than by water pH (14-17%) and by measured water table depth (WTD) in the regional data set (12.5%). In the continental data set, the comparable proportions of species were directly affected by the bryo-ratio and WTD inferred by soil moisture indicator values (50% vs 58%). Most of the species affected significantly by the bryo-ratio preferred the fens rich in non-sphagnaceous bryophytes. They were largely those with a low capability of vegetative reproduction. Conclusions The group of species preferring brown moss patches includes mostly rare and endangered species with a great need for generative reproduction (e.g., Primula farinosa, Triglochin palustris, Pedicularis palustris, Saxifraga hirculus). Our findings demonstrate the important role of the bryophyte layer in the structuring of vascular plant communities in fens and highlight urgent conservation needs for brown moss patches.

AB Long-term increases in DOC concentration in rivers draining areas of upland peat are a ubiquitous phenomenon in the UK. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these increases, but one compelling explanation is the observed long-term increase in temperature in UK uplands causing increases in peat decomposition rates, and increasing the depth of oxidation as evaporation increases depth to the water table. The study constructed an empirical model for water table depth and decomposition rate calibrated against observations from the Environmental Change Network monitoring site at Moor House in the North Pennines, UK. The study shows: (i) Depth of the water table has not changed significantly over a 30-year period, reflecting the fact that blanket peat is well buffered against climate change. (ii) Increases in temperature are responsible for a 12% increase in DOC production while an approximate 78% increase in DOC production has been observed. (iii) Overall DOC production is predicted to rise by 6% but observation suggests increases on the scale of 97%. (iv) The model inadequately represents changes in production and supply of DOC during periods of severe drought. The study shows that temperature change alone is insufficient to explain observed increases in DOC production. Alternative explanations for large increases in DOC production could include changes in land management, but an enzymic latch mechanism, i.e. derepression of anaerobic degradation, causing increased decomposition rates in response to severe drought is preferred.

AB The surficial geology of the Woodstock 7.5-minute Quadrangle, which is located in the northwest part of the Chicago-Metropolitan Area, was mapped to better address natural resource issues and better understand local geologic history. In the study area, the population is dependent completely upon groundwater for water supplies, and groundwater withdrawals are expected to increase dramatically in coming decades. The landscape and surficial geologic materials in the Woodstock Quadrangle are a result of numerous glaciations during the Quaternary. Surficial sand and gravel deposits, along with buried outwash deposits from older glacial events, constitute important aquifer and aggregate resources for local residents and industry. The landscape within the Woodstock Quadrangle includes glacial moraines, ice-walled lake plains, kettles, incised valleys, and glacial lacustrine deposits. These landforms, coupled with the thick glacial sediments, record a complicated geologic history associated with glacial processes and paleoclimate change. The surficial geologic map of the Woodstock Quadrangle consists of seven lithostratigraphic units associated with the most recent Wisconsinan glaciations in North America. These geologic units include multiple till deposits, outwash sediments, lacustrine sediments, and modern alluvium and peat deposits. This map provides the base geologic knowledge for planners, decision-makers, and other scientists.

AB A comparative study of forest clear-cut logging effects on daily growing season (May to October) net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of adjacent peatlands was conducted in two neighbouring forest upland-peatland complexes over 4 years (2005 to 2008) on the Boreal Plains (BP) of Alberta, Canada. Higher vapour pressure deficit at the harvested-upland (H-U) peatland, reflecting increased turbulent mixing after adjacent upland forest removal (2007 and 2008), resulted in increased peatland evapotranspiration rates that contributed to a seasonal decline in soil moisture (volumetric moisture content) influencing NEE. Overall, a significant change in mid-season NEE occurred at the H-U peatland 1 year post-harvesting, greater than NEE changes at the neighbouring intact-upland peatland. However, 2 years post-harvesting, mid-season NEE returned to within range of pre-harvesting variability (-0.54 to 1.34 g CO2-Cm-2 day(-1)). Results of this study demonstrate that BP peatland NEE is largely regulated by site-specific water availability, which, in turn, may be influenced in the short term by shifting microclimate and soil moisture patterns because of clear-cut logging. As such, predicting long-term carbon storage function of BP peatlands will require careful consideration of changing hydroclimatic conditions because of rapid expansion of BP deforestation, given that these ecosystems already exist in a state of hydrologic risk in this moisture deficit eco-region.

AB Rewetting combined with biomass crop cultivation (paludiculture) has been proposed as a method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from drained peatlands. This field experiment compared CO2 fluxes from drained (control) and rewetted experimental plots in a temperate fen under reed canary grass cultivation over two successive years. The annual weighted mean water table depth from soil surface (WTD) during the study period was 9, 3 and 1 cm in control, semi-flooded and flooded plots, respectively. There were no significant effects of WTD treatment on biomass yields. The choice of response model for CO2 fluxes influenced annual estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP), but all models showed that ER and GPP decreased in response to rewetting. The resulting net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, derived by combining eight ER and eight GPP models, varied widely. For example, NEE (expressed as CO2-C) ranged from -935 to -208 g m(-2) yr(-1) for the flooded plots. One set of ER and GPP models was selected on the basis of statistical criteria and showed insignificant differences in NEE between the three water table treatments (-537 to -341 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Treatment effects on CO2 emission factors, calculated as the sum of NEE and C export in harvested biomass (58-242 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)), were similarly insignificant. Thus, the results indicated that varying WTD within this narrow range could influence both ER and GPP without altering the net emissions of CO2.

AB Although it has become increasingly clear that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play important roles in population, community, and ecosystem ecology, there is limited information on the spatial structure of the community composition of AMF in the field. We assessed small-scale spatial variation in the abundance and molecular diversity of AMF in a calcareous fen, where strong underlying environmental gradients such as depth to water table may influence AMF. Throughout an intensively sampled 2 x 2 m plot, we assessed AMF inoculum potential at a depth of 0-6 and 6-12 cm and molecular diversity of the AMF community using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of 18S rDNA. Inoculum potential was only significantly spatially autocorrelated at a depth of 6-12 cm and was significantly positively correlated with depth to water table at both depths. Molecular diversity of the AMF community was highly variable within the plot, ranging from 2-14 terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) per core, but the number of T-RFs did not relate to water table or plant species richness. Plant community composition was spatially autocorrelated at small scales, but AMF community composition showed no significant spatial autocorrelation. Saturated soils of calcareous fens contain many infective AMF propagules and the abundance and diversity of AMF inoculum is patchy over small spatial scales.

AB Land-use changes have contributed to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Conversion from natural peatlands to agricultural land has led to widespread subsidence of the peat surface caused by soil compaction and mineralization. To study the net ecosystem exchange of carbon (C) and the contribution of respiration to peat subsidence, eddy covariance measurements were made over pasture on a well-developed, drained peat soil from 22 May 2002 to 21 May 2003. The depth to the water table fluctuated between 0.02 m in winter 2002 to 0.75 m during late summer and early autumn 2003. Peat soil moisture content varied between 0.6 and 0.7 m(3) m(-3) until the water table dropped below 0.5 m, when moisture content reached 0.38 m(3) m(-3). Neither depth to water table nor soil moisture was found to have an effect on the rate of night-time respiration (ranging from 0.4-8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in winter and summer, respectively). Most of the variance in night-time respiration was explained by changes in the 0.1 m soil temperature (r(2)=0.93). The highest values for daytime net ecosystem exchange were measured in September 2002, with a maximum of -17.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Grazing events and soil moisture deficiencies during a short period in summer reduced net CO2 exchange. To establish an annual C balance for this ecosystem, non-linear regression was used to model missing data. Annually integrated (CO2) C exchange for this peat-pasture ecosystem was 45 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). After including other C exchanges (methane emissions from cows and production of milk), the net annual C loss was 1061 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB Effects of depression depth (Z(T)), lake surface elevation (E-S), catchment area:lake surface area (A(T):A(O)), trophic status, and surficial geology on sediment burial rates in small Western Boreal Plain lakes were assessed using content and chronology of cores from a relatively large and small lake on each of moraine (M), glaciofluvial (GF), and glaciolacustrine (GL) deposits. Aquatic and terrestrial plant and sediment carbon:nitrogen (C:N) suggested most buried C was aquatic. The rate of long-term total C burial averaged 31 g(.)m(-2). year(-1) (range: 0-84 g(.)m(-2) (.) year(-1)); this was recently 79 g(.)m(-2). year(-1) (range: 40-180 g(.)m(-2.)year(-1)) (higher and more variable rates than previously reported for Boreal lakes). Long-term C accrual rate and sediment depth increased with increasing Z(T). In each landform, a relatively low base elevation (EB = E-S - Z(T)) lake began accumulating sediment thousands of years before a high EB lake. GF depressions were deeper and had accrued more C(.)m(-2) (and infilled) faster than M and GL lakes; a large GF lake had no organic sediment, perhaps because of large groundwater inputs. Increasing A(T):A(O) corresponded with increasing C accrual rates where precipitation and evaporation dominated (surface runoff infrequent) (M and GL) but not where groundwater dominated (GF lakes) lake water budgets, illustrating the importance of landform and depression characteristics in regionalizing lake-C burial estimates.

AB The A-ren and Yatagan Basins in SW Turkey host several Miocene coal deposits currently under exploitation for power generation. The present study aims to provide insight into the palaeoenvironmental conditions, which controlled the formation of the Husamlar coal seam located in A-ren Basin. The coal seam displays many sharp alternations of matrix lignite beds and inorganic, lacustrine sediment layers. The coal is a medium-to-high ash lignite (10.47-31.16 wt%, on dry basis) with high total sulphur content (up to 10 wt%, on dry, ash-free basis), which makes it prone to self-combustion. The maceral composition indicates that the peat-forming vegetation consisted of both arboreal and herbaceous plants, with the latter being predominant in the upper part of the seam. Mica and feldspars contribute to the low part of the seam; carbonates are dominant in the upper part, whereas quartz and pyrite are present along the entire coal profile. The sudden transitions of the telmatic to the lacustrine regime and reverse is attributed to tectonic movements that controlled water table levels in the palaeomire, which affected surface runoff and hence, clastic deposition.

AB The partitioning of latent heat flux (Q(E)) to vascular plant and moss surface components was assessed for a Sphagnum-dominated bog with a hummock-hollow surface having a sparse canopy of low shrubs. Results from porometry and eddy covariance measurements of Q(E) showed evaporation from the moss surface ranged from greater than 50% of total Q(E) early in the growing season to less than 20% after a dry period toward the end of the growing season. Both soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit (D-a) affected this partitioning with drier moss and peat, lower water table. and smaller D-a all reducing MOSS Q(E). Daily maximum moss Q(E) ranged from greater than 200 W m(-2) early in the growing season to less than 100 W m(-2) during a dry period. In contrast, vascular contribution to total QE increased over the season from a daily maximum of about 150 W m(-2) to 250 W m(-2) due to increase in leaf area by leaf replacement and emergence and to drying of the moss surface. Porometry results showed average daily maximum conductance from bog shrubs was near 8 mm s(-1). These conductance values were smaller than those reported for vascular plants from more nutrient-rich wetlands. The effect of increases in D-a on vascular QE were moderated by decreases in stomatal conductance. At constant available energy, vascular leaf conductance was reduced by as much as 2 mm s(-1) and moss surface conductance was enhanced by up to 3 mm s(-1) by large D-a. Considering vascular and non-vascular water transport characteristics and frequency of water table position and given the observed variations of Q(E) partitioning with water table location and moss and peat water content, it is suggested that modelling efforts focus on how dry hummocks and wet hollows each contribute to Q(E), especially as related to D-a and soil moisture dynamics.

AB The cell density, activity, and community structure of the bacterial community in wetland sediments were monitored over a 13-month period. The study was performed at Cedar Bog, an alkaline fen. The objective was to characterize the relationship between the sediment bacterial community in groundwater upwelling zones and the physical and chemical factors which might influence the community structure and activity. DNA, protein, and lipid synthesis were measured at three different upwelling zones by using [H-3]thymidine, [C-14]leucine, and [C-14]glucose incorporation, respectively. The physiological status (apparent stress) of the consortium was assessed by comparing [C-14]glucose incorporation into membrane and that into storage lipids. Bacterial cell density was determined by acridine orange direct counts, and gross bacterial community structure was determined by bisbenzimidazole-cesium chloride gradient analysis of total bacterial community DNA. Both seasonal and site-related covariation were observed in all estimates of bacterial biomass and activity. Growth rate estimates and cell density peaked in late July at 2.5 x 10(8) cells/g/day and 2.7 x 10(9) cells/g, respectively, and decreased in December to 2.0 x 10(7) cells/g/day and 1.5 x 10(9) cells/g, respectively. Across sites, membrane-to-storage-lipid ratios were generally highest in late spring and peaked in September for one site. Overall, the data indicate dynamic seasonal differences in sediment bacterial community activity and physiology, possibly in response to changing physical and chemical environmental factors which included the C/N/P ratios of the perfusing groundwater. By contrast, total cell numbers were rather constant, and community structure analysis indicated that the overall community structure was similar throughout the study.

AB Transpiration of a central European endemic tree species, Pinus rotundata Link, growing on a wooded peat bog in the TA (TM) eboA Basin, Czech Republic, was studied in 1999-2000. Transpiration was measured by sap flow techniques (heat field deformation method) on individual trees and scaled up to stand level. The radial patterns of sap flow density showed narrow peaks in the outer part of the xylem, sapwood accounted for 47-60% of the xylem radius and 72-84% of the xylem basal area. Adult trees tolerated well both short-term flooding during the growing season and drawdown of the water table to a depth of 60 cm below ground level. The maximum and mean daily transpiration rates were 3.0 and 1.8 mm per day, and were thus similar to published data for Scots pine. The seasonal total transpiration (25 April-20 October 2000, 180 days) amounted to 322 mm, or 62% of the potential evapotranspiration over this period. This canopy transpiration was compensated by 319 mm of precipitation. The difference between the accumulated precipitation and the accumulated transpiration (derived from seasonal sap flow measurements) closely mimicked the seasonal course of the water table.

AB The Okavango Delta is a large, low gradient (ca. 1:3400), alluvial fan situated in a graben structure which is an extension of the East African Rift system. The catchment is situated in sub-tropical central Angola (rainfall ca. 1000 mm/a), and is underlain by Kalahari sand. Okavango River water therefore has a very low dissolved solid content (ca. 40 ppm), and a very low suspended load. The main elastic sediment load consists of eroded Kalahari sand, which is transported as bedload. Base flow in the river sustains about 4000 km(2) of permanent swamps in the Panhandle and upper fan. The latter are flanked by seasonal swamps, which become inundated during advance of the seasonal flood wave. This flood wave takes four months to traverse the 250 km length of the fan. The extent of seasonal flooding is variable and can exceed 12 000 km(2). The fan is situated in a semi-arid region (rainfall 513 mm/a), in which evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall by a factor of three. Only 1.5% of inflow plus rainfall leaves the fan as surface flow, the rest being lost to the atmosphere. All of the elastic sediment load and most of the solute load is deposited on the fan. In the Panhandle region, bedload deposition occurs on point bars in a meandering river system, and produces alluvial ridges. Periodic avulsions give rise to anastomosis of the channel. Sedimentation patterns on the fan at the lower end of the Panhandle are closely tied to ecosystem function. Channel margins in the permanent swamps consist of peat, stabilised by papyrus, and are permeable. Water leaks from the channels, causing channel bed aggradation. Loss of water and aggradation in primary channels leads to channel failure, and the destruction of the accumulated peat by fire. Leaked water flows along hippo trails in the backswamps, giving rise to secondary distributary channel systems. Constant change in primary channel location creates a mosaic of wetland habitats in different successional stages, from open water to near climax aquatic grassland habitats. Little elastic sediment reaches the seasonal swamps, and the main sedimentary process is by precipitation of solutes, primarily as a consequence of transpiration. Aquatic plants induce saturation in silica in interstitial water in the root zone. Trees, which grow exclusively on islands, are responsible for intense transpirational water loss which induces saturation in calcite, the precipitation of which results in vertical expansion and hence island growth. Groundwater beneath these islands eventually becomes saline, resulting in species zonation. Islands are initiated by termites, or result from topographic inversion associated with channel failure. The resulting undulating topography creates a variety of habitats which vary in their duration of flooding, and hence in their species composition.

AB During the last 15-20 years, re-establishment of freshwater riparian wetlands and remeandering of streams and rivers have been used as a tool to mitigate nutrient load in downstream recipients in Denmark. The results obtained on monitoring four different streams and wetland restoration projects are compared with respect to hydrology, i.e. flow pattern and discharge of ground or surface water, retention of phosphorus (P), and removal of nitrogen (N). Furthermore, the monitoring strategies applied for quantifying the post-restoration nutrient retention are evaluated. The four wetland restoration projects are the Brede River restoration (including river valley groundwater flow, remeandering and inundation), Lyngbygaards River restoration (groundwater flow, irrigation with drainage water, inundation with river water and remeandering), Egeskov fen (fen re-establishment and stream remeandering) and Egebjerg Meadows (fen restoration and hydrological reconnection to Store Hansted River). Retention of phosphorus varied between 0.13 and 10 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), while the removal of nitrogen varied between 52 and 337 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The monitoring strategy chosen was not optimal at all sites and would have benefitted from a knowledge on local hydrology and water balances in the area to be restored before planning for the final monitoring design. Furthermore, the outcome concerning P retention would have benefitted from a more frequent sampling strategy.

AB The forested Coalburn catchment 1.5 km(2) in northern England experiences episodic stream acidification. In plan for sustainable management of the plantation forest cycle, an understanding is required of the flow pathways and hydrochemical routing signatures of the organic and mineral soils that make up the source areas for runoff. A tentative mixing model, based on simple water chemistry exists for the major (terrestrial) sources and buffers of acidification; it is being expanded and consolidated by a detailed approach to the organic components of runoff, via sampling and analysis of the luminescence of surface waters at the catchment outlet and in two distinctive feeder streams. Luminescence measurements are presented that permit a simple apportionment of source areas. However, the technique also appears to have potential for identifying differential flow sourcing between the acrotelm and catotelm of intact peat deposits and for clarifying the influence of forest root systems in altering the organic chemistry of infiltrating waters. Applications may include the monitoring and prediction of coloured water events for the water supply industry. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Drained and cultivated fen peats represent some of the world's most productive soils, however, they are susceptible to degradation and typically exhibit high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. We hypothesised that GHG losses from these soils could be reduced by manipulating water table depth, tillage regime, crop residue application or horticultural fleece cover. Using intact soil columns from a horticultural peatland, emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were monitored over a six-month period, using a closed-chamber method. Concurrent measurements of soil properties allowed identification of the key controls on GHG emissions. Raising the water table to the soil surface provided the strongest reduction in global warming potential (GWP(100); 25 +/- 6 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), compared to a free-draining control (80 +/- 1 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), but this effect was partially negated by an emission pulse when the water table was subsequently lowered. The highest emissions occurred when the water table was maintained 15 cm below the surface (168 +/- 11 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), as this stimulated N2O loss. Placement of horticultural fleece over the soil surface during spring had no significant effect on GWP100, but prolonged fleece application exacerbated GHG emissions. Leaving lettuce crop residues on the surface increased soil GWP(100) (105 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)) in comparison to when residues were incorporated into the soil (85 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), however, there was no evidence that this promoted positive priming of native soil organic matter (SOM). For maximum abatement potential, mitigation measures should be applied during the growing season, when GHG emissions are greatest. Our results also suggest that introduction of zero or minimum-till practices may not reduce GHG emissions. Maintaining a high water table was the only option that reliably reduced GHG emissions, however, this option is impractical to implement within current horticultural systems. We conclude that alternative strategies or a major change in land use (e.g., conversion from horticulture/arable to wetland) should be explored as a means of preserving these soils for future generations.

AB Testate amoebae analysis has been shown to be a valuable technique to reconstruct peatland palaeohydrology and thereby past climate change. However there is cause for concern over the potential impact of differential preservation on the record. To investigate the impact of various environmental factors a sequence of Sphagnum samples were subjected to treatment with weak acid, nutrient enrichment and desiccation over 28-months and shorter-term experiments with stronger acids. Changes were subtle but statistically significant with three treatments: long-term dessication and short-term acid treatment at two different concentrations. Results suggest that in dry periods the palaeoecological record may be skewed by differential preservation of tests, potentially leading to over-estimation of water table depths.

AB Diurnal variation in the rate of methane emission and its relation to water table depth and macro climate was studied in several plant communities within an acid, Sphagnum dominated, mixed mire in Northern Sweden. Provided that diurnal variation in solar radiation and air temperature occurred, methane fluxes differed during day and night. Diurnal patterns in methane emission rates were found to differ among mire plant communities. In relatively dry plant communities (ridges, minerotrophic lawn), the average nighttime emission rates were 2-3 times higher than the daytime rates during the two periods with high diurnal variation in solar radiation and air temperature. Methane emission was significantly (p < 0.05) related to solar radiation and soil temperature at depths of 5 and 10 cm at all sampling points in the dry plant communities. In the wetter plant communities, no significant difference between daytime and nighttime average methane emission rates were found even though methane emissions were significantly related with radiation and soil temperature at approximately 70% of the sampling points. The increased emission rate for methane at night in the comparatively dry plant communities was probably caused by an inhibition of methane oxidation, owing to the lower nighttime temperatures or to a delay in the supply of root-exuded substrate for the anaerobic bacteria, or by both. The pattern observed in the wet plant communities indicated that methane production were positively related either to soil temperature or light-regulated root exudation.

AB Wetlands serve as sinks for carbon and nutrients but they are also a large source of greenhouse gases. Our objective was to quantify emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from three free water surface-flow constructed wetlands in the presence and absence of emergent herbaceous vegetation (Typha angustifolia L. and Typha latifolia L.) across a gradient of soil moisture. Measurements were collected on eight sampling dates during June and July, 2014. Similar to previous research, CO2 emissions were higher in vegetated plots, increasing from a median +/- A std. error of 242 +/- A 29 to 1612 +/- A 95 mg m(-2) h(-1). Emissions of CH4 were also significantly higher in vegetated plots, but the relative magnitude of the effect of plants varied among wetlands. Emissions of CH4 were highest from vegetated plots in the wetland with the highest soil moisture (4.4 +/- A 1.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)). However, the largest effect of plants on methane emissions occurred in the wetland with intermediate soil moisture, with a 15-fold increase in CH4 emissions from 0.15 +/- A 0.90 to 2.4 +/- A 1.2 mg m(-2) h(-1). Design and management that consider the interactive effects of soil moisture and plants on CH4 emissions may help reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of constructed wetlands.

AB Spatial patterning of ecosystems can be explained by several mechanisms. One approach to disentangling the influence of these mechanisms is to study a patterned ecosystem along a gradient of environmental conditions. This study focused on hummock-hollow patterning of peatlands. Previous models predicted that patterning in drainage-dominated peatlands is driven by a peat-accumulation mechanism, reflected by higher nutrient availability in hollows relative to hummocks. Alternatively, patterning in evapotranspiration (ET)-dominated peatlands may be driven by a nutrient-accumulation mechanism, reflected by reversed nutrient distribution, namely, higher nutrient availability in hummocks relative to hollows. Here, we tested these predictions by comparing nutrient distributions among patterned peatlands in maritime (Scotland), humid temperate (Sweden), and humid continental (Siberia) climates. The areas comprise a climatic gradient from very wet and drainage-dominated (Scotland) to less wet and ET-dominated (Siberia) peatlands. Nutrient distribution was quantified as resource contrast, a measure for hummock-hollow difference in nutrient availability. We tested the hypothesis that the climatic gradient shows a trend in the resource contrast; from negative (highest nutrient availability in hollows) in Scotland to positive (highest nutrient availability in hummocks) in Siberia. The resource contrasts as measured in vegetation indeed showed a trend along the climatic gradient: contrasts were negative to slightly positive in Scotland, positive in Sweden, and strongly positive in Siberia. This finding corroborates the main prediction of previous models. Our results, however, also provided indications for further model development. The low concentrations of nutrients in the water suggest that existing models could be improved by considering both the dissolved and adsorbed phase and explicit inclusion of both nutrient-uptake and nutrient-storage processes. Our study suggests that future climate change may affect the ecosystem functioning of patterned peatlands by altering the contribution of pattern-forming mechanisms to redistribution of water and nutrients within these systems.

AB Vermicompost filtration is a new on-site waste treatment system. Consequently, little is known about the filter medium properties. The aim of this preliminary study was to quantify physical and compositional properties of vermicompost filter beds that had been used to treat domestic solid organic waste and wastewater. This paper presents the trials performed on pilot-scale reactors filled with vermicompost from a full-scale vermicompost filtration system. Household solid organic waste and raw wastewater at the rate of 130 L/m(2)/d was applied to the reactor bed surface over a four-month period. It was found that fresh casts laid on the bed surface had a BOD of 1290 mg/g VS while casts buried to a depth of 10 cm had a BOD of 605 mg/g VS. Below this depth there was little further biodegradation of earthworm casts despite cast ages of up to five years. Solid material in the reactor accounted for only 7-10% of the reactor volume. The total voidage comprised of large free-draining pores, which accounted for 15-20% of the reactor volume and 60-70% micropores, able to hold up water against gravity. It was shown that water could flow through the medium micropores and macropores following a wastewater application. The wastewater flow characteristics were modeled by a two-region model based on the Richards Equation, an equation used to describe porous spatially heterogeneous materials.

AB Fire is known to impact soil properties and hydrological flow paths. However, the impact of prescribed vegetation burning on blanket peatland hydrology is poorly understood. We studied 10 blanket peat headwater catchments. Five were subject to prescribed burning, while five were unburnt controls. Within the burnt catchments, we studied plots where the last burn occurred similar to 2 (B2), 4 (B4), 7 (B7), or greater than 10 years (B10+) prior to the start of measurements. These were compared with plots at similar topographic wetness index locations in the control catchments. Plots subject to prescribed vegetation burning had significantly deeper water tables (difference in means=5.3 cm) and greater water table variability than unburnt plots. Water table depths were significantly different between burn age classes (B2> B4> B7> B10+) while B10+ water tables were not significantly different to the unburnt controls. Overland flow was less common on burnt peat than on unburnt peat, recorded in 9% and 17% of all runoff trap visits, respectively. Storm lag times and hydrograph recession limb periods were significantly greater (by similar to 1 and 13 h on average, respectively) in the burnt catchments overall, but for the largest 20% of storms sampled, there was no significant difference in storm lag times between burnt and unburnt catchments. For the largest 20% of storms, the hydrograph intensity of burnt catchments was significantly greater than those of unburnt catchments (means of 4.2 x 10(-5) and 3.4 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively), thereby indicating a nonlinear streamflow response to prescribed burning. Together, these results from plots to whole river catchments indicate that prescribed vegetation burning has important effects on blanket peatland hydrology at a range of spatial scales.

AB This study considers long-term records of the nature of water colour and coincident water quality and quantity in order to test hypotheses about increases in release of dissolved organic carbon from peat soils across the northern hemisphere. The study focuses upon the treatment ratio, e. the ratio of the amount of coagulant dose required to the water colour of the incoming water, and compares this ratio to possible explanatory variables: pH, conductivity, water temperature, river flow and alkalinity. The study shows that:
   (i) The annual average increase in treatment ratio is just less than 6.5% over a six year period.
   (ii) There is a long-term increase in the treatment ratio that is independent of changes in riverflow, pH, conductivity, water temperature and alkalinity and so a real change in DOC composition is occurring.
   (iii) There is a seasonal cycle in treatment ratio that is also independent of the available water and climate variables.
   (iv) The upward trend in treatment ratio is declining with time over the study period.
   The observed trends in DOC composition are consistent with an explanation of increasing DOC concentration and flux based upon changes in flow and temperature but is not consistent with present explanations based upon changes in atmospheric deposition or upon drought unless the effect of the drought are short-lived (1-2 years).

TI Ecosystem-scale flux of CO2 from a restored vacuum harvested peatland
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE carbon dioxide; eddy correlation; evapotranspiration; peatland;
   restoration
AB At the ecosystem scale, the water and gas exchange processes are strongly coupled. Drainage and removal of a peatland's surface vegetation cover for peat harvesting alters its hydrology, and as a direct consequence the carbon budget. Previous studies have measured peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange using the chamber methodology. These studies have indicated that the spatial and temporal variability is large, suggesting the need for continuous ecosystem-scale measurements. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum-harvested peatland in eastern Quebec, Canada, using the eddy correlation measurement approach.
   Results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat. Evapotranspiration from the restored site was 20 and 25% less than that from an adjacent abandoned comparison site in 2000 and 2001 respectively. However, CO2 emissions remain large during non-snow periods (478 and 468 g C m(-2) in 2000 and 2001, respectively). The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture and thermal conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations.

ID EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA
AB Peat soils in the Everglades Agricultural area of south Florida are subsiding and releasing nutrients in waterways due to decomposition by aerobic microorganisms. Restoring peat soil in the Everglades involves adding organic matter back to the soil as did the native sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) in predrainage time and removing nutrients from soil water. It is not certain if sawgrass is more efficient at accumulating dry matter (DM) than agricultural crops. This experiment was conducted to compare DM yield distributions and root morphology of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), sawgrass, and St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] growing under different water-table depths. Plants were grown outside in 38-L pots containing a Pahokee muck soil (Euic, hyperthermic Lithic Haplosaprist) under 15- and 30-cm water tables. All plants were harvested after 11 mo. Across water-table treatments, sugarcane produced 55 kg m(-2) total DM (above plus below ground), while sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass had similar total DM yields averaging 5 kg m(-1). Sawgrass allocated 34% of its DM below ground averaged across water-table depths compared with 14 and 8% for sugarcane and St. Augustinegrass, respectively. However, sugarcane had 4 and 20 times more below ground DM than sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass, respectively. Sugarcane had 308 km m(-3) of total root length averaged across water-table treatments compared with an average of 24 km m(-1) for sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass, indicating that sugarcane had a much greater potential for absorbing nutrients. Sugarcane appears to have potential for building peat soil in the Everglades while reducing nutrient loading in ground water and allowing for coexistence of agriculture in soil restoration efforts.

AB Major, trace, rare-earth elements, and noble metal have been analyzed from the brown coal of the Amur region (Russian Federation) and coal combustion products to understand the provenance and depositional environment. It was discussed that weathering crusts of ore deposits and host rocks located in the mountain-folded frame of the Zeya-Bureya coal-bearing sedimentary basin were the main source of mineral substance and chemical elements in brown coals. The distribution of minerals and elements inside the forming coal seams was influenced by the type of vegetation incorporated into coal-forming peat mires bog by catastrophic floods along the existed hydraulic network, the physicochemical parameters of plant debris transformation during their conversion to coal, as well as the sorption properties of inclusions and interlayer of bitumen and humic acids in coal beds. An experimental technological complex was created to study the microelements transfer process in the dust-gas stream and the distribution of rare earth and trace elements separately in varieties of coal combustion products (slag, fly ash, dust-like part of the dust-gas flow, and technogenic cleaning water). The resulting combustion products of coal have been studied by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-spectrometry methods (ICP-mass spectrometry and ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy). Sample preparation technique for analysis was improved to determine the elemental composition. It was established that more than 60% of trace and rare earth elements were concentrated in ash and sludge. Data on these elements' concentration in the wash water sediment demonstrated a sufficiently high efficiency of the dust-gas flow cleaning. The use of a wet scrubber, of course, solves the problem of collecting the dust and gas flow cleaning from harmful and toxic elements of coal smoke, which should be a part of the technological chain of a coal combustion process in industrial boilers. Rare earth elements, scandium, and yttrium are considered economically valuable components in the coal combustion products of the Yerkovetskoe brown coal deposit in the Amur Region.

A simple model succeeded in reproducing the seasonal pattern in Eh changes at the peat surface. This included two terms: oxygen supply rate as a function of water-table depth and oxygen consumption rate as a function of temperature and microbial activity. The model explained well the minimum and maximum Eh in July and October, respectively. The activity of aerobic microbes in the peat was important in determining redox properties in the floating mat.

AB Leaching of total and dissolved phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium from fallow, unfertilized and fertilized barley and grass ley was studied in a four-year experiment carried out in lysimeters filled with clay, silt, coarse sand and Carer peat. Half of the lysimeters were irrigated with 290-480 mm of water annually. Irrigation increased the nutrient leaching. Phosphorus losses were anyway small (tot. P 0.02-0.26 kg ha(-1) a(-1) from the fallowed soils) owing to omission of surface runoff. Leaching of cations was more comparable with field observations. The annual average varied in the bare soils from 50 to 120 and from 30 to 70 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for Ca and Mg, respectively. The average leaching of K was small (4-24 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) in other than sand soil (56-94 kg ha(-1) a(-1)). Cropping of soil generally decreased the leaching of dissolved and total phosphorus and cations compared with the fallow treatment. Fertilization did not have any consistent effect.

AB The inorganic geochemistry and mineralogy of three cores from the Anderson-Dietz 1 coal bed, a 15.2-m-thick subbituminous coal bed in the Tongue River Member (Paleocene) of the Fort Union Formation, were examined (1) to determine if the cores could be correlated by geochemical composition alone over a total distance of 2 km and (2) to identify the major factors that influenced the geochemistry of the coal bed. Chemical data (46 elements on a coal-ash basis) for 81 coal samples and 4 carbonaceous rock samples, with most samples representing a 0.6-m-thick (2-ft) interval of core, were grouped into compositional clusters by means of cluster analysis. Seven major clusters were produced; two of these clusters can be used to correlate the coal bed throughout the study area. Data from scanning electron and optical microscope analyses indicate that several factors influenced the geochemistry of the Anderson-Dietz 1 coal bed. The majority of mineral grains in the coal bed are interpreted to be detrital (water borne); evidence includes the presence of rounded to subrounded quartz grains having two-phase, aqueous fluid inclusions characteristic of hydrothermal or low-to-moderate grade metamorphic quartz. These quartz grains are found throughout the coal bed but are most abundant in samples from the midpart of the bed, which was influenced by detrital input associated with the deposition of the clastic rocks that form the split between the Anderson and Dietz 1 coal beds 900 m to the east of the study area. In addition to the detrital minerals mentioned above, volcanic ash that was fluvially transported to the sites of peat deposition or possibly deposited as air-fall volcanic ash also affected the geochemistry of the coal bed. For example, crandallite(?), a mineral reported to form as an alteration product of volcanic ash, is found in seven samples from the coal bed. The presence of quartz grains containing silicate-melt inclusions in eight samples from the coal bed provides further support for a volcanic ash component. Other factors that probably affected the geochemistry of the coal bed include (1) detrital input associated with the deposition of the roof rocks of the coal bed, (2) peat-forming processes and plant material, and (3) epigenetic ground-water flow.

AB The Ylijoki area in the commune of Sodankyla, northern Finland, stood out as a peak in an airborne radiometric survey.  The area lies on a Precambrian granite containing an average of 8 ppm U.  The chemical composition of this granite is comparable to the U-rich granites in Sweden.  The weathering crust, till, sorted sand and peat contain high U concentration, up to 99 ppm in the weathering crust, 420 ppm in the till, 497 ppm in the sand and 1.3% in peat ash.  Although Th also has anomalous values the correlation between U and Th is poor.
   Cold extractability tests (0.1 M citric acid) show that most of the U in the till and sand is weakly bound and that in the weathering crust more firmly bound.  Uranium was possibly fixed in the weathering crust via scavenging by the clay minerals and iron oxides, in the till via adsorption to the surfaces of the mineral grains and in the peat via complexation with organic matter.
   The predominant dispersions mechanism is hydromorphic.  The high U content of the groundwater (maximum 520 ppb) shows that dispersion is still active.  The most coherent U anomaly occurs in the groundwater discharge area, where the peat is also enriched with U.  Some of it, nevertheless, owes its final dispersion pattern to a multicyclic history with several clastic (glacigenic) dispersion phases, each of them followed by postglacial weathering and hydromorphic dispersion.

AB Paleoecological records suggest that growing season length and/or cloudiness may affect peatland carbon accumulation and testate amoeba-based environmental reconstructions, highlighting a need to understand how light intensity affects microbial communities. We shaded plots on two peatlands for two years to examine effects on testate amoeba communities, the relative abundance of mixotrophic and heterotrophic testate amoebae, transfer-function performance, and delta C-13 values of two species of mixotrophic testate amoebae. Surprisingly, relative abundance of mixotrophic species increased in shade, although compositional changes did not affect transfer-function performance. Shading did not affect delta C-13 values of Hyalosphenia papilio and Heleopera sphagni, which ranged from -23.5 to -19.6%o and -23.2 to -19.2%o, respectively. These delta C-13 values were higher than those of potential food sources and lower than literature-derived values for Chlorella, the zoochlorellae inhabiting mixotrophic testate amoebae. delta C-13 values thus suggest that these mixotrophic species obtain some carbon from Chiorella, although coupled dietary and isotope studies are needed to quantify this contribution. More research is needed to assess impacts of light variability on peatland microbial communities; however, carbon sources are recorded by delta C-13 values of testate amoebae, indicating potential for studies of carbon cycling and how mixotrophy varies temporally and spatially.

AB The effect of short interval cyclic flooding on root and shoot growth of 'Shamrock' inkberry holly (Ilex glabra), 'Henry's Garnet' sweetspire (Itea virginica), and 'Winterthur' possumhaw (Viburnum nudum) was studied in a greenhouse in Auburn, AL. Liners (4.4 inches long) of each species were planted into trade 1-gal pots in 1 pine bark:1 peat by volume (PB:P) or fine textured calcined clay (CC). 'Shamrock' inkberry holly and 'Henry's Garnet' sweetspire were planted 18 Apr. 2008; the experiment was repeated with the addition of 'Winterthur' possumhaw on 16 June 2008. Plants were flooded to substrate level for 0 (non-flooded), 3, or 7 days. Flooding cycles were repeated at least five times with 7 days of draining between each flood cycle. During draining, plants received no irrigation. Non-flooded plants were watered as needed. Flooded plants for all species except 'Winterthur' possumhaw showed decreased root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and final growth index when compared with non-flooded plants. Survival was higher in CC than PB:P for both experiments. All plants maintained good visual quality and shoot growth. As a result, overall, these plants seemed tolerant of flooding despite differences in growth.

AB Organic chromophores of total organic carbon (TOC) and those of iron (Fe) contribute to the color of water, but the relative contributions of colored organic carbon (COC%) and Fe (Fe%) are poorly known. In this study, we unraveled Fe% and COC% in 6128 unfiltered water samples collected from 94 Finnish river sites of contrasting catchment properties. According to regression analysis focusing on TOC alone, on average 84% of the mean TOC consisted of COC, while 16% was non-colored or below the color-detection limit. COC and Fe were much more important sources of color than phytoplankton (chlorophyll a as a proxy) or non-algal particles (suspended solids as a proxy). When COC and Fe were considered as the only two sources of color, COC% ranged from 16.8% to 99.5% (mean 71%) and Fe% from 0.5% to 83.2% (mean 29%). Similar Fe% and COC% values were obtained when color was estimated from the absorption coefficients of COC and Fe at 490 nm. Fe% increased as a function of the concentration of Fe and was well predicted by the TOC-to-Femass ratio. In 608 samples with TOC-to-Fe ratios of <4.5, Fe dominated the color. TOC-to-Fe ratios varied widely within most sites, but in relation to hydrology. In catchments with a peatland coverage of >30%, peak flow exported elevated amounts of TOC relative to Fe and resulted in a high COC%. Base flow, instead, mobilized elevated amounts Fe relative to TOC and resulted in a high Fe%. In a catchment covered with 31% of agricultural fields, peak flow transported eroded soil particles high in Fe and thus resulted in a high Fe%, while during base flow the water was high in COC%. This study demonstrated that Fe% and COC% vary widely in river water depending on the catchment properties and hydrology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In regions with intensive agriculture, water level fluctuation in wetlands has generally become constricted within narrow limits. Water authorities are, however, considering the re-establishment of fluctuating water levels as a management tool in biodiverse, base-rich fens ('rich fens'). This includes temporary inundation with surface water from ditches, which may play an important role in counteracting acidification in order to conserve and restore biodiversity. Inundation may result in an increased acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) for two reasons: infiltration of base-rich inundation water into peat soils, and microbial alkalinity generation under anaerobic conditions. The main objectives of this study were to test whether short-term (2 weeks) summer inundation is more effective than short-term winter inundation to restore the ANC in the upper 10 cm of non-floating peat soils, and to explain potential differences. Large-scale field experiments were conducted for five years in baserich fens and Sphagnum-dominated poor fens. Winter inundation did not result in increased porewater ANC, because infiltration was inhibited in the waterlogged peat and evapotranspiration rates were relatively low. Also, low temperatures limit microbial alkalinity generation. In summer, however, when temperature and evapotranspiration rates are higher, inundation resulted in increased porewater Ca and HCO3- concentrations, but only in areas with characteristic rich fen bryophytes. This increase was not only due to stronger infiltration into the soil, but also to higher microbial alkalinity generation under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, porewater ANC did not increase in Sphagnum-plots as a result of the ability of Sphagnum spp. to acidify their environment. In both rich and poor fens, flooding-induced P-mobilization remained sufficiently low to safeguard P-limited vegetation. NO3- and NH4+ dynamics showed no considerable changes either. In conclusion, short-term summer inundation with base-rich and nutrient-poor surface water is considered beneficial in the management of non-floating rich fens, and much more effective than winter inundation.

AB Detailed carbon budgets from 2008 to 2010 were created for two 1-ha flow-through riverine wetlands created in 1994 adjacent to a third-order stream in central Ohio. Measurements were taken of dissolved non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOM), and coarse particulate organic carbon (CPOM). Methane emissions, soil sequestration, aquatic primary productivity, and macrophyte aboveground net primary productivity were also included in the carbon budget. The carbon budget successfully balanced inputs (1838 +/- 41 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and export/sequestration (1846 +/- 59 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with only a 0.5 % over estimation of export in relation to input; 12.8 % of the inflow was sequestered into the wetland soil. FPOM and CPOM concentrations and exports were positively correlated with hydrologic flow under most circumstances; NPOC and DIC concentrations were usually negatively or poorly correlated with hydrologic flow. In all seasons, except winter, the change of total carbon (NPOC, DIC, FPOM, and CPOM) concentration between inflow and outflow increased with increased hydrologic flow. Although carbon concentrations increased from inflow to outflow, the total surface water export of carbon is less than the inflow due to groundwater recharge from these perched wetlands.

AB The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) strongly emphasizes that all water polluting sectors must enhance the protection of water bodies in a cost-effective way. River Basin Management Plans need to be made to achieve a good environmental status for all water bodies by 2027 at the latest. This article examines three principal water protection measures used in forestry: buffer zones, overland flow fields and sedimentation ponds. We analytically develop marginal abatement cost functions for each of these measures and apply them numerically for the Finnish forestry. We find that the marginal abatement costs of nutrients using buffer zones in clear-cut mineral soil forests are very high, as they entail leaving financially mature and uncut trees. In contrast, the marginal costs of using overland flow fields in conjunction with ditch cleaning and clear-cutting in peatlands are very low. Furthermore, for sediments using overland flow fields as a water protection measure entails significantly lower abatement costs than does using sedimentation ponds in conjunction with ditch cleaning in peatland forests. A cost-effective solution in a river basin entails that the highest nutrient reductions are made in agriculture but that forestry also does its share. A cost-effective allocation of abatement measures entails that the proportions of the overall nutrient reduction are 3% (1%) in forestry and 97% (99%) in agriculture when the reduction target is set as 10% (30%).

AB The paucity of studies on permafrost runoff generation processes, especially in mountain permafrost, constrains the understanding of permafrost hydrology and prediction of hydrological responses to permafrost degradation. This study investigated runoff generation processes, in addition to the contribution of summer thaw depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation to streamflow in a small upland permafrost basin in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that the thawing period and the duration of the zero-curtain were longer in permafrost of the northern Tibetan Plateau than in the Arctic. Limited snowmelt delayed the initiation of surface runoff in the peat permafrost in the study area. The runoff displayed intermittent generation, with the duration of most runoff events lasting less than 24 h. Precipitation without runoff generation was generally correlated with lower soil moisture conditions. Combined analysis suggested runoff generation in this region was controlled by soil temperature, thaw depth, precipitation frequency and amount, and antecedent soil moisture. This study serves as an important baseline to evaluate future environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.

SO ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH

DT Article
ID HYDROLOGY; RUNOFF; LAKES
AB Hydrochemical transport within a small fen basin on Axel Heiberg Island, N.W.T., was examined during the 1990 spring melt. Snow cover, lake inflow, hillslope runoff, and basin outflow were monitored for pH, conductivity, and the storage and flux of five major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-). Ca2+ dominated the ionic load in the premelt snowpack. Although there were substantial spatial and temporal variations in runoff, ion concentrations and export rates from the basin's slopes, transport of all ions tended to rise during periods of increased runoff. Runoff became depleted in H+ and enriched in the remaining ions to varying degrees as meltwater interacted with basin soils. H+ was retained on hillslopes, while there was net export of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Cl- to the fen. Differences in active layer thickness within the basin appeared to have an important control on the contact time between infiltrating meltwater and the soil; these differences in turn accounted for spatial variations in net ionic export from the hillslopes. The snowpack represented 51 % of the total water input to the basin; however, snow cover made only a minor contribution to total ionic inputs. H+, Na+, K+, and Cl- were retained in the wetland, while there was net export of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from the basin. Weathering and cation exchange between H+-rich meltwater and alkaline soils were likely responsible for the release of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to surface runoff.

AB This study is about the coal petrography of the lignite deposit of Notio Pedio ( Southern field) in the central part of the Ptolemaida Basin. The sediments in the basin are mainly Neogene in age, surrounded by Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks. Fourteen samples, taken from a representative corehole, were analyzed for maceral composition. Huminite macerals are dominant ( 69.0 - 91.9%), with humotelinite present in high concentrations ( 40.1 - 48.6%). In those samples that originated from the lower lignite beds, humotelinite content decreases to 16.3 - 34.6%. Humodetrinite ranges from 20.3- 66.0% and is particularly abundant in the lower beds. Liptinite and inertinite macerals are present in small quantities. Based on the indices GWI, VI, GI, and TPI that are indicative of nutrient supply, groundwater level, preservation of plant tissue material and wetness, it was concluded that the paleoenvironment that hosted the peat deposit was mainly limnic and intensely rheotrophic.

AB The historical geography of the landscape of a lowland brook valley in the sandy Kempen area (eastern Brabant, Netherlands) shows the interaction of ecological processes and land use, and helps to understand processes in the present landscape. In this location the human influence, especially on the groundwater hydrology, played a major role in the development of the landscape. Levels and flow of different types of groundwater interacted with vegetation development and human interference, to produce landscape patterns.
   Four main stages have been identified. In the prehistoric period, a natural deciduous forest covered the higher grounds, ombrotrophic peat was formed in the valley, and groundwater was relatively deep. In the medieval stage man settled on the edge of the valley, cleared parts of the forest and dug part of the peat. Groundwater levels were raised, which increased the rate of groundwater discharge and increased the amount of associated lowland peat formation in the valley. This tendency continued in modern times, when the area was completely deforested. Groundwater levels increased further due to decreased evapotranspiration, which gave rise to the use of ponds for fish and for water mills. Finally, in the most recent period the groundwater level has been lowered by extensive artificial drainage, partly on a regional scale. It was concluded that evaluation of historical changes in the landscape help provide landscape planners with a sound idea of the nature of the landscape.

ID VEGETATION
AB Although quarrying is often cited as a potential threat to wetland systems, there is a lack of relevant, quantitative case studies in the literature. The impact of pumped groundwater discharged from a quarry into a wetland area was assessed relative to reference conditions in an adjacent fen wetland that receives only natural runoff. Analysis of vegetation patterns at the quarry wetland site, using Detrended Correspondence Analysis and the species indicator values of Ellenberg, revealed a clear disparity between community transitions in the quarry wetland and the reference site. Limited establishment of moisture-sensitive taxa, the preferential proliferation of robust wetland species and an overall shift towards lower species diversity in the quarry wetland were explicable primarily by the physico-chemical environment created by quarry dewatering. This encompassed high pH (up to 12.8), sediment-rich effluent creating a nutrient-poor substrate with poor moisture retention in the quarry wetland, and large fluctuations in water levels.

AB Leaching rates of the herbicide dichlorprop [(+/-)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanoic acid] and nitrate were measured together in field lysimeters containing undisturbed clay and pent soils. The purpose of the study was to investigate the leaching pattern of the two solutes in structured soils under different precipitation regimes. Spring barley (Hordeum distichum L.) was sown on each monolith and fertilized with 100 kg N ha(-1). Dichlorprop was applied at a rate of 1.6 kg active ingredient (a.i.) ha(-1) Each soil type received supplemental irrigation at two levels ('average' and 'worst-case'), giving total water inputs (irrigation and precipitation) of 664 and 749 mm year(-1), respectively. The larger water input approximately doubled the nitrate lends, from, on average, 11.6 to 21.8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in the clay soil and from 37.6 to 65.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in the peat soil. In contrast, dichlorprop leaching was reduced by more than one order of magnitude when the water input was increased from average amounts of 3.22 to 0.26 g a.i. ha(-1) during an 3-month period in the clay and from 28.9 to 2.67 g a.i. ha(-1) in the pent. This leaching pattern of dichlorprop was explained in terms of preferential flow. The dried-out top-soil of 'average' watered monoliths may have allowed water flow in cracks, thus moving some of the herbicide rapidly through the topsoil to the subsoil. Once the crampoon reached the subsoil, degradation rates would be reduced and the herbicide residues would be stored for later leaching. Nitrate was presumably more evenly distributed in the soil matrix; therefore, water rapidly moving through macropores would not carry significant amounts of nitrate. In contrast, leaching would occur more evenly through the soil matrix, causing larger narrate loads in the 'worst-case' watered monoliths. These results show that wet years may constitute a worst case scenario in terms of nitrate leaching, but not pesticide leaching, if macropore flow exerts a significant influence on leaching.

AB The climate change debate has increased the need for knowledge on both long- and short-term regional environmental changes. In general, these changes may often be a product of multiple causes, which complicates the separation of single driving forces. In this review we focus on current water budget changes in Germany's capital region, Berlin-Brandenburg, over the last 30 years. Available studies from a variety of disciplines (e.g. hydrology, water engineering, landscape ecology, nature conservation) were analysed in order to (1) identify both local and regional hydrological changes, (2) reveal their potential causes, and (3) discuss responses of ecosystems and society. These studies show that the Berlin-Brandenburg region is widely characterised by decreasing groundwater recharge, leading to decreasing groundwater and lake levels as well as decreasing fluvial discharge. These trends result both from complex, regional human impacts (e.g. long-term effects of hydro-melioration and changes in forest composition) and more general climate warming. The observed and assumed (future) changes of the regional water balance have been creating, and will continue to create, multifaceted impacts on existing ecosystems and society (e.g. wetland drying, decrease of biodiversity, decrease of productivity of grasslands and forests, increasing conflicts of interests). Several efforts to respond to the regional water deficit problem have already been undertaken, comprising for instance land-use optimisation, wetland restoration measures and the reestablishment of mixed deciduous forests. In general, however, the reviewed regional material on this topic reveals that the number and complexity of empirical studies are still poor. Thus, for both the identification and the explanation of current water balance changes and their effects, as well as for development and implementation of adaptive strategies, further multidisciplinary research efforts at different scales, including interregional comparisons, are required. Furthermore, both the observation of hydrological changes and the evaluation of adaptive and mitigative responses require at least continuous or, even better, extended monitoring efforts.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; GROUNDWATER; STREAMFLOW; GROWTH
AB Clear-cutting on wetlands of the St. Lawrence lowlands raised the water table levels on seven of the eight studied sites encompassing five forest types and four soil subgroups. Water table levels dropped 3 cm after clear-cutting on the eighth site, which was the wettest site with precut water levels within the top 10 cm. This was explained by evaporation from exposed water surfaces. The magnitude of the water table rises increased with the depth of the precut water table. The seasonal mean and maximum rise were respectively 20 and 52 cm on a poorly drained mineral soil which had the lowest precut water table levels. The smallest rises, with means around 7 cm, were associated with high precut water table on bogs and on fens. The watering up was not reduced on fens where a lateral how occurs. This study indicated that transition sites between the bogs or Mns and the uplands were most susceptible to hydrologic changes after clear-cutting. Watering up was caused by reduced evapotranspiration, of which the major component was interception. The rise of the water table observed in the clear-cut and the bordering forest indicates that clear-cutting in narrow strips is not an effective solution to avoid water table rise. Silvicultural treatments to maintain interception and transpiration by leaving logging debris, small trees, and preestablished regeneration would be more effective.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SPLASH DETACHMENT
AB A laboratory facility was built to quantify wash erosion by overland flow. The design allowed slope gradient and flow rate of water to be controlled. The apparatus was used to test the wash erosion from three Trinidadian soils (a sandy loam, a clay loam and another clay), four levels (0, 4%, 8%, and 12% by mass) each with peat and farmyard manure (FYM) and exposed to five slopes (9%, 15%, 21%, 25% and 30%). The aim of the test was to increase the general understanding of how peat and FYM affect the soil erosion process. The water content, bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils were measured prior to the measurement of wash erosion. As water content increased, bulk density decreased in all the three soils with increasing levels of peat and FYM. Although penetration resistance declined with increasing levels of added peat, it increased with increasing FYM content. Mean wash erosion increased from 0.99 kg for soils on a 9% slope to 1.88 kg for a 30% slope. Increasing levels of added peat and FYM decreased wash erosion at all combinations of parameters. Wash erosion was greater in the sandy loam and the clay loam than in the clay soil at the higher slopes (>15%). The opposite trend occurred at the lower slopes (9% and 15%), where soil loss was greater in the clay. Results from this study demonstrate that the effect of incorporation of peat and FYM on wash erosion depends on the type of soil, the soil slope, and the level of added organic material. Multiple linear regression equations were developed for predicting wash erosion from the experimental factors. The results of this study imply that for improved soil conservation, apart from adopting the land-use zoning of soils based on slopes, the incorporation of organic materials into steep arable slopes will greatly minimise soil erosion by water.

DT Article
ID WATER; METALS
AB Savage Fen is a wetlands complex at the base of north-facing bluffs in the Minnesota River Valley. The complex includes 27.8 hectares of calcareous fen that host rare calciphile plants whose populations are declining in Minnesota. Water and sediment compositions in the calcareous fen were studied to gain a better understanding of the hydrologic system that sustains the rare vegetation. Groundwater in the fen is a calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type with circumneutral pH values. The groundwater composition is the result of interactions among water, dissolved and gaseous carbon species, carbonates, and ion exchangers. Shallow groundwater is distinguished from deep groundwater by smaller concentrations of chloride, sulfate, magnesium, and sodium, and larger concentrations of calcium, bicarbonate, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonium. Magnesian calcite is the prevalent carbonate in unconsolidated sedimentary fill beneath the fen and is an important source and sink for dissolved calcium, magnesium, and inorganic carbon. Calcite concentrations just below the water table are small because aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of organic matter increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P(CO2)), decrease pH, and cause calcite to dissolve. Thick calcite accumulations just above the water table, in the root zone of calciphile plants, result from water table fluctuations and attendant changes in P(CO2). Groundwater beneath Savage Fen recharges in lakes and ponds south of the fen and upwells to the surface within the fen. Water at the water table is a mixture of upwelling groundwater and water near the surface that flows downslope from higher elevations in the fen. Changes in oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of shallow groundwater indicate that the proportion of upwelling groundwater in shallow groundwater decreases downgradient in the calcareous fen. Encroachment of reed grasses into the calcareous fen may reflect human-caused disturbances in the recharge area.

AB The transport of dissolved minerals and groundwater flow plays a crucial role in the ecosystem of many wetlands. Nonetheless, installing equipment to monitor groundwater seepage is invasive, harms vegetation, and can impact biodiversity. By remotely mapping surface temperature in late summer, when there is the greatest difference between warm soil and cold groundwater, temperature patterns can expose areas with the greatest upward gradient and flow. The conventional method of using tensiometers to measure hydraulic gradient and estimate flux using Darcy's law was applied and compared with thermal imaging to characterize groundwater seepage at two contrasting sites within a central North Dakota fen (groundwater discharge wetland). Both sites exhibited variable gradients between the shallow and deep tensiometers. The temperature trend determined from the thermal imaging showed a closer relationship to the measured hydraulic gradients at the herbaceous (Sedge) site than at the wooded (Willow) site. Saturated hydraulic conductivity K ranged from 6 x 10(-5) to 2 x 10(-4) m/s for the Willow site; and 6 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-4) m/s for Sedge site. The flux calculated for the Willow site ranged from 1.4 x 10(-5) to 2.7 x 10(-4) m/s and that of the Sedge site ranged from 2.2 x 10(-6) to 6.3 x 10(-5) m/s. The gradients are affected at shallow depth because of heterogeneous soil stratigraphy, which is likely the reason that seepage faces at the sites cannot be mapped solely by thermal imaging.

AB Landscape-scale ecohydrological mapping is commonly restrained to one-dimensional ecohydrological transect studies or two-dimensional vegetation distributions lacking adequate spatial coverage of explanatory hydrological data. The objective of this paper is to construct a two-dimensional (semi-3D) landscape-scale ecohydrological map based on vegetation distribution maps and detailed spatial, multi-year, floodplain inundation water quality data. The dataset comes from the near-natural Biebrza floodplain mire in Poland encompassing 658 inundation water quality analyses over the period 2002-2012, covering 17 different vegetation communities of freshwater marshes and rich fens. The data represent the main hydrological gradients from valley edge to river encompassing groundwater seepage, local stagnant precipitation influences and river flooding and drainage. We used chi-squared Haberman residuals analysis to correlate communities to inundation water quality types, resembling river water and three different types of groundwater. Out of 17 communities, six showed a preference for river water, three showed a preference for clean groundwater, four for diluted groundwater and one for polluted groundwater. For three communities, no significant preference was found. Spatial patterns in vegetation and attributed water quality preference can be linked to three dominant hydrological processes at the landscape scale, i.e. discharge of clean and polluted groundwater near the valley edges, dilution of exfiltrated groundwater with local snowmelt and precipitation water and flooding with river water along the river. The ecohydrological relations are depicted in two-dimensional maps and a semi-3D diagram with typical cross sections. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The aim of this work is to demonstrate the application of kaolin as a pozzolanic additive of stabilized peat. In addition to kaolin, Portland composite cement, calcium chloride and silica sand were used as the materials to stabilize the peat. To achieve such aim, test specimens of both untreated and stabilized peats were tested in laboratory in order to evaluate its unconfined compressive strength and rate of permeability. Each test specimen was prepared in such a way that it has to simulate the in situ condition of deep peat stabilization by deep mixing method. It was found that test specimen with 10% partial replacement with kaolin has the highest unconfined compressive strength that exceeds the minimal required unconfined compressive strength of 345 kPa. The test specimen was subjected to 100 kPa initial pressure and cured in water for 7 days. The unconfined compressive strength of the test specimen was discovered to be 33.7 times greater than that of untreated peat specimen. In laboratory permeability tests, the rate of permeability of untreated peat was found to be 6.43 x 10(6) times higher than that of stabilized peat. Samples of the test specimens were examined using Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). High peaks of calcium element from the EDX results of stabilized peat specimens imply that the specimens have high calcium composition as a result of cement hydrolysis, and addition of kaolin is believed to induce secondary pozzolanic reaction in which the cementation crystals of mainly calcium silicate hydrate were formed to bind the soil. Based on the observation of SEM of the stabilized peat specimens, it was found that there was a significant pore refinement in the test specimens as a result of the filler effect of silica sand and pozzolanic activity of kaolin.

AB Here, we describe and evaluate two low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) designed to remotely monitor wetland hydrochemical dynamics over time scales ranging from minutes to decades. Each WSN (one student-built and one commercial) has multiple nodes to monitor water level, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, and major solutes at user-defined time intervals. Both WSNs can be configured to report data in near real time via the internet. Based on deployments in two isolated wetlands, we report highly resolved water budgets, transient reversals of flow path, rates of transpiration from peatlands and the dynamics of chromophoric-dissolved organic matter and bulk ionic solutes (specific conductivity)-all on daily or subdaily time scales. Initial results indicate that direct precipitation and evapotranspiration dominate the hydrologic budget of both study wetlands, despite their relatively flat geomorphology and proximity to elevated uplands. Rates of transpiration from peatland sites were typically greater than evaporation from open waters but were more challenging to integrate spatially. Due to the high specific yield of peat, the hydrologic gradient between peatland and open water varied with precipitation events and intervening periods of dry out. The resultant flow path reversals implied that the flux of solutes across the riparian boundary varied over daily time scales. We conclude that WSNs can be deployed in remote wetland-dominated ecosystems at relatively low cost to assess the hydrochemical impacts of weather, climate, and other perturbations.

AB Surface mining in northern Alberta transforms wetlands and forests into open pits, tailings ponds, and overburden. As part of their license to operate, mine operators are required to reclaim this altered landscape to a predisturbance capacity. In 2012, Syncrude Canada Limited constructed one of the first of two reclaimed wetlands, the Sandhill Fen Watershed (SFW), to evaluate wetland reclamation strategies. SFW is a 52-ha system atop soft-tailings that includes an inflow/outflow pump system, underdrains, upland hummocks, and a fen lowland. In this study, water table dynamics of the fen lowland were evaluated in the 2 years following commissioning (2014-2015) to assess whether this newly constructed watershed has hydrological conditions that facilitate hydric soils with water table regimes similar to reference systems. Results indicate that the location and hydrophysical properties of placed materials control water table responses to both water management and precipitation. This differential water table response in the SFW lowland drove lateral fluxes between adjacent landforms, suggesting periods of intermittent water supply from uplands to wetlands along hummock margins. As in natural systems, the lowland fen exhibited several lateral flow reversals over the 2 years depending upon water level. Water tables on-average were greater than those observed in natural analogues. Comparison during these first 2 years following commissioning contribute to the increasing insight as to how construction and management practices support reclamation postmining.

AB We demonstrate the negative impacts of ground thaw on sap flow in black spruce. Climate warming is accelerating permafrost thaw; our study may inform observed warming-related productivity declines in subarctic forests.
   Many of Canada's northern boreal peatlands are situated on discontinuous permafrost. Here, permafrost provides the physical foundation on which forests persist. However, climate warming is leading to increased rates of permafrost thaw resulting in both increased active layer thickness (ALT) as well as shrinkage of the area underlain by permafrost due to lateral thaw at plateau margins. Such changes to the substrate likely impact growth and physiological processes of the trees. Despite this, little is known about the role of active layer development, and changes to it, including thaw of the underlying permafrost on tree water relations. Here, we measured sap flow in black spruce from a peatland experiencing rapid permafrost thaw and quantified drivers of changes in sap flow. Time series analyses revealed that of the environmental drivers examined, vapour pressure deficit was the strongest predictor of diurnal sap flow, while seasonal patterns were driven largely by energy inputs; however, the environmental drivers of importance did not change as a function of ground thaw conditions. To understand the implications of changing permafrost and active layer conditions, we quantified differences in sap flow between trees in interior positions of permafrost plateaus and trees on degrading plateau edges. We found > 65 % reductions in sap flow in edge trees, attributable to reduced root function at waterlogged edges. Seasonal thaw processes also influenced sap flow. Paired measures of ALT indicated a negative linear relationship with sap flow that was stronger for interior trees. Greater ALT, which corresponds with deeper frost and water tables reduced sap flow by up to 60 % and is likely attributable to drying in surface soil layers where rooting occurs. Climate warming will accelerate permafrost thaw, which our data suggests will drive decreases in the productivity of black spruce-dominated subarctic forests. These findings may thus enhance our understanding of widespread reductions in productivity in boreal forests in northwestern North America.

AB Globally, soil anoxia and water table rise play a role in the development of peatlands from forests. Cited causes have included a diversity of internal and external mechanisms, including Sphagnum and feather mosses, hardpan development, and peatland expansion. The objectives of this study were to examine water table depth in black spruce stands of the Clay Belt of Quebec and Ontario, and to associate changes with potential stand scale causal factors (primarily biological). A methodological issue, the link between oxygen zone and water table, was also addressed. Within stands less than 100 yr post-fire, oxygen zone and water table position were only loosely related, and no other potential factors were significantly correlated. Across a chronosequence of stands, while oxygen zone thickness in the soil profile was relatively constant, its position relative to the mineral soil changed, as it rose from the mineral soil into the forest floor. Forest floor thickness was the dominant explanatory factor in oxygen zone position, suggesting that in these forests other postulated mechanisms are less important. At the landscape level, the movement of the oxygen zone into the forest floor has important consequences for the long-term productivity of this intensively exploited forest region.

AB A rare form of wetland, string and net-patterned salt marshes, exist in and near Wood Buffalo National Park in northeastern Alberta and the adjacent Northwest Territories. In two wetlands (Benchmark, and Lobstick creeks) examined in August 2001, a benthic blue-green algae/diatom community covered flark bottoms. Calamagrostis stricta (Narrow Reed Grass) and Triglochin maritima (Seaside Arrow-grass) at Benchmark Creek and Atriplex subspicata (Saltbush), Puccinellia nutalliana (Nuttall's Salt-Meadow Grass), and Triglochin palustris (Slender Arrow-grass) at Lobstick Creek dominated the strings. Hordeum jubatum (Foxtail Barley), Puccinellia nuttalliana, Spergularia marina (Salt-marsh Sand Sporty), and Triglochin palustris were common to both wetlands. Other noteworthy plant occurrences included Aster ericoides (Tufted White Prairie Aster), A. pauciflorus (Few-flowered Aster), Carex mackenzici (Mackenzie's Sedge), Glaux maritima (Sea Milkwort), Monolepis nuttalliana (Spear-leaved Goosefoot). Plantago eriopoda (Saline Plantain). P. maritima (Sea-side Plantain), Scirpus paludosus (Prairie Bulrush), and Suaeda calceoliformis (Western Sea-blite). The wetlands observed were associated with valleys. In order to form, they may require a gentle elevational gradient for lateral flow of saline surface water. The patterns may be related also to soil processes involving excessive soil salts. Soil augering revealed an insufficient amount of peat for the sites to be classified as fens; soils appear to classify as Rego Humic Gleysols. These rare wetlands require study of their mode of formation, distribution, and their biota. I suggest a new type designation: interior patterned saline marsh.

AB Because anthropogenic stressors have caused mire degradations in the subarctic northern Japan such as the drying and the invasion of alder-dominant shrub forest, the Japanese governments recently started a new project to restore a meandering former river channel in the catchment in order to diminish shrub forest and to recover mire ecosystem. In this study, the author developed the integrated catchment-based eco-hydrology model to include the mass transport and vegetation succession processes in the mire (NICE-VEG). NICE-VEG simulated the water/heat budget, the mass transport, and vegetation succession processes iteratively including the competition between two vegetation types (alder-dominant shrub forest and reed-sedge vegetation) in order to evaluate the relationship between drying and alder invasion in the mire and to clarify a method for mire recovery. NICE-VEG reproduced well the alder invasion in the mire so far by various anthropogenic stressors, which indicate that it is important to add newly the growth reduction factor for water table depth in the model. Simulation results indicated that restoring meanders to the river channel could be effective for decreasing discharge and sediment loading of the river, and increasing groundwater level at the downstream of restoration area around the mire. Simulation also forecasted the mire recovery more or less by restoring meanders to the river channel in the future. These results suggest that the policy of river restoration could be effective as one of mire conservation plans for the recovery of mire vegetation. It is powerful to apply the process-based model to assess the linkage of hydrological change and vegetation succession. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The surface water chemistry of Hoylandet has been studied by performing two synoptic surveys, during high runoff in the autumn of 1986 and during a low flow period in the summer of 1988. Based on water samples of up to 38 chemical variables from 75 sites, analyses show considerable variation in the chemical composition. There is a strong altitude gradient, i.e. very dilute poorly buffered waters dominate at higher elevations near the timberline while progressively higher salt content and alkalinities are characteristic at lower altitudes more dominated by forests. The influence of mires is less pronounced. The overall water quality is of oligotrophic nature with low concentrations of strong acid anions and metals known to be enriched under acidified conditions. The natural pH gradients are considerable but with no indication of anthropogenic acidification. The data provide little support for the hypothesis that in-catchment production of organically derived acidity leads to acid runoff, which in these catchments appears compensated by increased weathering. The findings are in general accordance with other Hoylandet catchment studies. It is concluded that this area may serve as a representative pristine surface runoff analogue for catchments currently affected by atmospheric deposition of strong mineral acids.

AB Measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapour flux densities were carried out for a disturbed raised peat bog in the north of the Netherlands during an 18 month continuous experiment. Tussock grass (sp. Molinea caerulae) mainly dominated the vegetation of the bog area. The maximum leaf area index (LAI) of the vegetation reached a numerical value of about 1.7 in mid-August.
   When the LAI is large enough (LAI > 0.2), a mean net uptake of carbon dioxide is observed with a clear daily pattern. The total evapotranspiration consists of a soil, an open water, and a plant transpiration part. When the LAI is large enough (LAI > 0.2), plant transpiration dominates the total evapotranspiration. The mean daily transpiration pattern, however, is not similar to the carbon dioxide uptake pattern.
   During the summer months, the daytime carbon dioxide uptake shows a single early morning maximum value followed by a decline in uptake during the rest of the day. The evapotranspiration, however, follows more or less the incoming short-wave radiation pattern. Effects of the vapour pressure deficit are suggested as a possible cause of this discrepancy.

AB The sulphate budgets of two valley-bottom conifer swamps, located in headwater catchments with contrasting till depth, typical of the southern Canadian Shield were determined from June 1990 to August 1992. Temporal variations in the retention of SO42- in both swamps were related to the magnitude of upland runoff and water level in the wetlands. Contrasts in catchment till depth and nature of groundwater flow resulted in differences in SO42- retention between years and swamps. Transient groundwater inputs entering the swamp in the thin-till catchment resulted in a large water-table drawdown during dry summers, export of SO42- the following fall, and low annual SO42- retention. Continuous discharge of groundwater into the swamp in the moderate-till catchment maintained saturated surfaces and efficient SO42- retention during both years with dry and wet summers. Greater SO42- retention in this swamp may also be contributed by the greater interaction of groundwater, rich in SO42-, with deeper pear. Data from these two sites indicate that within the shallow till - rock ridge physiographic region of the Canadian Shield, small variations in catchment till depth can result in a large range in temporal and spatial variations in SO42- retention in valley wetlands.

AB Wood ash (3.1, 3.3 or 6.6 tonnes dry weight ha(-1)) was used to fertilize two drained and forested peatland sites in southern Sweden. The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest floor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007-1 October 2008. No significant (p>0.05) changes in forest floor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha(-1), while the CH4 fluxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha(-1). The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0-0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p<0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p<0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the first 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was significantly larger (p<0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.52 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not significantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p<0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Dissolved gas concentrations (O-2, CH4, CO2) in peat cores were monitored simultaneously using a fine (1.56 mm diameter) membrane inlet probe connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer. This technique allows direct measurements at specific locations within the sample with minimal disturbance. Detailed gas profiles in completely waterlogged peat samples (hollows) and samples in which the water table was several cm below the vegetation surface (hummocks) were compared. The depth of the water table played a central role in the distribution of gases. In a hollow, oxygen was present (90 mu M) at the surface but was not detectable (< 0.5 mu M) at depths greater than 2 cm. Concentrations of CH4 and CO2 increased from 6 and 300 mu M respectively at the surface to maxima of 450 and 3900 mu M at 13 cm depth. At a hummock, O-2 and CO2 were present above the water table but CH4, was not detectable. CH4 was measurable 2 cm below the water table. Both CH4 and CO2 concentrations increased with depth but maxima were not attained in the sampled cores.

AB Raised bogs have accumulated more atmospheric carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Climate-induced expansion of trees and shrubs may turn these ecosystems from net carbon sinks into sources when associated with reduced water tables. Increasing water loss through tree evapotranspiration could potentially deepen water tables, thus stimulating peat decomposition and carbon release. Bridging the gap between modelling and field studies, we conducted a three-year mesocosm experiment subjecting natural bog vegetation to three birch tree densities, and studied the changes in subsurface temperature, water balance components, leaf area index and vegetation composition. We found the deepest water table in mesocosms with low tree density. Mesocosms with high tree density remained wettest (i.e. highest water tables) whereas the control treatment without trees had intermediate water tables. These differences are attributed mostly to differences in evapotranspiration. Although our mesocosm results cannot be directly scaled up to ecosystem level, the systematic effect of tree density suggests that as bogs become colonized by trees, the effect of trees on ecosystem water loss changes with time, with tree transpiration effects of drying becoming increasingly offset by shading effects during the later phases of tree encroachment. These density-dependent effects of trees on water loss have important implications for the structure and functioning of peatbogs.

AB Altitudinal gradients are useful to study the potential effects of climate change on ecosystems. Historically, studies on elevation gradients have primarily focused on macro-organisms and ecosystem processes, while microorganisms have been mostly ignored despite their ubiquity and functional importance. We studied the temporal (about every two months from June 2008 until May 2009) variation of testate amoeba communities in four Sphagnum-dominated peatlands along a 1300 to elevation gradient in the Swiss Mountains (580-1880 m) in relation to water table depth and hydrochemistry with special focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a useful proxy for changes in C-cycling in peatlands.
   The lowest site had significantly (P < 0.01) lowest testate amoeba density, species richness. The highest site had highest testate amoeba density (38 ind mg(-1) dry mass of Sphagnum). Seasonal fluctuations in testate amoeba species richness and diversity were not consistent among sites but density tended to peak in spring at all sites, autumn in the three highest sites and mid-winter in the upper two sites. In a redundancy analysis (RDA) community structure was more strongly correlated to altitude (33.8% of variance explained in living community) than to soil hydrological and hydro-chemical variables (together explaining 16.2% of variance). In a partial RDA with altitude used as covariable, the four sites were separated by DOP, DOC, DON, pH and average depth to water table.
   The abundance of high trophic level testate amoeba species (shell-aperture over their body size >0.20; i.e. primarily predators of protists and micro-metazoa) as well as the community size structure increased from lowest to highest elevation (respectively by 3.7x and 6x) and followed the seasonal patterns of total density, while DOC, DON, and DOC/DON decreased with elevation.
   These results agree with previously reported alteration of peatland microbial food chains in response to experimental warming, suggesting that climate-induced changes in microbial community structure (here a shortening of microbial food chains) represent a mechanism controlling the carbon balance of peatlands.

AB Monthly mean sink/source strength pattern of a degraded temperate peatland in northwestern Turkey was quantified using the eddy covariance technique between July 2010 and February 2014. Atmospheric and hydrological drivers and responses to extreme events of sink/source strength were analysed using multiple linear regression models, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron with principal component analysis and multiple comparisons following general linear models. On the basis of the three full-year measurements, mean annual, growing season and maximum estimates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were -0.22mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1), -0.28mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1) and -0.11mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1) in July, respectively. The main driver of changes in monthly mean NEE pattern was found to be latent heat flux. Independent validation results showed a similar predictive performance (r(2)=74%) of multiple linear regression and support vector machine models as a function of month, total rainfall, water table depth, relative humidity, latent heat, atmospheric water vapour, wind direction and downwelling shortwave radiation. A shift in NEE from a net sink to a net source was observed in response to the deepest and shallowest water table depths due to drought and flooding, respectively.

AB Climate change can be expected to increase the frequency of summer droughts and associated low water tables in ombrotrophic peatlands. We studied the effects of periodic water table drawdown in a mesocosm, experiment. Mesocosms were collected in Southern Sweden, and subsequently brought to an experimental field in the Netherlands. Two water table treatments were applied: one with constant water tables at 5 cm below the moss surface, and one in which the water table was allowed to drop, resulting in water tables fluctuating between 5 and 21 cm below the moss surface. Sphagnum growth, as well as Sphagnum and vascular plant abundance, were assessed for 21 years. Our results show that the abundance of graminoid species increased most in the constant water table treatment. In contrast, ericoid species cover increased when water tables were allowed to fluctuate. Furthermore, Sphagnum cuspidatum production decreased with fluctuating summer water tables, while Sphagnum magellanicum responded oppositely. From these results we conclude that increased occurrence of periods with low water tables may bring about a shift in dominant Sphagnum species as well as a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover, resembling the shift from hollow to lawn or hummock vegetation. The difference in response within functional groups (vascular plants, Sphagnum) may add to the resilience of the ecosystem. (C) 2008 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Sedges (Cyperaceae) are dominant plants in many northern wetlands and contribute to the carbon cycling in several ways. In order to more accurately estimate the carbon balance of a wetland it is essential to be able to simulate the temporal changes of the leaf area of the sedges. Our aim was to test the ability of a simple carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange model to predict the seasonal development of sedge leaf area index (LAI). The model simulates the development of sedge LAI that depends on carbon gain/loss in net photosynthesis, utilization of stored carbon in spring, and LAI decline due to senescence in late summer. The net photosynthesis model is driven by LA!, air temperature, water table depth and photosynthetically active radiation. We parameterized and validated the model with two years of observational LAI data from two boreal pristine peatland sites and included data points from both pristine and manipulated (drainage and warming) treatment plots. Model parameter values other than the timing of the start of senescence, LAI decline rate in senescence and size of carbon storage were independent of observational data. The model successfully simulated the seasonal course of LAI development and is thus an easy and adjustable tool for producing estimates of sedge LAI for other peatland sites. It can be adjusted to different sites although it cannot predict the exact LAI level of a site that is controlled by site characteristics. Its ability to simulate the interannual variation in this two-year dataset was inadequate so there is a need to test the model against longer time series of measured LAIs in order to validate models' capability to predict the interannual variability of LAI.

AB This study reports on the Sinanpasa Basin, a typical example of the Miocene tectonic intracontinental grabens formed in West Anatolia, Turkey. The study reconstructs the paleoenvironmental and palcogeographic history of the graben based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of basin-fill deposits exposed mainly near the graben's northern and southern margins. The sedimentary paleoenvironments in the graben range from basin-margin alluvial fan systems and basin-axis fluvial distributary system to an intrabasinal shallow lake environment surrounded by peat-forming mires, changing from carbonate to more clayey, episodically evaporitic, and shifting its shorelines considerably. The spatial distribution and stratigraphic stacking of these paleoenvironments indicate the main controlling role of climatic changes and an asymmetrical "see-saw" tectonic subsidence of the graben floor. An important component of the sedimentation in the graben was volcanism, which probably commenced in the late Early Miocene and was related to the development of a local stratovolcano. Volcanic products - accumulated mainly at the graben's northern margin - include variously welded pyroclastic airfall and ground-surge tephra, vent-derived volcanic fluidization breccias, autoclastic lava flow breccias, and water-bearing lahars. The volcanic deposits made the intrabasinal lake struggle for accommodation space within the graben, while the ash tephra and related hydrothermal activity had a major impact on the lake water chemistry. B- and U-bearing evaporites formed episodically in drying lake areas, reaching economic thicknesses in several adjacent sister grabens. The Sinanpasa Basin is a representative example of the Miocene tectonic grabens of West Anatolia, and its sedimentation model suggested by the present study may serve as a tentative reference case for the region's numerous sister grabens, helping to understand their sedimentation conditions, environmental changes, and lithostratigraphic facies organization.

AB Over time peat harvesting and human encroachment have devastated the hydrology of Wainfleet Bog. Disturbances caused by human activities have rendered the bog ecosystem vulnerable to an influx of invasive species. The European White Birch (Betula pendula) has contributed to the degradation of the Wainfleet Bog. The disrupted hydrology has allowed for the development of dry conditions that have enabled B. pendula to take over habitats that were once dominated by native flora. To determine whether B. pendula was depressing the water table through evapotranspiration, we examined water table levels (March 1998 to July 1999) and vegetative data from 15 well stations. Analysis of results using a Repeated Measures Statistic Design failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between the presence of B. pendula and water table levels at Wainfleet Bog.

AB A cutover bog contaminated with seawater in New Brunswick, Canada remained barren 5 years after peat extraction operations ceased despite the proximity of natural seed sources. The aim of the study was to identify abiotic stresses impeding plant establishment and test transplanting of salt-tolerant wetland plants. The site consisted of long cambered rectangular fields that sloped down (2%) to the drainage ditches on both sides. Across this slope, zones were delineated based on moisture gradient as: Up-areas (drier), Mid-areas (moist) and Low-areas (wet). Juncus balticus was transplanted to these zones in August 2004 whereas Spartina pectinata was reintroduced in June 2005. Plant material was collected from nearby marshes. Survival of J. balticus in August 2005 was poorest at the Low-areas probably because of the early season flooded conditions of that zone. S. pectinata survival in June 2006 was good in all zones having better adaptation to early season waterlogged conditions. Early season waterlogged conditions resulted from a perched water table (May-June) and were alleviated only upon the complete thaw of the frozen peat layer on 8 July. Thereafter, important changes in peat characteristics occurred: lowered water table depths that increased redox potentials, decreased moisture content (theta) that increased dry bulk density (rho), and increased electrical conductivity (EC) that decreased pH. Waterlogged conditions were of greater magnitude and duration at the Low-areas but salinity levels were highest in the Up-areas and Mid-areas. We conclude that local conditions of waterlogging (especially in the Low-areas) and high salinity and low pH (notably in the Up- and Mid-areas) favoured the survival of S. pectinata in all areas and J. balticus in Up- and Mid-areas only.

AB Wetlands often form the transition zone between upland soils and watershed streams, however, stream-wetland interactions and hydrobiogeochemical processes are poorly understood. We measured changes in stream nitrogen (N) through one riparian wetland and one beaver meadow in the Archer Creek watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, USA from 1 March to 31 July 1996. In the riparian wetland we also measured changes in groundwater N. Groundwater N changed significantly from tension lysimeters at the edge of the peatland to piezometer nests within the peatland. Mean N concentrations at the peatland perimeter were 1(.)5, 0(.)5 and 18(.)6 mumol L-1 for NH4+, NO3- and DON (dissolved organic nitrogen), respectively, whereas peatland groundwater N concentration was 56(.)9, 1.5 and 31(.)6 mumol L-1 for NH4+, NO3- and DON, respectively. The mean concentrations of stream water N species at the inlet to the wetlands were 1(.)5, 10(.)1 and 16(.)9 mumol L-1 for NH4+, NO3- and DON, respectively and 1(.)6, 28(.)1 and 8(.)4 mumol L-1 at the wetland outlet. Although groundwater total dissolved N (TDN) concentrations changed more than stream water TDN through the wetlands, hydrological cross-sections for the peatland showed that wetland groundwater contributed minimally to stream flow during the study period. Therefore, surface water N chemistry was affected more by in-stream N transformations than by groundwater N transformations because the in-stream changes, although small, affected a much greater volume of water.
   Stream water N input-output budgets indicated that the riparian peatland retained 0(.)16 mol N ha(-1) day(--1) of total dissolved N and the beaver meadow retained 0(.)26 mol N ha(-1) day(-1) during the study period. Nitrate dominated surface water TDN flux from the wetlands during the spring whereas DON dominated during the summer. This study demonstrates that although groundwater N changed significantly in the riparian peatland, those changes were not reflected in the stream. Consequently, although in-stream changes of N concentrations were less marked than those in groundwater, they had a greater effect on stream water chemistry-because wetland groundwater contributed minimally to stream flow.

AB Carbon dioxide efflux and soil microenvironmental factors were measured diurnally in Carex aquatilus- and Eriophorum angustifolium-dominated riparian tundra communities to determine the relative importance of soil environmental factors controlling ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. Measurements were made weekly between 18 June and 24 July 1990. Diurnal patterns in carbon dioxide efflux were best explained by changes in soil temperature, while seasonal changes in efflux were correlated with changes in depth to water table, depth to frozen soil and soil moisture. Carbon dioxide efflux rates were lowest early in the growing season when high water tables and low soil temperatures limited microbial and root activity. Individual rainfall events that raised the water table were found to strongly reduce carbon dioxide efflux. As the growing season progressed, rainfall was low and depth to water table and soil temperatures increased. In response, carbon dioxide efflux increased strongly, attaining rates late in the season of approximately 10 g CO2 m-2 day-1. These rates are as high as maxima recorded for other arctic sites. A mathematical model is developed which demonstrates that soil temperature and depth to water table may be used as efficient predictors of ecosystem CO2 efflux in this habitat. In parallel with the field measurements Of CO2 efflux, microbial respiration was studied in the laboratory as a function of temperature and water content. Estimates of microbial respiration per square meter under field conditions were made by adjusting for potential respiring soil volume as water table changed and using measured soil temperatures. The results indicate that the effect of these factors on microbial respiration may explain a large part of the diurnal and seasonal variation observed in CO2 efflux. As in coastal tundra sites, environmental changes that alter water table depth in riparian tundra communities will have large effects on ecosystem CO2 efflux and carbon balance.

TI Impacts of groundwater extraction on calcareous fen floristic quality

ID TEMPERATE ZONE; PLANTS
AB Groundwater withdrawal has increased over the past several decades throughout the U.S. Upper Midwest, yet impacts of pumping on groundwater-dependent wetlands remain understudied. Here, we compared measures of floristic quality, hydrologic conditions, and nutrient availability in pairs of more-impacted fens and less-impacted fens throughout Wisconsin. Floristic quality was significantly lower in more-impacted fens than in less-impacted fens, the result of the disappearance of rare and specialist species and the increase in richness and cover of non-native and weedy species. Plots within more-impacted fens generally had lower root-zone volumetric water content, greater depth to water table, and higher available nitrogen and phosphorus than within less-impacted fens, although nonuniformly among or within sites. Lower volumetric water content predicted plot-level declines in floristic quality, richness of rare or specialist species, an increase in the number of non-native or problematic species, and an increase in cover of non-native and problematic species. Our results strongly suggest that groundwater withdrawals have substantial negative impacts on nearby fen quality and furthering imperilment of several species they contain.

AB Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), including 19 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 15 PAH-derivatives (oxygenated and nitrogen heterocyclic PAHs), were measured in streams in a remote headwater catchment in northern Europe and in more urbanized, downstream areas. Sampling was conducted during 2014 to 2016 and included the main hydrological seasons (snow-free, snow-covered, and spring flood) at six sampling sites. Levels of the targeted PACs varied substantially over time and space and were up to 110-fold (on average 17-fold) and 7000-fold (on average 670-fold) higher for PAHs and PAH-derivatives, respectively, during spring flood compared with preceding snow-covered and snow-free seasons. Higher levels of Sigma PACs were generally found in a headwater stream draining a mire than at an adjacent forested site, with up to 20 times and 150 times higher levels for Sigma PAH and Sigma PAH-derivatives, respectively. The particle-bound PAC levels were positively correlated to surface runoff in the mire stream (Sigma PAHs: p = 0.032; Sigma PAH-derivatives: p = 0.040) but not in the corresponding forest stream, during snowmelt and winter base flow. In more urbanized downstream areas, particle-bound PACs were instead strongly associated with suspended particulate matter (p < 0.05; Sigma PAHs and Sigma PAH-derivatives except one site). Levels of Sigma PACs in the streamwater were on average 3-fold higher downstream of the most densely populated area than at the outlet of the headwater catchment. The higher PAC levels in the downstream water compared to the remote headwater were clearer when normalized to SPM amounts (instead of water volume), with a gradual downstream trend between the sites.

AB One fourth of the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry operations such as ditch network maintenance increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes an understanding of how forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of ditch cleaning on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that ditch cleaning lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to ditch cleaning. Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after ditch cleaning, which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of ditch network maintenance. The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that ditch cleaning had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when ditch cleaning does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary.

AB This study reconstructs a long-term record of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux release from an upland peat catchment in Northern England in order to construct a model of future DOC flux. A structural modelling approach is used to develop models for DOC production in the acrotelm in relation to changing temperature and water table depth. DOC production in the acrotelm is coupled with a description of release of reserves of carbon from the catotelm triggered by enzymic latch mechanisms. The model needs only three parameters to be successfully matched to the data, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of over 90% against the reconstructed catchment record. Model results suggests that the half-life of the effect of drought on the catchment is 11.2 years and that the majority of DOC production comes from the acrotelm/catotelm boundary. Using the calibrated model and predictions of future rainfall and temperature, it is forecast that DOC flux from this peat-covered catchment will increase to 25 tonnes C/km(2) by 2010 at a rate of 0.48-0.88 tonnes C/km(2)/year. These results imply a total DOC flux from UK rivers of 0.88-0.83 Mt C in 2002 and of the order of 1 Mt C by 2010. The implications for terrestrial carbon storage and water treatment are discussed.

AB We present a testate amoebae training set for building a paleohydrology transfer function. Ninety-one samples were collected from three Sphagnum peatlands in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, NE China. Redundancy analysis revealed that depth to the water table (DWT) and moisture content (% water) are the primary factors that control testate amoebae assemblages. Transfer functions for prediction of these two environmental variables were developed. The root mean square error (RMSEP) for DWT and moisture content were 6.74 cm and 1.49 %, respectively, assessed with "leave-one-out" cross validation. We applied a more robust cross validation method for clustered structure data, "leave-one-site-out," and the RMSEP of the best performance model increased to 6.90 cm and 1.67 %, but all models still had predictive power. The effect of uneven sampling was tested using new statistical approaches. Greater numbers of samples in the middle range of the gradient yielded smaller RMSEP values than did samples from the extreme wet and dry ends of the spectrum, where there were fewer samples. Our results indicate this training set is a potentially important tool for paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, NE China. It will contribute to understanding climate change, particularly past monsoon activity, in this region.

AB Severe drying of soils can lead to cracking and thus the generation of new hydrological pathways. In soils that show hydrophobic behaviour upon drying, it is possible that such flowpaths survive beyond the period of the drought that caused the initial cracking. Change in flowpaths in peat following severe droughts has been proposed as an explanation for tong-term increases in DOC concentration leaving peat-covered catchments across the Northern Hemisphere With changes in climate making dry summers and summer drought more likely in the UK, this study aims to understand whether there have been long-term flowpath changes in a peat soil following a 1 in 33 year drought. The measure used by this study to analyse changes in the flowpaths present in peat soils is the probability of runoff initiation. The probability of runoff initiation represents a method for comparing the occurrence of runoff from the catchment in comparison to the precipitation inputs relative to the antecedent conditions of the catchment. The study examines 1674 rainfall events over a five year period before and after a severe drought and shows that the most important factor for controlling runoff initiation is the total amount of rainfall in any event and that the system is capacity rather than rate limited. The time of year is found to have a significant influence upon the probability of runoff initiation above and beyond the effect of water table depth and rainfall character. However, the study can find no persistent effect of severe drought beyond the period of drought itself, suggesting that, in terms of the factors investigated here, peat flowpaths are stable against changes in drought frequency and severity with climate change and cannot contribute to long-term changes in DOC runoff.

AB The total pools and chemical species of Fe in soils from seven groundwater/surface water ecotones were analysed. The associated soil waters from four of the sites were analysed for Fe and SO4. The selected sites were mainly the upper reaches of streams in coniferous forests, having a size of 3-4 m(2). The results showed great differences in total Fe concentrations in the soils. The high positive correlation between pyrophosphate-extractable Fe and organic matter (Spearman rank coefficient 0.700) indicated the importance of organic C for the retention of Fe. Organically-bound Fe and Fe oxides were the major species in all the soils. Moreover, soil water analyses suggested that sulphate reduction occurs, with the formation of Fe-sulphides during seasons with high microbiological activity. Comparable sulphate concentrations in groundwater and runoff waters, but much lower concentrations in peat waters, may be a result of a dynamic cycling of reduction and oxidation within the soils. Another explanation could be that most of the discharging groundwater was flowing quickly through more permeable sections of the soil.

AB The link between inter-annual variability (IAV) in ecosystem CO(2) exchange and meteorological conditions was evaluated using a decade (June 1998 to October 2008) of eddy covariance (EC) and meteorological data recorded at the Mer Bleue peatland, a large ombrotrophic bog located in Ontario, Canada (45.40 degrees N lat., 75.50 degrees W long.). Year-to-year variability in meteorology was particularly marked by prolonged growing periods, warmer soil temperature and greater water table drawdown during the summer of 1998-1999 and 2001-2003 periods. Ecosystem response to short- and long-term environmental alterations may be direct, where the response can be predicted as a linear function of the changing variables (constant slope) and/or indirect, in which case, a change in the rate of a particularly ecosystem response can be expected (variable slope). In this study, the potential direct and indirect effects of a decadal meteorological variability on IAV of ecosystem CO(2) exchange were evaluated using a constant and variable slope multiple regression models. Indirect effect of lAV that results from a functional change in ecosystem response was identified and quantified as significant year-to-year changes in the slopes of the regression (i.e. as a difference between a constant and variable slope model) between weekly means of daytime net ecosystem productivity (NEP(day)) or nighttime ecosystem respiration (R(night)) and the following meteorological variables: photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), water table depth (WTD), air (TA) and soil temperature (TS), relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed(WS). Results of the analysis illustrated that the direct effects of meteorological variation (seasonal and inter-annual) together explained similar to 67% of the total variance in both NEP(day) and R(night) over the 10 year period, with seasonal (week-to-week) variations explaining most of the total variance in NEP(day)(48.2%) or R(night) (61.2%). Indirect effects (functional change) explained only 5.3% and 3.4% of the total variance in NEP(day) and R(night) over the 10 year monitoring period, respectively. The relationship between NEP(day) and TA, RH and that of R(night) and TS were identified as the sources of the slope changes. This level of indirect effect of meteorological variation at Met Bleue bog is smaller than that found previously at some upland sites and may be a general characteristic of undisturbed peatland ecosystems. Hence, at present variations in CO(2) exchange at this bog are largely tuned to the cyclic seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in meteorology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The climate of Siberia is primarily influenced by the Siberian High (SH), although other large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, in particular North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) storm tracks, play an important role. How variability in the relative strength and trajectory of these climatic systems has affected local to regional palaeoclimatic conditions remains little known. Here, we employ multi-proxy peat core analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15 in Sphagnum, plant macrofossil, pollen, charcoal) from Plotnikovo Mire, part of the Great Vasyugan Mire in western Siberia (Tomsk province, Russia). We provide a high-resolution record of variations in climatic conditions and the biogeochemical fluxes of carbon and nitrogen over the past 2000 years and then discus the link between local climatic conditions and larger scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Our record shows that generally warm and dry conditions prevailed from BC 500 to 500 CE. Warm and wet episodes occurred during the early (800-950 CE) and later (1150-1300 CE) part of the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly (MCA), and were interrupted by a warm and dry mid-MCA phase (1000-1200 CE). Progressively cooler and wetter conditions established from 1400 CE, which became most marked between 1600 and 1850 CE, coincident with the Little Ice Age (LIA). Finally, drying of the mire surface reflects the warming trend of recent decades. We found that C accumulation was greater (90 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) at times of wetter conditions and when Sphagnum was dominant, and lowest (35 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) during periods of mixed vascular plant growth and Sphagnum under drier/unstable hydrological conditions. This peatland has been an active C sink over the past 1500 years, however, its ability to sequester carbon has decreased with recent warming and may continue to decrease with ongoing climatic warming and drying. We hypothesise that generally warm and moist conditions at the study site and over wider Siberia during the MCA could have been linked to a weakening of the Siberian High, which in turn enhanced the ingress of Atlantic moisture-carrying air masses across Siberia. Conversely, a strengthened SH overlapping negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) modes during the LIA, resulted in a longer cold season with a delayed snowmelt and diminished evapotranspiration. This study shows that the interplay of moisture bearing air masses from different origins led to complex local hydroclimate and biogeochemical patterns. However, to resolve the spatio-temporal coherency of such climate variability due to the interaction of different air masses, and therefore better predict future climate changes, a denser network of palaeo-records is needed.

AB Biologically mediated redox processes in the riparian zone, like denitrification, can have Substantially beneficial impacts on stream water quality. The extent of these effects, however. depends greatly oil the hydrological boundary conditions. The impact of hydrological processes oil a wetland's nitrogen sink capacity was investigated in a forested riparian fen which is drained by a first-order perennial stream. Here, we analysed the frequency distributions and time-series of pH and nitrogen, silica, organic carbon and oxygen concentrations in throughfall, soil solution, groundwater and stream water, and the groundwater levels and stream discharges from a 3-year period. During baseflow conditions, the stream was fed by discharging shallow, anoxic groundwater and by deep, oxic groundwater. Whereas the latter delivered considerable amounts of nitrogen (similar to 0-37 mg l(-1)) to the stream, the former was almost entirely depleted of nitrogen. During stormflow, near-surface runoff in the upper 30 cut soil layer bypassed the denitrifying zone and added significant amounts to the nitrogen load of the stream. Nitrate-nitro-en was close to 100% of deep groundwater and stream-water nitrogen concentration. Stream-water baseflow concentrations of nitrate, dissolved carbon and silica were about 1.6 mg l(-1), 4 mg l(-1) and 7.5 mg l(-1) respectively, and > 3 mg l(-1), > 10 mg l(-1) and < 4 mg l(-1) respectively during discharge peaks. In addition to that macroscale bypassing effect, there was evidence for a corresponding microscale effect: Shallow groundwater sampled by soil suction CLIPS indicated complete denitrification and lacked any seasonal signal Of Solute concentration, which was in contrast to piezometer samples from the same depth. Moreover, mean solute concentration in the piezometer samples resembled more that of suction-cup samples from shallower depth than that of the same depth. We conclude that the soil Solution CLIPS sampled to a large extent the immobile soil-water fraction. In contrast, the mobile fraction that was sampled by the piezometers exhibited substantially shorter residence time, thus being less exposed to denitrification, but predominating discharge of that layer to the stream. Consequently, assessing the nitrogen budget based on suction-cup data tended to overestimate the nitrogen consumption in the riparian wetland. These effects are likely to become more important with the increased frequency and intensity of rainstorms that are expected due to climate change. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Predicted daily fluxes from an ecosystem model for water, carbon dioxide, and methane were compared with 1994 and 1996 Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) field measurements at sites dominated by old black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) (OBS) and boreal fen vegetation near Thompson, Man. Model settings for simulating daily changes in water table depth (WTD) for both sites were designed to match observed water levels, including predictions for two microtopographic positions (hollow and hummock) within the fen study area. Water run-on to the soil profile from neighboring microtopographic units was calibrated on the basis of daily snowmelt and rainfall inputs to reproduce BOREAS site measurements for timing and magnitude of maximum daily WTD for the growing season. Model predictions for daily evapotranspiration rates closely track measured fluxes for stand water loss in patterns consistent with strong controls over latent heat fluxes by soil temperature during nongrowing season months and by variability in relative humidity and air temperature during the growing season. Predicted annual net primary production (NPP) for the OBS site was 158 g C.m(-2) during 1994 and 135 g C.m(-2) during 1996, with contributions of 75% from overstory canopy production and 25% from ground cover production. Annual NPP for the wetter fen site was 250 g C.m(-2) during 1994 and 270 g C.m(-2) during 1996. Predicted seasonal patterns for soil CO2 fluxes and net ecosystem production of carbon both match daily average estimates at the two sites. Model results for methane flux, which also closely match average measured flux levels of -0.5 mg CH4.m(-2). day(-1) for OBS and 2.8 mg CH4.m(-2). day(-1) for fen sites, suggest that spruce areas are net annual sinks of about -0.12 g CH4.m(-2), whereas fen areas generate net annual emissions on the order of 0.3-0.85 g CH4.m(-2), depending mainly on seasonal WTD and microtopographic position. Fen hollow areas are predicted to emit almost three times more methane during a given year than fen hummock areas. The validated model is structured for extrapolation to regional simulations of interannual trace gas fluxes over the entire North America boreal forest, with integration of satellite data to characterize properties of the land surface.

AB The Zoige Plateau Wetland, the largest alpine peat wetland in the world, is facing an extreme threat from over-grazing and drainage. For eco-hydrological protection, the influence of drainage on the wetland degradation is very significant. Although several negative impacts of the drainage ditches have been discussed by researchers in many studies, in this paper an Interactive Groundwater (IGW) modeling system is introduced to reproduce the hydrological process of the wetland and explain its degradation mechanism. The Longriba Wetland, a typical component of the Zoige Wetland, was taken as the research site because several wetlands in different degrees of degradation were included.
   Based on an established indicator system, the site was divided into three categories: Wetland Type I with slight degradation, Type II with medium degradation and Type III with heavy degradation. By comparing the simulated groundwater tables with the measured values, the IGW model has proved to be an effective approach to simulating the aquifer characteristics of the study site. The head contour and further seepage simulation of the site showed that drainage ditches have a severe influence on wetland degradation. In the vertical plane, the soil water in the submerged area mainly flows downward, and changes its pattern near the drainage ditches. While in the horizontal plane, soil water continuously flows from the center wetland to the drainage ditches, and then is lost through them. This speeds up the wetland degradation. The bigger and deeper ditches create greater degradation. Therefore, blocking ditches is suggested as a way to preserve the wetland moisture and prevent wetland degradation.

AB Currently, the most widely accepted hypothesis to explain high As concentrations in Bangladesh ground-waters is that dissolved organic C (DOC) reduces solid Fe (hydr)oxides and mobilizes sorbed arsenate. The nature of the DOC and its release mechanism are still controversial. Based on weekly to biweekly sampling over the course of one monsoon cycle at six monitoring wells of different depths, it is proposed that storativity changes drive natural DOC release from clay-peat layers to the adjacent aquifers. With a decrease in hydraulic heads during the dry season, total mineralization and DOC concentrations increased. With the onset of the rainy season and an increase in hydraulic heads, release of clay-peat derived components stopped and vertical water displacement due to groundwater recharge from rainwater occurred, causing aquifer flushing and a decrease in total mineralization and DOC concentrations. Total As and DOC concentrations correlated over depth. However, at the depth of maximum concentrations, the As peak was observed during the rainy season. At present, the reason for this inverse seasonal trend between As and DOC is unclear. Higher mineralization or DOC concentrations could lead to increased As sorption or the increased arsenite release is a time-lag abiotic or microbial response to the DOC peak. The vulnerability of the Pleistocene aquifer towards increased As concentrations was found to be much higher than previously assumed. Though sorption capacities were determined to be higher than in the Holocene aquifer, probably due to intact Fe (hydr) oxides, long-term continuous As input from overlying clay and peat layers by the proposed seasonal storativity changes has led to increased aqueous As concentrations of 85 mu g/L, considerably higher than drinking water standards. Until now, aquifer and especially aquitard and aquiclude hydraulics have not been considered sufficiently when attempting to explain As mobilization in Bangladesh. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Geochemical and hydrological data from abandoned mine watersheds demonstrated that (1) point sources of pollution fail to account for total receiving watercourse metal load at higher flows and (2) an inverse relationship exists between river flow and pH due to peatland runoff. Quantifying the varying importance of point and diffuse pollution sources enabled prediction of treatment benefits for a major point source of pollution in one watershed. Instream zinc load increases with river flow (similar to 3 to 14 kg Zn/d) due to diffuse groundwater and surface runoff pollution sources at higher flows. Lab tests demonstrated that metal release from the streambed, driven by pH decreases at higher flows, also contribute to increased downstream metal loads. Predicting point source treatment benefits demonstrates major instream improvements at low flow (zinc decreases from >800 to 120 mu g Zn/L). At higher flows treatment benefits diminish (Zn decreases from 240 to only 200 mu g Zn/L) due to the greater influence of diffuse sources. A quantitative understanding of the variable importance of point and diffuse sources of pollution, and instream processes of metal attenuation and release, is crucial to evaluating the benefits of treatment to downstream water quality.

AB The world's forests are highly fragmented by linear disturbances, and many forests have failed to recover decades after abandonment. Lack of recovery is common in unproductive forests, such as treed peatlands, because of conditions that limit tree growth, including simplification of microtopography (loss of microsites). The persistence of these features affects biodiversity, but of particular concern in Canada is the detrimental effects on threatened woodland caribou. Although natural regeneration of trees in peatlands occurs in some places, it is not an effective recovery strategy for restoring the habitat of woodland caribou. This has led to restoration activities with costs exceeding CAD$12 500/km. However, current restoration does not consider wildfires, which can destroy planted trees but also initiate early seral conditions that favor natural regeneration. Here we compared tree regeneration on seismic lines and adjacent forest controls for burnt (75 sites) and unburnt (68 sites) treed peatlands in northeast Alberta, Canada. Tree regeneration (stems with a DBH < 1 cm/ha) varied from 28 500 in burnt lines, 11 440 in unburnt lines, and 18 210 in burnt forest, to 9520 in unburnt forest. Wildfires promoted denser regeneration in sites with a greater proportion of serotinous species and water table depth. Microtopography and terrain wetness explained regeneration on burnt lines, but not unburnt lines. In burnt and unburnt lines, sunlight, microtopography, and depth of water table most affected tree regeneration patterns.

AB A new process-based distributed model, the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) integrated catchment-based ecohydrology (NICE) model, was developed. The model includes surface-unsaturated-saturated water processes and assimilates land-surface processes describing the variation in phenology with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) satellite data. The model was applied to the Kushiro River catchment (northern Japan, area of 2204.7 km(2)) with a resolution of 500 m and 8 days averaged vegetation changes. Excellent agreement between simulated and measured values was obtained for soil temperature, soil moisture, groundwater level, and river flow discharge during the 6 month snow-free period, achieved by taking into account vegetation phenology, soil properties, and geological structure. The model explains water cycle change and drying phenomena in the Kushiro Mire associated with vegetation change caused by the increased sediment load due to river channelization and consequently the invasion of alder ( Alnus japonica) into the mire.

TI Utilisation of the sedimentological and hydrochemical dynamics of the

   paleo-shoreline indicators
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY

DT Article

   Zealand
AB Terrestrial sediments are generally simple to differentiate from lacustrine sediments, but the interface between the two is difficult to recognise when clean beach sand is absent. In addition, tracing the dispersal of pollutant trace metals at this interface can be a major problem because toxic and natural metal cycles often take the same path. To solve these problems, we studied the natural geochemical processes in a wetland along the shore of Lake Taupo, New Zealand to characterise the surficial sediments that could be used as indicators of shoreline processes and to determine the variability of natural metals in the system. Lake Taupo is New Zealand's largest lake, The Stump Bay Wetland is part of the South Taupo Wetland, which is situated along the southern edge of Lake Taupo and has an area of 15.4 km(2). Although much of the surrounding shoreline has been modified by human activity, the Stump Bay Wetland has retained its natural configuration. To understand the variability at the terrestrial-lacustrine inter-face, we characterised the surficial sediments using shallow cores to learn the stratigraphy and geochemical make up of the sediment using X-ray Fluorescence (XR-F) for major elements and selected metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Ba). In addition, we installed shallow piezometers to relate the stratigraphy and geochemistry to groundwater flow and chemical composition (pH, alkalinity, dissolved Fe). Silt deposits derived from floods alternate with peat accumulations in shallow cores taken in the centre of the wetland. The reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron controls the South Taupo wetland groundwater pH and total alkalinity. Sediment cores from the wetland have high iron concentrations (up to 15 vvt.%). The abundance of iron in the cores does not correlate with either loss on ignition (LOI) or silica abundance, indicating that the iron is derived from a combination of decay of organic matter and leaching from volcanic rock material, Concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium and magnesium tend to increase with depth, and reflect the increasing amount of inorganic matter in the core. Sulphur concentrations in the cores are relatively low, and there is a weak correlation with LOI. Although conditions for iron sulphide precipitation are possible in the wetland sediments, it does not occur within the upper I in of the sediment. The low topographic and groundwater gradient of the wetland area has led to a close interaction between sediment build-up and the hydrochemistry of the water flowing into the lake. In particular, zones of iron-rich diagenetic alteration of sediments at the surface water-groundwater interface could be used to fix the position of the shoreline in paleo-lake studies, as long as the chemical interactions along the groundwater flow path are understood.

AB We investigated oribatid mite communities in a Sphagnum-dominated boreal peatland system characterised by a mosaic of oligotrophic and meso-eutrophic areas. We aimed to determine the relative importance of environmental factors (pH, Sphagnum nutrient content, water table level, diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes in the surrounding plant community) and spatial variation in influencing abundance, diversity and community composition of aquatic and terrestrial oribatid mites. Among environmental variables, water table level (micro-topography), pH, and K in Sphagnum tissues were the main predictors of Oribatida community structure. Aquatic species were associated with pools; two terrestrial species-Hoplophthiracarus illinoisensis and Nothrus pratensis-were associated with oligotrophic hummocks; the rest of terrestrial species were associated with dryer mesotrophic and eutrophic habitats. Low water table depth (hummocks), high local plant diversity, and high P in Sphagnum tissues were predictors of high abundance of terrestrial Oribatida. Species richness of terrestrial Oribatida was linked with low water table and high plant diversity. For aquatic Oribatida abundance, water table depth was the single most important predictor variable. Plot trophic class (its status on the peatland poor-rich gradient assigned based on plant indicator species) was also a significant predictor of terrestrial Oribatida abundance, richness, and community structure. Spatial structuring was important for terrestrial Oribatida community composition, weak (P < 0.10) for terrestrial Oribatida abundance and richness, and not significant for aquatic Oribatida.

AB Sphagnum farming provides a sustainable wet land use alternative for drained peatland agriculture. Since 2011 Sphagnum has been cultivated on formerly drained bog grassland at Hankhauser Moor in north-west Germany. The site has been rewetted and is equipped with an automatic irrigation system which controls the inflow and outflow of water. We used measurements and models to determine the amount of irrigation water needed to keep the water table just below the Sphagnum surface throughout the year. In winter there was a water surplus, whereas in spring and summer evapotranspiration exceeded precipitation, creating a water deficit. Next to evapotranspiration, horizontal seepage was a major cause of water loss. Modelling indicated that the amount of irrigation required to make up the water deficit in the dry hydrological year 2013 (November 2012 to October 2013) amounted to 359 mm (3,588 m(3) ha(-1)). To compensate for the average water deficit over the 20year period 1993-2013, 160 mm of water would be needed annually (i.e. 1,600 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)), but the maximum water deficit accumulated during that period was much higher, at 6,363 m(3) ha(-1). In relative terms, both evapotranspiration and seepage losses will decrease with increasing size of the rewetted area because drained surroundings enhance water losses from the wetter Sphagnum farming site, both as evapotranspiration due to advection (oasis effect) and as horizontal seepage due to steepening of hydraulic gradients. For successful Sphagnum farming the water demand must be considered and an appropriate water supply must be guaranteed.

AB Sub-daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (production, mobility and instream processes) have the potential to create a subtle sub-daily rhythm of DOC variation in streams. We used high-frequency data, covering the spring-summer-autumn period, which included discharge, specific conductivity, pH, groundwater levels, temperature, evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel DOC cycles in northern catchments. We focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream (0.65 km(2)) before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream (3.2 km(2)), with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel. DOC cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14:00 h and temporally varying amplitude, with a median of 0.61 mgl(-1). Results supported the hypothesis that diel DOC cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes, specifically the viscosity-effect theory: viscosity-driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush DOC from the peat to the stream. The temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel DOC cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature. Downstream, the did DOC signal was weaker, with around 4-fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon. The lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on DOC cycles. In-stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between DOC sources and stream reduced. The study highlighted that even in climates such as the Scottish Highlands, where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent, sub-daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur. Unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle.

AB The consolidation and permeability of transparent amorphous silica are studied in this paper. Transparency is achieved by matching the refractive indices of the amorphous silica particles and the pore fluid. The fundamental premise of this research is that transparent synthetic soils made of amorphous silica can be used in model tests to study three-dimensional deformation and flow problems, using nonintrusive optical visualization techniques, if amorphous silica can be produced with geotechnical properties similar to natural soils. The amorphous silicas studied in this paper exhibit consolidation behavior similar to that of organic clays and peat. The permeability of the material falls within the range typically reported for clays and peats.

AB Testate amoebae are widely used in ecological and palaeoecological studies of peatlands, particularly as indicators of surface wetness. To ensure data are robust and comparable it is important to consider methodological factors which may affect results. One significant question which has not been directly addressed in previous studies is how sample size (expressed here as number of Sphagnum stems) affects data quality. In three contrasting locations in a Russian peatland we extracted samples of differing size, analysed testate amoebae and calculated a number of widely-used indices: species richness, Simpson diversity, compositional dissimilarity from the largest sample and transfer function predictions of water table depth. We found that there was a trend for larger samples to contain more species across the range of commonly-used sample sizes in ecological studies, Smaller samples sometimes failed to produce counts of testate amoebae often considered minimally adequate. It seems likely that analyses based on samples of different sizes may not produce consistent data. Decisions about sample size need to reflect trade-offs between logistics, data quality, spatial resolution and the disturbance involved in sample extraction. For most common ecological applications we suggest that samples of more than eight Sphagnum stems are likely to be desirable. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB This article hypothesizes that production and preservation of source-rock type facies in deltaic systems, both landward and seaward of a coastline, is mutually exclusive, time-successive and related to the dynamics of relative sea level. Sedimentologic research in the Holocene Mississippi and Rhone delta complexes suggests that rheotrophic peats and associated organic-rich beds preferably accumulate in the accommodation space created behind landward stepping shorelines in a transgressive systems tract (TST). Such a setting also allows for a sufficient supply of recharging fresh nutrient-rich groundwater into the peat forming mires [Kosters, E.C., Suter, J.R., 1993. Facies relationships and systems tracts in the late Holocene Mississippi Delta Plain. Journal of Sedimentary Petrology 63 (4) 727-733.]. Independently carried-out quantitative paleoecological studies in the same delta systems (and in addition in the Orinoco and Po deltas) suggest that in a progradational setting (highstand systems tract/HST), seasonally discharged nutrient- and sediment-laden river waters on the shelf may give rise to anoxia or dysoxia. Subsequent overfertilization of the shelf leads to accumulation of organic-rich mud belts on the shelf [VanderZwaan, G.J., Jorissen, F.J., 1991. Biofacial patterns in river-induced anoxia. In: Tyson, R.V., Pearson, T.H. (Eds.), Modern and Ancient Continental Shelf Anoxia. Geological Society of London, Special Publication no. 58, pp. 65-82.]. Thus, production and preservation of source-rock type facies landward of a shoreline (as peats and related sediments) is preferred in a TST, when accommodation space and nutrient supply are landward of the shoreline. Vice versa, production and preservation of such facies seaward of a shoreline (as organic-rich shelf muds) occurs preferentially in a highstand systems tract. In that situation, accommodation space is on the shelf, where river-fed nutrients are supplied as well. This hypothesis suggests further potential for application of sequence stratigraphic concepts for improved understanding of the occurrence of source-rock type facies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Understanding the factors that control As concentrations in groundwater is vital for supplying safe groundwater in regions with As-polluted aquifers. Despite much research, mainly addressing Holocene aquifers hosting young (<100 yrs) groundwater, the source, transport, and fate of As in Pleistocene aquifers with fossil (>12,000 yrs) groundwaters are not yet fully understood and so are assessed here through an evaluation of the redox properties of the system in a type locality, the Po Plain (Italy).
   Analyses of redox-sensitive species and major ions on 22 groundwater samples from the Pleistocene arsenic-affected aquifer in the Po Plain shows that groundwater concentrations of As are controlled by the simultaneous operation of several terminal electron accepters. Organic matter, present as peat, is abundant in the aquifer, allowing groundwater to reach a quasi-steady-state of highly reducing conditions close to thermodynamic equilibrium. In this system, simultaneous reduction of Fe-oxide and sulfate results in low concentrations of As (median 7 mu g/L) whereas As reaches higher concentrations (median of 82 mu g/L) during simultaneous methanogenesis and Fe-reduction. The position of well-screens is an additional controlling factor on groundwater As: short screens that overlap confining aquitards generate higher As concentrations than long screens placed away from them. A conceptual model for groundwater As, applicable worldwide in other Pleistocene aquifers with reducible Fe-oxides and abundant organic matter is proposed: As may have two concentration peaks, the first after prolonged Fe-oxide reduction and until sulfate reduction takes place, the second during simultaneous Fe-reduction and methanogenesis.

AB The Litavka River (length 56 km, watershed area 630 km(2), average flow at the outlet to the Berounka River 2.57 m(3) s(-1)) drains the historical mining, ore processing, and smelting region of Pr bram. This Ag-Pb-Zn+/-Sb ore district (production from the thirteenth century to 1978, locally to 1980) is known for extensive heavy metal contamination. Recent contamination of the Litavka River system is mostly related to the erosion of contaminated soils and fluvial floodplains sediments, especially from a low-gradient river section located immediately below the ore district, where the fine-grained floodplain sediments are from 1.0 to 1.7 m thick. Radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometry dating of charcoal fragments separated from one floodplain profile showed calibrated (14)C age in the range AD 1220-1284 at a depth of 1.2 m below the surface, while depths of 0.4 and 0.8 m yielded ages in the range AD 1680-1939. Formation of this floodplain was related to disturbance of the river equilibrium resulting from deforestation and the influx of fine-grained material from ore processing, including historical failures of settling ponds. Fluxes of heavy metals during flood events in the Litavka River were studied 35 km downstream below the ore district. Metals are transported here mostly (more than 99% for Pb) in the form of suspended particulate matter (SPM), which at the outlet of the Litavka River contains 2,016 mg kg(-1) Zn, 918 mg kg(-1) Pb, and 25.5 mg kg(-1) Cd on average. During a snowmelt-related minor flood event between March 25 and 29, 2006 (peak flow 36.6 m(3) s(-1)), the river transported 2,400 tonnes of SPM during 4 days, containing 74 kg of Cd, 2,954 kg of Pb, and 5,811 kg of Zn. During larger floods (water flows above 55 m(3) s(-1) have occurred here 27 times during the last 77 years), the contamination is more diluted by material eroded in the floodplain along the middle and lower river course.

AB The ecohydrological impact of tree-canopy removal on moss and peat, which provide a principal carbon store, is just starting to be understood. Different mosses have contrasting contributions to carbon and water fluxes (e.g., Sphagnum fuscum, Pleurozium schreberi) and are strongly influenced by tree-canopy cover. Changes in tree-canopy cover may therefore lead to long-term shifts in species composition and associated ecohydrological function. However, the medium-term response to such disturbance, the associated lag in this transition to a new ecohydrological and biogeochemical regime, is not understood in detail. We investigate this medium-term (4years) ecohydrological, biogeochemical, and species compositional response to tree-canopy removal using a randomized plot design within a northern peatland. This is the only study to test for the influence of increased light alone. We demonstrate that changes in treatment plots 4years after tree-canopy removal were not significant. Notably, P.schreberi and S.fuscum remained within their respective plots post treatment, and there was no significant difference in plot resistance to evapotranspiration or carbon exchange. Results show that tree-canopy removal alone has little impact on bryophyte ecohydrology in the short or medium-term. This resistance to disturbance contrasts strongly with short-term changes observed within mineral soils, suggesting that concurrent shifts in the large scale hydrology induced within such disturbances are necessary to cause rapid ecohydrological transitions. Understanding this lagged response is critical to determine the strength of medium to long-term negative ecohydrological feedbacks within peatlands in addition to carbon and water fluxes on a decadal timescale in response to disturbance.

AB Sound taxonomy is a major requirement for quantitative environmental reconstruction using biological data. Transfer function performance should theoretically be expected to decrease with reduced taxonomic resolution. However for many groups of organisms taxonomy is imperfect and species level identification not always possible.
   We conducted numerical experiments on five testate amoeba water table (DWT) transfer function data sets. We sequentially reduced the number of taxonomic groups by successively merging morphologically similar species and removing inconspicuous species. We then assessed how these changes affected model performance and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction using two fossil data sets.
   Model performance decreased with decreasing taxonomic resolution, but this had only limited effects on patterns of inferred DWT, at least to detect major dry/wet shifts. Higher-resolution taxonomy may however still be useful to detect more subtle changes, or for reconstructed shifts to be significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A lysimeter method using undisturbed soil columns was used to investigate the effect of water table depth and soil properties on soil organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivated peat soils. The study was carried out using cultivated organic soils from two locations in Sweden: Orke, a typical cultivated fen peat with low pH and high organic matter content and Majne-garden, a more uncommon fen peat type with high pH and low organic matter content. Even though carbon and nitrogen contents differ greatly between the sites, carbon and nitrogen density are quite similar. A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil monoliths (50 cm high, 029.5 cm) per site. They were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) after the original vegetation was removed. The lysimeter design allowed the introduction of water at depth so as to maintain a constant water table at either 40 cm or 80 cm below the soil surface. CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from the lysimeters were measured weekly and complemented with incubation experiments with small undisturbed soil cores subjected to different tensions (5, 40. 80 and 600 cm water column). CO(2) emissions were greater from the treatment with the high water table level (40 cm) compared with the low level (80 cm). N(2)O emissions peaked in springtime and CH(4) emissions were very low or negative. Estimated GHG emissions during one year were between 2.70 and 3.55 kg CO(2) equivalents m(-2). The results from the incubation experiment were in agreement with emissions results from the lysimeter experiments. We attribute the observed differences in GHG emissions between the soils to the contrasting dry matter liability and soil physical properties. The properties of the different soil layers will determine the effect of water table regulation. Lowering the water table without exposing new layers with easily decomposable material would have a limited effect on emission rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Stump Bay wetland forms part of the South Taupo wetland, which is situated on the southern shore of Lake Taupo and belongs to the largest continuous wetlands in the North Island of New Zealand. The wetland's extent has increased since the beginning of Lake Taupo's artificial lake level regulation in 1941. Hydrological and hydrochemical data collected seasonally from nine piezometers installed in the Stump Bay wetland over a duration of two years show the influence of the stratigraphy and groundwater flow on the hydrochemistry of the wetland.
   The hydrology is characterised by through-flowing or discharging groundwater, with a main flow direction towards the lake. The piezometric contour map shows a groundwater divide running from south-west to north-east, creating an eastern and western discharge system. Higher dissolved oxygen concentrations (0.3-6.1 g/m(3)) and slightly higher temperatures (8-18.9 degrees C) in the western part of Stump Bay suggest the presence of Tongariro River seepage water in this area. The eastern part of the wetland is likely to be fed by discharging water originating from the Turangi plain.
   The main chemical characteristic of Stump Bay's groundwater is the high concentration of total dissolved iron (up to 145 g/m(3)). High iron concentrations are found to be associated with the presence of a clay layer within the top metre of peat/sediment. The reduction of iron controls the groundwater's conductivity (0.07-0.6 mS/cm), alkalinity (18-423 g/m(3)), and pH (6-7.2). The nutrient status of the wetland's groundwater is generally low. Increased microbial activity at higher temperatures during summer is likely to cause seasonal fluctuations in pH, alkalinity, concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and for some sites dissolved iron. All of these parameters have higher values in summer and lower values in winter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bryophyte substrates and species may affect spore germination through allelopathy. Polytrichum strictum is currently expanding in peatlands in north-eastern China is this an effect of its superior spore germinability or do its gametophytes have a stronger allelopathic effect than do Sphagnum? We conducted a spore burial experiment to test the effect of species identity, substrate and water table depth (WTD) on spore germinability and bryophyte allelopathic effect with P. strictum and two Sphagnum species (S. palustre and S. magellanicum). After 5 months of burial during a growing, season, the spores were tested for germinability. Allelopathic effect of bryophyte substrates was assessed by the difference between spore germinability after being stored inside or outside the substrates. After burial, more than 90% of the spores lost their germinability across all three species due to ageing and allelopathy. Spore germinability differed among species, where the spores in S. palustre had a higher germination frequency than those in P. strictum. The three bryophytes maintained a higher germinability in Sphagnum than in Polytrichum hummocks, probably due to a stronger allelopathic effect of P. strictum. Water table draw down by 10 cm increased germinability by more than 60% across the three species. The study indicates that P. strictum does not possess an advantage regarding spore germination but rather its gametophytes have a stronger allelopathic effect Due to the weaker inhibitive effect of Sphagnum gametophytes, P. strictum may have a potential establishment superiority over Sphagnum in peatlands, in addition to a better drought tolerance, which may explain its current expansion.

AB Tomasz Mieczan (2009) Ciliates in Sphagnum peatlands: vertical micro-distribution, and relationships of species assemblages with environmental parameters. Zoological Studies 48(1): 33-48. The distribution of ciliates living among different species of mosses (Sphagnum angustifolium, S. cuspidatum, S. flexuosum, S. magellanicum, Polytrichum strictum, and P. commune) in eastern Poland Sphagnum peatlands is described. The highest species richness (23-35 taxa) occurred in hollows dominated by S. angustifolium, S. flexuosum, and S. palustre. Decidedly lower numbers of taxa (7-10) were observed in hummocks dominated by S. magellanicum and Polytrichum. The greatest abundance of ciliates was found in micro-sites dominated by S. flexuosum (25-30 individuals (ind./g), while the lowest was found in sites dominated by Polytrichum (4-6 ind./g). Likewise, independent of the species of mosses, micro-vertical differentiation of these protozoa was found. The number of species and abundance significantly increased at the deepest sampling depth. The upper sampling of mosses (0-5 cm) was dominated by mixotrophic taxa, whereas the deeper sampling level (5-10 cm) showed increases in the proportions of bacterivore species. In peatlands, the factors limiting the occurrence of ciliates are physical and chemical suitability - mainly the total organic carbon content and depth of water table (DWT), but also somewhat lower levels of pH and the species of moss. In turn, an increase in pH also increased the role of nutrients. Such factors have a significant effect on the occurrence of ciliates, The abundances of ciliates in spring and autumn were positively correlated with the concentration of organic matter independent of the species of moss; however, in summer, the influence of pH and DWT increased. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.1/33.pdf

AB Evaporation rates were measured for an oligotrophic raised peat bog dominated by the restionaceous rush Empodisma minus (Hook. f.) Johnson and Cutler in northern New Zealand.
   Evaporation rates were smaller than those found for other wetlands, ranging between 0.06-0.16 mm h(-1) during the daytime, and the average latent heat Aux accounted for only 23% of net radiation. Daily average evaporation was only 34% of the Penman potential open water rate, yet the soil was permanently close to saturation.
   Bowen ratios in the range 3-5 indicate that available energy is primarily partitioned into sensible heat by the dense plant canopy. Bowen ratios in this range are normally associated with semi-arid zone climates rather than with a permanently moist raised peat bog.
   According to the Penman-Monteith model, the conservative evaporation regime at this site is due to a very large canopy resistance, with daily averages in the range 150-608 s m(-1) when the canopy is dry, This large canopy resistance is probably the result of plant responses to a nutrient-poor environment, combined with the effect of an extremely dense canopy preventing the diffusion of water vapour from the moist peat substrate.
   Variations in canopy resistance behaviour are caused by variable degrees of canopy wetness for several days following rain, This behaviour poses difficulties for modelling evaporation in water balance studies, hence a simple scheme utilising the Penman potential open water evaporation is favoured.

ID REMOTE-SENSING APPROACH; CENTRAL KENYA RIFT; BARINGO
AB A cluster of artesian springs encircled by mounds of marsh and wet meadows was discovered near the equator in Kenya, East Africa. Each spring is capped by a dense fibrous root mat that covers a mound of clayey peat with a blister of water in the center. Individual mounds are similar to 15 m wide, 1-2 m high, and affect an area of similar to50 m(2). The central water-blister volume is <1 m(3). The arched semi-permeable vegetation cap appears to be buoyed upward by slow artesian flow that leaks through the cap and moves slowly away. Lush plant growth (Poaceae and Cyperaceae, algae, diatoms, and filamentous cyanobacteria) is supported even through the dry season (Dec.-Feb.). The term "artesian blister wetland" is proposed for this unusual marsh, which has not been described previously. Approximately 20 small, circular-to-oval artesian blister wetlands occur within a large spring and wetland complex (similar to1.3 km(2)) that includes several freshwater Typha marshes fed by ground-water seeps. The springs discharge along a rift-related fracture system near the contact between volcanic bedrock and late Quaternary sediments. Cores (1-2 m) through the mounds revealed a dense root mat underlain by water in the center and a clayey peat that is locally pebbly at the base surrounding the blister. LOI in the clayey peat decreases from 75% at surface to similar to10% at 0.4-1.2 m. Blister water is cool, fresh, and dysaerobic (T = 30-33 degreesC; pH = 6.2-7.2; conductivity similar to600 iS/cm; and DO = 50%; 0.6-3.5 mg/l). The spring/wetland mounds likely form by the blanketing of the land around the spring orifice with vegetation (paludification). Plants and cyanobacteria seem to trap sediment transported by surface run-off and wind. The mound grows with time, but its height is limited by the magnitude of the hydraulic head. These ecological niches are important freshwater resources for animals and humans in semi-arid environments.

AB Boreal black spruce forests typically have a dense ground cover of bryophytes. The two main bryophyte groups in boreal black spruce forests, feathermoss and Sphagnum, have ecophysiological characteristics that influence the biogeochemical cycles of black spruce forests differently. The objective of this study was to examine the environmental controls of ground cover composition and net primary production (NPP) of feathermoss and Sphagnum in a boreal black spruce forest in central Saskatchewan. The fraction of Sphagnum ground cover was positively correlated to canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance (r(2)=0.48, P=0.03), but the fraction of feathermoss ground cover was negatively correlated to canopy PAR transmittance in plots where Sphagnum was present (r(2)=0.87, P <0.0001). Sphagnum presence was inversely correlated (P=0.0001) to water table index, defined as water table depth relative to the peat layer, while feathermoss occurred in a wider range of microenvironments. Average NPP for 1998 was more than three times greater for Sphagnum (77 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than feathermoss (24 g C m(-2) year(-1)), but the average bryophyte NPP for 1998 was 25 g C m(-2) year(-1) because feathermoss was the dominant ground cover. The large, but differing, peat carbon content of Sphagnum- versus feathermoss-dominated boreal forests and peatlands necessitates the need to accurately quantify fraction ground cover. Additional validation of the empirical models between environmental variables and fraction ground cover of bryophytes is necessary, but the reported relationships offer an approach to model carbon dynamics of bryophytes in boreal forests and peatlands.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; SPLASH DETACHMENT
AB This study follows an earlier one which showed that organic materials in form of peat and farmyard manure decreased wash erosion. A rainfall simulator was added to a soil test bed so that soil erosion by raindrops could be monitored. The design of the soil test bed allowed soil slope to be controlled. The apparatus was used to test the raindrop erosion of three Trinidadian soils (a sandy loam, a clay loam and another clay) with three levels of added peat (0%, 4% and 8% by mass), compacted at three levels (95 kPa, 137 kPa and 179 kPa) and exposed to a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h(-1) falling on soils on four slope gradients (9%, 15%, 21%, and 30%). The aim of the test was to investigate how peat reduces the soil erosion process and was carried out by making intermediary measurements of infiltration and runoff. Bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils were measured prior to the measurement of raindrop erosion. Both bulk density and penetration resistance decreased with increasing levels of peat in all the three soils. Mean cumulative infiltration decreased from 6.6 mm to 4.3 mm; mean cumulative runoff increased from 17.9 mm to 39.0 mm and soil erosion increased from 1.56 kg to 2.78 kg in each case when the soil slope increased from 9% to 30%. Peat incorporation increased infiltration, and decreased runoff and soil erosion in all soils at all combinations of slopes and compaction efforts. Soil erosion was greater in the sandy loam than in the clay and clay loam soils. Compaction of the soil was found to increase surface runoff and decrease infiltration and soil loss. Results from this study confirm that the major reason why peat reduces soil erosion by rainfall is its effect in decreasing bulk density, increasing infiltration, and reducing runoff, rather than stabilising the soil. Multiple linear regression equations were developed for predicting soil erosion from the experimental factors. The results of this study further emphasise that for soil conservation, apart from adopting land use zoning of soils based on slopes, the incorporation of organic materials in steep arable slopes will greatly reduce soil erosion by water.

TI A Fine-scale Examination of Larix laricina and Picea mariana Abundances

AB Wetland research has described changes in plant communities along environmental gradients, however, little is known about the relationship between fine-scale hydrologic and abiotic factors and the relative abundances of individual, co-occurring species. Larix laricina (Eastern Larch) and Picea mariana (Black Spruce) are the 2 dominant tree species in open boreal peatlands in the northeastern US. In order to describe abiotic gradients that correlate with species abundances at local spatial scales, we collected data on Eastern Larch and Black Spruce stem abundances, groundwater pH, conductivity, depth to water table, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and canopy closure from 42 plots along 6 transects in an Adirondack wetland. We correlated stem abundances with each of the abiotic variables and then used regression to explain variation in stem abundances of the 2 species along those abiotic gradients. Percent canopy closure explained 56% of the variability in Eastern Larch stem abundance, and depth to groundwater was also positively correlated with number of Eastern Larch stems. These 2 abiotic conditions covaried; thus, the best model to explain variability in Eastern Larch stem abundance included only canopy closure. Black Spruce stem abundance was significantly lower in plots with higher water temperatures (R-2 = 0.31). In a multiple-regression model, depth to the water table explained an additional 6% of the variance and substantially reduced Mallows' C-p. Eastern Larch and Black Spruce appear to establish along different abiotic gradients at the scale of tens of meters within this study wetland. Although light levels, as mediated by canopy closure, would be predicted to influence the establishment of Eastern Larch based on its silvics, the strong negative relationship between Black Spruce stem abundance and water temperature has not been previously reported. Sampling other peatlands will allow us to determine the universality of these patterns and to better understand which environmental gradients operate at local spatial scales to structure patterns of tree distribution within peatlands.

AB Current efforts to assess changes to the wetland hydrology caused by growing anthropogenic pressures in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) require well-founded spatial and temporal estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET), which is the dominant component of the water budget in this region. This study assessed growing season (May-September) and peak growing season (July) ET variability at a treed moderate-rich fen and treed poor fen (in 2013-2018), open poor fen (in 2011-2014), and saline fen (in 2015-2018) using eddy covariance technique and a set of complementary environmental data. Seasonal fluctuations in ET were positively related to net radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit and followed trends typical for the Boreal Plains (BP) and AOSR with highest rates in June-July. However, no strong effect of water table position on ET was found. Strong surface control on ET is evident from lower ET values than potential evapotranspiration (PET); the lowest ET/PET was observed at saline fen, followed by open fen, moderately treed fen, and heavily treed fen, suggesting a strong influence of vegetation on water loss. In most years PET exceeded precipitation (P), and positive relations between P/PET and ET were observed with the highest July ET rates occurring under P/PET similar to 1. However, during months with P/PET > 1, increased P/PET was associated with decreased July ET. With respect to 30-year mean values of air temperature and P in the area, both dry and wet, cool and warm growing seasons (GS) were observed. No clear trends between ET values and GS wetness/coldness were found, but all wet GS were characterized by peak growing seasons with high daily ET variability.

AB Restoration of disturbed wetland systems is an important component of wetland mitigation, yet uncertainty remains about how hydrologic processes affect biologic processes and wetlands patterns. To design more effective restoration strategies and re-establish native plant communities in disturbed wetlands, it is imperative to understand undisturbed systems. A site within Cherokee Marsh located in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, contains a relatively undisturbed area of wetland consisting of plant communities common within the prairie landscape including a fen, sedge meadow, and shallow marsh. These distinct communities are found within an area of minimal topographic relief, yet transitions from one community to the next occur over short distances. This study sought to characterize the geologic, hydrologic, and chemical gradients associated with these shifts in vegetation to gain insight into the factors controlling the spatial differences in dominant plant species, which could be critical for restoration success. Vegetation analyses revealed a transition of dominant sedge species, which appeared to correspond to changes in hydrology from a ground-water dominated to a surface-water dominated system (as determined by water isotopes). Along the same vegetation transect, subsurface coring results show a heterogeneous composition of peat and till with lateral and vertical variations in stratigraphy, which relates to variability in ground-water discharge as evidenced by hydroperiods and stable isotope composition. Applications of this type of approach throughout the glaciated terrains of the midwestern and northeastern United States and Canada can improve future wetland restoration and management.

AB This study considers evaporation from northern peatlands, which are important global stores of soil carbon. Evaporation is commonly simulated using the Penman-Monteith model. The model incorporates the aerodynamic resistance to vapour transfer (r(a)), which can currently only be measured using expensive, tabour intensive micro-meteorological methods. A new approach to measuring r(a) is presented. The approach involves accurately measuring the evaporation from a modified Bellani plate atmometer, of known surface resistance and temperature. With knowledge of basic meteorological parameters, r(a) can then be calculated. The approach is compared to modelled resistances within a northern peatland: no significant difference was found between modelled and measured r(a). Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In northern landscapes, peatlands are widespread and their hydrological processes are complex. Furthermore, they are typically remote, limiting the amount and accuracy of in situ measurements. This is especially the case for evapotranspiration ET, which strongly influences watershed hydrology. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the validity of the bulk-transfer approach to estimate ET over boreal peatlands. The simplicity of the model relies on four assumptions: (i) near-neutral atmospheric conditions; (ii) wet surface; (iii) constant momentum roughness length depending on vegetation height; and (iv) constant water vapor roughness length, with the last two assumptions implying a constant water vapor transfer coefficient C-E. Using eddy covariance data from three Canadian peatlandsNecopastic (James Bay, Quebec), Mer Bleue (Ottawa, Ontario), and Western Peatland (Athabasca, Alberta)this paper shows that these sites are characterized by frequent occurrences of near-neutral atmospheric conditions, especially the Necopastic site, with nearly 76% of the 30-min data segments occurring under near-neutral stratification. The analysis suggests these near-neutral conditions occur as a result of strong mechanical turbulence and weak buoyancy effects. The bulk-transfer approach gives promising results for 30-min and daily ET in terms of mean error and correlation, with performances similar to the Penman equation, without requiring net radiation data. The accuracy of the approach is likely related to the number of near-neutral periods and the elevated position of the water table, which backs up the wet surface assumption.

AB Large bottomless lysimeters were investigated for their suitability as a tool in the study of water balances of treeless and tree-covered areas on a raised mire. The lysimeters, large enough to contain a mature tree, were developed to measure the liquid discharge from the peat monolith they enclosed. By determining the other, less elusive components of the water balance, this approach enables evapotranspiration rates to be estimated and comparisons between treeless and tree-covered areas to be made.
   The principal features of the design and operation of the lysimeters are described. Discharge measured with the lysimeters was analysed for short-term periods as well as for a hydrological year, and was compared with expected amounts of discharge obtained from a simplified water balance (D-exp = P - 1.1 E-t for the winter, and D-exp = P - 08 E-t for the summer). Results indicated that D was reliable for short intervals (10 days on average) with moderate amounts of rainfall. Under more extreme weather conditions, leakage underneath the lysimeter walls could occur, resulting from the strong slope-dependent water exchange across the lysimeter. Suggestions are made for improvements to the design of the lysimeter system, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peat deposits from the littoral part of the wetland 2nd Pond on Nightingale Island in the central South Atlantic have been analysed to investigate the Holocene climate development on the island and to test a hypothesis about regionally persistent humidity variations. A variety of proxies were analysed - total carbon and nitrogen, biogenic silica, diatoms, amount of organic matter, macrofossils and magnetic susceptibility - and together with the lithology they are interpreted as a record reflecting changes in humidity/precipitation. Early Holocene (10,000-8500 cal. BP) was possibly significantly drier than today, probably caused by a southerly displacement of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW) during the Antarctic climate optimum. From 8500 cal. BP and onwards, the climate became generally more humid and surface run-off increased due to higher precipitation, possibly as an effect of increased influence from the SHW as it moved north. During this generally humid period, our data disclose a distinct pattern of recurrent centennial- to millennial-long events of increased precipitation and the results corroborate the only other study in the region with a similar humidity record. The events might represent large-scale climate oscillations in the Southern Hemisphere, such as latitudinal shifts of the SHW, but may also be related to changes in sea surface temperatures.

AB Macropores are important components of soil hydrology. The spatial distribution of macropore flow as a proportion of saturated hydraulic conductivity was tested on six humid-temperate slopes using transects of tension infiltrometer measurements. Automated water table and overland flow monitoring allowed the timing of, and differentiation between, saturation-excess overland flow and infiltration-excess overland flow occurrence on the slopes to be determined and related to tension-infiltrometer measurements. Two slopes were covered with blanket peat, two with stagnohumic gleys and two with brown earth soils. None of the slopes had been disturbed by agricultural activity within the last 20 years. This controlled the potential for tillage impacts an macropores. The proportion of near-surface macropore flow to saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to vary according to slope position. The spatial patterns were not the same for all hillslopes. On the four non-peat slopes there was a relationship between locations of overland flow occurrence and reduced macroporosity. This relationship did not exist for the peat slopes investigated because they experienced overland flow across their whole slope surfaces. Nevertheless, they still had a distinctive spatial pattern of macropore flow according to slope position. For the other soils tested, parts of slopes that were susceptible to saturation-excess overland flow (e.g. hilltoes or flat hilltops) tended to have least macropore flow. To a lesser extent, for the parts of slopes susceptible to infiltration-excess overland flow, the proportion of macropore flow as a component of infiltration was also smaller compared with the rest of the slope. The roles of macropore creation and macropore infilling by sheet wash are discussed, and it is noted that the combination of these may result in distinctive topographically controlled spatial patterns of macropore flow.

AB We measured the diurnal change in groundwater level (GWL) and other hydrological factors in sphagnum peat in Sarobetsu Mire, Hokkaido. Japan. Field measurements confirmed that at nighttime, the GWL lowered just after a rainfall event and its rate of lowering slowed with time. until finally the GWL rose later in the night. At the study site, however, the groundwater inflow is minimal. The field experiment reproduced this tendency under the condition that the groundwater flow was completely interrupted.
   A new model was proposed to explain the GWL change during the night without groundwater flow, considering the peat-soil structure. Sphagnum peat has various scales of pores, including those found on the inside of plant cell walls. These pores were classified into two types based on their water infiltration capacity. One is the large pores that can easily be filled with water and also can be easily drained. The GWL is determined by the water in these large pores. The other types are the small pores that cannot be filled with water or drained of water so easily. Just after a rainfall event, the water potential in the large pores is larger than that in the small pores, and accordingly the discharge from the large pores to the small pores occurs. Since the GWL is determined by the large pores. the GWL decreases during the night. The GWL rate of decline slows, as the difference in the two pore potentials grows smaller. Further, when the water potential in the large pores in the night becomes lower than that in the small pores after intensive evapotranspiration, the water starts to move from the small pores to the large pores, and consequently the GWL increases later in the night. The diurnal change in the water loss from the large pores was compared with that caused by evapotranspiration. The comparison showed that all of the water loss from the large pores during daytime was evapotranspiration, whereas the water loss from the large pores during nighttime was mostly in the form of the storage change in the small pores. The storage change in the small pores in a day ranged from -0.19 to 0.21 cm day(-1), and these values were a large proportion of the day's total evapotranspiration. The characteristics of the subsurface water movement in sphagnum peat indicate that the sphagnum peat acts as a buffer zone to prevent drastic changes in the GWL. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

AB Subsurface flow can be an important process in gully erosion through its impact on decreasing soil cohesion and erosion resistance as soil water content or pressure increases and more directly by the effects of seepage forces on particle detachment and piping. The development of perched water tables fosters lateral flow that can result in seepage at the surface and/or formation of soil pipes by internal erosion of preferential flow paths. Continued internal erosion of soil pipes can lead to gullies, dam and levee failures. However, the processes involved in particle and aggregate detachment from soil pipe walls and transport processes within soil pipes have not been well studied or documented. This paper reviews the limited research on sediment detachment and transport in macropores and soil pipes and applies the knowledge learned from the much more extensive studies conducted on streams and industrial pipes to hydrogeologic conditions of soil pipes. Knowledge gaps are identified and recommendations are made for future research on sediment detachment and transport in soil pipes. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sphagnum peatlands represent a globally significant pool and sink of carbon but these functions are threatened by ongoing climate change. Testate amoebae are useful bioindicators of hydrological changes, but little experimental work has been done on the impact of water table changes on communities.
   Using a mesocosm experimental setting that was previously used to assess the impact of drought disturbance on communities and ecosystem processes with three contrasted water table positions: wet (-4 cm), intermediate (-15 cm) and dry (-25 cm), we studied the capacity of testate amoeba communities to recover when the water table was kept at -10 cm for all plots. The overall experiment lasted three years. We assessed the taxonomic and functional trait responses of testate amoeba communities. The selected traits were hypothesised to be correlated to moisture content (response traits: shell size, aperture position) or trophic role (effect traits: mixotrophy, aperture size controlling prey range).
   During the disturbance phase, the mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the wet and intermediate plots, while the community shifted to a dominance of "dry indicators" (Corythion dubium, Nebela tincta, Cryptodifflugia oviformis) and corresponding traits (loss of mixotrophy, and dominance of smaller taxa with ventral or ventral-central aperture) in dry plots. During the recovery phase we observed two contrasted trends in the previously wet and intermediate plots: communities remained similar where the Sphagnum carpet remained intact but species and traits indicators of drier conditions increased in plots where it had degraded. In the former dry plots, indicators and traits of wet conditions increased by the end of the experiment.
   This is one of the first experiment simulating a disturbance and subsequent recovery in ex-situ mesocosms of Sphagnum peatland focusing on the response of testate amoebae community structure as well as functional traits to water table manipulation. The results generally confirmed that testate amoebae respond within a few months to hydrological changes and thus represent useful bioindicators for assessing current and past hydrological changes in Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Forest stream riparian wetlands have a number of important features. This investigation treats one aspect, the nitrogen retention after upland clear-cutting which leads to elevated nitrate leaching, and the importance of the flow pathways in this connection. The runoff occurs mainly via the upper permeable section of the peat while the lower peat act as an aquitard, restricting the flow from the underlying till. The till groundwater is progressively artesian towards the discharging stream. Water analyses from piezometers show that the water chemistry in the peat is rather variable, indicating the presence of channelling. Channelling is also indicated by spring discharges from the peat that have elevated nitrate contents pointing to bypass flow. Redox bars indicating sulphate reduction display the same picture of irregular distribution. However, a general observation is that volumes with sulphate reduction increase towards the stream and that sulphate reduction occurs preferably in the surface peat, indicating the importance of a degradable substrate for the sulphate reducers. Nitrate reduction during the growth season occurs predominantly close to the upland till areas. The riparian tree stand is dominated by spruces which are likely to be disfavoured by the rising groundwater level after clear-cutting. The riparian tree stand does not extend far enough towards the upland to be benefited by the elevated nitrate flux. Buffer stands should be broader, extending into the till upland where they can utilise the leached nitrate and, more important, thanks to their deeper rooting depth protect the peatland trees against wind felling.

AB The maintenance or development of plant community diversity in species-rich wet grasslands has been a focus of water management considerations in the UK for the past 20 years. Much attention has been given to the control of water levels in the ditch systems within these wet grassland systems. In this paper we report measurements of aeration status and water-table fluctuation made on a peat soil site at Tadham Moor in Somerset, UK, where water management has focused on the maintenance of wet conditions that often result in flooding in winter and wet soil conditions in the spring and summer. Measurement and modelling of the water-table fluctuation indicates the possibility of,variability in the aeration of the root environment and anoxic conditions for much of the winter period and for part of the spring and summer. We have used water content and redox potential measurements to characterize the aeration status of the peat soil. We find that air-filled porosity is related to water-table depth in these situations. Redox potentials in the spring were generally found to be low, implying a reducing condition for nitrate and iron. A significant relationship (p < 0.01) between redox potential and water-table depth exists for data measured at 0.1 m depth, but no relationship could be found for data from 0.4 m depth.

AB This study used a long-term monitoring data to analyse the abundance, seasonal dynamics, spatial distribution and catchment export of total organic carbon (TOC) in one of the largest undisturbed peatland river catchment in Central Europe. Mean annual TOC concentrations in the Narew River basin were higher than 10-11 mg C L-1 which is similar to nemoral or Baltic rivers. The maximal monthly TOC concentrations occurred in May with a one-month delay from the spring maximum of water outflow. High TOC concentrations were accompanied by naturally increased organic nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations resulting in decreased water quality class despite the anthropogenic pressure is low. Mean annual export of TOC from the Narew River catchment amounted to 2.15 g C m(-2), which is nearly 25% higher than for the Vistula River, the recipient. TOC export form the analysed river basin in dry years was 30% lower and 50% higher in wet years than the multiannual average. The primary cause of high TOC concentrations in the Narew River catchment and high TOC export is the occurrence of biogeochemically active wetlands, functioning not only thanks to spring flooding of the valleys, but also based on permanent intensive groundwaters supply from surrounding plateaus. This emphasises the importance of basin hydrology in the regulation of carbon cycling in the temperate lowland catchments. Our results also indicate that in environmental zonation of Europe Narew River catchment should be classified as belonging to the Baltic Province (Nemoral environmental zone) rather then to Continental zone. This is because it is characterized with high riverine TOC concentrations and natural water oxygen depletion in summers. Thus, Environmental Stratification of Europe developed for environmental statistics and monitoring should be re-evaluated. Climate change is likely to affect the organic carbon circulation in peatland catchments and reduce TOC fluxes into river network.

AB A hydrological and geochemical investigation of the Prairie Flats surficial uranium deposit in Summerland, BC was undertaken to identify the principal controls on uranium deposition. A network of piezometers was installed and used to measure the hydraulic conductivities of the host sediments as well as the general flow direction and aqueous geochemistry of the resident groundwaters. Two hydrostratigraphic units were identified: a peat and clay unit overlying a sand and gravel unit. Measured hydraulic conductivities were on the order of 10(-7) and 10(-5) m/s, respectively, and the vertical hydraulic gradients indicate significant groundwater discharge upward into the peat and clay unit. Prairie Flats groundwaters are neutral to alkaline in pH, enriched in Ca2+ and HCO3-, and have dissolved uranium concentrations ranging from 10 to nearly 1,000 mug/l. Groundwater flow and geochemistry data were used to estimate the flux of uranium in groundwater at the site. A major fraction of the uranium is taken up by adsorption to organics. There is also evidence for subsequent desorption by the formation of soluble complexes with bicarbonate. Uranium that is not held by adsorption is most likely precipitated as uraninite, UO2(c). Reducing conditions in the peat and clay unit (Eh <0.1 V) relative to the underlying sand and gravel unit (Eh >0.2 V) may explain the high concentrations of uranium nearer ground surface. The current flux of uranium into the flats is significantly smaller than that calculated from the size and age of the deposit, which may be an indication of changing rates of deposition in response to varying climatic and hydrogeologic conditions over time.

AB Land development activities such as agriculture, clear cutting, peat mining, and the planting of forest plantations on wetlands can affect the hydrologic behavior of these ecosystems by affecting their water storage and release patterns on the landscape. The effects of these development activities on hydrologic fluxes in peatlands (Typic Medisaprists) were compared to the effects of forest management practices in North Carolina using a field-tested hydrologic simulation model (DRAINMOD). Simulations revealed that natural peat-based (Histosol) pocosin systems lose 66% (80 cm) of the 123 cm of average annual rainfall by evapotranspiration (ET) and 34% (42 cm/yr) via annual runoff. Annual runoff values were 63 cm/yr for peat mining areas, 48 cm/yr for cleared peatlands, 46 cm/yr for peatlands converted to agriculture and 34 cm/yr for pine plantations, once the forest canopy is closed. Thus, these wetland alterations, except for forestry, significantly increased runoff and decreased ET compared to the natural ecosystem. Forest pine plantation management decreased runoff and increased ET. A case study of the effects of forest management practices was reviewed for a 15-year-old drained loblolly pine plantation growing on fine sandy loam soils (Thermic Typic umbraquults) in the coastal plains of North Carolina. Forestry activities such as thinning (i.e., reduced leaf area index by 50%) decreased ET and canopy interception and nearly doubled drainage loss (38 cm/yr to 60 cm/ yr). Commonly applied forest practices, such as drainage, increased the average number of flow events with flows > 5 mm/day to 86 days per year from 26 days per year under natural conditions.

AB Surface and atmospheric controls on latent heat flux (Q(E)) and energy partitioning were assessed during three growing seasons at the Mer Bleue peat bog. The surface consisted of a sparse canopy (maximum leaf area index similar to 1.3) of low, mostly evergreen shrubs over moss-covered hummocks and hollows. Available energy was partitioned mostly to Q(E) (Bowen ratio often less than 0.5) throughout the growing seasons over an extensive range of water table fluctuation (as much as 50 cm). Q(E) was often at or below the equilibrium rate due to surface (low moss water content, strong vascular stomatal control) and/or atmospheric (low vapour pressure deficit (D-a)) factors. Turbulent energy fluxes varied with net radiation and the magnitude of the fluctuations were affected by D-a and moss water content. It is suggested that a change in source partitioning for Q(E) led to a change in Q(E) - D-a dynamics. Early in the growing season the moss was wet and the vascular canopy was replacing leaves, thus QE increased as D-a increased because moss, which reacts passively to D-a contributed strongly to Q(E). Later in the growing season as water table declined and the evaporation load reduced moss and fibric peat water contents, moss contributed less strongly to Q(E) and vascular contribution became more important. Also, stomatal control became more influential in reducing bulk surface conductance for water vapour and Q(E) in response to increasing D-a. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precommercial thinning is a silvicultural treatment commonly used to reduce the number of stems in densely regenerated stands. When applied to organic or mineral wetland sites, this treatment drastically eliminates a great portion of the canopy, which is responsible for maintaining evapotranspiration processes. The water table is susceptible, therefore, to rise in those sites where evapotranspiration is a significant regulator of the hydrological balance. The objective of this study was to investigate and quantify water table rise after precommercial thinning on post-harvest, drained forested wetlands, and to relate this rise to factors influencing evapotranspiration processes. The water table rose after precommercial thinning regardless of soil type, the distance to the drainage ditch, or the year of observation. In the second year after thinning on mineral soils, canopy openings were invaded by abundant and vigorous ground vegetation. Water table rise was significantly lower at that time than for the preceding year, indicating a tendency for faster hydrological recovery on mineral soil sites. The water table rise was related to the basal area removed, indicating the importance of woody vegetation in regulating water table depth in forested wetlands. Seasonal patterns in water table depth further illustrated the role of vegetation in the hydrological balance of such sites. Light to moderate thinning practices, therefore, appeared to be the most appropriate recommendation to avoid watering-up in young forested wetland stands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the scarcity of natural archives for palaeoenvironmental studies, the climatic evolution of South Africa during the late Quaternary remains the subject of considerable debate. Peat deposits provide excellent archives to investigate past environmental and climate variability. Vankervelsvlei, a fen near the southern Cape coast, located 152 m above mean sea level within the year-round rainfall zone of South Africa, is ideally suited to investigate past environmental changes in this region. A 14.6 m long sediment sequence was retrieved from the fen, from which 8.85 m of sediment have been analysed using a multiproxy approach. This includes elemental, macrofossil and micropalaeontological analyses. As a novelty in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in this region, leaf wax n-alkanes and their compound-specific stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes were also investigated.
   The chronology of the sequence is based on 13 radiocarbon ages and reveals a basal age of 37,430 (+1.570)/(-1,710) cal BP. The top of the investigated sequence has an age of 1,180 (+340)/(-170) cal BP. Leaf wax n-alkane abundances and their compound-specific stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes, as well as various (in)organic (bio)geochemical parameters, indicate that the older section of the sequence (37,430 (+1.570)/(-1,710) - -28,050 (+510)/-600 cal BP), which is composed of strongly degraded peat, represents a rather dry phase during MIS 3. This is followed by a hiatus of around 20,000 years (28,050(+510)/(-6)(00) to 8,360 (+730)/-810( )cal BP) reflecting the driest conditions during MIS 2. By comparing to supra-regional archives, this is hypothesised to have resulted from a larger extension of the Antarctic sea ice, which caused an equatorward shift of the Westerlies, blocking the tropical easterlies and resulting in drier conditions along the south coast and the adjacent coastal platform.
   During the Early Holocene, the input of reworked soil into the depression and subsequently renewed peat formation from 6,820(+305)/(-365) cal BP to 1,180(+340)/(-170) cal BP in Vankervelsvlei point to moister climatic conditions. Contraction of Antarctic sea ice and a poleward shift of the Westerlies during the Holocene is consistent with this interpretation.
   Climatic driving forces are suggested to differ between centennial/millennial and orbital time scales. Evapotranspirative enrichment through stronger winds is assumed to be the main driver on centennial to millennial time scale within this hydrological system. However, a combination of evapotranspiration and precipitation amount seems to be the most prominent driver on the orbital time scales. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bare-soil evaporation involves coupled flow of liquid water, water vapor, and heat. As evaporation results in non-isothermal conditions in the soil, the temperature dependence of transport properties and thermal fluxes of water and vapor must be accounted for. In a companion paper, we showed that the Richards equation, that is, a single-phase flow model assuming isothermal conditions, is applicable to accurately determine soil hydraulic properties including the medium to dry range from evaporation experiments by inverse modeling. This is warranted if pressure head data across a wide moisture range, that is, from almost saturated to almost air-dry, are used in the objective function and a suitable parameterization of the hydraulic conductivity function including vapor and non-capillary flow is used. In this article, we confirm the theoretical results by examining real evaporation experiments, in which we measured the temporal dynamics of evaporation rate, soil temperature, and pressure head in laboratory soil columns. Pressure head was measured with mini-tensiometers and relative humidity sensors. The measurements were evaluated by inverse modeling with the Richards equation assuming isothermal conditions and ambient temperature in the soil. Our results for a sandy and a loamy soil show that the observed transient water and vapor dynamics in the drying soil could be accurately matched, provided the hydraulic conductivity curve considered isothermal vapor diffusion and film flow. These components dominate hydraulic conductivity in the medium to dry soil moisture range and were uniquely identified in agreement with the theoretical analysis in the companion article.

AB In this paper, we provide screening-level analysis of plausible Everglades ecosystem response by 2060 to sea level rise (0.50 m) interacting with macroclimate change (1.5 A degrees C warming, 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and rainfall that either increases or decreases by 10%). We used these climate scenarios as input to the Ecological Landscape Model to simulate changes to seven interactive hydro-ecological metrics. Mangrove forest and other marine influences migrated up to 15 km inland in both scenarios, delineated by the saltwater front. Freshwater habitat area decreased by 25-30% under our two climate change scenarios and was largely replaced by mangroves and, in the increased rainfall scenario, open water as well. Significant mangroves drowned along northern Florida Bay in both climate change scenarios due to sea level rise. Increased rainfall of 10% provided significant benefits to the spatial and temporal salinity regime within the marine-influenced zone, providing a more gradual and natural adjustment for at-risk flora and fauna. However, increased rainfall also increased the risk of open water, due to water depths that inhibited mangrove establishment and reduced peat accumulation rates. We infer that ecological effects related to sea level rise may occur in the extreme front-edge of saltwater intrusion, that topography will control the incursion of this zone as sea level rises, and that differences in freshwater availability will have ecologically significant effects on ecosystem resilience through the temporal and spatial pattern of salinity changes.

AB Holarctic mires are systems of great ecological value and limited alpine distribution. Their southernmost European boundary borders the Mediterranean region. Understanding how environmental factors influence the plant community distribution and its response to disturbances, especially in the water regime, is a key step for their management and conservation. Here, we report our study of the main ecological gradients that determine the distribution of different plant community types in the Trescuro mire system and their response to variations in the environmental conditions such as summer drought. We set up 30 sampling points across the vegetation mosaic where pH, electrical conductivity, water table depth, and ion concentration were recorded during the 2014 and 2015 summers. The results revealed that variation in the water table level is what most drives the vegetation distribution at the local scale, followed by the ion concentration. Soligenous communities, which are highly dependent on water run-off, were the most affected by the drought event in 2015. Because these communities are generally situated in the marginal parts of mire systems, summer drought periods may facilitate invasion by trees into the areas they occupy, which may eventually lead to a reduction of mire area. This study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of these unique and complex systems through elucidating the relationship between the vegetation and climatic variations.

AB Oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of well-preserved mammoth teeth from the Middle Wurmian (40-70 ka) peat layer of Niederweningen, the most important mammoth site in Switzerland, were analysed to reconstruct Late Pleistocene palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions. Drinking water (delta O-18 values of approximately -12.3 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand were calculated front oxygen isotope compositions of mammoth tooth enamel apatite using a species-specific calibration for modern elephants. These delta O-18(H2O) values reflect the mean oxygen isotope composition of the palaeo-precipitation and are similar to those directly measured for fate Pleistocene groundwater from aquifers in northern Switzerland and southern Germany. Using a present-day delta(18)O(H2)o-precipitation-air temperature relation for Switzerland, a mean annual air temperature (MAT) of around 4.3 +/- 2.1 degrees C can be calculated for the Middle Wurmian at this site. This MAT is in good agreement with palaeotemperature estimates on the basis of Middle Wurmian groundwater recharge temperatures and beetle assemblages. Hence, the climatic conditions in this region were around 4 degrees C cooler during the Middle Wurmian interstadial phase, around 45-50ka BP, than they are today.
   During this period the mammoths from Niederweningen lived in an open tundra-like, C-3 plant-dominated environment as indicated by enamel (delta C-13 values of -11.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand and pollen and macroplant fossils found in the embedding peat. The low variability of enamel delta C-13 and delta O-18 values from different mammoth teeth reflects similar environmental conditions and supports a relatively small time frame for the fossil assemblage.

TI A 1000-year reconstruction of summer precipitation from Ireland:
   Calibration of a peat-based palaeoclimate record

AB Calibration of proxy climate records is well-established for annually resolved proxies such as tree rings, but it has not been attempted for non-annually resolved proxies such as those from peatland surface wetness records. Several previous studies have suggested that peatland surface wetness is primarily driven by warm season moisture balance and implied a potential for producing calibrated records of deficit or precipitation. This paper presents a high-resolution testate amoebae analysis of a peat record from central Ireland covering the last c.1000 years, and provides the first attempt to produce a calibrated record of past precipitation from a peat record. Past water table depth was reconstructed using a transfer function applied to contiguous samples for the top 1 m of the profile. The chronology was constrained by a series of radiocarbon ages (including 'bomb-spike' ages) and spheroidal carbonaceous particles. Correlations between reconstructed water tables and meteorological records (1958-1995) of precipitation and deficit were strongly positive and were used to reconstruct precipitation and deficit from the last 1000 years. Validation using earlier meteorological records was hampered by very low peat accumulation rates, but suggested the summer precipitation and deficit reconstructions were more robust than a reconstruction of annual precipitation. The summer precipitation reconstruction suggests that the period AD1400-1850 experienced higher summer rainfall than for much of both the preceding 400 years and the last 150 years. The change in regime from low to high summer rainfall may be attributed to changes in the summer North Atlantic Oscillation. Combined with tree ring and speleothem records of winter NAO, this suggests a major change in seasonality of precipitation in far western Europe between the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. The MCA was characterised by dry summers and wet winters, whilst the LIA had wet summers and dry winters. Calibration of peat surface wetness records using meteorological records holds much potential for the future and may lead to improved insights into seasonal precipitation and water balance changes. This study was limited by slow accumulation rates leading to low temporal resolution for the late 19th and early 20th century part of the record. Further development of the technique will require more highly temporally resolved records of change over the whole of the instrumental time period to allow a full calibration and validation approach to be applied.

AB Question: Do species from communities with different flooding dynamics differ in seed buoyancy? Is there a trade-off between seed buoyancy and seed longevity?
   Methods: Seeds of 55 freshwater wetland species were collected and related to communities along the hydrological gradient, ranging from constantly flooded reed beds, through tall herb fens and rich fens, to rarely flooded wet meadows. Species were experimentally tested for seed buoyancy over 2 10 days in standing water and moving water. Seed longevity for each species was calculated.
   Results: Community occurrence along the hydrologic gradient was mirrored by seed buoyancy. Seed buoyancy was highest for species of almost permanently inundated reed beds and lowest for species of rarely inundated wet meadows. The seed buoyancy characteristics of species of reed beds were best adapted to hydrological dynamic conditions mimicked by the treatment moving water and were the most independent of the flow rate of the water. A high percentage of the species used had a transient seed bank. Together with high buoyancy in many species, this suggests a trade-off between dispersal capacity and seed persistence.
   Conclusions: In freshwater wetlands with rather stable water levels, many species lack a persistent seed bank and depend on dispersal for colonization of new habitats. Seed buoyancy enhances aquatic seed dispersal, and can be of great importance in both vegetation dynamics and restoration. In wetlands that are inundated for a long period during the year and with a water level above soil surface, higher seed buoyancy enhances the possibility for hydrochory.

AB In areas with intensive animal livestock farming, agricultural soils are enriched with phosphorus (P). These soils exhibit an increased risk for P transfer to the sub-soil and surface water via leaching. Besides the presence of hydrological pathways between a field and surface water, P in soil solution should be studied for evaluating the environmental risk. For this purpose, soil P extraction methods can be used. In this study, we tested the relation between various extraction methods and P in soil solution, simulated by a water extraction at a soil-to-solution ratio of 1:2 (w/v) using field-moist topsoils sampled from the major Dutch soil types (noncalcareous and calcareous sand and clay, reclaimed peat, and peat). The following methods were used: P-w (1:60 [v/v] water-extractable P), 0.01 M CaCl2 (1:10 [v/v]), FeO-strip, and acid ammonium oxalate-extractable P, Al, and Fe. Phosphorus in the 1:2 water extracts was mainly present as molybdate-reactive P (MRP). Extraction methods with the highest ability to predict MRP in 1:2 water extracts across different soil types were CaCl2, P-w, and FeO-strip, the latter two normalized for [Al + Fe](ox). However, for the peat and noncalcareous clay soils, also estimation of molybdate-unreactive P (MUP) is important because MUP dominates in the 1:2 water extracts of these soils. Thus, an extraction method that only deterntines MRP will not suffice, and further research is needed on the environmental risk of MUP in soil solution from these soil types. The calcareous sandy soils deviated significantly from the above mentioned relationships. For this soil type, it should be tested whether a single water extraction (e.g., P-w) suffices for determining the environmental risk.

AB A greenhouse experiment was set up to investigate if infrequently and frequently occurring species respond differently to simulated habitat changes. Two frequently occurring (Bryum pseudotriquetrum and Calliergonella cuspidata) and two infrequently occurring (Hamatocaulis vernicosus and Paludella squarrosa) rich fen bryophytes were grown in mixed culture and subjected to rainwater or groundwater and three levels of N, ammonium nitrate (0, 1 and 3 mg N L-1) and P, potassium phosphate (0, 0.05 and 0.1 mg P/L). All species responded negatively to higher N-levels and three of the four species responded negatively to rainwater and higher P-levels. C. cuspidata had highest relative growth rate (RGR) in all treatments, and the infrequently occurring species had lower RGR and were more negatively affected by high levels of N than the frequently occurring species. A negative effect of rainwater seemed to be caused by higher background levels of N in rainwater compared to groundwater. We found a negative effect of high initial bryophyte density in three of the four species indicating density-dependent inhibition between species. We suggest that maintenance of oligotrophic conditions by recharge of nutrient-poor groundwater is vital for conservation of infrequently as well as frequently occurring rich fen bryophytes.

AB Interpretations of the abundance and distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) lipids have been increasingly applied to infer changes in paleoenvironment and to estimate terrigenous organic matter inputs into estuarine and marine sediments. However, only preliminary information is known regarding the ecology and physiology of the source organisms of these biomarkers. We assessed the production rates of brGDGTs under different redox conditions in peat, where these lipids are found in high concentrations, particularly at greater depths below the fluctuating water table. The incorporation of hydrogen relative to carbon into lipids observed in our dual stable isotope probing assay indicates that brGDGTs were produced by heterotrophic bacteria. Unexpectedly, incubations with stable isotope tracers of the surface horizon (5-20 cm) initiated under oxic conditions before turning suboxic and eventually anoxic exhibited up to one order of magnitude higher rates of brGDGT production (16-87 ng cm(-3) y(-1)) relative to the deeper, anoxic zone (20-35 cm; ca. 7 ng cm(- 3) y(-1)), and anoxic incubations of the surface horizon (< 3 ng cm(-3) y(-1)). Turnover times of brGDGTs in the surface horizon ranged between 8 and 41 years in the incubations initiated under oxic conditions, in contrast to 123 742 years in anoxic incubations. As brGDGTs were actively produced during both anoxic incubations and those exposed to oxygen, we conclude that their source organisms are likely facultative aerobic heterotrophs that are particularly active in the peat acrotelm. Production rates of bacterial fatty acids (ca. 2 mu g cm(-3) y(-1)) were roughly two orders of magnitude higher than those of brGDGTs, suggesting that brGDGT producers are a minor constituent of the microbial community or that brGDGTs are a small component of the microbial cell membrane in comparison to fatty acids, despite the typically high brGDGT concentrations observed in peat. Multivariate analysis identified two branched fatty acids that shared a similar production pattern as brGDGTs among the experimental treatments and may be associated with brGDGT biosynthesis.

AB The quantitative relationship between stand growth rate and water table level in peatland forest sites has not been fully ascertained in the literature. In this study, we investigated this relationship by means of a bivariate regression model, Tree and stand attributes, including volume and past 5-year volume growth as well as median water table depth (WTM) during the 1984 growing season, were observed in 69 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample stands with three subplots established in each stand. All stands were located in deep-peated, moderately rich to poor organic soil sites in Central Finland (61 degrees 45'-62 degrees 26'N, 22 degrees 40'-28 degrees 29'E) that had been ditched for forestry about 25 years earlier (1959-1961). Prediction models for the fixed mean functions for 5-year volume growth and WTM as well as estimates for variances and the correlation of random effects at plot and subplot levels were estimated simultaneously using bivariate regression methods. The correlation of model residuals at the plot level was highly significant. The model was applied to simulate stand volume development for a period of 20 years. Simulations illustrated the dynamic interaction of stand volume, volume growth, and soil water levels: deep initial WTM resulted in stand growth and volume-development increases and subsequently further deepened the WTM in the stand. The model can be applied to southern boreal drained Scots pine peatlands to estimate the WTM in different stand volume conditions and to assess the effect of stand management on WTM.

AB The hydrologic process of the sandy desert remains a focus in research in arid areas. Three major natural phenomena that can indicate the hydrological cycle in the extremely dry Badain Jaran Desert were found, namely the assemblage of megadune microrelief and evaporite, megadune vegetation and microrelief, as well as lakeside runoff and vegetation. The microrelief sand layer water, evaporite minerals, and lakeside hydrogeological features were analyzed by the drying and weighing method, environmental scanning electron microscopy with energy spectrum analysis functions, and a hydrogeological borehole survey. The water content of the microrelief 0-0.5 m sand layer is between 4.7% and 9.3%. The evaporite minerals are mainly composed of calcite (CaCO3) and gypsum (CaSO4). The shallow groundwater system in the off-shore area of lakes consists of an aeolian sand layer, a peat layer, and a lacustrine sedimentary layer, and the phreatic water with a thickness of 20 cm to 40 cm is reserved in the bottom of aeolian sand layer with a peat layer as a waterproof baseboard. Based on these results, the above three natural phenomena can be explained as follows: (1) The assemblage of megadune microrelief and evaporite was caused by the outcropping of water from megadune vadose zone in the form of preferential flow for a long time. Its leading edge differential wind erosion and calcium cemented fine sand layer indicate that water from the megadune vadose zone moves to and recharges the microrelief water along the micro-scale fine sand layer, during which, it features a multiple layer as it is controlled by a vertical dune bedding structure. (2) The small-scale assemblage of megadune vegetation and microrelief indicates that the water from the megadune vadose zone moved laterally and led to vegetation development, and the assemblage of microrelief and vegetation at a slope scale indicates that the vadose zone water presented multilayer enrichment and runoff producing due, to a great extent, to the bedding structures of different spacial locations. (3) The assemblage of lakeside runoff and vegetation is related to the phreatic water recharged by precipitation surrounding the lake, which indicates that the megadune water recharged by precipitation moved to the bottom of the megadune and constituted supply to the lake water. The three assemblages fully demonstrate that the megadune water recharged by precipitation in this desert could recharge the groundwater water and even lake water in the form of preferential flow due to the control of the bedding structure of different scales within the megadune. The results of lake water balance and the occurrence conditions of phreatic water surrounding the lake imply that the precipitation in this desert plays an important role in sustaining the lake. This study provides reliable evidence for revealing the essence of the hydrological cycle and the source of lake water in the Badain Jaran Desert, which indicates that although precipitation is small, it cannot be ignored in arid sandy desert areas.

AB We measured soil climate and the turbulent fluxes of CO2, H2O, heat, and momentum on short towers (2 m) in a 160-yr-old boreal black spruce forest in Manitoba, Canada. Two distinct land cover types were studied: a Sphagnum-dominated wetland, and a feathermoss (Pleurozium and Hylocomium)-dominated upland, both lying within the footprint of a 30-m tower, which has measured whole-forest carbon exchange since 1994. Peak summertime uptake of CO2 was higher in the wetland than for the forest as a whole due to the influence of deciduous shrubs. Soil respiration rates in the wetland were approximately three times larger than in upland soils, and 30% greater than the mean of the whole forest, reflecting decomposition of soil organic matter. Soil respiration rates in the wetland were regulated by soil temperature, which was in turn influenced by water table depth through effects on soil heat capacity and conductivity. Warmer soil temperatures and deeper water tables favored increased heterotrophic respiration. Wetland drainage was limited by frost during the first half of the growing season, leading to high, perched water tables, cool soil temperatures, and much lower respiration rates than observed later in the growing season. Whole-forest evapotranspiration increased as water tables dropped, suggesting that photosynthesis in this forest was rarely subject to water stress. Our data indicate positive feedback between soil temperature, seasonal thawing, heterotrophic respiration, and evapotranspiration. As a result, climate warming could cause covariant changes in soil temperature and water table depths that may stimulate photosynthesis and strongly promote efflux of CO2 from peat soils in boreal wetlands.

AB In order to investigate the transformation among the precipitation, groundwater, and surface water in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, precipitation and groundwater samples which were collected at the meteorological station of the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the surface water which collected from the Wolulan River were used to identify the transformation of three types of water. The isotope composition of different kinds of water sources were analyzed via stable isotope (deuterium and oxygen-18) investigation of natural water. The results show a clear seasonal difference in the stable isotopes in precipitation. During the cold half-year, the mean stable isotope in precipitation in the Sanjiang Plain reaches its minimum with the minimum temperature. The delta O-18 and delta D values are high in the rainy season. In the Wolulan River, the evaporation is the highest in August and September. The volume of evaporation and the replenishment to the river is mostly same. The groundwater is recharged more by the direct infiltration of precipitation than by the river flow. The results of this study indicate that the water bodies in the Sanjiang Plain have close hydrologic relationships, and that the transformation among each water system frequently occurs.

AB Most previous studies on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands have focused on the boreal, subarctic, and tropical regions. Little is known about CH4 emissions from the alpine peatlands that are widely distributed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. To assess the magnitudes of daily and seasonal variations in CH4 flux in this area, and to identify the influential environmental factors, an eddy covariance (EC) tower with a LI-7700 open-path CH4 analyzer was established on Hongyuan Peatland. Total annual CH4 emission was 46.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2014, with emissions in the non-growing season accounting for 25% of the annual total. From May to September 2014, diurnal variation in CH4 emissions was observed, with CH4 fluxes varying between 0.15 and 0.25 mu molm(-2) s(-1). In contrast, during all other periods of 2014, no diurnal variation was observed, and CH4 flux varied below 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A clear seasonal pattern in CH4 exchange with small surges in CH4 emission appeared in soil thawing and freezing seasons. Wavelet analysis was applied to the continuous CH4 flux time series to explore temporal variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange during the growing season. On daily timescales, changes in CH4 flux are in phase with changes in air temperature, and influenced by friction velocity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). On weekly-to-monthly timescales, soil temperature can explain most of the variation in CH4 exchange. Though CH4 fluxes had no apparent correlation with water table level, fluxes were significantly (R-2 = 0.86) correlated with soil temperature measured at -25 cm depth, close to the water table level throughout the growing season, suggesting a synergistic effect of water table level and soil temperature on methane emission. This study highlights the need for continuous eddy covariance measurements and time series analysis approaches to adequately describe temporal variability in ecosystem CH4 exchange.

AB Wastes of the ore cyanide process are prone to oxidation and acid leaching that cause mobilization, migration, and precipitation of elements, including noble metals. The issues of waste oxidation, as well as release and transport of oxidation products, are of principal environmental concern and a focus of active geochemical research. We study the behavior of Au and Ag in the natural-industrial system "sulfide wastes-surface/pore waters-particulate matter-bottom sediments" in the presence of different elements (Na, Mg, K, Ca, Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, Ag, Au, Hg, Pb, REE, et..), at the Novo-Ursk auriferous pyritic deposit (Salair, Kemerovo region, Russia).
   The wastes include processed primary ore (wastes I) and ore from the gold-bearing weathering profile (wastes II) that store, respectively, 0.5 ppm Au, 18 ppm Ag and 0.26 ppm Au, 13 ppm Ag. Gold in wastes I occurs in the native form with Cu and Ag impurities and also Au exist as invisible species in pyrite. In wastes II, gold is adsorbed onto the surfaces of secondary mineral particles (kaolinite, montmorillonite, hydromica, and Fe(III) compounds) while silver is an isomorphic impurity in alunite-jarosite minerals. The oxidation of wastes produces acid mine drainage (AMD) water, with pH = 1.9 and high concentrations of sulfate, Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Pb, As, Se, Te, Hg, Cd, and REE, which flows into the Ur River (a tributary of the Inya).
   The stream transports gold and silver existing in dissolved + colloidal and particulate forms. Dissolved + colloidal gold and silver have similar distribution patterns with their contents inversely proportional to pH. Dissolved + colloidal gold in the AMD water is more abundant than silver (0.4-1.2 ppb Au against 0.1-0.3 ppb Ag). Gold changes from the dissolved + colloidal (in AMD) to particulate (till 0.03 ppb) forms and precipitates in progressively larger amounts with distance from the tailings. Silver inmost of the analyzed natural and tailings-impacted waters exists as suspended particles (to 1 ppb). The concentrations of gold and silver are the highest (1.8-2.1 ppb Au and 4.5-5.7 ppb Ag) in peat pore waters within the geochemical trains of the tailings, apparently as a result of re-precipitation on organic barriers.

AB In this study we evaluated the magnitude and seasonal variations of natural and anthropogenic fluxes of inorganic (NO3-, NH4+, and PO43-) and organic (DON and dissolved organic carbon) nutrients delivered by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and rivers to the fourth largest estuary in the USA, Mobile Bay in Alabama. To identify the sources of SGD-nutrient in the estuary and their subsurface biogeochemical transformation, we applied a multimethod approach that combines geochemical nutrient (N and P) mass-balances, stable isotopes (nitrate delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) and sediment organic matter delta C-13(org) and delta N-15(org)) signatures, microbial sequencing analyses, dissolved organic matter source-composition, and shallow estuarine sediment lithological analyses. We found that during dry seasons SGD delivered nearly a quarter of the total nutrient inputs to Mobile Bay. These SGD fluxes were anoxic and N was delivered to the bay almost entirely as NH4+ and DON, which represented more than half of the total NH4+ and almost one fifth of the total DON inputs to the bay. We further observed that these significant SGD-derived N fluxes occurred exclusively to the east shore of Mobile Bay, historically impacted by hypoxia and large-scale fish kills known as ``Jubilees''. We demonstrate here that although the Mobile Bay coastal area is largely developed and anthropogenic influences are well documented, a shallow peat layer identified only on the east shore serves as the main source of the exceptionally high NH4+ and DON fluxes. We found that the high groundwater NO3- concentrations observed further inland from overfertilization also identified by previous studies, decreased dramatically as groundwater percolated through the intertidal zone of the coastal aquifer. The microbial community identified in the coastal sediments suggests that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were the main processes responsible for this extensive removal and transformation of anthropogenic N, respectively. Furthermore, we found no significant anthropogenic inputs from manure or sewage waste to the bay. These findings show that natural sources of nutrients can outcompete anthropogenic inputs despite extensive development of the coastal area. We hypothesize that similar subsurface biogeochemical nutrient transformations can occur in other shallow estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico and worldwide.

ID ABUNDANCE
AB The effects of the underground pipe drainage and land use on the carabid and staphylinid communities were studied using pitfall trapping and soil sampling. Various soil characteristics were studied and compared with community data. The number of species discovered by both pitfall trapping and soil sampling was lower in drained plots. The difference in the number of species was more distinct by soil sampling. The activity of beetles was apparently higher by soil sampling. The activity of beetles was apparently higher in drained plots. Drainage resulted in the extinction of hygrophilous species. The main factors affecting the carabid and staphylinid communities were organic matter content and actual moisture. The water table depth had smaller influence on beetles.

AB This paper describes the poorly known larvae of Anabolia lombarda Ris, 1897 and Limnephilus sericeus (Say, 1824) and gives some additional data for Limnephilus flavospinosus Stein, 1874. Information on the morphology of the fifth instar larva is given, and the most important diagnostic features are illustrated. In the context of already available keys, the larva of Anabolia lombarda keys together with Anabolia furcata Brauer, 1857. Both species may be separated by gill positions and by distribution patterns. Limnephilus sericeus keys together with Grammotaulius nigropunctatus (Retzius, 1783), Limnephilus ignavus McL., 1865 (fifth instars) and with fourth instars of G. nigropunctatus and Limnephilus binotatus Curtis, 1834. In this case the species can be separated by head width, the number of setae in setal group sa1 at the first abdominal dorsum and sternum, the shape of the anteromedian metanotal sclerites and the presence of a trochanteral brush at mid and hind leg. Finally, L. flavospinosus keys with Limnephilus rhombicus (L., 1758) which may be separated by the number of central intermediate c-setae at the ninth abdominal dorsum. With respect to zoogeography, Anabolia lombarda occurs only on the southern slope of the Alps whereas L. sericeus is widespread in Europe, ranging from the Alps to the Northern Tundra, and including North America. Limnephilus flavospinosus, on the other hand, is a widespread species in Southern and Central Europe but lacking in Northern Europe and Scandinavia. Anabolia lombarda and L. flavospinosus preferably occur in standing water bodies and slowly flowing environments; they are typical inhabitants of the littoral zone of ponds and lakes and slowly-flowing stream reaches. Limnephilus sericeus is a typical tyrphophilous species, preferring small ponds in peat bogs.

SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
AB Field studies on the Late Pleistocene and Holocene landscape history were conducted in the central Palatinate Forest (Pfalzerwald, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) near the village of Johanniskreuz. The structure and composition of periglacial cover beds. the young floodplain sediments of the Aschbach, Schwarzbach und Moosalbe valleys, and the sediment structure in some dry valleys, of alluvial fans and slope colluvia, were studied. The sandy cover beds are less than 10% aeolian, and in all cases only the main and basal layer are present, with no evidence of the intermediate layer. In general, the cover beds resemble those of other parts of the Central German Uplands (Mittelgebirge). As a rule, their total thickness is 100 cm, and that of the main layer 45-55 cm. Evidence from valley-floor and spring bogs. sediment sections, and historic charcoal-burning sites was used to identify palaeo-climatological, semi-natural and anthropogenic landscape changes. Based on alluvial fans and slope colluvia, the following sedimentation phases could be identified for the Holocene: Preboreal, Boreal, and Subboreal (natural Impact factors) and the Late Holocene, since the High Middle Ages (anthropogenic impact factors, e g. deforestation) The influence that historical charcoal production and tillage have had on accelerating surface runoff and the formation of colluvia is discussed This study represents the first ever chronostratigraphy of the Pleistocene cover beds and Holocene valley floor sediments of the Palatinate Forest (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Increasing human population and intensive land use combined with a warming climate and chronically diminished snowpacks are putting more strain on water resources in the western United States. Properly functioning riparian systems slow runoff and store water, thus regulating extreme flows; however, riparian areas across the west are in a degraded condition with a majority of riparian systems not in proper functioning condition, and with widespread catastrophic erosion of water-storing peat and organic soils. Headcuts are the leading edge of catastrophic channel erosion. We used aerial imagery (1.4-3.3-cm pixel) to locate 163 headcuts in riparian areas in the Sweetwater subbasin of central Wyoming. We found 1-m-the generally available standard resolution for land management-and 30-cm pixel imagery to be inadequate for headcut identification. We also used Structure-from-Motion models built from ground-acquired imagery to model 18 headcuts from which we measured soil loss of 425-720 m(3). Normalized by channel length, this represents a loss of 1.1-1.8 m(3) m(-1) channel. Monitoring headcuts, either from ground or aerial imagery, provides an objective indicator of sustainable riparian land management and identifies priority disturbance-mitigation areas. Image-based headcut monitoring must use data on the order of 3.3 cm ground sample distance, or greater resolution, to effectively capture the information needed for accurate assessments of riparian conditions.

AB Natural tracers (alkalinity and silica) were used to infer groundwater-surface-water exchanges in the main braided reach of the River Feshie, Cairngorms, Scotland. Stream-water samples were collected upstream and downstream of the braided section at fortnightly intervals throughout the 2001-2002 hydrological year and subsequently at finer resolution over two rainfall events. The braided reach was found to exert a significant downstream buffering effect on the alkalinity of these waters, particularly at moderate flows (4-8 m(3) s(-1)/congruent toQ(30-70)). Extensive hydrochemical surveys were undertaken to characterize the different source waters feeding the braids. Shallow groundwater flow systems at the edge of the braided floodplain, recharged by effluent streams and hillslope drainage, appeared to be of particular significance. Deeper groundwater was identified closer to the main channel, upwelling through the hyporheic zone. Both sources contributed to the significant groundwater-surface-water interactions that promote the buffering effect observed through the braided reach. Their impact was less significant at higher flows (> 15 m(3) s(-1)/>Q(10)) when acidic storm runoff from the peat-covered catchment headwaters dominated, as well as under baseflow conditions (<4 m(3) s(-1)/<Q(70)), when upstream alkalinity was already buffered owing to headwater groundwater sources assuming dominance. The significant temporally and spatially dynamic influence of these groundwater-surface-water interactions was therefore seen to have important implications for both catchment functioning and instream ecology.

AB The mass and energy exchange between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere depends on the structure and functioning of vegetation and soil cover. The aim of the work was to compare the ecosystem CO2, heat and water vapor exchange in the old-growth spruce forest and meso-oligotrophic peatland, typical ecosystems of the middle taiga landscapes on the European Russia. The study was made by using the eddy-covariance method. In the warm period of the year, the spruce forest ecosystem was characterized by higher values of the net radiation (R-n) and turbulent heat exchange (H) than the peatland. In the peatland, the latent heat flux (LE) in July represented more than the half of the net radiation. Net ecosystem exchange CO2 (NEE) from 1st April to 31st August was -327 gC/m(2) in the spruce forest and -40 gC/m(2) in the peatland, and the total evapotranspiration (ET) was 324 mm and 300 mm, respectively. A close correlation was established between NEE and ET in daily dynamics (R-2 = 0.7-0.9). The average daily values of net exchange CO2 in spruce forests are closely correlated with the net radiation (R-2 = 0.63) and turbulent heat exchange (R-2 = 0.57). For the meso-oligotrophic peatland, heat transfer factors turned out to be less significant (R-2 = 0.38-0.45). The obtained data can be used to predict carbon exchange processes and water vapor fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems due to expected climate changes in the region.

AB In 1916 the time stamp for quantitative palynology was set with Lennart von Post's initial paper on pollen analysis and environmental change in the Scandinavian peat bogs. In the 1930s, Von Post provided a map of the known palynological reconstructions. This map showed many conspicuous gaps of geographic coverage that have endured to this day. In particular, environmental reconstruction in arid lands remain much less known, largely due to the paucity of depositional environments in these areas as well as challenges with preservation in regions either uniformly dry or subjected to strong wet/dry phases. Over the last decade we have examined linkages between desert wetland development and episodes of wet and arid conditions. Desert wetland, or cienegas, are recharged by groundwater and appear to be sensitive to climate-driven groundwater fluctuations. These systems appear to "grow" during wet periods potentially associated with enhanced El Nino activity, suggesting an important linkage with groundwater dynamics and the quantity and frequency of winter precipitation delivery. Hydrologic conditions in cienegas are also important controls on the preservation of pollen, where episodes of aridity coincide with periods of poor pollen preservation. We assess modern El Nino events, as analogs of past wet conditions, to provide context on the atmospheric controls for delivery of moisture into the desert southwest during winter. Our analysis shows that anomalously high and persistent moisture delivery into the region during El Nino events enables the growth of cienegas, improves preservation of pollen and promotes the growth of fuels necessary to support wildfire. This paper examines cienega sites located in the southwestern region of North America at the US/Mexico Border and discusses results that addresses a geographical gap identified by Von Post's original work in paleoenvironmental research.

DE peat; sand; geotechnical stabilization; mechanical characteristics
ID MODEL
AB Organic soils exhibit problematic properties such as high compressibility and low shear strength; these properties may cause differential settlement or failure in structures built on such soils. Organic soil removal or stabilization are the most important methods to overcome geotechnical problems related to peat soils' engineering characteristics. This paper presents soil mechanical intervention for stabilization of peat with sand columns and focuses on a comparison between the mechanical characteristics of undisturbed peat and peat stabilized with 20%, 30% and 40% of sand on the laboratory scale. Cylindrical columns were extruded in different diameters through a nearly undisturbed peat sample in the laboratory and filled with sand. By adding sand columns to peat, higher permeability, higher shear strength and a faster consolidation was achieved. The sample with 70% peat and 30% sand displayed the most reliable compressibility properties. This can be attributed to proper drainage provided by sand columns for peat in this specific percentage. It was observed that the granular texture of sand also increased the friction angle of peat. The addition of 30% sand led to the highest shear strength among all mixtures considered. The peat samples with 40% sand were sampled with two and three sand columns and tested in direct shear and consolidation tests to evaluate the influence of the number and geometry of sand columns. Samples with three sand columns showed higher compressibility and shear strength. Following the results of this laboratory study it appears that the introduction of sand columns could be suitable for geotechnical peat stabilization in the field scale.

AB This state-of-the-art paper presents an interpretation of the permeability, compressibility, and shear strength of fibrous peats using data from laboratory tests on undisturbed block samples of two fibrous peats, as well as extensive laboratory and field data from the literature on fibrous peat deposits. Engineering properties of fibrous peats are significantly different from those of most inorganic soils. However, the same fundamental mechanisms and factors determine behavior of both inorganic soils and fibrous peats. Fibrous peat deposits possess very high initial permeability, typically 1,000 times the initial permeability of soft clay and silt deposits. Upon compression, the permeability of fibrous peats decreases dramatically, with a ratio of permeability change index to in situ void ratio equal to 0.25, as compared to 0.50 for soft clay and silt deposits. Fibrous peats display extreme compressibility to the increase in effective vertical stress, with compression index values right after preconsolidation pressure 5 to 20 times the corresponding compressibility of typical soft clay and silt deposits. Among geotechnical materials, fibrous peats display the highest ratios of secondary compression index to compression index, in the range of 0.05 to 0.07. The values of coefficient of earth pressure at rest for normally consolidated young fibrous peat deposits are in the range of 0.30 to 0.35, as compared to 0.45 to 0.65 for inorganic soils. The values of friction angle from triaxial compression tests for fibrous peats are in the range of 40 to 60 degrees, as compared to less than 35 degrees for soft clay and silt compositions. For fibrous peats, the ratios of undrained shear strength in compression to preconsolidation pressure are usually in the range of 0.50 to 0.75, as compared to 0.32 for soft clay and silt deposits. For surficial fibrous peat deposits the ratio of vane shear strength to preconsolidation pressure is near 1.0, as compared to 0.12 to 0.35 for inorganic soft clay and silt deposits. For fibrous peats, the ratio of undrained Young's modulus to undrained shear strength is in the range of 20 to 80.

AB Increased sulfur loads originating from polluted surface water and groundwater, and from enhanced atmospheric input, are a major threat to the biogeochemical functioning and biodiversity of freshwater wetlands. Sulfate reduction, normally playing a modest role in these systems, becomes the most important biogeochemical process, inducing severe eutrophication and sulfide toxicity. In field enclosure experiments we observed striking differences between the responses of two freshwater marshes to sulfate. On one location sulfate addition resulted in strong phosphorus mobilization without sulfide accumulation, whereas high sediment sulfide concentrations, known to be toxic to wetland macrophytes, were reached in the other marsh without eutrophication occurring. The results could be explained by differences in groundwater iron discharge and nutrient contents of the peat sediments. Sulfate reduction rates appeared to be limited by either electron donor availability (first marsh) or electron acceptor availability (second marsh). The implications of these findings are explained in relation to freshwater wetland management.

AB Quantifying landscape-scale methane (CH4) fluxes from boreal and arctic regions, and determining how they are controlled, is critical for predicting the magnitude of any CH4 emission feedback to climate change. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of small areas of strong methanogenic activity, vs. larger areas with net CH4 uptake, in controlling landscape-level fluxes. We measured CH4 fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge-dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an aapa mire in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape, lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An intercomparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up-scaled using a high-resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH4 fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water-table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH4 release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH4 uptake in birch forest soils. An intercomparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH4 emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100km(2) area. For the full growing season (May to October), similar to 1.1-1.4g CH(4)m(-2) was released across the 100km(2) area. This was based on up-scaled lawn emissions of 1.2-1.5g CH(4)m(-2), vs. an up-scaled uptake of 0.07-0.15g CH(4)m(-2) by the wider landscape. Given the strong temperature sensitivity of the dominant lawn fluxes, and the fact that lawns are unlikely to dry out, climate warming may substantially increase CH4 emissions in northern Finland, and in aapa mire regions in general.

AB This study examines the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from upland peat during the period of the autumn flushing. Hydroclimatic conditions were monitored in conjunction with measurements of absorbance and the E4/E6 ratio of the stream draining an 11.4 km(2) upland peat catchment in northern England. During two months of monitoring the effects of 67 separate rainfall events were examined showing that:
   1. The peat behaves hydrologically as if it were a two end-member system consisting of old, interevent, and new, event, water. Runoff is initiated by percolation excess of new water at the acrotelm-catotelm interface.
   2. The discharge of dissolved organic matter behaves like a three end-member system with the between-event water being low in DOC and storm events being characterized by two types of water. Initial runoff being characterized by new water rich in DOC that gives way to new water depleted in DOC. This transition can be ascribed to the runoff progressing from throughflow within the acrotelm progressing to saturation-excess overland flow.
   3. Depletion of DOC during storm events is accompanied by a change in the character of the DOC as the E4/E6 ratio changes. This suggests that the decrease in DOC during events is the result of exhaustion of reserves rather than changes in the flowpaths being utilized by runoff.
   4. The amount of carbon released in any event is critically dependent upon the time between events during which oxidation processes generate a reservoir of available carbon. Production of available carbon in the catchment is as high as 4.5 g C per day per m(3) of peat, suggesting a turnover rate of peat of the order of 42 years. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The prospect of harvesting forest-peatland systems in the coastal western hemlock forest region of British Columbia has created the need for an understanding of the interrelationship between topography, groundwater flow, and site productivity. Detailed topographic mapping including the use of ground-penetrating radar coupled with point measurements of specific yield, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and groundwater level were used to determine the characteristics of groundwater flow along forest-peatland complexes. A topographic index was then used to characterize the spatial distribution of groundwater flow and site conditions (as represented by water table depth and organic horizon thickness) influencing forest community type. Forest community type mean index decreased from open peatland to upland forest. Areas with high slope indices had thicker organic horizons (0.7-1.8 m), water tables closer to the surface (0-0.2 m), and higher soil moisture contents (46-92%). These conditions affect successional dynamics and favour the invasion of hydrophytic species such as Sphagnum mosses. Areas with low slope index values were associated with shallower organic horizons (< 0.4 m), deeper water table (0.3 to > 1.6 m), and drier soil moisture (35-76%), favouring more prolific timber growth.

AB In water Injectors rapid shut in creates a water hammer Water ham mer effects resulting from the shutting in of water Injection wells have a considerable impact on injection well performance and Ion gevity Over time injectors that undergo repeated rapid shut ins often have significantly reduced injectivity and show evidence of sanding and even failure of the downhole completion This study seeks to provide in operational reference for the well-injection operation and valve installation to mitigate backflow and maintain the downhole sand-control device integrity and thus good water injectivity
   Two different shut in scenarios fen an offshore injection system have been investigated One of the scenarios is that two wells are shut in and the third well is kept open The other scenario is that the topside pump is stopped while the injection wells are still kept open Water hammer sensitivity on different parameters such as valve installation position stroke time water backflow conditions and the hydraulic characteristics, has been performed
   For Scenario I the pressure change because of the wellhead shut in is approximately 200 psi at bottomhole which is much lower than the amplitude seen at the wellhead (3 400 psi) The third well which stays open for injection experiences in even larger pressure surge (approximately 450 psi at bottomhole) Backflow for the opt ning well could be close to 10 000 STB/D With increasing skin because of cumulative injectivity damage by water particle plugging and thermal-induced fracture closure at shut-in the water-hammer pressure fluctuation can be is high as 1,200 psi For Scenario II pressure fluctuation because of topside shut-in is 300 psi With the surface controlled subsurface safety valve (SCSSV) closing when backflow is felt the water hammer fluctuation can be reduced to 200 psi
   Unlike the classic water hammer in pipelines water hammer in injection wells is much less in surge amplitude because the high-injectivity reservoir behaves like a cushion to absorb the water-hammer impact on the downhole completion and sand control infrastructure Water hammer in the wells and pipeline system experiences (1) after flow with reduced bottomhole pressure (BHP) and flow rate into formation (2) backflow when BHP becomes less than reservoir pressure and (3) resumption of water flow into reservoir when BHP starts to Increase This cyclic process continues with reduced amplitude in each cycle because of fraction A check valve set at the bottomhole could stop the backflow in less than I second This study provides useful reference and operation guidelines On offshore water injection and completion design consideration

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeo-chemical reactions, global carbon cycling, heavy metal transport, water treatability and potability. One source of DOM to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge. Changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas, which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and DOM treatability. In order to investigate potential changes in groundwater DOM character after rainfall recharge, we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat-rich sand aquifer in New South Wales, Australia, during an extended period of low precipitation (average daily precipitation rate < 1.6 mm day(-1) over the 8 months prior to sampling), and after two heavy precipitation events (84 mm day(-1) and 98 mm day(-1) respectively). We assess changes in DOM composition after correcting for dilution by a novel combination of two advanced analytical techniques: liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We also assess changes in water chemistry pre- and post-rainfall. Post-rainfall, we show that the dilution-corrected amount of highly aromatic DOM molecular formulae (i.e. those categorised into the groups polyphenolics and condensed aromatics) were 1.7 and 2.0 times higher respectively than in pre-rainfall samples. We attribute this to the flushing of peat-derived DOM from buried organic material into the groundwater. We also identify that periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic/HOC ratios in groundwater (median = 4.9, n = 14). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to compare the HOC fraction with FT-ICR MS compound groups. We show that HOC has a more aromatic character in pre-rainfall samples, and is less similar to the aromatic groups in post-rainfall samples. This suggests that the decline in water-borne hydrophobics observed post-rainfall could be associated with preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic aromatic DOM, making post-rainfall samples less treatable for potable water supply. Post-rainfall we also observe significant increases in arsenic (leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the World Health Organisation drinking water limit of 10 mu g/ L). Increases in coastal rainfall due to climate change may therefore alter the composition of groundwater DOM in coastal peatland areas in ways that may impact DOM bioavailability, and increase arsenic concentrations, reducing the ease of water treatment for human consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the chemical and molecular changes of shallow groundwater DOM pre-rainfall and post-rainfall in a sedimentary organic carbon rich environment through multiple analytical techniques.

Water samples were collected in the spring and fall seasons from two surface-water sampling sites, an upstream potential recharge area and a downstream discharge area, as well as from a set of in-stream nested wells in the upstream potential recharge area. Changes in DOM concentration, molecular weight distribution, and molar absorptivity at 280 nm were measured. Surface and shallow (1.6 m below land surface) groundwater samples collected in spring 1997 in the potential recharge zone (actual recharge impeded by an extensive clay lens) were found to be very similar in terms of DOM concentrations and physicochemical properties and is believe to originate from a common source. Samples taken in fall 1997 yielded no surface water because of drought conditions, and the shallow groundwater DOM collected from the recharge well contained significantly less and chemically altered DOM. This change in chemical properties is believed to be caused in part by fractionation resulting from sorption to mineral phases. Batch isotherm experiments show that sorption by goethite of the DOM from both spring surface and shallow groundwaters in the potential recharge area were similar, whereas the fall groundwater possessed a much lower affinity for the sorbent. This study demonstrated that shallow groundwaters collected under different climatic and hydrologic conditions (spring, high flow versus fall, drought conditions) resulted in different physicochemical properties and adsorption affinities.

AB Southernmost Patagonia, located at the relatively narrow passage between Antarctica and South America, is a highly sensitive region for recording meridional and zonal changes in the pattern of oceanic and atmospheric circulation. The island of Isla de los Estados, situated at 54.5 degrees S, 64 degrees W, east of Argentinean Tierra del Fuego, provides an exceptional possibility, to investigate terrestrial records of atmospheric conditions in an oceanic setting during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. Here we present geochemical and diatom analyses from 10600 to c. 1500 cal BP of one sequence (LGB) with peat, lake sediments and lagoon deposits at the northern coast of the island, and a lake sediment sequence (CAS) 3 km further inland. The data comprise TC, TN, loss on ignition analyses and continuous XRF scanning as well as age-depth modeling based on AMS-C-14 dating on both cores. Diatom analysis of the CAS record complements the geochemical proxies. During the Holocene, our two sites have been impacted by two different forcings: changes in the regional climate regime largely influenced by the varying strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW), while relative sea-level changes affected the deposits of the coastal site. In concert with the onset of the Antarctic thermal optimum, our data suggest fairly warm conditions and the establishment of denser peat and forest vegetation on the island c. 10600 cal BP. Between 8500 and 4500 cal BP geochemistry and diatoms from the CAS record indicate stronger Westerlies at this latitude, which means higher wind speed or higher storm frequency and more precipitation, resulting in more pronounced surface run-off. After 4500 cal BP, the geochemical proxies and large changes in diatom assemblages indicate a decrease in precipitation, weaker winds and possibly cooler conditions, probably as an effect of weaker SHW and/or a latitudinal shift. The depositional environment of CAS changed from gyttja to peat around 1000 cal BP. At LGB, the onset of gyttja sedimentation around 7900 cal BP shows that the former wet land with peat accumulation had become a lake with a fairly rapid sedimentation. The chemical data from LGB imply a gradually increasing marine influence, probably as an effect of both rising sea level and increased impact of storms and maximum high tides. After a marine high-stand during the mid-Holocene, the LGB site returned into a peat bog again around 3400 cal BP. Our data suggest that since then relative sea level first dropped back below present sea level followed by a rise to present day sea level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB e Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the water cycle, whereby accurate partitioning of ET into evaporation and transpiration provides important information about the intrinsically coupled carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Currently, global estimates of partitioned evaporative and transpiration fluxes remain highly uncertain, especially for high-latitude ecosystems where measurements are scarce. Forested peat plateaus underlain by permafrost and surrounded by permafrost-free wetlands characterize approximately 60% (7.0x10(7)km(2)) of Canadian peatlands. In this study, 22 Picea mariana (black spruce) individuals, the most common tree species of the North American boreal forest, were instrumented with sap flow sensors within the footprint of an eddy covariance tower measuring ET from a forest-wetland mosaic landscape. Sap flux density (J(S)), together with remote sensing data and in situ measurements of canopy structure, was used to upscale tree-level J(S) to overstorey transpiration (T-BS). Black spruce trees growing in nutrient-poor permafrost peat soils wre found to have lower mean J(S) than those growing in mineral soils. Overall, T-BS contributed less than 1% to landscape ET. Climate-change-induced forest loss and the expansion of wetlands may further minimize the contributions of T-BS to ET and increase the contribution of standing water.

AB A simple method for the installation of groundwater lysimeters in peat soils was developed which reduces both time and financial effort significantly. The method was applied on several sites in the Rhinluch, a fen peat land 60 kin northwest of Berlin, Germany. Over a two-year period, upward capillary flow and evapotranspiration rates under grassland with different groundwater levels were measured. The installation of tensiometers and TDR probes additionally allowed the in situ determination of the soil hydraulic properties (water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity). The results of the measurements of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity demonstrate that more than one single method has to be applied if the whole range of the conductivity function from saturation to highly unsaturated is to be covered. Measuring the unsaturated conductivity can be done only in the lab for an adequately wide range of soil moisture conditions.

AB The hydrology and nutrient dynamics of a sacred lake in the western part of the Sikkim Himalaya were studied. The lake watershed has broad-leaved mixed forest and agriculture land, two perennial and five seasonal inlets, and one major outlet. Annual inflow was 1103x10(6) l while outflow was 4279x10(6) l. About 70% of its water was from subsurface flow and seepage. More than 50% of the discharge was recorded in August (peak rainy season month) and the least in March (lean month). Sediment flow to the lake was 346 Mg y(-1) and outflow 316 Mg y(-1). The remaining 30 Mg was deposited in the lake. High sediment runoff in the rainy season turned the lake turbid and caused expansion of the bog. The nutrient (dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, total-N, ammonium-N, phosphate-P and chloride) levels of the lake, inlets and outlet varied between seasons and sites. Plankton productivity ranged from 16 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in winter to 247 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season. Its respiratory loss was 12 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in winter and 160 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season. Religious activities, agriculture, cattle grazing and forestry in the watershed should be controlled for maintaining the longevity of the lake.

AB Peatland drainage has been an important component of forestry management in the boreal zone and the resulting ditch networks are maintained regularly to sustain forest productivity. In Finland, this is recognized as the most detrimental forestry practice increasing diffuse loads of suspended solids. Alongside forestry management on peatlands, interest in peatland restoration has grown lately. Distributed hydrological modeling has the potential to address these matters by recognizing relevant physical mechanisms and identifying most suitable strategies for mitigating undesired outcomes. This study investigates the utility of such a modeling approach in a drained peatland forest environment. To provide a suitable tool for this purpose, we coupled channel network flow to the three-dimensional distributed hydrological model FLUSH. The resulting model was applied to a 5.2 ha drained peatland forest catchment in Eastern Finland. The model was calibrated and validated using field measurements obtained over frost-free periods of five months. The application showed that distributed modeling can disentangle the importance of spatial factors on local soil moisture conditions, which is significant as peatland drainage aims to control these conditions. In our application, we limited the spatial aspect to the topography and the drainage network, and found that the drainage configuration had a clear effect on the spatial soil moisture patterns but that the effect was less pronounced during the wetter summer. Future applications of distributed modeling in this field comprises investigating the impacts of other spatial factors, modeling channel erosion and solid transport to address strategies for their mitigation, and evaluating restoration schemes.

AB Sea cliffs along the western coast of Cape Liptrap at Arch Rock provide nearly continuous exposure of calcareous eolianites dated at 68-112 ka (five optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages). Calcareous eolian deposition began immediately after the last interglacial marine highstand (Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5e) and continued during sea level fall until the beginning of OIS 4. West- southwesterly winds transported calcareous sand across similar to 12 km of exposed continental shelf by the beginning of OIS 4. A brief period of cold, arid, windy continental climate with ephemeral, but intense, surface runoff immediately preceded the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This resulted in fluvial reworking of the calcarenites into an alluvial fan dated at 23-25 ka (four OSL ages). The fan overlies peat dated at 25,279 yr cal BP and is capped by a paleosol dated at 60 10 yr cal BP. Concurrent eolian reworking by northwesterly winds of siliceous sediments on marine terraces along the eastern and central portion of Cape Liptrap formed siliceous longitudinal dunes with ages ranging from 19 to 24 ka (five OSL ages). The phase of maximum landscape instability at Cape Liptrap coincides with solar insolation and air temperature minima and preceded the LGM by several thousand years. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The internal water fluxes within Sphagnum mosses critically affect the rate of evaporation and the wetness of the living upper few centimetres of moss (capitula) and the physiological processes (e.g. photosynthesis) that support them. To quantify water fluxes and stores in Sphagnum rubellum hummocks we used a 30 cm high column (mesocosm) of undisturbed hummock moss including the capitula, and applied a number of experiments to investigate (1) staged lowering (and raising) of the water table (wt) with a manometer tube; (2) pumped seepage of about 0.7 cm d(-1) to produce a wt drop of 1.5 cm day(-1); and (3) evaporation averaging 3.2 mm d(-1). Water content (theta) at saturation (theta(s)) was similar to 0.9 cm(3) cm(-3) for all depths. Residual water content (theta(r)) was 0.2 cm(3) cm(-3) at 5 con depth, increasing to 0.47 cm(3) cm(-3) at 25 cm depth. Hydraulic conductivity (K) of the same top 5 cm layer ranged from 1.8 x 10(-3) m s(-1) at theta(s) to 4 x 10(-8) on s(-1) at theta(r). By comparison K at 25 cm depth had a much more limited range from 2.3 x 10(-4) m s(-1) at theta(s) to 1.1 x 10(-5) m s(-1) at theta(r). Staged wr lowering from -10 cm to -30 cm (no evaporation allowed) resulted in an abrupt change in theta that reached a stable value generally within an hour, indicating the responsiveness of moss to drainage. Staged increases also resulted in an abrupt rise in theta, but in some cases several days were required for theta to equilibrate. Pumped seepage resulted in a sequential decline of theta, requiring about 10 days for each layer to reach theta(r), after the water table dropped below the sensor at the respective depths. Evaporation resulted in a similar pattern of decline but took almost three times as long. The computer simulation Hydrus 1D was used to model the fluxes and provided a good fit for the staged lowering and pumped seepage experiments. but overestimated the water loss by evaporation. We believe the reason for this is that over the longer evaporation experiment, the monolith underwent consolidation and shrinkage which reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity, thus reducing the rate of upward water flux - not accounted for in the simulation. Declining theta, in lower layers (i.e., before pore drainage) was evidence of consolidation. The study confirms that the hydraulic structure results in a rapid transition to a low but stable water content in upper mosses when the water table falls, a low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in such circumstances that constrains upward water flux caused by evaporation when theta, is reached, but sustains it for a wide range of water tables. Moreover, the hydraulic parameters can be represented with the Mualem-van Genuchten approach, enabling the fluxes to be modelled in one dimension with reasonable accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Study region: This study is based on the rapidly developing Athabasca Oil Sands region, northeastern Alberta.
   Study focus: Hydrograph separation using stable isotopes of water is applied to partition streamflow sources in the Athabasca River and its tributaries. Distinct isotopic labelling of snow, rain, groundwater and surface water are applied to estimate the contribution of these sources to streamflow from analysis of multi-year records of isotopes in streamflow.
   New hydrological insights for the region: The results provide new insight into runoff generation mechanisms operating in six tributaries and at four stations along the Athabasca River. Groundwater, found to be an important flow source at all stations, is the dominant component of the hydrograph in three tributaries (Steepbank R., Muskeg R., Firebag R.), accounting for 39-50% of annual streamflow. Surface water, mainly drainage from peatlands, is also found to be widely important, and dominant in three tributaries (Clearwater R., Mackay R., Ells R.), accounting for 45-81% of annual streamflow. Fairly limited contributions from direct precipitation illustrate that most snow and rain events result in indirect displacement of pre-event water by fill and spill mechanisms. Systematic shifts in regional groundwater to surface-water ratios are expected to be an important control on spatial and temporal distribution of water quality parameters and useful for evaluating the susceptibility of rivers to climate and development impacts.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a significant global store of soil carbon, which are subject to increasing natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Wildfire is the single largest disturbance to boreal forest and wetlands annually. Critical to the long-term carbon storage function in peatlands is the (re-)establishment of a near-surface water table following wildfire. This has been recently shown to in part be facilitated by post-fire reductions in water losses via evapotranspiration (ET). However, reduced ET may also have cascade impacts on other ecohydrological processes in recovering peatlands, such as a reduction in carbon sequestration. To investigate the linked cycles of evaporative loss and carbon exchange in burned peatlands, the burned and unburned peatlands in Alberta, Canada, were instrumented with eddy covariance systems to monitor continuous fluxes of energy, carbon dioxide, and water vapour, over two summer seasons (2013 and 2014; 2-3 years post-burn). The burned site showed significant changes to respiration and productivity and a shift in the partitioning of available energy (significantly larger Bowen ratio; mean values of 1.19 and 1.10 at the burned and unburned sites, respectively), as well as a significant reduction in ET rates. Decreases in respiration did not offset the decrease in primary productivity, and the burned site was significantly less productive than the reference site on a net production basis for the available data period. This provides direct observations of ET and CO2 fluxes at a novel ecosystem scale to show the impacts of fire on short-term (2-3 years) post-burn ecosystem ecohydrological function.

AB DRAINMOD 6.1 was evaluated for hydrological simulation of two drained (1.0m drain depth, 20m spacing) peat extraction areas in Northern Finland. Water table depth (WTD) and drainage outflow were recorded continuously during two years, and the data were used for model calibration and validation. Despite some under- and overestimation of certain events, WTD fluctuations simulated quite accurately, whereas the model did not simulate drainage outflow well compared to observed data, especially for daily runoff. Mean absolute error (MAE) was 11.29 and 9.09cm and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (EF) was 0.64 and 0.62 for both study sites during the validation period, indicating good agreement between predicted and observed WTD. These results demonstrate that DRAINMOD 6.1 can satisfactorily simulate the WTD fluctuations in peat extraction areas in the cold climate of northern Finland, but further studies are needed to improve the model to better include frozen condition and peat extraction activities.

TI QUANTIFYING ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES AND LOADINGS WITHIN A SMALL
   CATCHMENT WITH CONSERVATION INTERESTS, EASTERN SCOTLAND
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Review
AB 1.  This paper demonstrates the possibility of quantifying sub-catchment nutrient budgets from routinely monitored hydrological and hydrochemical data.  The relative importance of a number of potential anthropogenic nutrient sources was quantified for a small catchment in Scotland.  Within the catchment there are two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, including two lochs and a floodplain mire.  The study was undertaken to provide information for prescribing strategies to safeguard the conservation interests of these aquatic systems.
   2.  The principal source of nitrate was found to be groundwater.  Phosphate and ammonium loadings were greatest in surface run-off.  The evidence indicates that the greatest contributor towards these nutrient sources is agriculture.  Even when conservative estimates of losses were applied, current fertilizer and animal inputs could account for present day nutrient loadings.  In addition, changes in the area under arable farming and under individual crops during the past 30 years are consistent with trends in nitrate and phosphate loads.
   3.  Nutrient inputs from sewage works overflows and septic tanks within the catchment were estimated to be small.  Leachate from a landfill site within the catchment was also not considered to be a major source of nutrients, but a more intensive water quality monitoring programme would be needed to confirm the absence of leachate plumes.
   4.  The only long-term solution to reducing nutrient loadings to the aquatic systems is a reduction in agricultural activities within the catchment and avoidance of fertilizer and slurry applications near water sources.  Diversion of drainage ditch waters supplying the floodplain mire is also a possibility but the hydrological consequences of such an action could induce more severe degradation than that due to nutrient enrichment.

AB Phosphorus (P) flux from wetland soil can be a significant factor affecting overall wetland treatment performance. The purpose of our study was to quantify the effects of water level drawdown on P exchange between surface water and organic soil in a constructed wetland. We used 12 fiberglass mesocosms filled with 30 cm of peat soil to quantify nutrient exchange between surface water and organic soil in a wet-dry-wet cycle. Six mesocosms were planted with emergent macrophytes and six mesocosms were maintained free of emergent vegetation. We evaluated four treatments including continuously and intermittently flooded treatments, both with and without emergent macrophytes. Each treatment was replicated three times and every mesocosm was plumbed to monitor flow volumes and water chemistry. Effluent P concentrations were similar for all four treatments prior to first drawdown period. However, upon re-flooding, all intermittently flooded tanks exhibited a three to fourfold increase in surface water P concentration, which lasted for a period of up to ten weeks. The magnitude of nutrient flux to surface water and the time period over which P release took place were season dependent, with longer duration of high nutrient flux during dry-season drawdowns. Results of repeated measures analysis indicated that hydropattern was the dominant factor affecting P-flux to overlying surface water, while presence or absence of emergent vegetation had no significant influence on effluent concentrations. Organic and particulate phosphorus fluxes were substantially higher in treatments lacking emergent macrophytes, subsequent to the dry-season drawdowns. Intermittently flooded treatments with no emergent vegetation generated the most dissolved and particulate phosphorus. Our results indicate that maintaining saturated soil is sufficient to retain stored P. while plants played no significant role in P retention for a wetland receiving P-loading rate on the order of 0.1 g week(-1) during a wet-dry-wet cycle.

AB Research into processes governing the hydrologic connectivity of depressional wetlands has advanced rapidly in recent years. Nevertheless, a need persists for broadly applicable, non-site-specific guidance to facilitate further research. Here, we explicitly use the hydrologic landscapes theoretical framework to develop broadly applicable conceptual knowledge of depressional-wetland hydrologic connectivity. We used a numerical model to simulate the groundwater flow through five generic hydrologic landscapes. Next, we inserted depressional wetlands into the generic landscapes and repeated the modeling exercise. The results strongly characterize groundwater connectivity from uplands to lowlands as being predominantly indirect. Groundwater flowed from uplands and most of it was discharged to the surface at a concave-upward break in slope, possibly continuing as surface water to lowlands. Additionally, we found that groundwater connectivity of the depressional wetlands was primarily determined by the slope of the adjacent water table. However, we identified certain arrangements of landforms that caused the water table to fall sharply and not follow the surface contour. Finally, we synthesize our findings and provide guidance to practitioners and resource managers regarding the management significance of indirect groundwater discharge and the effect of depressional wetland groundwater connectivity on pond permanence and connectivity.

AB The Holocene vegetation dynamics of low- and mid-altitude areas of inland Iberia remain largely unknown, masking possible legacy effects of past land-use on current and future ecosystem trajectories. Here we present a 4000-year long palaeoecological record (pollen, spores, microscopic charcoal) from a mire located in the Caballeros National Park (Toledo Mountains, central Spain), a region with key conservation challenges due to ongoing land-use changes. We reconstruct late Holocene vegetation history and assess the extent to which climate, land-use and disturbances played a role in the observed changes. Our results show that oak (Quercus) woodlands have been the main forested community of the Toledo Mountains over millennia, with deciduous Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus faginea more abundant than evergreen Quercus ilex and Quercus suber, particularly on the humid soils of the valley bottoms. Deciduous oak woodlands spread during drier periods replacing hygrophilous communities (Betula, Salix, hygrophilous Ericaceae) on the edges of the mire, and could cope with fire disturbance variability under dry conditions (e.g. ca. 3800-3000-1850-1050 BC- and 1300-100 cal BP-AD 650-1850-) as suggested by regional palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Pollen and coprophilous fungi data suggest that enhanced fire occurrence at ca. 1300-100 cal BP (AD 650-1850) was due to deliberate burning by local people to promote pastoral and arable farming at the expense of woodlands/shrublands under dry conditions. While historical archives date the onset of strong human impact on the vegetation of Caballeros to the period at and after the Ecclesiastical Confiscation (ca. 150-100 cal BP, AD 1800-1850), our palaeoecological data reveal that land-use was already intense during the Arab period (ca. 1250-900 cal BP, AD 700-1050) and particularly marked during the subsequent City of Toledo's rule (ca. 700-150 cal BP, AD 1250-1800). Finally, we hypothesize that persistent groundwater discharge allowed the mires of the Toledo Mountains to act as interglacial hydrologic microrefugia for some hygrophilous woody plants (Betula, Myrica gale, Erica tetralix) during pronounced dry spells over the past millennia.

AB Mine reclamation in the Athabasca oil sands region Canada, is required by law where companies must reconstruct disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and lakes that existed in the Boreal landscape prior to mining. Winter is a major hydrological factor in this region as snow covers the landscape for 5-6 months and is similar to 25% of the annual precipitation, yet few studies have explored the influence of winter processes on the hydrology of constructed watersheds. One year (2017-2018) of intensive snow hydrology measurements are supplemented with 6 years (2013-2018) of meteorological measurements from the constructed Sandhill Fen watershed to: (a) understand snow accumulation and redistribution, snowmelt timing, rate, and partitioning, (b) apply a physically based model for simulating winter processes on hillslopes, and (c) evaluate the impact of soil prescriptions and climate change projections on winter processes in reclaimed systems. The 2017-2018 snow season was between November and April and snow water equivalent (SWE) ranged between 40 and 140 mm. Snow distribution was primarily influenced by topography with little influence of snow trapping from developing vegetation. Snow accumulation was most variable on hillslopes and redistribution was driven by slope position, with SWE greatest at the base of slopes and decreased toward crests. Snowmelt on hillslopes was controlled by slope aspect, as snow declined rapidly on west and south-facing slopes, compared with east and north-facing slopes. Unlike results previously reported on constructed uplands, snowmelt runoff from uplands was much less (similar to 30%), highlighting the influence of different construction materials. Model simulations indicate that antecedent soil moisture and soil temperature have a large influence on partitioning snowmelt over a range of observed conditions. Under a warmer and wetter climate, average annual peak SWE, and snow season duration could decline up to 52% and up to 61 days, respectively, while snowmelt runoff ceases completely under the warmest scenarios. Results suggest considerable future variability in snowmelt runoff from hillslopes, yet soil properties can be used to enhance vertical or lateral flows.

ID CONSOLIDATION
AB This paper discusses the hydraulic conductivity (k) of peat and organic clay as measured by laboratory and in-situ tests. Thekof various peat soils and organic clay soils in Hokkaido, Japan, was investigated by the following tests: in-situ hydraulic conductivity test using a borehole, electric cone penetration test, oedometer test, and laboratory hydraulic conductivity test. Thekof peat and organic clay dramatically decreases during consolidation. The index of change ink, which indicates consolidation-related changes ink, increases linearly with the increase in the in-situ void ratio and the ignition loss. Thekof peat measured by oedometer test was found to range from approximately 1/20 to 1/180 of that measured by in-situ hydraulic conductivity test, which is considered to provide the macroscopickof peat ground. Since large plant remnants must be removed for the oedometer testing of peat, the laboratorykobtained from this test underestimates the macroscopickof the peat layer. The ratio of laboratorykto in-situkcan be simply expressed as a function of the ignition loss. Based on the results of a dissipation test of pore water pressure that used the electric cone penetration test, an equation for estimating the in-situkof peat ground is presented. Using the above-mentioned experimental correlations, a suitable procedure for determining the permeability parameters of peat ground in practical applications is proposed.

AB The upper part of the Narew River valley (NE Poland) belongs to the last extensive undrained, non-reclaimed valley wetlands in Central Europe. However, in recent decades, the fluviogenous mire has experienced a significant change in water resources which may be linked to climatic fluctuations and changes in vegetation. In NE Poland during the last three decades, a clear trend toward milder and drier climate has been observed that has resulted in lower river discharge. Reduction in surface water inflow into the mire, diminished duration and degree of flooding, decrease in summer rainfall and increase in evapotranspiration have led to the substantial fall of the groundwater table in the valley and a decrease in volume of water stored in organic sediments. A comparison of water table measurements made in the 1970s with contemporary observations showed that presently, summer minimum groundwater levels are as much as 60 cm lower than in the past. A significant drop of water table elevation might be additionally attributed to increased ET caused by cessation in agricultural use of the mire and expansion of Phragmites. Between the 1970s and 2002, the total amount of water lost by ET increased by 42%, whereas ET, rose by 7% only. We found that patches of common reed rushes were hot spots for ET across the Narew wetland landscape. The evaluation of the effectiveness of restoration measures aimed at restoration of the water conditions in the Narew mire led us to the conclusion that raising the river water level by use of in-stream structures may be not adequate to make up the summer moisture deficit and ensure a sufficiently high groundwater level in the adjacent wetland. The restoration goal may be partly achieved by large vegetation manipulation in the form of mowing or grazing. Vegetation management could reduce ET by 170 mm m(-2) year(-1), potentially minimizing the extent and the duration of groundwater drawdowns. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The effects of climatic factors and vegetation type on evapotranspiration (E) and water use efficiency (WUE) were analyzed using tower-based eddy-covariance (EC) data for nine mature forest sites, two peatland sites and one grassland site across an east-west continental-scale transect in Canada during the period 2003-2006. The seasonal pattern of E was closely linked to growing-season length and rainfall distribution. Although annual precipitation (P) during the observation period was highly variable among sites (250-1450 mm), minimum annual E was not less than 200 mm and was limited to 400-500 ram where annual P exceeded 700 mm. Site-specific interannual variability in E could be explained by either changes in total P or variations in solar irradiance. A highly positive linear correlation was found between monthly mean values of E and net radiation (R-n) at the grassland site (AB-GRL), the two peatland sites (AB-WPL and ON-EPL), and only one of the forest sites (coastal Douglas-fir, BC-DF49) whereas a hysteretic relationship at the other forest sites indicated that E lagged behind the typical seasonal progression of R-n. Results of a cross-correlation analysis between daily (24-h) E and R-n revealed that site-specific lag times were between 10 and 40 days depending on the lag of vapour pressure deficit (D) behind R-n and the decoupiing coefficient, Omega. There was significant seasonal variation in daytime mean dry-foliage Priestley-Taylor alpha with maxima occurring in the growing season at all sites except BC-DF49 where it was relatively constant (similar to 0.55) throughout all years. Annual means of daytime dry-foliage alpha mostly ranging between 0.5 and 0.7 implied stomatal limitation to transpiration. Increasing D significantly decreased canopy conductance (g(c)) at the forest sites but had little effect at the peatland and grassland sites, while variation in soil water content caused only minor changes in g(c). At all sites, a strong linear correlation between monthly mean values of gross primary production (GPP) and E resulted in water use efficiency being relatively constant. While at most sites, WUE was in the range of 2.6-3.6 g C kg(-1) H2O, the BC-DF49 site had the highest WUE of the twelve sites with values near 6.0 g C kg(-1) H2O. Of the two peatland sites. AB-WPL, a western treed fen, had a significantly higher WUE (similar to 3.0 g C kg(-1) H2O) than ON-EPL, an eastern ombrotrophic bog (similar to 1.8 g C kg(-1) H2O), which was related to peatland productivity and plant functional type.

AB Upland agricultural land management activities such as grazing, vegetation burning, and bare ground restoration impact hydrological elements of headwater catchments, many of which may be important for downstream flood peaks (e.g., overland flow and soil water storage). However, there is poor understanding of how these management practices affect river flow peaks during high magnitude rainfall events. Using the distributed TOPMODEL, spatial configurations of land management were modelled to predict flood response in an upland catchment, which contains different regions operating subsidized agricultural stewardship schemes. Heavy grazing leading to soil compaction and loss of vegetation cover in stewardship regions covering 79.8% of the catchment gave a 42-min earlier flow peak, which was 82.2% higher (under a 1-hr 15-mm storm) than the current simulated hydrograph. Light grazing over the same regions of the catchment had much less influence on river flow peaks (18min earlier and 32.9% increase). Rotational burning (covering 8.8% of the catchment), most of which is located in the headwater areas, increased the peak by 3.2% in the same rainfall event. Vegetation restoration with either Eriophorum or Sphagnum (higher density) in bare areas (5.8%) of the catchment provided a reduction of flood peak (3.9% and 5.2% in the 15-mm storm event), whereas the same total area revegetated with Sphagnum in riparian regions delivered a much larger decrease (15.0%) in river flow peaks. We show that changes of vegetation cover in highly sensitive areas (e.g., near-stream zones) generate large impacts on flood peaks. Thus, it is possible to design spatially distributed management systems for upland catchments, which reduce flood peaks while at the same time ensuring economic viability for upland farmers.

AB The O-18 isotope content of five species of Sphagnum from three peatlands in Ontario was analyzed. Sphagnum fuscum and S. capillifolium had significantly more enriched deltaO-18 values than S. fallax, S. magellanicum, and S. papillosum. The enriched values in the former species indicate that water involved in photosynthesis in hummock species is much more affected by evapotranspiration than in adjacent species situated in depressions. These data suggest that microenvironmental water relations regulate evapotranspiration in Sphagnum species. Environmental isotope analysis (O-18, H-2) is another technique that may shed light on understanding Sphagnum ecophysiology and water relations along microenvironmental gradients in northern peatlands.

AB Land cover changes can impact the climate by influencing the surface energy and water balance. Naturally treeless or sparsely treed peatlands were extensively drained to stimulate forest growth in Finland over the second half of 20th century. The aim of this study is to investigate the biogeophysical effects of peatland forestation on regional climate in Finland. Two sets of 18-year climate simulations were done with the regional climate model REMO by using land cover data based on pre-drainage (1920s) and post-drainage (2000s) Finnish national forest inventories. In the most intensive peatland forestation area, located in the middle west of Finland, the results show a warming in April of up to 0.43K in monthly-averaged daily mean 2m air temperature, whereas a slight cooling from May to October of less than 0.1K in general is found. Consequently, snow clearance days over that area are advanced up to 5 days in the mean of 15 years. No clear signal is found for precipitation. Through analysing the simulated temperature and energy balance terms, as well as snow depth over five selected subregions, a positive feedback induced by peatland forestation is found between decreased surface albedo and increased surface air temperature in the snow-melting period. Our modelled results show good qualitative agreements with the observational data. In general, decreased surface albedo in the snow-melting period and increased evapotranspiration in the growing period are the most important biogeophysical aspects induced by peatland forestation that cause changes in climate. The results from this study can be further integrally analysed with biogeochemical effects of peatland forestation to provide background information for adapting future forest management to mitigate climate warming effects. Moreover, they provide insights about the impacts of projected forestation of tundra at high latitudes due to climate change.

AB Although it is known that cool fire can result in carbon loss in organic soils, data are lacking on the effects of such fire on the distinctive lowland organic soils of the southern hemisphere and on the relationship of fire-induced carbon loss to topography. We established an experiment to determine the effects of a low severity burn on organic and total mass of soils, the position of the water table and vegetation cover. We recorded soil losses directly after the fire, after the first rain and after 4 years. We also recorded losses as a result of the first rain and at 4 years after a wildfire at another locality with the same vegetation and topography. We compared soil surface temperatures over summer between burned and unburned moorland. The planned fire resulted in substantial soil and carbon losses, which, up to 4 years after the wildfire, occurred mostly as a result of the fire itself and the first rains. The topographic wetness index was strongly related to soil and organic matter loss for the pooled data for both sites, while fire severity, slope and vegetation cover were less predictive. Burning increased dissolved organic material in streams; the depth of the water table; and, soil temperatures. The continuing soil loss on slopes 18 years after fire contrasts with faster recovery on the shelves and in the basins, reflecting a strong topographic component in variation. Fire is a major influence on the depth of the organic soils of the southern hemisphere, as in the northern hemisphere. The influence of fire on soils varies markedly between topographic positions, with the time interval between fires that would maintain organic soils in basins being markedly less than that necessary to maintain organic soils on slopes. The topographic effect appears to be a consequence of relative drying rather than relative exposure to water or aeolian erosion or differences in fire severity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Akutan Volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian are, but until recently little was known about its history and eruptive character. Following a brief but sustained period of intense seismic activity in March 1996, the Alaska Volcano Observatory began investigating the geology of the volcano and evaluating potential volcanic hazards that could affect residents of Akutan Island. During these studies new information was obtained about the Holocene eruptive history of the volcano on the basis of stratigraphic studies of volcaniclastic deposits and radiocarbon dating of associated buried soils and peat. A black, scoria-bearing, lapilli tephra, informally named the "Akutan tephra," is up to 2 m thick and is found over most of the island, primarily east of the volcano summit. Six radiocarbon ages on the humic fraction of soil A-horizons beneath the tephra indicate that the Akutan tephra was erupted approximately 1611 years B.P. At several locations the Akutan tephra is within a conformable stratigraphic sequence of pyroclastic-flow and lahar deposits that are all part of the same eruptive sequence. The thickness, widespread distribution, and conformable stratigraphic association with overlying pyroclastic-flow and lahar deposits indicate that the Akutan tephra likely records a major eruption of Akutan Volcano that may have formed the present summit caldera. Noncohesive lahar and pyroclastic-flow deposits that predate the Akutan tephra occur in the major valleys that head on the volcano and are evidence for six to eight earlier Holocene eruptions. These eruptions were strombolian to subplinian events that generated limited amounts of tephra and small pyroclastic flows that extended only a few kilometers from the vent. The pyroclastic flows melted snow and ice on the volcano flanks and formed lahars that traveled several kilometers down broad, formerly glaciated valleys, reaching the coast as thin, watery, hyperconcentrated flows or water floods. Slightly cohesive lahars in Hot Springs valley and Long valley could have formed from minor flank collapses of hydrothermally altered volcanic bedrock. These lahars may be unrelated to eruptive activity.

AB Catchment-scale transit times for water are increasingly being recognized as an important control on geochemical processes. In this study, snowmelt water mean transit times (MTTs) were estimated for the 15 Krycklan research catchments in northern boreal Sweden. The snowmelt water MTTs were assumed to be representative of the catchment-scale hydrologic response during the spring thaw period and, as such, may be considered to be a component of the catchment's overall MTT. These snowmelt water MTTs were empirically related to catchment characteristics and landscape structure represented by using different indices of soil cover, topography and catchment similarity. Mire wetlands were shown to be significantly correlated to snowmelt MTTs for the studied catchments. In these wetlands, shallow ice layers form that have been shown to serve as impervious boundaries to vertical infiltration during snowmelt periods and, thus, alter the flow pathways of water in the landscape. Using a simple thought experiment, we could estimate the potential effect of thawing of ice layers on snowmelt hydrologic response using the empirical relationship between landscape structure (represented using a catchment-scale Pe number) and hydrologic response. The result of this thought experiment was that there could be a potential increase of 20-45% in catchment snowmelt water MTTs for the Krycklan experimental catchments. It is therefore possible that climatic changes present competing influences on the hydrologic response of northern boreal catchments that need to be considered. For example, MTTs may tend to decrease during some times of the year due to an acceleration in the hydrologic cycle, while they tend to increase MTTs during other times of the year due to shifts in hydrologic flow pathways. The balance between the competing influences on a catchment's MTT has consequences on climatic feedbacks as it could influence hydrological and biogeochemical cycles at the catchment scale for northern latitude boreal catchments.

SO IRISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD RESEARCH

DT Article
DE drainage; hydraulic conductivity; peat
AB The selection of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of compressible peat for use in the design of drain spacing depends on: (i) whether the peat is drained or undrained; and (ii) the method of measurement of K. Drainage gives rise to dewatering and consolidation, while K measurement can cause swelling and consolidation. Swelling and consolidation affect the porosity of the peat, and can lead to significant differences in the values of K obtained. Selection of a suitable design value of K is problematical in view of the changes that can take place in K and in the peat depths as a result of drainage. In this study, three techniques were used to measure K in a blanket peat, viz. the auger hole, the piezometer and the drain-outflow methods. In some piezometric tests both recovery and falling-head procedures were used in the same hole. Values of K for undrained peat varied from 0.04 m / day to 1.34 m / day with a mean of 0.5 m / day and a coefficient of variation of 70%. However, the mean K value by the falling-head method in undrained peat was only 0.065 m / day. The falling-head (0.041 m / day), recovery (0.039 m / day) and auger-hole (0.12 m / day) methods in drained peat and the drain-outflow method (0.075 m / day) were only 9 to 27% of the mean by the auger hole and piezometer recovery methods in undrained peat. Because of consolidation and dewatering subsequent to drainage, a design value of K measured in undrained peat by the auger-hole or piezometer methods could result in an incorrect drain spacing. The variation of K in peat following on drainage can be assessed from a plot of drain outflows against water-table depth.

ID TRAVERTINES
AB Calcium carbonate production in most freshwater tufa systems is controlled by a combination of physico-chemical precipitation, and biomediation associated with procaryote-microphyte biofilms. Inorganic precipitation is dominant under turbulent flow regimes, whereas biomediation necessitates sluggish flow or static water. We show here that temperature is also likely to affect tufa formation rates and architecture, leading to the development of a clearly definable range of fabrics. Two contrasting models are proposed: Warm semi-arid tufas: well seen in the Ruidera Pools National Park, Albacete Province, Central Spain, where tufa barrages consist of vertical, narrow rimmed arcuate structures. Frequently these are bounded both upstream and downstream by deep lakes. Laterally accreting mammilate stromatolites dominate the upper two thirds of lake margin subaqueous overhangs, whereas conical growth-forms dominate shady basal parts of subaqueous overhangs. Dense reed stands grow in thin peats on top of the vertical lake margin walls. Resistivity survey and percussion augering show up to 20 m of earlier lake fill which is banded into dark and pale beds. The upper 10 m accumulated in 4600 years. There is little or no preservation of organic material within these deposits.
   Cool temperate tufas: typified by slowly accumulating barrage tufas at Caerwys (N. Wales) and Alport (N, Derbyshire, UK). Transverse barriers across valleys are dominated by arcuate buttress developments built up of downstream-facing tabular carbonate sheets. Pools upstream of the barriers are shallow, dominated by clotted lime mud and organic sapropels in their depocentres, and stromatolite-dominated (laminar to low domes, or oncoidal) facies in broad marginal zones. Marginal stands of semi-aquatic vegetation are rooted in thick peats but frequently are also encrusted around their exposed stems by oncoidal carbonate. Fabric preservation is good for the carbonate material, however, marginal peats rapidly oxidise and stem encrustations collapse to produce cylindrical oncoid beds. Depocentre sapropels are always preserved and contain important pollen records otherwise rare in carbonate regions.
   Carbonates in both models accumulate relatively rapidly. They have a moderate preservation potential within Late Cenozoic terrestrial successions. The distinctly different characteristics of their preserved fabrics should allow recognition of two contrasting ''climatic'' models for fluvial barrage tufas in ancient deposits.

AB The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the restoration of wetlands impacted by a series of drainage ditches and pools located in an extensive undeveloped peatland in the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, Michigan. This study examined the nature and extent of degradation to the Marsh Creek wetlands caused by alteration of natural hydrology by a water-storage pool (C-3 Pool) that intersects the Marsh Creek channel. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in moderate-intensity disturbance associated with natural water-level fluctuations below the C-3 dike contributed to lower species richness, reduced floristic quality and a larger tree and shrub component than vegetation upstream from the pool. Wetland plant communities were sampled quantitatively and analyzed for species richness, floristic quality and physiognomy. Aerial photographs, GIS databases and GPS data contributed to the characterization and analysis of the Marsh Creek wetlands. Results showed that there was lower species richness in vegetated areas downstream from the pool, but not the anticipated growth in shrubs. Wetland vegetation upstream and downstream from the pool had similar floristic quality, except for a greater number of weedy taxa above the pool. Seepage through the pool dike and localized ground-water discharge created conditions very similar to those observed around beaver dams in Marsh Creek. In essence, the dike containing the C-3 Pool affected hydrology and wetland plant communities in a manner similar to an enormous beaver dam, except that it did not allow seasonal flooding episodes to occur. Management actions to release water from the pool into the original Marsh Creek channel at certain times and in certain amounts that mimic the natural flow regime would be expected to promote greater plant species richness and minimize the negative impacts of the dike.

AB Here the hydrogeochemical constraints of a tracer dilution study are combined with Fe and Zn isotopic measurements to pinpoint metal loading sources and attenuation mechanisms in an alpine watershed impacted by acid mine drainage. In the tested mountain catchment, delta(56) Fe and delta(66) Zn isotopic signatures of filtered stream water samples varied by similar to 3.5 parts per thousand. and 0.4 parts per thousand, respectively. The inherent differences in the aqueous geochemistry of Fe and Zn provided complimentary isotopic information. For example, variations in delta(56)Fe were linked to redox and precipitation reactions occurring in the stream, while changes in delta(66)Zn were indicative of conservative mixing of different Zn sources. Fen environments contributed distinctively light dissolved Fe (<-2.0 parts per thousand) and isotopically heavy suspended Fe precipitates to the watershed, while Zn from the fen was isotopically heavy (>+0.4 parts per thousand.). Acidic drainage from mine wastes contributed heavier dissolved Fe (similar to+0.5 parts per thousand) and lighter Zn (similar to+0.2 parts per thousand) isotopes relative to the fen. Upwelling of Fe-rich groundwater near the mouth of the catchment was the major source of Fe (delta(56)Fe similar to 0 parts per thousand.) leaving the watershed in surface flow, while runoff from mining wastes was the major source of Zn. The results suggest that given a strong framework for interpretation, Fe and Zn isotopes are useful tools for identifying and tracking metal sources and attenuation mechanisms in mountain watersheds.

AB Soil solution was collected to identify seasonal trends in its chemistry and to examine relationships between the concentrations of ions and variables that may control them. Samples were collected fortnightly at 10 cm and 50 cm depth in a blanket peat soil at Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve in the northern Pennine uplands of England. Dissolved organic carbon at 10 cm peaked each summer and correlated most strongly with temperature. At both depths Na+ and Cl- were the dominant ions, reflecting the oceanic climate. Over the 3-year sampling period, concentrations of the principal anions and cations at 10 cm varied little except during the autumns of 1994 and 1995 following unusually dry summers. At these times concentrations of SO42--S increased from < 3 <mu>mol to a maximum of 430 mu mol and were balanced by smaller increases in Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and H+. The SO42- concentration at 10 cm was most strongly correlated with depth to the water table 3 weeks prior to sampling. At 50 cm depth in the peat a small increase in SO42- occurred only during the autumn of 1995, and the concentration of SO42- at this depth correlated most strongly with that at 10 cm. At neither depth were there any strong correlations with deposition. The increase in H+ concentration associated with the peak in SO42- at 10 cm depth represents a fall in pH from usual values around 4.2 to 3.5.

AB The potential for wetland emissions to feedback on climate change has been previously hypothesised [Houghton et al., 2001]. We assess this hypothesis using an interactive wetlands scheme radiatively coupled to an integrated climate change effects model. The scheme predicts wetland area and methane (CH4) emissions from soil temperature and water table depth, and is constrained by optimising its ability to reproduce the observed inter-annual variability in atmospheric CH4. In transient climate change simulations the wetland response amplifies the total anthropogenic radiative forcing at 2100 by about 3.5 - 5%. The modelled increase in global CH4 flux from wetland is comparable to the projected increase in anthropogenic CH4 emissions over the 21st century under the IS92a scenario.

AB In cold climates, fungicides are used on golf greens to prevent snow mould causing serious damage to the turf. However, fungicide residues have been detected in runoff from golf courses, which may lead to restrictions on use. There is therefore an urgent need to improve understanding of the processes affecting leaching of fungicides from turfgrass systems to allow identification of green construction and management practices that minimize environmental impacts. In this study we monitored the leaching of the fungicide iprodione in a putting green. Sorption and degradation of iprodione was measured in batch and incubation experiments, and the simulation model MACRO was used as a risk assessment tool. Degradation of iprodione was bi-phasic, with a rapid initial phase (half-life 17 h) caused by enhanced biodegradation. Degradation rates slowed considerably after 5 days, with half-lives of up to 38 days. Sorption of iprodione was linear, with a K-oc value of ca 400 cm(3) g(-1). MACRO reasonably accurately matched measured drainflows and concentrations of iprodione in soil and drainflow. However, peak concentrations in drainage were underestimated, which was attributed to preferential finger flow due to water repellency. The results also showed the importance of the organic matter content in the green root zone in reducing leaching. It was concluded that, with 'reasonable worst-case' use, losses of iprodione from greens can occur at concentrations exceeding water quality limits for aquatic ecosystems. Snow mould problems should be tackled by adopting green root zone mixes that minimize leaching and 'best management practices' that would avoid the need for intensive prophylactic use of fungicides.

AB Determination of infiltration properties of soils under laboratory conditions necessitates the collection of soil samples in a way that maintains their natural physical properties. Mountain forest soils, containing rock fragments, root systems and a significant amount of organic matter, make it extremely difficult to test their hydraulic conductivity using both laboratory and field methods. A widely used technique of sampling by driving a cylinder into the ground in this type of soils causes damage to their structure resulting from the displacement of root systems and rock fragments as well as reduction of soil porosity. Thus, subsequent results contain an error that is difficult to estimate. The aim of the present research was: (I) to develop a laboratory method for testing the hydraulic conductivity of mountain forest soils, and in particular a method of collection of undisturbed soil samples, (2) to determine the influence of the applied method of collecting samples on the thickening of their peripheral layer and on elimination of increased infiltration at the boundary between the soil medium and the cylinder, (3) to determine the extent of the impact of the irregular shape of a sample on its hydraulic conductivity and (4) to develop an empirical method for determining the actual values of hydraulic conductivity, taking into account the error associated with the flow of water through samples with different shapes. The method of soil sampling consists in gradual formation of a cylindrical soil monolith and filling the free space between the monolith and the tri-cylindrical container with low-pressure assembly foam. This method ensures preservation of the natural physical properties of the examined samples and elimination of errors during the measurement of the hydraulic conductivity, caused by increased infiltration at the boundary between the soil medium and the cylinder. It was shown that the mean error of hydraulic conductivity determination, related to the irregular shape of samples, amounts to 11.57%. The error may be eliminated by the application of conversion coefficients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Degassing of terrestrially-respired CO2 from streams and small rivers appears to be a significant component in watershed carbon budgets. Here we propose an original approach to quantify CO2 degassing in small headwater bodies using pCO(2), DIC (or total alkalinity, TA) and delta C-13-DIC data in stream waters that avoids the difficulty of measuring or choosing a gas transfer velocity. Our inversed model applies to acidic, non-buffered (humic-type) waters and relies on two main assumptions, i.e., the stable isotopic composition of DIC in groundwater seeping to surface water (CO2 from respired soil organic carbon and HCO3- from weathering) and on kinetic fractionation at the water-air interface ((CO2)-C-12 degases to the atmosphere more rapidly than (CO2)-C-13). We first consider both the soil organic matter isotopic composition and the isotopic fractionation of CO2 in the soil, to derive the delta C-13-CO2 in that soil and groundwater. From the HCO3- concentrations in streams, we estimate the relative contribution of silicate and carbonate weathering (the latter being minor in these waters) to the HCO3- and its associated isotopic composition. Model calculations start from the delta C-13-DIC value computed by the aforementioned method and consist of two interlocked iterative procedures. The first procedure simulates the decrease in pCO(2) and the increase in delta C-13-DIC that occur along the stream watercourse during degassing, starting from an assumed initial soil pCO(2) and ending at the in situ pCO(2) or delta C-13-DIC. The second iteration procedure consists of adjusting the initial soil pCO(2) until pCO(2) and delta C-13-DIC simultaneously reach the in situ measured values. After convergence is obtained, the model computes a theoretical concentration of DIC, [DIC](ex.), that has been lost as CO2 to the atmosphere from the headwater to the sampling point in the river. [DIC](ex). can be multiplied by the river discharge to derive the quantity of carbon degassed from the river surface. The model was tested on seasonal field datasets from three small rivers draining sandy podsols in southern France and gave annual areal degassing rates comparable to those reported in other studies, though somewhat larger (upper half range in two rivers, similar to 10 times the average in one stream). Part of this discrepancy might have been caused by an intense degassing in the vicinity of groundwater seeps, which was accounted for our integrative method but not by classical methods based on stream water pCO(2) and gas transfer velocity. The sensitivity of the model results on the assumption of the importance of carbonate weathering might also explain part of this high degassing rate. The model reproduced consistent values and seasonal trends of soil pCO(2) (maximal in summer) and gas transfer velocity (maximal at high water flow). We discuss the sensitivity of the model to the different parameters and assumptions and propose some improvements including groundwater sampling, for better constraining the computed degassing rates.

AB 1 Linear elongation and dry-matter production of three Sphagnum species (S. capillifolium, S. magellanicum and S. fallax) were measured during three consecutive growing seasons at a nutrient-poor mire in the southern Alps of Italy. The growth data were subjected to path analysis, in which climatic parameters, distance to water table and photoperiod were employed as independent variables in the regressions.
   2 Individuals of all three species were also cultured in the laboratory under different combinations of photoperiod x photon flux density x night temperature. The resulting growth data were compared by two-way ANOVA.
   3 Long-day photoperiod promoted growth of all species. Induction of dormancy required both short-day photoperiod and low night temperature.
   4 Mean temperature had a positive effect on growth of both S. capillifolium and S. magellanicum. Growth of S. fallax, a species which is more prone to desiccation in dry periods, was more affected by water-table depth.
   5 The periodic pattern of dry-matter accumulation in Sphagnum is controlled partly by an as yet unknown internal rhythm based on photoperiod, and partly by external factors related to climate. However, the response of Sphagnum to environment differs between species and is reflected in the competitive equilibria between species that are adapted to different microhabitats. Hollow species are usually more productive than hummock species in wet periods but this ratio often reverses in dry periods.

AB There is interest in quantifying phosphorus (P) loss from intensively grazed dairy landscapes to identify key pathways and target remediation methods. The Bog Burn drains a dairying catchment in Southland, New Zealand, and has been monitored at fortnightly intervals over a 12-mo period at four sites for suspended sediment (SS), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total phosphorus (TP). Time-integrated samplers, deployed at 0.6 median water depth at each site (calculated from previous year's flow data), collected sediment samples, which were analyzed for SS, bioavailable phosphorus (BAP), and TP. Mean concentrations of DRP and TP in stream flow and BAP and TP in sediment were generally highest in summer or autumn (0.043 mg DRP L-1, 0.160 mg TP L-1, 173 mg BAP kg(-1), 2228 mg TP kg(-1)) and lowest in winter or spring (0.012 mg DRP L-1, 0.034 mg TIP L-1, 6 mg BAP kg(-1), 711 mg TP kg(-1)), while loads were highest in winter. Analysis of Cs-137 concentrations in trapped sediment, topsoil, subsoil, and stream bed and bank sediment indicated that trapped sediment was derived from topsoil and entered the stream either through tile drainage or, to a lesser extent, overland flow. Because concentrations of DRP and TP in stream flow are in excess of recommended limits for good water quality (>0.01 mg DRIP L-1, 0.033 mg TP L-1), management should focus on the topsoil and specifically on decreasing P loss via tile drainage. This is best achieved by decreasing soil Olsen P concentrations, especially because, on average, Olsen P concentrations in the catchment were above the agronomic optimum.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) was measured via the eddy covariance technique at a shrub bog peatland in southeastern Ontario for 5 years. For most of the study period the temperature was above normal. Precipitation was variable, but, in 2 years, late summer dry periods resulted in an extended period of deep drawdown of the water table (WT). Growing-season (May-September) daily ET varied considerably; maximum ET rates were 4 to 5 rum day(-1). Winter ET rates were an order of magnitude smaller than in summer, yet the total winter ET loss was important, accounting for 23 to 30% of the annual ET water loss. Annual precipitation exceeded annual ET by 1.55 to 1.94 times.
   During the growing season, daily ET was closely related to daily potential evaporation (PET); however, the slope of this relationship was statistically different in some years. In contrast, ET and WT were only weakly related in most years. When ET was sorted into 5 cm WT classes there was no difference in mean ET across most WT classes; only the two deepest WT classes had significantly smaller mean ET. The ratio ET/PET followed the same pattern. We present a conceptual model of ET that relates WT, soil hydraulic properties and moss and vascular plant processes.

AB We report natural abundance of (15)N content in a suite of plants and lichens from a sloping open peatland in coastal northern British Columbia, Canada. A wide range of delta(15)N values varying between -11 and +3 parts per thousand were observed in the studied species. Herbs, mosses, and shrubs generally grouped individually along the delta(15)N gradient from enriched to more depleted values. This grouping probably reflects similar nitrogen acquiring strategies within the group, but some species with different strategies showed deviated delta(15)N values from the cluster. Hummock-lawn gradient, which is illustrated as depth to water table, explains the variation in delta(15)N signature of cryptogams: the deeper the groundwater table, the more depleted is the (15)N. This trend might be explained by differences in nitrogen sources and/or differences in internal fractionation during nitrogen translocation processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Europe, agriculture on managed peat wetlands is often a balance between maximising farming production, whether hay harvest or cattle production or both, and a desire to maintain a threatened ecological landscape with its flora and fauna. Because of the large amount of carbon stored in peat soils, the management of peat wetlands to minimise the production of atmospheric greenhouse gases is also now a priority. Eddy correlation and allied radiation and soil physics measurements were made continuously over several years at a wetland meadow peat site that is subject to a water level management scheme, at Tadham Moor in the Somerset Levels and Moors, UK. These measurements provided estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and, through established models, estimates of Gross Photosynthetic Production (GPP), and separate soil and plant respiration. A relationship between depth to the water table and soil respiration was established that showed increasing ecosystem respiration with increasing depth to the water table. Annual results are presented for 2002, which also incorporate harvest and cattle carbon gains and losses. In 2002, the site had a significant loss of soil carbon of 59 gC m(-2) y(-1) compared to the historical long-term carbon uptake of natural peat-lands. However, it is shown that the current implementation of the management scheme is ineffective in maintaining the prescribed water levels in the ditches. A consequence of this is that desired water levels in the field are not achieved. Controlling the management scheme for in-field water levels (rather than channel levels) is shown to decrease markedly the annual soil respiration and hence help to maintain the current soil carbon stocks without affecting the current farming practice.

AB Depending on the soil type, different types of binder have been used to stabilize soft soils nowadays. An essential criterion in the selection of suitable binder is its capability of achieving the desirable soil stabilizing function. For peat soil, it was evident that the engineering properties of the soil can be improved with Portland cement and ground granulated blast furnace slag with siliceous sand acting as filler. The soil stabilization technique is developed in such a way that the cement, slag and siliceous sand are dry mixed with in situ peat soil to form columnar reinforcement in the deep peat ground prior to preloading. When mixed with cement in the soil, the slag which contains silica, alumina and reactive lime is activated and this can accelerate the reactions of cement in peat and improve the stabilization effect. This paper highlights the evidence on the positive effects of the binder at stabilizing peat soil through laboratory mix design and testing investigation. Markedly increase in pH and unconfined compressive strength and significant reduction in linear shrinkage, compressibility and permeability of the stabilized peat were discovered from the results of the investigation.

AB Mosses and lichens are important components of boreal landscapes [Vitt et al., 1994; Bubier et al., 1997]. They affect plant productivity and belowground carbon sequestration and alter the surface runoff and energy balance. We report the use of multiresolution satellite data to map moss and lichens over the BOREAS region at a 10 in, 30 in, and I km scales. Our moss and lichen classification at the 10 in scale is based on ground observations of associations among soil drainage classes, overstory composition, and cover type among four broad classes of ground cover (feather, sphagnum, and brown mosses and lichens). For our 30 in map, we used field observations of ground cover-overstory associations to map mosses and lichens in the BOREAS southern study area (SSA). To scale up to a I km (AVHRR) moss map of the BOREAS region, we used the TM SSA mosaics plus regional field data to identify AVHRR overstory-ground cover associations. We found that: 1) ground cover, overstory composition and density are highly correlated, permitting inference of moss and lichen cover from satellite-based land cover classifications; 2) our I m moss map reveals that mosses dominate the boreal landscape of central Canada, thereby a significant factor for water, energy, and carbon modeling; 3) TM and AVHRR moss cover maps are comparable; 4) satellite data resolution is important, particularly in detecting the smaller wetland features, lakes, and upland jack pine sites; and 5) distinct regional patterns of moss and lichen cover correspond to latitudinal and elevational gradients.

   TERRAIN UNITS; EVAPORATION; IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; ADVECTION; CANADA
AB A model to calculate the water balance of a hummocky sedge fen in the northern Hudson Bay Lowland is presented. The model develops the potential latent heat flux (evaporation) as a function of net radiation and atmospheric temperature. It is about equally sensitive to a 2% change in net radiation and a 1 degrees C change in temperature. The modelled potential evaporation agrees well with the Priestley-Taylor formulation of evaporation under conditions of a non-limiting water supply. The actual evaporative heat flux is modelled by expressing actual/potential evaporation as a function of potential accumulated water deficit. Model evaporation agrees well with energy balance calculations using 7 years of measured data including wet and dry extremes. Water deficit is defined as the depth of water below reservoir capacity. Modelled water table changes concur with measurements taken over a 4 year period. When net radiation, temperature and precipitation measurements are available the water balance can be projected to longer time periods. Over a 30 year interval (1965-1994) the water balance of the sedge fen showed the following. During the growing season, there was an increase in precipitation, no change in temperature and a decrease in net radiation, evapotranspiration and water deficit. There was also a decrease in winter snow depths. The fen was brought back to reservoir capacity during final snowmelt every year but one. Summer rainfall was the most important single factor affecting the water balance and the ratio actual/potential evaporation emerged as a linear function of rainfall amount. A 2 x CO2 climate warming scenario with an annual temperature increase of 4 degrees C and no precipitation change indicates lesser snow amounts and a shorter snow cover period. A greater summer water deficit, triggered mainly by greater evaporation during the month of May, is partially alleviated by lesser evaporation magnitudes in July. The greater water deficit would be counterbalanced by a 23% increase in summer rainfall. On average, the fen's water reservoir would still be recharged after winter snowmelt but the ground would remain at reservoir capacity for a shorter time. The warming scenario with a 10% decline in summer rainfall would create a large increase in the longevity and severity of the water deficit and this would be particularly evident during drier years. The carbon budget and peat accumulation and breakdown rates are strongly affected by changes in the water balance. Some evidence implies that greater water deficits lead to an increase in net carbon emissions. This implies that the sedge peatland could lose biomass under such conditions. An example is given where increased water deficit results in large decreases in local wetland streamflow.

AB Subfossil remains of various groups of organisms preserved in peat and sediment archives are commonly used to infer past environmental changes using transfer functions based on species composition. However, the changes in community structure can also be explored using the functional trait approach. Investigation of functional traits in palaeoecological records can inform about the mechanisms through which abiotic variables such as temperature or moisture impact communities. Moreover, changes in functional traits provide information about changes in ecosystem functioning and can potentially lead to the reconstruction of past processes at the ecosystem scale. Here, we use five key functional traits of arcellinid testate amoebae (TAs), a group of protozoa that are key actors in the microbial foodwebs in peatlands. We apply this approach to the subfossil TA Holocene record of four geographically independent peatlands from Alaska, Switzerland, Poland and Russia. We found that species with larger shells were frequently eliminated from the communities most likely as a result of a switch towards drier conditions. However, when conditions were wetter, species with large shells and species with small shells could coexist because they differed in their trophic niche (i.e. preys). Our results show direct but site-specific links between TA trait data and the depth to water table and pH data inferred from TA species composition. This suggests that past environmental changes influenced both species composition and community function in these ecosystems. Overall, this study demonstrates that species- and trait-based approaches yield complementary information on past environmental changes. For instance, while taxonomic approaches reveal the changes in community composition over time, investigation of traits informs both on the causes and the consequences of these changes on ecosystem functioning.

AB In Hokkaido, the northern part of Japan, degradation of natural wetland is occurring due to invasion of Sasa vegetation associated with construction of drainages. We measured greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes at the Sasa invaded wetland in Bibai, Hokkaido. GHG fluxes at Sphagnum-dominated site (Sp) and Sasa invasion site (Sa) were measured by using a closed chamber method (transparent acryl chamber which covering plants) from July to October 2002. GFIG concentration profiles, air filled porosity, and gas diffusion coefficient (D/D-0) of topsoil were also measured.
   Water table depth was not significantly different between the sites. Air-filled porosity was significantly lower in Sa than in Sp (p = 0.03). D/D-0 was also lower in Sa than in Sp. CH4 emissions (mg C m(-2) hr(-1)) were significantly lower in Sa (2.4 +/- 0.64) than in Sp (3.7 +/- 0.48) (p 0.03), although Sa showed a higher CH4 concentration gradient at ground surface than that of Sp. This might be due to poor gas exchange in Sa. CO2 emissions (mg C m(-2) hr-1) were found in Sa (13 +/- 15), while photosynthetic CO2 uptake were found in Sp (-89 +/- 7.0). This could be due to low ability Of CO2 fixation of Sasa vegetation, because CO2 emission from ground surface was probably lower in Sa than in Sp due to poor soil gas exchange in Sa. N2O fluxes (mg N m(-2) hr(-1)) were 0.010 +/- 0.007 in Sp and 0.00 1 +/- 0.002 in Sa. Therefore, there was no significant difference between the sites (p = 0.16). However, soil N2O concentrations in Sa decreased below the atmospheric N2O concentration, could be due to N2O dissolution into the soil water under poor soil gas exchange condition in Sa.

AB The Bezedna site represents a unique lake-mire complex in the Lublin chalkland, eastern Poland. This karst region contains Upper Cretaceous carbonate rocks under the influence of continental climate. Using sedimentologic, palaeobotanical, and fossil ostracode analyses as well as radiocarbon dating on cores, we were able: (1) to reconstruct the morphogenetic mechanisms related to lake formation, (2) to describe the main stages of lake evolution, and (3) to identify the environmental conditions during this evolution. The first stage was the formation of an accumulation basin in a periglacial setting related to permafrost thawing in the last phase of the Weichselian and at the beginning of the Holocene. During the second stage, in the successive phases of the Holocene, lake evolution was determined by climate changes and local conditions, and in the youngest Subatlantic period-also by human activity in several settlement phases. Natural water bodies in a karstic region create unique conditions for water circulation, especially for groundwater. During the change from the periglacial to temperate climate of the Holocene in the Lublin chalkland, the response of substratum (deeply frozen during the Weichselian) was influential in the development of surface water conditions in the study area. The strong fracturing of the Upper Cretaceous bedrock and general change of groundwater circulation associated with the activation of an ascending groundwater supply favored the intensive dissolution of carbonate and the progressive ground subsidence. Based on the reconstruction and correlation with paleoenvironmental investigations of the adjacent Volhynia chalkland, we were able to estimate and compare the influences of local (morphologic and geologic) conditions versus global climate changes on the paleoenvironmental record. Climate-driven lake-level fluctuations coincided over great areas of the Northern Hemisphere and are well reflected in changes of the Ostracoda fauna.

Drawdown of the water table ranged from 23 cm at 3 m to 6 cm at 60 m from the ditch and was similar on mineral and organic soils. The ditch significantly lowered the: water table up to a distance of 60 m where the water table was maintained below the 20 cm depth 25% more often than on the undrained control. Soil water content was reduced by drainage in the top 10 cm layer and rite depth of the aerobic layer increased by 6 to 9 cm. This significant improvement of the soil moisture regime in the seedling rooting zone was similar at 7 and 40 m from the ditch, indicating that a dense ditch network may not be necessary to enhance seedling growth.

AB The relative contributions to total actual evapotranspiration (AET) from pond and riparian areas in a pond-wetland complex in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP) of northern Alberta are measured using the Bowen ratio energy balance technique. Measurements show that a pond typical of the WBP evaporates at a rate more than twice that of the adjacent riparian peatland. Relating the actual to potential evapotranspiration over both surfaces yields Priestley-Taylor alpha coefficients of 0.69 and 1.11 for the peatland and pond respectively. Further results demonstrate that the sheltering and turbulent influences of the adjacent forested areas must be considered in the processes governing the permanence of WBP ponds. That is, forestry practices may inadvertently enhance the evaporative losses from the ponds, over and above the controls exerted by the regional climate. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Biodiversity of Central European semi-natural upland grasslands is steadily declining, due to either abandonment or management intensification. Although there are several descriptive overviews of their vegetation, quantitative information on the relationship between their species richness or composition and environmental factors is still scarce. We sampled upland grasslands in the southern part of the Czech Republic in order to determine the main soil variables affecting diversity of their vegetation. The relationships between species richness and environmental variables were tested using correlation analysis and regression trees, and the relationship between species composition and environment using detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Of soil variables, species richness of vascular plants was most strongly affected by phosphorus and, less so, by potassium and organic matter, with higher richness in habitats with less phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter. Grasslands on soils with pH < 4.6 were species-poor, but across the rest of the pH range richness was independent of pH. Most bryophyte species were present on low-pH soils poor in calcium and phosphorus and on organic soils. Red List species were best represented in fen meadows on organic soils with high calcium and low pH. Major determinants of floristic composition were soil moisture, nutrient availability, and soil pH. This study shows that conservation management of these grasslands should focus on reducing phosphorus input and protecting groundwater discharge areas from drainage.

AB Population size of habitat-specialized butterflies is limited in part by host plant distribution and abundance. Effective conservation for host-specialist species requires knowledge of host-plant habitat conditions and relationships with the specialist species. Clayton's copper butterfly (Lycaena dorcas claytoni) is a Maine state-endangered species that relies exclusively on shrubby cinquefoil (Dasiphora fruticosa) as its host. Dasiphora fruticosa occurs in 28 wetlands in Maine, ten of which are occupied by L. d. claytoni. Little is known about environmental conditions that support large, persistent stands of D. fruticosa in Maine. We evaluated the environment (hydrology, pore water and peat nutrients) associated with D. fruticosa distribution, age, and condition in Maine wetlands supporting robust stands of D. fruticosa to compare with L. d. claytoni occurrence. Although dominant water source in D. fruticosa-containing wetlands included both groundwater discharge and surface-flow, D. fruticosa coverage was greater in wetlands with consistent growing season water levels that dropped into or below the root zone by late season, and its distributions within wetlands reflected pore water hydrogen ion and conductivity gradients. Flooding magnitude and duration were greatest during the L.d. claytoni larval feeding period, whereas, mean depth to water table and upwelling increased and were most variable following the L. d. claytoni egg-laying period that precedes D. fruticosa senescence. Oldest sampled shrubs were 37 years, and older shrubs were larger and slower-growing. Encounter rates of L. d. claytoni were greater in wetlands with larger D. fruticosa plants of intermediate age and greater bloom density. Wetland management that combines conditions associated with D. fruticosa abundance (e.g., non-forested, seasonally consistent water levels with high conductivity) and L. d. claytoni occurrence (e.g., drawdown below the root zone following egg-laying, abundant blooms on intermediate-aged D. fruticosa, nearby D. fruticosa-containing wetlands) will aid L. d. claytoni conservation.

AB PurposeWetlands have a critical impact on the global carbon cycle. This study aims to investigate the spatial and vertical distribution of the soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc), to identify the differences of SOCc among swamps, marshes, bogs, and fens at a regional scale, and finally to examine the main environmental factors impacting SOCc at different depth intervals within different wetland types located in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM).Materials and methodsA total of 218 soil samples were collected. SOCc was determined by the combustion-oxidation method. To analyze the impacts of wetland type, soil type, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), evapotranspiration (ET), elevation (EL), and slope (SL) on SOCc, statistical analysis methods were executed, including ANOVA with the Duncan test, Pearson correlations analysis, and the stepwise multiple regressions analysis.Results and discussionThe mean values of SOCc in the 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100-cm intervals were 130.4, 64.2, and 32.6gkg(-1), respectively. The wetland type played an important role in the pattern of SOCc in terms of significant differences (p<0.05) among the different wetland types in the 0-60-cm depth. However, significant differences were not found among different soil types. In terms of the wetland type, the highest SOCc was found in bogs (p<0.05), probably due to the higher MAP and lower MAT. The increased MAP (R-2=0.1369, p<0.01) and decreased MAT (R-2=0.1225, p<0.01) had positive associations on the wetland SOCc. ET (R-2=0.2809, p<0.01), MAP (R-2=0.2025, p<0.01), and EL (R-2=0.0484, p<0.05) were positively correlated with marsh SOCc. Moreover, MAP was positively correlated with the bog SOCc (R-2=0.1296, p<0.01). For vertical patterns, SOCc was higher in the 0-30-cm interval and decreased with depth. The impacts of environmental factors on SOCc decreased with depth for each wetland type. Models were developed to document the relations between the SOCc of marshes and fens and corresponding environmental factors.ConclusionsWetland types largely differed in the soil carbon pools in the GKM of China. The relative importance of environmental factors was different for the SOCc values of various wetland types. To minimize carbon loss into the atmosphere, more protections are required for wetlands, especially in the 0-30-cm depth interval because it contains higher SOCc values and is more vulnerable and less stable than those in the deeper layers.

AB Prior research has demonstrated the importance of water limitations and increasing temperatures on upland black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) tree growth, which is a dominant component of the North American boreal forest. However, little work has been done to investigate the connectivity between growth and hydro-climate in peatland black spruce systems. The boreal forest is the largest global terrestrial biome and is highly threatened due to current and projected increases in temperatures for the northern latitudes. Here we explore the dynamics among annual black spruce growth, climate, and water table elevations using 45 years of in situ precipitation, temperature, and water table elevation coupled with dendrochronological analysis from six research peatlands at the Marcell Experimental Forest, MN, USA. From 1963 to 2010, we found weak relationships between water table elevation and black spruce growth at the six study sites. Instead, annual black spruce growth was most favourable during three climatic periods: (a) cool, moist conditions in mid-summer; (b) warm mid-spring temperatures; and (c) cool temperatures in the fall prior to the current growing season. The disconnect between black spruce growth and water table dynamics was surprising and suggests that either annual black spruce growth is minimally responsive to hydrological fluctuations at the timescale we analysed or there is great elasticity of black spruce growth to peatland water table and evapotranspiration dynamics under the range of hydrological fluctuations contained in our record.

AB Palynological, loss-on-ignition, and X-ray fluorescence data from a 525 m sediment core from a mangrove forest at the mouth of the Shark River Estuary in the southwestern Everglades National Park, Florida were used to reconstruct changes occurring in coastal wetlands since the mid-Holocene. This multi-proxy record contains the longest paleoecological history to date in the southwestern Everglades. The Shark River Estuary basin was formed similar to 5700 cal yr BP in response to increasing precipitation. Initial wetlands were frequently-burned short-hydroperiod prairies, which transitioned into long-hydroperiod prairies with sloughs in which peat deposits began to accumulate continuously about 5250 cal yr BP. Our data suggest that mangrove communities started to appear after similar to 3800 cal yr BP; declines in the abundance of charcoal suggested gradual replacement of fire-dominated wetlands by mangrove forest over the following 2650 yr. By similar to 1150 cal yr BP, a dense Rhizophora mangle dominated mangrove forest had formed at the mouth of the Shark River. The mangrove-dominated coastal ecosystem here was established at least 2000 yr later than has been previously estimated. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

AB Peatland testate amoebae (TA) are well-established bioindicators for depth to water table (DWT), but effects of hydrological changes on TA communities have never been tested experimentally. We tested this in a field experiment by placing Sphagnum carpets (15 cm diameter) collected in hummock, lawn and pool microsites (origin) at three local conditions (dry, moist and wet) using trenches dug in a peatland. One series of samples was seeded with microorganism extract from all microsites. TA community were analysed at T0: 8-2008, T1: 5-2009 and T2: 8-2009. We analysed the data using conditional inference trees, principal response curves (PRC) and DWT inferred from TA communities using a transfer function used for paleoecological reconstruction. Density declined from T0 to T1 and then increased sharply by T2. Species richness, Simpson diversity and Simpson evenness were lower at T2 than at T0 and T1. Seeded communities had higher species richness in pool samples at T0. Pool samples tended to have higher density, lower species richness, Simpson diversity and Simpson Evenness than hummock and/or lawn samples until T1. In the PRC, the effect of origin was significant at T0 and T1, but the effect faded away by T2. Seeding effect was strongest at T1 and lowest vanished by T2. Local condition effect was strong but not in line with the wetness gradient at T1 but started to reflect it by T2. Likewise, TA-inferred DWT started to match the experimental conditions by T2, but more so in hummock and lawn samples than in pool samples. This study confirmed that TA responds to hydrological changes over a 1-year period. However, sensitivity of TA to hydrological fluctuations, and thus the accuracy of inferred DWT changes, was habitat specific, pool TA communities being least responsive to environmental changes. Lawns and hummocks may be thus better suited than pools for paleoecological reconstructions. This, however, contrasts with the higher prediction error and species' tolerance for DWT with increasing dryness observed in transfer function models.

AB Question: What is the relative importance of environmental gradients and surface microtopography ( variation in vertical level within sampling units) for fine-scale plant species richness in Picea abies swamp forests?
   Location: 11 swamp forests in SE Norway.
   Methods: We recorded species richness ( number of species of vascular plants, mosses, Sphagnum and hepatics), depth to water table, soil base status and vertical range ( microtopographic relief) in 2400 microplots, (each 1/16 m(2)), in 150 1-m(2) plots in the 11 swamp forests. Relationships between species richness and environmental predictors were modelled by GLMM.
   Results: Moss and hepatic species richness increased with increasing microtopographic relief, most strongly for wet acid sites, in which similar trends were also found for Sphagnum. Relief was a poor predictor of vascular plant species richness.
   Conclusions: Microtopographic relief is a good predictor of local species richness in Picea abies swamp forests, partly because larger vertical variability means higher within-plot habitat diversity with respect to the wet-dry gradient, and partly because qualitatively new microhabitats associated with steep slopes are added in drier sites. The relationship between species richness and microtopographic relief is context dependent, differing in complex ways among species groups and among sites with different environmental conditions.

AB Reclamation of the boreal landscape, including both wetlands and uplands integrated into complex watersheds, has presented a challenge over the past decade with few attempts. Relevant today is wetland/peatland reclamation on reclaimed landscapes positioned on saline sand deposits left on In-pits' from open pit oil sands mining. Part of the reclamation challenge lies in choosing characteristic species that are tolerant of conditions present on the reclaimed landscape. Species need to both survive harsh environmental conditions and facilitate succession from mineral-based wetlands (marshes) to peat-based ones (fens). A two-by-six factorial experiment was implemented in a greenhouse under two moisture levels: saturation to 2.5 cm below the soil level (high) and saturation to 7.5 cm below the soil level (low) and six salinity treatments: 5 mg L-1 Na+, 400 mg L-1 Na+, 850 mg L-1 Na+, 1250 mg L-1 Na+, 1850 mg L-1 Na+, and 2700 mg L-1 Na+. Water level affected total biomass, with the low water level producing higher biomass. Sodium concentration affected biomass, root:shoot ratio, stomatal conductance, evapotranspiration, and photosynthetic rate; all responses were similar for the lower Na concentrations and declined after the 850 mg L-1 treatment. We conclude that B. syzigachne tolerates Na levels of 850 mg L-1 and survives with diminished performance at treatment of 850 mg L-1 up to 2700 mg L-1. With these salinity responses, along with broad tolerance to water levels, B. syzigachne has great potential as an early colonizing annual species for conditions predicted to occur in many of the in-pit reclamation designs.

AB Critical load calculations have suggested that groundwater at depth of 2m in Sweden is very sensitive to acid load. As environmental isotope studies have shown that most of the runoff in streams has passed through the soil, there is a risk in the near future of accelerated acidification of surface waters.
   To assess the importance of the last soil horizon of contact before discharge, the upper 0-0.2m of soils in seven discharge zones were analysed for pools of base cations, acidity and base saturation. The sites were about 3-4m(2) in size and selected from two catchments exposed to different revels of acid deposition.
   The soils in the seven sites had high concentrations of exchangeable base cations and consequently high base saturation. The high correlation (r(2) = 0.74) between base saturation in the soils of the discharge zones and mean pH of the runoff waters suggested that the discharge zone is important for surface water acidification. The high pool of exchangeable base cations will buffer initially against the acid load. As the cation exchange capacity (meq dm(-3)) and base saturation were lower in the sites from the catchment receiving lower deposition, these streams may be more vulnerable to acidification in the near future. The high concentration of base cations in non-exchangeable fractions may also buffer against acidification as it is likely that some of these pools will become exchangeable with time.

AB Natural Boreal saline fens provide analogues for reclaimed wetland systems constructed with sodium-rich tailings materials. These natural analogues can improve our understanding of vegetative controls on dominant ecohydrological processes (i.e. evapotranspiration (ET)) in constructed landscapes. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize ET within a natural boreal saline fen over a growing season to determine the primary hydro-climatic controls using community-scale ET measurements targeting dominant vegetation communities within different microforms along with environmental controls. ET rates were highest during periods of peak vegetation growth and temperatures between June and August, with rates decreasing slightly in July. Vegetation species' physiology was the dominant variable governing ET. The more salt tolerant species maintained higher ET rates despite the lower leaf area index and water table levels found within these species. The lower ET rates measured in July can be attributed to high water tables from above average precipitation causing soil inundation and salt stress, increasing stomatal closure. However, community plots containing Triglochin maritima maintained transpiration rates under the coupled stress conditions. Therefore, this is a potentially important species for use in boreal reclamation planting schemes. Last, the findings emphasize that the dominant vegetation selected for reclamation projects must coincide with the materials used (peat and subsurface materials), as results within this study demonstrate that some native boreal fen species (Calamagrostis inexpansa, Hordeum jubatum, and Juncus balticus) were unable to maintain transpiration rates during flood and saline conditions that can occur within the mining area of this region.

DT Article
DE Wetlands; Mining; Groundwater modeling; Groundwater management; Estonia
AB The water balance of wetlands plays an integral role in their function. Developments adjacent to wetlands can affect their water balance through impacts on groundwater flow and increased discharge in the area, and they can cause lowering of the wetland water table. A 430 km(2) area was selected for groundwater modelling to asses the effect of underground mining on the water balance of wetlands in north-eastern Estonia. A nature conservation area (encompassing Selisoo bog) is within 3 km of an underground oil-shale mine. Two future mining scenarios with different areal extents of mining were modeled and compared to the present situation. Results show that the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface is of critical importance to potential wetland dewatering as a result of mining. Significant impact on the Selisoo bog water balance will be caused by the approaching mine but there will be only minor additional impacts from mining directly below the bog. The major impact will arise before that stage, when the underground mine extension reaches the border of the nature conservation area; since the restriction of activities in this area relates to the ground surface, the conservation area's border is not sufficiently protective in relation to underground development.

AB High Arctic wetlands, though limited in occurrence, are an important ecological niche, providing the major vegetated areas in an and and cold polar desert environment. These wetlands are often found as patches in the barren landscape. At a few locales which may be ice-wedge polygonal grounds, glacial terrain and zones of recent coastal uplift, wetland occurrence can become extensive, forming a mosaic that comprises patches of different wetland types. Reliable water supply during the thawed season is a deciding factor in wetland sustainability. The sources include meltwater from late-lying snowbanks, localized ground water discharge, streamflow, inundation by lakes and the sea, and for some ice-wedge wetlands, ground-ice melt. Different types of wetlands have their own characteristics, and peat accumulation or diatom depositions are common. The peat cover insulates the wetland from summer heating and encourages permafrost aggradation, with the feedback that a shallow frost table reduces the moisture storage capacity in a thinly thawed layer, which becomes easily saturated. All the wetlands studied have high calcium content since they are formed on carbonate terrain. Coastal wetlands have high salt concentration while snowmelt and ground-ice melt provides dilution. The sustainability of High Arctic wetlands is predicated upon water supply exceeding the losses to evaporation and lateral drainage. Disturbances due to natural causes such as climatic variations, geomorphic changes, or human-induced drainage, can reduce inundation opportunities or increase outflow. Then, the water table drops, the vegetation changes and the peat degrades, leading to the detriment of the wetlands. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We quantified the response of peatland water table level (WTL) and energy fluxes to harvesting of a drained peatland forest. Two alternative harvests (clear-cut and partial harvest) were carried out in a mixed-species ditch-drained peatland forest in southern Finland, where water and energy balance components were monitored for six pre-treatment and three post-treatment growing seasons. To explore the responses caused by harvestings, we applied a mechanistic multi-layer soil-plant-atmosphere transfer model. At the clear-cut site, the mean growing season WTL rose by 0.18 +/- 0.02 m (error estimate based on measurement uncertainty), while net radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes decreased after harvest. On the contrary, we observed only minor changes in energy fluxes and mean WTL (0.05 +/- 0.03 m increase) at the partial harvest site, although as much as 70% of the stand basal area was removed and leaf-area index was reduced to half. The small changes were mainly explained by increased water use of spruce undergrowth and field layer vegetation, as well as increased forest floor evaporation. The rapid establishment of field layer vegetation had a significant role in energy balance recovery at the clear-cut site. At partial harvest, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and model-data comparison suggested the shade-adapted spruce undergrowth was suffering from light stress during the first post-harvest growing season. We conclude that in addition to stand basal area, species composition and stand structure need to be considered when controlling WTL in peatland forests with partial harvesting. Our results have important implications on the operational use of continuous cover forestry on drained peatlands. A continuously maintained tree cover with significant evapotranspiration capacity could enable optimizing WTL from both tree growth and environmental perspectives.

AB Here we present results from a field experiment in a sub-arctic wetland near Abisko, northern Sweden, where the permafrost is currently disintegrating with significant vegetation changes as a result. During one growing season we investigated the fluxes of CO(2) and CH(4) and how they were affected by ecosystem properties, i.e., composition of species that are currently expanding in the area (Carex rotundata, Eriophorum vaginatum and Eriophorum angustifolium), dissolved CH(4) in the pore water, substrate availability for methane producing bacteria, water table depth, active layer, temperature, etc. We found that the measured gas fluxes over the season ranged between: CH(4) 0.2 and 36.1 mg CH(4) m(-2) h(-1), Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) -1000 and 1250 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1) (negative values meaning a sink of atmospheric CO(2)) and dark respiration 110 and 1700 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1). We found that NEE, photosynthetic rate and CH(4) emission were affected by the species composition. Multiple stepwise regressions indicated that the primary explanatory variables for NEE was photosynthetic rate and for respiration and photosynthesis biomass of green leaves. The primary explanatory variables for CH(4) emissions were depth of the water table, concentration of organic acid carbon and biomass of green leaves. The negative correlations between pore water concentration and emission of CH(4) and the concentrations of organic acid, amino acid and carbohydrate carbon indicated that these compounds or their fermentation by-products were substrates for CH(4) formation. Furthermore, calculation of the radiative forcing of the species expanding in the area as a direct result of permafrost degradation and a change in hydrology indicate that the studied mire may act as an increasing source of radiative forcing in future.

AB A field-scale pulse-injection experiment with the herbicide Isoproturon was conducted in a Danish riparian wetland. A non-reactive tracer (bromide) experiment was also carried out to characterize the physical transport system. Groundwater flow and reactive transport modelling was used to simulate flow paths, residence times, as well as bromide and Isoproturon distributions. The wetland can be characterized by two distinct riparian flow paths; one flow path discharges 2/3 of the incoming groundwater directly to the free water surface of the wetland near the foot of the hillslope with an average residence time of 205 days, and another flow path diffusively discharging the remaining 1/3 of the incoming groundwater to the stream with an average residence time of 425 days. The reactive transport simulations reveal that Isoproturon is retarded by a factor of 2-4, which is explained by the high organic content in the peat layer of the wetland. Isoproturon was found to be aerobically degraded with a half-life in the order of 1280 days. Based on the quantification of flow paths, residence times and half-lives it is estimated that about 2/3 of the injected Isoproturon is removed in the wetland. Thus, close to 1/3 may find its way to the stream through overland flow. It is also possible that high concentrations of metabolites will reach the stream. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Boreal wetland carbon cycling is vulnerable to climate change in part because hydrology and the extent of frozen ground have strong influences on plant and microbial functions. We examined the response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) across an experimental manipulation of water table position (both raised and lowered water table treatments) in a boreal-rich fen in interior Alaska. DOC and TDN responses to water table manipulation exhibited an interaction with seasonal ice dynamics. We observed consistently higher DOC and TDN concentrations in the lowered water table treatment (71.7 +/- 6.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg(-L)) than in both the control (55.6 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg(-L)) and raised (49.1 +/- 4.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg L-1, respectively) water table treatments. Across all plots, pore water DOC concentrations at 20 cm increased as the depth to water table increased (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). DOC concentrations also increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased, with solutes increasing most rapidly in the drained plot (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). About half of the TDN pool was composed of dissolved organic N (DON). Inorganic N and DON were both highly correlated with changes in DOC, and their respective constraints to mineralization are discussed. These results demonstrate that a declining water table position and dryer conditions affect thaw depth and peat temperatures, and interactions among these ecosystem properties will likely increase DOC and TDN loading and potential for export in these systems.

AB Testosterone is constantly excreted into the environment by both human and animal sources but little is known about how it is transported in the environment. In this study, testosterone was measured in 15 sites in the Upper Jordan Valley after major rain events (238 samplings) for two consecutive rain seasons. The area consists of small farms, cattle pasture, fish ponds with some urban development. One liter samples were extracted on solid phase columns and the eluates measured using specific radioimmunoassay for testosterone and estrogen (estradiol+estrone). The first rain season was the first above average season after a 3-year period of well below average rainfall. It was found in the rain season of 2001/2002, that following a rain sequence of 131 mm/week there was an initial large increase in the concentration of testosterone (maximum 6 ng/l) accompanied by high estrogen (maximum 6 ng/l), which then gradually declined to non-detectable levels (<0.3 ng/l) over a period of 3 months. These peaks originated from runoff from cattle pasture and fish pond effluent. Later peaks consisted only of testosterone that was moderately associated with sulfate (r(2)=0.53, P<0.05) and somewhat associated with total phosphorus (r(2)=0.49, P<0.1) indicating that the origin was leaching from the sulfurous peat soil. In the following rainy season, which had recorded rainfalls, no testosterone peaks above I ng/l were seen. We conclude that the testosterone accumulated in the Upper Jordan Valley was washed out in two stages, first as surface runoff from cattle pasture and then as discharge from the soil.

AB The sulphur content of coal is an important consideration when developing reserves for exploitation, driven by emission limits from power stations becoming more stringent. Variations in the sulphur content of Westphalian A and B coals from the predominantly freshwater Northumberland Coalfield, Northeast England, were studied according to their regional, stratigraphic and in-seam location. The observed variation in sulphur content spatially increases towards the source area away from more marine influenced areas, with increased sulphur content through time linked to changes in the general depositional environment as conditions became more marine-influenced. A model of basinal surface water and groundwater flow driven by post-depositional source area tectonism is thought to have played only a minor role in contributing secondary sulphur to the coal. However, the isotopic composition of coal pyrite shows a similar rang. e in composition to that of pyrite and other sulphides from the North Pennine Orefield along the southern margin of the coalfield, suggesting an additional potential source of secondary sulphur, as sulphur-rich fluids were expelled northwards through the coal measures during early Permian Variscan transpression from the south. The Westphalian A and B are interpreted as third-order depositional sequences, defined by third-order maximum flooding surfaces. Each sequence is made up of several coal-bearing fourth-order parasequences, which tend to be more brackish to marine in character, on either side of the third-order maximum flooding surfaces when base level was relatively high. The lowest sulphur coals are confined to the lower to middle, relative low stand part of the Westphalian A third-order base level curve and the lowest part of the Westphalian B third-order base level curve. This difference is attributed to a more rapid rise of base level in the Westphalian B. The stratigraphic and spatial distribution of coal sulphur has been used as a guide to prediction of reserve identification for surface mining operations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geochemical studies of pore water and groundwater in sulphide-bearing tailings have been performed at the Laver mine in northern Sweden. Pore water has been sampled from just above the groundwater table down to the peat and till underlying the tailings. Groundwater has been sampled weekly from April to November in pipes installed at various depths in the tailings. All samples were analysed for major and trace elements by using ICP-AES and ICP-MS When the oxidation front in the tailings is moving downwards, metals released by weathering in this low-pH environment are to a large extent retained secondarily in the tailings below the oxidation front and do not reach the groundwater, except in areas where the oxidation front is situated close to the groundwater table. Vertical flow of precipitation water contaminated with metals released by sulphide oxidation is, thus, not the major explanation for groundwater contamination. Instead, contamination occurs when the advancing oxidation front pushes the secondary enrichments of metals ahead to meet the groundwater table and the met, als are released to the groundwater. The release of metals is caused by desorption due to the low pH in this environment. Areas of the tailings deposit with shallow groundwater table are at present the main sources of metal release. There is a seasonal variation in the composition of groundwater, particularly shallow groundwater. This is caused by changing levels of the groundwater table. Rising groundwater table results in outflush of metals in areas where the groundwater reaches secondarily retained metals. A steady trend with rising groundwater table after snowmelt results in a larger proportion of contaminated water in shallow groundwater, which decreases during the autumn. Concentration peaks of Cu and other metals in shallow groundwater may be the result of small, rapid rises of the groundwater table due to strong precipitation, superimposed on the general seasonal trend.

AB Aquatic and semiaquatic turtles use wetlands and thermally buffered soils to thermoregulate during the active season and to sustain body temperatures above freezing during overwintering. We deployed temperature data loggers during wintertime and summertime in wetlands occupied by Bog Turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) in southwestern Virginia, United States, to contrast the temperatures of the wetland environment to turtle carapace temperatures over two field seasons. Temperature signatures were used to evaluate probable hibernation depth and the timing and cues of spring emergence. We measured soil temperature profiles during winter in saturated hibernacula and similar but unsaturated structures to evaluate the dependence of temperature on water-table depth. Mean daily turtle temperature (n = 16) during the coldest portion of two winters was 2.5 degrees C (SE = 0.29), with one turtle experiencing 14 continuous days at temperatures between -1 degrees C and 0 degrees C when ambient temperatures dipped below -10 degrees C. Water tables remained within 15 cm below the soil surface throughout both winters, preventing freezing temperatures for shallow-hibernating turtles. The date of first emergence differed by 15 d between the two study years, with both soil temperature and ambient temperature potentially serving as emergence cues. During summer activity, turtles alternated between periods of thermoregulation and thermoconformity by basking and accessing deep, thermally buffered saturated soil. The dependence of Bog Turtle body temperature on soil saturation and depth is important for understanding how hydrologic alteration in wetlands can affect Bog Turtle ecology.

AB The Alberta Wetland Inventory (AWI), which is used in a variety of applications across the province to estimate wetland cover from aerial photographs, detected only 34% of confirmed wetland field plots in boreal forest watersheds in the Swan Hills of Alberta. Given the association between wetland cover and runoff and surface water chemistry in western Canadian boreal forest (Boreal Plain) watersheds, accurate quantification of wetland cover is critical to efforts to model hydrologic processes and water quality. Therefore, as a component of the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) Project, the Wetland Inventory and Identification Tool (WIIT) was developed and successfully detected 81% of the wetland field plots. Application of both models across a variety of landscapes in the boreal forest of Alberta demonstrated that wetland cover estimates were 1.5 times higher with the new WIIT model than with AWI. Also, WIIT identified polygons that were both smaller and contained taller trees than those identified by AWI, indicating that this computer model may be more effective than wetland identification methods that use only aerial photography. Results of this study show that careful interpretation of aerial photographs at the 1:15,000 scale, coupled with ground truthing and computer models, can provide an accurate means of identifying wetlands on Boreal Plain landscapes.

AB PALADYN is presented; it is a new comprehensive and computationally efficient land surface-vegetation-carbon cycle model designed to be used in Earth system models of intermediate complexity for long-term simulations and paleoclimate studies.
   The model treats in a consistent manner the interaction between atmosphere, terrestrial vegetation and soil through the fluxes of energy, water and carbon. Energy, water and carbon are conserved. PALADYN explicitly treats permafrost, both in physical processes and as an important carbon pool. It distinguishes nine surface types: five different vegetation types, bare soil, land ice, lake and ocean shelf. Including the ocean shelf allows the treatment of continuous changes in sea level and shelf area associated with glacial cycles. Over each surface type, the model solves the surface energy balance and computes the fluxes of sensible, latent and ground heat and upward shortwave and longwave radiation. The model includes a single snow layer.
   Vegetation and bare soil share a single soil column. The soil is vertically discretized into five layers where prognostic equations for temperature, water and carbon are consistently solved. Phase changes of water in the soil are explicitly considered. A surface hydrology module computes precipitation interception by vegetation, surface runoff and soil infiltration. The soil water equation is based on Darcy's law. Given soil water content, the wetland fraction is computed based on a topographic index. The temperature profile is also computed in the upper part of ice sheets and in the ocean shelf soil.
   Photosynthesis is computed using a light use efficiency model. Carbon assimilation by vegetation is coupled to the transpiration of water through stomatal conductance. PALADYN includes a dynamic vegetation module with five plant functional types competing for the grid cell share with their respective net primary productivity.
   PALADYN distinguishes between mineral soil carbon, peat carbon, buried carbon and shelf carbon. Each soil carbon type has its own soil carbon pools generally represented by a litter, a fast and a slow carbon pool in each soil layer. Carbon can be redistributed between the layers by vertical diffusion and advection. For the vegetated macro surface type, decomposition is a function of soil temperature and soil moisture. Carbon in permanently frozen layers is assigned a long turnover time which effectively locks carbon in permafrost. Carbon buried below ice sheets and on flooded ocean shelves is treated differently. The model also includes a dynamic peat module.
   PALADYN includes carbon isotopes C-13 and C-14, which are tracked through all carbon pools. Isotopic discrimination is modelled only during photosynthesis.
   A simple methane module is implemented to represent methane emissions from anaerobic carbon decomposition in wetlands (including peatlands) and flooded ocean shelf.
   The model description is accompanied by a thorough model evaluation in offline mode for the present day and the historical period.

AB Data from four components of the radiation balance were used to investigate the surface energy budgets for a Carex lasiocarpa mire in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, and the controlling factors of the evapotranspiration (ET) were discussed in detail. During the growing season 2006, the shortwave radiation (SWa dagger") reaching the mire surface added up to 2,854.3 MJ m(-2) and the net radiation (Rn) was 1,637.4 MJ m(-2) in total, with an average of 9.86 MJ m(-2) day(-1). G was the smallest flux at the water-atmosphere interface, with an average of about 0.91 MJ m(-2) day(-1), but showed high relative variability, even changing its sign. The latent and sensible heat fluxes (LE and H) amounted to 787.48 and 476.26 MJ m(-2), respectively, and the total sum of LE and H accounted for 77.18% of Rn. By conversion from LE, the average value of ET from the mire was 1.84 mm day(-1), amounting to 298.8 mm. The total ET was almost 60% of the total rainfall in the same period, proving that ET is the primary water consumer in the mire. The growth of C. lasiocarpa was related closely with surface resistance (r (s)), and analysis of partial correlation indicated that r (s) correlated negatively with leaf area index (LAI) when the interference of the available energy, Rn-G, was removed. There was a strong linkage between r (s) and the evaporative fraction [LE/(LE + H)] as well as Bowen ratio (beta). r (s) was the key factor in controlling the variation of ET and regulating energy partitioning between LE and H. During the whole growing season, r (s) and R (n)-G were the two main factors coupled in ET processes. In spring, r (s) dominated ET processes, and the increase in LAI led to a decrease in r (s), which in turn accelerated ET as vegetation developed until late August. After August, the available energy controlled the process of ET completely until ET reached an equilibrium in mid-October.

AB Ecosystems within the subhumid Boreal Plains of Northern Alberta host ecologically and commercially significant habitat and natural resources. However, these ecosystems exist under a delicate hydrologic balance that may be upset as the climate warms by 2 to 5 degrees C over the next century. In this study, numerical simulations were used to predict climate change impacts at a catchment composed of a mosaic of Boreal Plains ecosystems including a small pond, peatlands with sparse black spruce, and hillslopes with predominantly aspen forests. Simulations were conducted with a fully integrated groundwater-surface water code using a 2-D model previously calibrated to a decade of hydrologic data that included a range in climatic conditions. Projections from 13 climate change scenarios were simulated from 2011 to 2090 and compared to a base case scenario that assumed no climate change. Results indicate peatland water levels may decline by up to 1 m; however, sensitivity simulations indicate that the decline in water levels may be moderated by several feedback mechanisms that restrict evaporative losses and moderate water level changes. In contrast, higher evapotranspiration losses from the aspen hillslopes are predicted to result in near-surface soils becoming increasingly drier. Thus, the aspen may frequently be water stressed and increasingly susceptible to secondary maladies such as pests and disease. Reduced pond water levels are also predicted with the development of frequent ephemeral conditions in warmer and drier scenarios. Concurrent decreases in stream flow may further impact downstream ecosystems. Further research into the regional health and sustainability of Boreal Plains ecosystems is warranted and could benefit from the development of improved numerical tools capable of extending the processes considered.

AB The failure of managed wetlands to provide a broad suite of ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage, wildlife habitat, ground-water recharge, storm-water retention) valuable to society is primarily the result of a lack of consideration of ecosystem processes that maintain productive wetland ecosystems or physical and social forces that restrict a manager's ability to apply actions that allow those processes to occur. Therefore, we outline a course of action that considers restoration of ecosystem processes in those systems where off-site land use or physical alterations restrict local management. Upon considering a wetland system, or examining a particular management regime, there are several factors that will allow successful restoration of wetland services. An initial step is examination of the political/social factors that have structured the current ecological condition and whether those realities can be addressed. Most successful restorations of wetland ecosystem services involve cooperation among multiple agencies, acquisition of funds from non-traditional sources, seeking of scientific advice on ecosystem processes, and cultivation of good working relationships among biologists, managers, and maintenance staff. Beyond that, in on-site wetland situations, management should examine the existing hydrogeomorphic situation and processes (e.g., climatic variation, tides, riverine flood-pulse events) responsible for maintenance of ecosystem services within a given temporal framework appropriate for that wetland's hydrological pattern. We discuss these processes for five major wetland types (depressional, lacustrine, estuarine, riverine, and man-made impoundments) and then provide two case histories in which this approach was applied: Seney National Wildlife Refuge with a restored fen system and Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge where riverine processes have been stimulated to restore native habitat. With adequate partnerships and administrative and political support, managers faced with degraded and/or disconnected wetland processes will be able to restore ecosystem services for society in our highly altered landscape by considering wetlands in their given hydrogeomorphic setting and temporal stage.

AB In contrast to previous peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) model sensitivity analyses, which usually focussed on only one or a few processes, this study investigates interactions between various biotic and abiotic processes and their parameters by comparing CoupModel v5 results with multiple observation variables.
   Many interactions were found not only within but also between various process categories simulating plant growth, decomposition, radiation interception, soil temperature, aerodynamic resistance, transpiration, soil hydrology and snow. Each measurement variable was sensitive to up to 10 (out of 54) parameters, from up to 7 different process categories. The constrained parameter ranges varied, depending on the variable and performance index chosen as criteria, and on other calibrated parameters (equifinalities).
   Therefore, transferring parameter ranges between models needs to be done with caution, especially if such ranges were achieved by only considering a few processes. The identified interactions and constrained parameters will be of great interest to use for comparisons with model results and data from similar ecosystems. All of the available measurement variables (net ecosystem exchange, leaf area index, sensible and latent heat fluxes, net radiation, soil temperatures, water table depth and snow depth) improved the model constraint. If hydraulic properties or water content were measured, further parameters could be constrained, resolving several equifinalities and reducing model uncertainty. The presented results highlight the importance of considering biotic and abiotic processes together and can help modellers and experimentalists to design and calibrate models as well as to direct experimental set-ups in peatland ecosystems towards modelling needs.

AB Lithalsas are permafrost mounds formed by ice segregation in mineral-rich soil that occur within the zone of discontinuous permafrost. Nearly 1800 lithalsas were mapped using archival aerial photographs within the Great Slave Lowland, Northwest Territories, Canada. These are up to 8 m high and several hundred meters in length and width. One lithalsa, examined by electrical resistivity and boreholes, rises 4 to 6 m above an adjacent peatland, shows clear evidence of ice-segregation at depth and ground heave of between 2.5 and 4.0 m, and is estimated to have formed within the past 700 years. Regionally, lithalsas are typically located adjacent to ponds and streams with mature forms vegetated by deciduous (birch) forest or mixed (birch and spruce) forest with a herb-shrub understory and include circular, crescentic and linear forms. They are abundant within the Lowland region, which contains widespread glaciolacustrine, lacustrine and alluvial fine-grained sediments. The lithalsas are most common within the first few tens of meters above the present level of Great Slave Lake, indicating that many are late Holocene, and some less than 1000 years, in age. A comparison with lithalsas in contemporary environments reveals that comparatively warm but extensive discontinuous permafrost, fine-grained sediments (alluvial, lacustrine, marine or glaciomarine), and available groundwater supply provide the climatic and hydro-geological parameters for the development of lithalsas in permafrost terrain. The identification of lithalsas in this region is important given their sensitivity to climate change and potential hazards to northern infrastructure upon thawing.

AB Physiochemical controls on the carbonate geochemistry of large river systems are important regulators of carbon exchange between terrestrial and marine reservoirs on human time scales. Although many studies have focused on large-scale river carbon fluxes, there are few investigations of mechanistic aspects of carbonate mass balance and transport at the catchment scale. We determined elemental and carbonate geochemistry and mass balances for net carbonate dissolution fluxes from the forested, mid-latitude Huron River watershed, established on carbonate-rich unconfined glacial drift aquifers. Shallow groundwaters are near equilibrium with respect to calcite at pCO(2) values up to 25 times atmospheric values. Surface waters are largely groundwater fed and exhibit chemical evolution due to CO2 degassing, carbonate precipitation in lakes and wetlands, and anthropogenic introduction of road salts (NaCl and CaCl2). Because the source groundwater Mg2+/HCO3- ratio is fairly constant, this parameter permits mass balances to be made between carbonate dissolution and back precipitation after groundwater discharge. Typically, precipitation does not occur until IAP/K calcite values exceed 10 times supersaturation. Stream chemistry changes little thereafter even though streams remain highly supersaturated for calcite. Our data taken together with historical United States Geological Survey (USGS) data show that alkalinity losses to carbonate precipitation are most significant during periods of lowest discharge. Thus, on an annual basis, the large carbon flux from carbonate dissolution in soil zones is only decreased by a relatively small amount by the back precipitation of calcium carbonate.

AB For soils with shallow groundwater and high organic carbon content, water table depth (WTD) is a key parameter to describe their hydrologic state and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Since the microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 satellite data might support the monitoring of these climate-relevant soils at high spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) by detecting spatial and temporal changes in local field and water management. Despite the low penetration depth of the C-band, sigma(0) is influenced by shallow WTD fluctuations via the soil hydraulic connection between the water table and surface soil. Here, we analyzed sigma(0) at 60 monitoring wells in a drained temperate peatland with degraded organic soils used as extensive grassland. We evaluated temporal Spearman correlation coefficients between sigma(0) and WTD considering the soil and vegetation information. To account for the effects of seasonal vegetation changes, we used the cross-over (incidence) angle method. Climatologies of the slope of the incidence angle dependency derived from two years of Sentinel-1 data and their application to the cross-over angle method did improve correlations, though the effect was minor. Overall, averaged over all sites, a temporal Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.45 (+/- 0.17) was obtained. The loss of correlation during summer (higher vegetation, deeper WTD) and the effects of cuts and grazing are discussed. The site-specific general wetness level, described by the mean WTD of each site was shown to be a major factor controlling the strength of the correlation. Mean WTD deeper than about -0.60 m lowered the correlations across sites, which might indicate an important limit of the application.

AB Although there have been recent significant gains in our understanding of mercury (Hg) cycling in aquatic environments, few studies have addressed Hg cycling on a watershed scale. In particular, attention to Hg species transfer between watershed components (upland soils, groundwater, wetlands, streams, and lakes) has been lacking. This study describes spatial and temporal distributions of total Hg and MeHg among watershed components of the Allequash Creek watershed (northern Wisconsin, USA). Substantial increases in total Hg and MeHg were observed as groundwater discharged through peat to form springs that flow into the stream, or rivulets that drain across the surface of the wetland. This increase was concomitant with increases in DOC. During fall, when the Allequash Creek wetland released a substantial amount of DOC to the stream, a 2-3 fold increase in total Hg concentrations was observed along the entire length of the stream. Methylmercury, however, did not show a similar response. Substantial variability was observed in total Hg (0.9 to 6.3) and MeHg (<0.02 to 0.33) concentrations during synoptic surveys of the entire creek. For the Allequash Creek watershed, the contributing groundwater basin is about 50% larger than the topographic drainage basin. Total Hg concentrations in groundwater, the area of the groundwater basin, and annual stream flow data give a watershed-yield rate of 1.2 mg/km(2)/d, which equates to a retention rate of 96%. The calculated MeHg yield rate for the wetland area is 0.6 to 1.5 mg/km(2)/d, a value that is 3-6 fold greater than the atmospheric deposition rate.

AB Extreme climate events are increasing in frequency and duration and may directly impact belowground foodwebs and the activities of component soil organisms. The soil invertebrate community, which includes keystone decomposers, might respond to these newly induced soil microclimate conditions by shifts in density, species composition, spatial patterning and/or functional traits.
   To test if and how short-term extreme climatic conditions alter the structure, the vertical stratification and the community weighted trait means of the springtail (Collembola) community in sub-arctic peatbogs, we experimentally subjected Sphagnum peat cores in a field setting to factorial treatments of elevated temperature and episodically increased moisture content.
   The large precipitation peaks did not affect the springtail community, but an average soil temperature increase of 4 degrees C halved its density in the shallower peat layers, mainly caused by the reduced dominance of Folsomia quadrioculata. A hypothesized net downward shift of the surface-dwelling springtail community, however, was not observed. We observed species-specific responses to warming but the overall community composition in subsequent organic layers was not significantly altered. Although the effects of an extreme warming event on density, species composition and vertical stratification pattern seemed subtle, functional trait analysis revealed directional community responses, i.e. an overall increase of soil-dwelling species due to warming, even though warming did not alter layer-specific community weighted trait means.
   We suggest that subtle changes in moisture conditions, due to increased evapotranspiration, have decreased typically surface-dwelling species relative to soil-dwelling species. The extent to which this directional change in the community is maintained after an extreme event, and its costs for the community's resilience to multiple sequential extreme events will consequently determine its longer-term effects on the community and on ecosystem functioning.

AB Proxy reconstructions of climatic parameters developed using transfer functions are central to the testing of many palaeoclimatic hypotheses on Holocene timescales. However, recent work shows that the mathematical models underpinning many existing transfer functions are susceptible to spatial autocorrelation, clustered training set design and the uneven sampling of environmental gradients. This may result in over-optimistic performance statistics or, in extreme cases, a lack of predictive power. A new testate amoeba-based transfer function is presented that fully incorporates the new recommended statistical tests to address these issues. Leave-one-out cross-validation, the most commonly applied method in recent studies to assess model performance, produced over-optimistic performance statistics for all models tested. However, the preferred model, developed using weighted averaging with tolerance downweighting, retained a predictive capacity equivalent to other published models even when less optimistic performance statistics were chosen. Application of the new statistical tests in the development of transfer functions provides a more thorough assessment of performance and greater confidence in reconstructions based on them. Only when the wider research community have sufficient confidence in transfer function-based proxy reconstructions will they be commonly used in data comparison and palaeoclimate modelling studies of broader scientific relevance.

AB Two cores from calcite rafts deposits located in Cenote Ich Balam and Hoyo Negro were dated and analyzed for Sr-87/Sr-86, delta O-18, delta C-13, Sr/Ca and Cl/Ca. The geochemical records show changing aquifer salinity spanning the last similar to 8.5 cal kyrs BP and interrelationships with Holocene climate trends (wet and dry periods). During the wet mid-Holocene, the salinity of the meteoric Water Mass (WM; at 7.8-8.3 cal kyrs BP) was relatively high at 1.5-2.7 ppt and then became less saline (1.0-1.5 ppt) during the last similar to 7000 yrs as climate became progressively drier. High salinity of the meteoric WM during the wet mid-Holocene is attributed to increased turbulent mixing between the meteoric and underlying marine WM. Increased precipitation, in terms of amount, frequency, and intensity (e.g. hurricanes) causes higher flow of meteoric water towards the coast and mixing at the halocline, a phenomenon recorded with recent instrumental monitoring of the aquifer. Conversely, during dry periods reduced precipitation and flow in the meteoric WM would result in lower salinity. Karst properties and Holocene sea-level rise also seem to have an effect on the aquifer. When the regionally extensive network of shallow cave passages (similar to 10-12 m water depth) are flooded at similar to 8000 cal yrs BP, there is a rapid shift in salinity. This study demonstrates that calcite raft deposits can be used as paleo-environmental recorders documenting the effects of sea level and climate change on aquifer condition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The potential risk of phosphorus (P) loss in surface run-off can be decreased using sparingly soluble forms of P fertilizer (e.g. reactive phosphate rock (RPR)). However, it is unclear whether RPR can decrease P loss in leachate, especially when applied to soils with a small anion storage capacity (viz. P sorption capacity) and pH. Our hypothesis was that at low soil pH, the solubility of RPR would increase and result in P losses in leachate similar to those receiving single superphosphate (SSP), but at higher pH, less P would be lost from soils receiving RPR than SSP. Lysimeters containing a crushed, sieved acid mesic Organic (viz. peat) subsoil (30-60 cm) were limed to pH 4.5, 5.5 or 6.5 and treated with SSP or RPR at rates of 0, 50, 100 or 200 kg P/ha. Lysimeters were sown with ryegrass and watered over 12 months under controlled conditions and the leachate collected. Losses of filtered (<0.45 mu m) reactive inorganic P (FRP) and unreactive or organic P (FUP) in leachate were greatest for pH 4.5 treatments and least for the pH 6.5 treatments. The difference in FRP and FUP leachate losses in RPR- and SSP-treated soils was smaller at pH 4.5 and 5.5, and increased at pH 6.5 as losses from soils receiving RPR decreased compared to those receiving SSP. The results suggest that RPR can be used as a strategy to decrease P losses in leachate from an acid Organic soil with small P sorption capacity when limed to >pH 5.5.

AB Regional variation in size and shape of Sphagnum hummocks of eight lowland mires throughout Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, was examined in relation to climatic factors. The size and shape of hummocks significantly differed among the regions: low and flat hummocks occurred in the northern region and next to the Sea of Japan; moderately raised and conical hummocks occurred in the western part of the Pacific coast; and extremely raised and cylindrical hummocks occurred in the eastern region. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the mean and maximum heights and height/basal area of hummocks were negatively correlated with evapotranspiration rate (E-0) in summer, duration of sunshine, and air temperature. Of these, evapotranspiration rate in summer positively correlated with radiation and thermal factors. Mean height of hummocks within a mire was increased with precipitation during the growing season. Because the regional difference of the hummock form was not related to the difference in nutrient conditions, the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation prevailed over edaphic conditions. Higher E-0 in summer was considered to cause water stress for hummock species in the northern region and next to the Sea of Japan, whereas heavy rainfall relieved it in the western region of the Pacific coast. Consequently, lower and flat hummocks were a result of the higher E-0 in summer, moderately raised and conical hummocks of the medium E-0 and high precipitation, and extremely raised and cylindrical hummocks of a lower E-0 due to prolonged foggy days.

AB The NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model was applied to the Biliu River catchment, northern China, to estimate the carrying capacity of the water resource there. The model reproduced well the water and heat budgets after the construction of a reservoir in the middle reach of the river. It also correctly backcasted the degradation of water resources such as river discharge and groundwater after the completion of the reservoir. Calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite data clearly showed vegetation degradation downstream of the reservoir. Statistical analysis of a decoupling indicator based on the simulated water carrying capacity and on the satellite data of vegetation index indicated that water-related stress in Dalian city, where the economy has grown rapidly after the completement of the reservoir, has increased in accordance with the environmental degradation below the reservoir. The results indicate a close relationship between water resource and economic growth, which has greatly affected ecosystem degradation and its serious burden on the environment in the catchment. The simulated results highlight the linkage between urban development in Dalian and sustainable water resource management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane emission from a wetland was measured with the eddy covariance system. The location of the system allowed observation of methane efflux from areas that were covered by different vegetation types. The data presented in this paper were collected in the period between the 13th of June and the 31st of August 2012. During the warmest months of the summer, there was no strong correlation between methane emissions and either the water table depth or peat temperature. The presence of reed and cattail contributed to a pronounced diurnal pattern of the flux and lower methane emission, while areas covered by sedges emitted higher amounts more with no clear diurnal pattern.

AB The cumulative effects of human actions on wetland ecosystems motivate current efforts at wetland restoration. They also have created in part the context within which restorations are undertaken. Using modern hydrogeological understanding of wetland-landscape linkages, I argue that restorations should begin with a cumulative impact analysis for the entire region in which the restoration is proposed. The analysis, however, should not focus merely on number of hectares of wetlands lost or degraded. It should be based on the concept of templates for wetland development. These templates are the diversity of settings created in specific landscapes by the complex interactions of hydrogeologic factors and climate. They control key hydrologic variables and hydrologically influenced chemical variables that cause specific wetland types to form and to be maintained through time. They also determine in large part the biogeochemical cycling characteristics specific to different types of wetlands. They thus account for both the biological and functional diversity of wetlands. A cumulative impact assessment for restoration purposes should identify the kinds, numbers, relative abundances, and spatial distribution of wetland templates in a region-both past and present. These past and present profiles of the wetland landscape can be used to make decisions regarding the type and location of restorations. Matching type and location to the appropriate hydrogeologic setting will maximize the probability of success for individual projects. Regional wetland diversity can be restored if individual restoration decisions about wetland type and location are made in light of the diversity of templates in past and present regional profiles.

AB Ebullition can transport methane (CH4) at a much faster rate than other pathways, albeit over limited time and area, in wetland soils and sediments. However, field observations present large uncertainties in ebullition occurrences and statistic models are needed to describe the function relationship between probability of ebullition occurrence and water level changes. A flow-through chamber was designed and installed in a mudflat of an estuarine temperate marsh. Episodic increases in CH4 concentration signaling ebullition events were observed during ebbing tides (15 events over 456 ebbing tides) and occasionally during flooding tides (4 events over 455 flooding tides). Ebullition occurrence functions were defined using logistic regression as the relative initial and end water levels, as well as tidal amplitudes were found to be the key functional variables related to ebullition events. Ebullition of methane was restricted by a surface frozen layer during winter; melting of this layer during spring thaw caused increases in CH4 concentration, with ebullition fluxes similar to those associated with large fluctuations in water level around spring tides. Our findings suggest that initial and end relative water levels, in addition to tidal amplitude, partly regulate ebullition events in tidal wetlands, modulated by the lunar cycle, storage of gas bubbles at different depths and seasonal changes in the surface frozen layer. Maximum tidal strength over a few days, rather than hourly water level, may be more closely associated with the possibility of ebullition occurrence as it represents a trade-off time scale in between hourly and lunar periods.

AB Within the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, groundwaters from the Marshall Formation (Mississippian) contain As derived from As-rich pyrites, often exceeding the World Heath Organization drinking water limit of 10 mug/L. Many Michigan watersheds, established on top of Pleistocene glacial drift derived from erosion of the underlying Marshall Formation, also have waters with elevated As. The Huron River watershed in southeastern Lower Michigan is a well characterized hydrogeochemical system of glacial drift deposits, proximate to the Marshall Fm. subcrop, which hosts carbonate-rich groundwaters, streams, and wetlands (fens), and well-developed soil profiles. Aqueous and solid phase geochemistry was determined for soils, soil waters, surface waters (streams and fens) and groundwaters from glacial drift aquifers to better understand the hydrogeologic and chemical controls on As mobility. Soil profiles established on the glacial drift exhibit enrichment in both Fe and As in the oxyhydroxide-rich zone of accumulation. The amounts of Fe and As present as oxyhydroxides are comparable to those reported from bulk Marshall Fm. core samples by previous workers. However, the As host in core samples is largely unaltered pyrite and arsenopyrite. This suggests that the transformation of Fe Sulfides to Fe oxyhydroxides largely retains As and Fe at the oxidative weathering site. Groundwaters have the highest As values of all the waters sampled, and many were at or above the World Health limit. Most groundwaters are anaerobic. within the zones of Fe3+ and As(V) reduction. Although reduction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides is the probable source of As, there is no correlation between As and Fe concentrations. The As/Fe mole ratios in drift groundwaters are about an order of magnitude greater than those in soil profiles, suggesting that As is more mobile than Fe. This is consistent with the dominance of As(111) in these groundwaters and with the partitioning of Fe2+ into carbonate cements. Soil waters have very low As and Fe contents, consistent with the stability of oxyhydroxides under oxidizing vadose conditions. When CO2 charged groundwaters discharge in streams and fens, dissolved As is effectively removed by adsorption onto Fe-oxides or carbonate marls. Although Fe does not display conservative behavior with As in groundwaters, a strong positive correlation exists between As and Sr concentrations. As water rock interactions proceed, the As/Fe and Sr/Ca ratios would be expected to increase because both As and Sr behave as incompatible elements. Comparisons with groundwater chemistries from other drift-hosted aquifers proximate to the Marshall sandstone are consistent with these relations. Thus, the Sr content of carbonate-rich groundwaters may provide useful constraints on the occurrence, origin and evolution of dissolved As in such systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A three-dimensional stratigraphic model was constructed of the upper 50 m of the Mississippi River Delta, southeastern USA. The model is used to understand hydrogeological connections among the Mississippi River, adjacent interdistributary bays and groundwater systems, and to understand how stratigraphic settings affect potential anthropically induced subsidence and erosion in the region. This study uses 619 geotechnical borings throughout the area along with the multiple-indicator natural neighbor (MINN) interpolation method to construct the model. Based on available data, the study focused on the Mississippi River reach from Head of Passes (river mouth) to Jesuit Bend (108 km upstream), covering an area of approximately 1,800 km(2)and ranging in elevation from 3 to -46 m. The model shows typical basal coarse-grained sand bodies overlain by 10-m-thick blanket clay, which is interbedded frequently with silty and sandy sediments and occasionally with peat and organic clay. Sands are most abundant between elevations -10 and -35 m. The Mississippi River main channel incises the underlying sands, thereby providing pathways for river-groundwater exchange. Increased hydrologic loads may propagate along the flow paths potentially giving rise to high pore-water pressure and a resultant increase in land subsidence and thus local erosion of natural and local flood-control levees. This method of analysis may apply to other deltaic regions similarly subject to anthropically accelerated subsidence and erosion.

AB Aim We present a model to account for self-assembly of the slough-ridge-tree island patterned landscape of the central Everglades in southern Florida via feedbacks among landforms, hydrology, vegetation and biogeochemistry. We test aspects of this model by analysing vegetation composition in relation to local and landscape-level drivers.
   Location We quantified vegetation composition and environmental characteristics in central Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3A, southern WCA-3A and southern WCA-3B in southern Florida, based on their divergence in water management and flow regimes over the past 50 years.
   Methods In 562 quadrats, we estimated species coverages and quantified maximum, minimum and average water depth, soil depth to bedrock, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and proximity to the nearest tree island. We used non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) to relate compositional variation to local and landscape-level factors, and evaluated environmental differences among eight a priori vegetation types via ANOVA.
   Results Water depth and hydroperiod decreased from sloughs to ridges to tree islands, but regions also differed significantly in the abundance of several community types and the hydroregimes characterizing them. NMS revealed two significant axes of compositional variation, tied to local gradients of water depth and correlated factors, and to a landscape-scale gradient of proximity to tall tree islands. Sawgrass height and soil thickness increased toward higher ridges, and NDVI was greatest on tree islands.
   Main conclusions This study supports four components of our model: positive feedback of local substrate height on itself, woody plant invasion and subsequent P transport and concentration by top predators nesting on taller tree islands, compositional shifts in sites close to tree islands due to nutrient leakage, and flow-induced feedback against total raised area. Regional divergence in the relationship of community types to current hydroregimes appears to reflect a lag of a few years after shifts in water management; a longer lag would be expected for shifts in landscape patterning. Both local and landscape-level drivers appear to shape vegetation composition and soil thickness in the central Everglades.

AB Heathland has become fragmented throughout its European range with many countries losing 60-90% of their heathland area during the 20th century. A small, isolated area of wet heathland within permitted ball clay workings in Dorset (England) was translocated in October 1993 to an engineered receptor cell fed by groundwater and direct precipitation in order to mitigate the otherwise total loss of the wet heath. The aims were to rescue the wet heathland and to re-establish a community type similar to the wet heath that originally occurred at the donor site prior to the recent development of vegetation communities and birch colonisation associated with drier conditions. Vegetation monitoring over 12 years up to 2005 indicated that the experimental translocation successfully fulfilled the aims for a period of 7 years when the hydrological regime of the receptor site was actively managed. There was development of a mosaic of wet heath and mire vegetation community types including Sphagnum lawns and open bog pools. However, when active management ceased, the receptor site became drier and species were lost. Multivariate analysis revealed a trajectory of progressive rapid chronological change during 1994 and 1995 followed by a period of relative stability between 1996 and 2000 which coincided with greater species density. Subsequently up to 2005, the plant community became less species-rich and the plant community reverted to a species structure similar to that which occurred in 1994/1995. The importance of hydrological regime for plant community structure was tested using fixed-quadrat data and the water level measurements made in the period 1995-1998. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) multivariate analysis revealed a hydrological gradient with a significant seasonal effect of water table depth in the first half of the year and close association of the least wet quadrat location and non-mire species. Overall, the results support the use of translocation as a means of rescuing wet heath habitat which would otherwise be lost due to change in land use. There is a risk of failure when translocating a complex ecosystem such as wet heath but ecological engineering provides an insight into defining the risk. Our results demonstrated that an ecologically acceptable outcome for a wet heath translocation can be achieved with careful design and implementation and sensitive management of the receptor site. However, it is essential to secure long-term hydrological and vegetation management in order to provide a sustainable outcome for long-term survival of a target wet heath community.

TI Land Maps from 19th Century as a Source of Names of Physiographical

SO ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA

DT Article
AB Preservation of the landscape is connected with the resource protection of the rural environment and with the cultural legacy. Name local are one of elements of the cultural legacy. Name of object, can indicate place the object in the space. Names of settlement objects, physiographical objects and natural objects are collected and made available through the National Register of Place Names (Panstwowy Rejestr Nazw Geograficznych - PRNG). PRGN is an official, referential database constituting the base for other systems of spatial information containing place names. In the literature there are many classifications of geographical names. In the article there is a division which is dividing toponyms to names of inhabited physiographical objects - oykonyms and to names of uninhabited physiographical objects - anoykonyms.
   Article analyzed maps which have been made from the 19th century from the area of Wielkopolski as anoykonyms sources to the National Register of Place Names. At the work analyzed twenty-two maps, which have been made in scale 1:5000 from the National Archive in Poznan. The maps covered the area which was divided in two areas. The first area was the villages located near the Wrzesnia. The second area was the villages located in the strip Grodzisk Wielkopolski-Opalenica-Pniewy-Sierakow. In research anoykonyms were divided in the following groups: 1. topographical relief (hillock, pit) 2. following water 3. water standing (pond, bog-mud, wetland) 4. other physiographic objects (field, meadow-pasture, forest). Analysis of maps showed, diversifying the amount of names of topographical objects on individual maps. The most of topographical names was on map of Gnin (21). Least of topographical names were on the maps of Nowa Wies Krolewska and Ksiazno (1). On remaining maps the amount of names ranged from 4 to 8. Anoykonyms were on 45% of the surveyed maps. From the analysis of maps were obtained in total 60 anoykonyms. The division according to individual groups looks as follows:
   1. topographical relief - 7 names (hillock - 1, pit - 6)
   2. flowing water - 4 names
   3. standing water - 12 names (pond - 2, bog-mud - 5, wetland - 5)
   4. other physiographic objects - 37 names (field - 15, meadow-pasture - 17, forest - 5).
   Places of appearing of names "topographical relief" of the area was compared with appropriate topographical maps and available maps on Geoportal. The control was aimed at checking whether the name is connected with the topography relief. (In all accidents the inspection confirmed speculations.) anoykonyms fields, meadows, pastures and forests, which were obtained from the maps, can provide a basis for studies of landscape history and to inform land cover, land use, ownership structure or human activity.
   Anoykonyms acquired from maps were confirmed in descriptive sources. Collected names were Compared from with "Urzedowymi nazwami miejscowosci i obiektow fizjograficznych" for the Wielkopolska given in years to 70 of the 20th century, with the National Register of Place Names available from Geoportal and with other descriptive materials. More than 30 percent anoykonyms which were on maps were confirmed in descriptive materials (38% of them appeared in more than one descriptive materials). Names of physiographical objects should be get both from of maps and as well as descriptive materials. Maps are used for a spatial localization of objects. Descriptive materials are used for a verification of names from maps. The names of the physiographical objects before the entry to the registry (PRNG) should be subject to appropriate verification.
   Research has shown that the maps from the nineteenth century are a valuable source anoykonyms. Physiographic object names can be used to specify the changes and evolution of the environment.

ID GRUS-AMERICANA; PATTERN
AB Through a spatial, multi-scale approach I compared available habitat with habitat used by whooping cranes (Grus americana) on their nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. Thirty-two study sites (16 used, 16 available) were established in the nesting area in August 1996. Data were gathered by (a) plots of 9.8 m radius which provided detailed site data and served as ground truth for (b) concentric circular plots of 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 m radius in which 21 cover types were mapped onto false color infrared 1:15,840 airphotos. Whooping cranes chose habitat that differed from a random sample. Habitat selection was strongest at the nest site, when many attributes of habitat type and structure were evident. Beyond 200 m radius from the nest site, selection was evident solely as avoidance of unsuitable habitat. At the nest site scale (9.8 m radius), the preferred habitat was visually open, with large amounts of open water (median depth 7 cm in August), nearby which there were a few abundant vegetation species in an open spatial arrangement. Habitat types used by whooping cranes were diatom ponds, bulrush (Scirpus validus) marshes, bulrush/ cattail (Typha latifolia) mixed marshes with aquatic macrophytes, and shrubby mixed marshes with water sedge (Carex aquatilis) and cattail. Plant species diversity of the entire crane area is low, particularly that of nesting sites. In contrast, spatial diversity of community types is a marked characteristic of the area; average patch size is < 1 ha. At the 78.5 ha scale (500 m radius), there were no apparent differences in landscape structure or diversity between used vs available habitats. MANOVA/repeated measures and multi-response permutation procedures were used to examine habitat selection at five spatial scales. Whooping cranes selected bulrush marsh out to a radius of 200 m from the nest, and avoided featureless shrub bogs and fens out to a radius of at least 500 m from nests. Historical and present nesting habitat share the following characteristics: small shallow lakes and ponds, willow com munities, marshes of bulrush and cattail, mudflats, and perhaps sedge meadows. The present nesting habitat may be atypical compared to the core of the historical range in its diatom ponds, gypsum karst-groundwater discharge hydrogeology, and permafrost. Cranes appear to use only a small portion of the total available area of their nesting grounds. The Wood Buffalo-Aransas whooping crane population should not be limited by available breeding habitat in the near future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous small watercourses are draining the hinterland of the NW German coast. The waters mainly originate from marsh and fen areas and have yellow to deep brownish color. During their flow path, the waters exhibit gradients in salinity (0.2-3), pH (6.2-8.8), particulate organic carbon (5-25%), and iron oxides (7-12%), which alter the concentrations of most dissolved and particulate trace metals. For example, dissolved Fe is rapidly removed from solution at increasing salinities by flocculation, whereas dissolved U is removed in the very low-salinity zone by Fe- and organic-rich colloids. The waters at the flood-gate of Neuharlingersiel, where a composite sample of the entire study area is collected before the freshwater is discharged into the marine-dominated tidal flat area in front of the mainland dike, have the following average trace metal concentrations: dissolved Fe 11 mu M, Mn 4 mu M, Mo 10 mu M, U 1.8 mu M, V 75 mu M and particulate Fe 7 mg kg(-1), Mn 1200 mg kg(-1), Mo 2 mg kg(-1), U 1.7 mg kg(-1), V 140 mg kg(-1). After passing the flood-gate most Mo- and U-salinity distributions fit well to the conservative mixing line that connects the seawater of the Wadden Sea to the low-salinity river water entering the tidal flat area. In contrast, dissolved Fe, Mn, and V are removed from solution, especially at intermediate salinities, which may be due to mixing of freshwater with seawater depleted in these elements, flocculation and/or scavenging by particulate matter. In general, processes similar to those in estuarine systems alter the geochemical signatures on transects from land to sea. Compared to average river water, the watercourses are enriched in dissolved and particulate Fe, Mn, Mo, U, and V. Due to the fast removal of dissolved Fe in the salinity gradient and the high concentrations of Mo and U in seawater, the watercourses only form a source for Mn, V, terrestrial organic carbon, and particulate Fe for the Wadden Sea.

AB Dune slacks are biodiverse seasonal wetlands which experience considerable fluctuation in water table depth. They are under threat from eutrophication and lowered water tables due to climate change and water abstraction. The biological effects caused by the interactions of these pressures are poorly understood, particularly on soil processes. We used a mesocosm experiment and laboratory assays to study the impact of lowered water tables, groundwater nitrogen contamination, and their synergistic-effects on soil microbial processes and greenhouse gas emissions. This study showed that just a 10 cm decrease in water table depth led to a reduction, in denitrification and to a corresponding increase in soil nitrogen content. Meanwhile N2O emissions occurred for longer durations within dune slack soils subject to higher concentrations of groundwater nitrogen contamination. The results from extracellular enzyme assays suggest that decomposition rates increase within drier soils shown by the increase in beta-glucosidase activity, with further sensitivity to groundwater nitrogen contamination shown by the increase in phenol oxidase activity. Dune slack soils with a 10 cm lower water table had significantly lower CH4 emissions, nearly 5 times lower in the drier soils. Our findings demonstrate that dune slacks are sensitive to both small changes in groundwater levels and to groundwater nitrogen contamination. The biological impacts from lowered water tables are likely to be intensified where there is also groundwater nitrogen contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Better knowledge of spatial and temporal delivery of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in small catchments is required to understand the mechanisms behind reported longterm changes in C fluxes from some peatlands. We monitored two storms with contrasting seasons and antecedent conditions in a small upland UK moorland catchment. We examined DOC concentrations and specific UV absorbance (SUVA at 285 nm), together with solute concentrations required to undertake end-member mixing analyses to define dominant flow paths contributing to streamflow. This was combined with laboratory soil-solution equilibrations. We aimed to resolve how seasonal biogeochemical processing of DOC and flowpath changes in organo-mineral soils combine to affect DOC exported via the stream. An August storm following a dry period gave maximum DOC concentration of 10 mg l(-1). Small DOC: DON ratios (16-28) and SUVA (2.7-3.6 l mg(-1) m(-1)) was attributed to filtration of aromatic compounds associated with up to 53% B horizon flow contributions. This selective filtration of high SUVA DOC was reproduced in the experimental batch equilibration system. For a November storm, wetter antecedent soil conditions led to enhanced soil connectivity with the stream and seven times greater DOC stream-load (maximum concentration 16 mg l(-1)). This storm had a 63% O horizon flow contribution at its peak, limited B horizon buffering and consequently more aromatic DOC (SUVA 3.9-4.5 l mg(-1) m(-1) and DOC: DON ratio 35-43). We suggest that simple mixing of waters from different flow paths cannot alone explain the differences in DOC compositions between August and November and biogeochemical processing of DOC is required to fully explain the observed stream DOC dynamics. This preliminary evidence is in contrast to other studies proposing hydrological controls on the nature of DOC delivered to streams. Although our study is based only on two storms of very different hydrological and biogeochemical periods, this should promote wider study of DOC biogeochemical alteration in headwaters so that this be better incorporated in modelling to predict the impacts of changes in DOC delivery to, and fate in, aquatic systems.

AB Partitioning soil respiration (SR) into its components, heterotrophic and rhizospheric respiration, is an important step for understanding and modelling carbon (C) cycling in organic soils. However, no partitioning studies on afforested organic soil croplands exist. We separated soil respiration originating from the decomposition of peat (SRP), and aboveground litter (SRL) and root respiration (SRR) in six afforested organic soil croplands in Finland with varying tree species and stand ages using the trenching method. Across the sites temporal variation in SR was primarily related to changes in soil surface temperature (-5 cm), which explained 71-96% of variation in SR rates. Decomposition of peat and litter was not related to changes in water table level, whereas a minor increase in root respiration was observed with the increase in water table depth. Temperature sensitivity of SR varied between the different respiration components: SRp was less sensitive to changes in soil surface temperature than SRL or SRR. Factors explaining spatial variation in SR differed between different respiration components. Annual SRp correlated positively with peat ash content while that of SRL was found to correlate positively with the amount of litter on the forest floor, separately for each tree species. Root respiration correlated positively with the biomass of ground vegetation. From the total soil respiration peat decomposition comprised a major share of 42%; the proportion of autotrophic respiration being 41% and aboveground litter 17%. Afforestation lowered peat decomposition rates. Nevertheless the effect of agricultural history can be seen in peat properties for decades and due to high peat decomposition rates these soils still loose carbon to the atmosphere.

AB Reliable temporal modelling of groundwater level is significant for efficient water resources management in hydrological basins and for the prevention of possible desertification effects. In this work we propose a stochastic method of temporal monitoring and prediction that can incorporate auxiliary information. More specifically, we model the temporal (mean annual and biannual) variation of groundwater level by means of a discrete time autoregressive exogenous variable (ARX) model. The ARX model parameters and its predictions are estimated by means of the Kalman filter adaptation algorithm (KFAA) which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in hydrology. KFAA is suitable for sparsely monitored basins that do not allow for an independent estimation of the ARX model parameters. We apply KFAA to time series of groundwater level values from the Mires basin in the island of Crete. In addition to precipitation measurements, we use pumping data as exogenous variables. We calibrate the ARX model based on the groundwater level for the years 1981 to 2006 and use it to predict the mean annual and biannual groundwater level for recent years (2007-2010). The predictions are validated with the available annual averages reported by the local authorities.

AB The coalbed methane potential and producibility of any coal-bearing strata are strongly affected by the hydrogeological regime of formation waters and by coal permeability, which in turn depends on the effective stress regime of the coals. Peat that accumulated in the Alberta basin during the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary led to the formation of coal deposits that may contain significant coalbed methane resources. The flow of formation waters plays an important role in the maintenance and producibility of this resource. The present-day flow is driven by gravity (topography) and erosional rebound and is controlled by rock permeability and the presence of gas-saturated sandstones. The estimated gas in place in the Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous coals decreases significantly with stratigraphic age, ranging between less than 2 bcf/mi(2) in the lower coal zones and 12 bcf/mi(2) in the uppermost coals. The gas content, especially of the deeper coals, is lower than would be expected for the corresponding coal rank and burial depth, most likely because the underpressuring has caused the release of gas from the coals and accumulation, in adjacent sands. The shallow coals, although of low rank, may contain important amounts of late-stage biogenic methane. The salinity of formation water in shallow coal seams, where the flow is driven by topography, is low, generally less than 1500 mg/L, although in places, it reaches 3000-5000 mg/L. The salinity of formation water in the deeper, underpressured strata in the west-central part of the basin is significantly higher, reaching 18,000 mg/L. This affects treatment and/or disposal strategies with regard to the water produced concurrent to coalbed methane.

AB The effects of site preparation practices (drainage, mounding and fertilization) on the fluxes from the soil surface of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were studied on an organic-rich peaty gley soil at Harwood Forest, north-east England. Drained plots had significantly higher CO2 fluxes but significantly lower CH4 fluxes compared with undrained plots, while N2O emissions were not affected by drainage. Mounding caused significantly higher CH4 emissions, while it significantly reduced N2O emissions. Fertilization caused significant increases in emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O. In terms of overall greenhouse warming potential, drainage and fertilization increased CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 18-29 and 7-23 per cent, respectively, while mounding reduced CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 8 per cent in year 1, but had no effect on emissions in year 2 of study. Soil temperature was the main environmental variable controlling CO2 emissions, while CH4 was controlled primarily by water table depth. Nitrous oxide emissions responded to changes in soil temperature and water table depth. In the short term, drainage and fertilization contributed to accelerating greenhouse gas emissions significantly, although their long-term effects are likely moderated by accelerating carbon accumulation in the tree biomass. Long-term studies are required to assess the cumulative impacts of site preparation practices during the whole rotation cycle.

AB Climate change may have profound impacts on the maintenance of peatlands and surface water systems in the sub-humid western Boreal Plain (WBP) of Northwestern Canada. Wetlands in the WBP, whereas significant carbon stocks are sensitive to changes in climate, because in most years potential evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds precipitation. In this study, a dynamic closed chamber technique was used to examine the relative midday (10:00-16:00 h) growing season (April-October) contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration (R-tot) and moss photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GEP) to net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 at the soil surface of different degrees of spruce forest canopy cover and microtopography (lawn and depression) in two peatland-pond complexes in the WBP, north-central Alberta, Canada. Results demonstrate that Sphagnum lawns showed the greatest amount of uptake, and dominant surface cover plant communities (Sphagnum and feather mosses) were associated more with canopy cover and incident radiation (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) than microclimate and hydrology. Although microclimate and hydrology varied spatially, no major changes in plant communities were observed across microtopographic gradients (lawns and depression). Differences in NEE with hydrology and microclimate were observed between microtopographic units (depression and lawns), but this was not consistent with surface cover plant community types, which makes generalized fluxes in this landscape particularly challenging.

AB Atlantic white cedar (AWC) stands form peat substrates in association with a seasonally flooded, saturated hydrologic regime. Less than 2% of the AWC swamp land area present during the pre-colonial era remains, and most of the current area now exhibits a temporarily flooded hydrologic regime. The purpose of this study was to quantify radial AWC growth at time scales that were cumulative (throughout ~60-year lifespans) and annual to clarify the relationship with hydrologic regime and climate in drained and undrained stands. Two 60-year-old stands having either drained or undrained conditions were selected in national wildlife refuges in Virginia and North Carolina, USA. Shallow groundwater wells fitted with continuous recorders measured depth-to-water-table during the 1999 calendar year to verify hydrologic regimes, and tree ring widths were evaluated from 54 trees per site. Cumulative time scale growth of individual tree stems was strongly suppressed by high water tables in the undrained stand. Annual growth rates among climate variables also diverged such that wetter months were positively correlated with tree ring width in the drained stand. Results suggest that AWC tree ring growth patterns can provide natural resource managers with insights into historic hydrologic conditions that influence ecosystem services and biodiversity.

AB The extent of endomycorrhizal colonization of Dasiphora floribunda was measured in 8 calcareous wetlands in eastern New York State, USA. Environmental parameters (pH, conductivity, water-table depth, soil moisture, soil organic matter, soil NH4+, soil available P, and porewater DIP) varied among wetlands. Soil available P was relatively low and ranged from 2.52 to 15.74 mg-P gdw(-1) in all 8 wetlands. Contrary to expectation, the extent of endomycorrhizal colonization of D. floribunda did not vary among calcareous wetlands of different soil phosphorus or moisture status. Mycorrhizal colonization of D. floribunda ranged from 66.7 to 91.7%, with an average of 78.1 +/- 7.7%. Although environmental parameters were only measured once, these results suggest that soil available P and soil moisture, used to predict variation of endomycorrhizal colonization of other wetland plants, are not useful for predicting the extent of endomycorrhizal colonization of D. floribunda. We propose that calcareous wetlands in eastern New York are an endpoint on a continuum of wetland types where P availability is so low that variation of P status among calcareous wetlands is not ecologically significant in the regulation of endomycorrhizal colonization.

AB Much progress has been made in methane modeling for the Arctic. However, there is still large uncertainty in emissions estimates due to the spatial variability in water table depth resulting from complex topographic gradients, and due to variations in methane production and oxidation due to complex freezing and thawing processes. Here we extended an extant methane emission module within a biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), to include a large-scale hydrology model, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. The VIC model provides the required inputs, including freezing and thawing fronts, soil temperature and moisture, to the methane module. The effect of topography on the redistribution of soil moisture and water table depth was explicitly modeled using the TOPMODEL approach. The coupled modeling framework was applied to the Yukon River basin at a spatial resolution of 1 km from 1986 to 2005. The simulations show that the average annual net emissions of CH4 from the region are 4.01 Tg CH4 yr(-1). El Nino phenomena usually lead to positive emission anomalies, while decreases in net CH4 emissions may be associated with strong La Nina events. Precipitation was found to be more closely related to CH4 dynamics than to soil temperature and active layer depth during the study period. This study suggests that the effects of soil freezing and thawing processes and the effects of microtopography on hydrology should be considered in the quantification of CH4 emissions.

DE gully; balka; East European Plain; Quaternary
ID HOLOCENE; DNIEPER; BASIN
AB Balkas (large Quaternary gullies) of the south-western part of the East European Plain (and their analogues in Central and Western Europe) are considered in terms of their geomorphology, lithology, sedimentology, modern surface processes, stratigraphy and palaeogeography. Features attributed to balkas in comparison with regular gullies and small river valleys are described. Balkas are widespread elements of the modern landscape with the same characteristic gentle-concave bottom as regular gullies, and with or without weakly incised river channels. Buried gully incisions of different ages (post-Gelasian) with the same shape are also revealed below modern Balkas. They are infilled by characteristic balka alluvial, slope and even lacustrine-bog deposits, in places representing compound sequences of fluvial-aeolian sedimentation. The fluvial part reflects multiple series of ephemeral episodes of increased water and sediment supply within temporary streams. Two conspicuous series supposedly fall within the final stages of the Dnieper (late Middle Pleistocene) and Valdai (Late Pleistocene) glaciations. Different ideas concerning the increase of surface runoff and erodibility of soils that might favour active balkas under conditions of land-ice decay and permafrost, including its degradation, are discussed. The development of balkas included relatively short phases of incision and accumulation interrupted by much longer periods of inactivity, when they were subjected to surface processes in a subaerial environment or left as a relic. However, during active phases they served as important and powerful depositories and arteries of rillgullybalka sedimentation systems, collecting and transmitting eroded material to the river valleys. These phases are related to climatic oscillations and were to some degree independent of fluvial processes affecting the permanent streams. Most of the Middle-Late Pleistocene balkas retained their primary features, having subsequently been incorporated into the erosional network. In contrast, some of them were totally infilled and disappeared from the landscape. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Differences of surface elevation in arctic polygonal landforms cause spatial variation in soil water contents (theta), active layer depths (ALD), and thereby in CO2 and CH4 exchange. Here we test hypotheses in ecosys for topographic controls on CO2 and CH4 exchange in trough, rim, and center features of low- and flat-centered polygons (LCP and FCP) against chamber and eddy covariance (EC) measurements during 2013 at Barrow, Alaska. Larger CO2 influxes and CH4 effluxes were measured with chambers and modeled with ecosys in LCPs than in FCPs and in lower features (troughs) than in higher (rims) within LCPs and FCPs. Spatially aggregated CO2 and CH4 fluxes from ecosys were significantly correlated with EC flux measurements. Lower features were modeled as C sinks (52-56 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 sources (4-6g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and higher features as near C neutral (-2-15 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 neutral (0.0-0.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Much of the spatial and temporal variations in CO2 and CH4 fluxes were modeled from topographic effects on water and snow movement and thereby on theta, ALD, and soil O-2 concentrations. Model results forced with meteorological data from 1981 to 2015 indicated increasing net primary productivity in higher features and CH4 emissions in some lower and higher features since 2008, attributed mostly to recent rises in precipitation. Small-scale variation in surface elevation causes large spatial variation of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges and therefore should be considered in estimates of GHG exchange in polygonal landscapes.

AB Alkaline fens are ecosystems with extraordinarily high biodiversity. However, they belong to the most threatened ecosystems in Europe due to drainage, land use intensification and cessation of traditional management. In such systems, evapotranspiration (ET) is an important hydrological process as it is the principal way of water loss. However, there is a knowledge gap concerning the effect of vegetation structure and management on this process. Thus, we quantify actual ET rate based on diurnal groundwater fluctuation in different vegetation and management types (forested, only-mowed, mowed/cleared) as well as analyze the differences in vegetation composition. We utilize medium-term, high frequency hydrological data from an alkaline fen in northern Germany as well as data on floral species composition and light availability. Our results show that ET rates are similar in the mowed fen with tree clearance (cleared/mowed fen) and in the only-mowed fen. The only-mowed fen has significantly higher ET rates compared to the alder carr and one part of the willow forest. Similarly the cleared/mowed fen also had significantly higher ET rates than those in the alder carr. Although the results are not entirely consistent with those of other authors, few studies support our findings. We conclude that the difference we observe may be caused by differences in microclimate such as lower temperature and wind speed and higher humidity in the forest, compared to the open fens. Species composition was significantly different between the forested fen and the cleared fen. (C) 2020 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

   HISTORY
AB The mid-Holocene decline of Tsuga canadensis (hereafter Tsuga) populations across eastern North America is widely perceived as a synchronous event, driven by pests/pathogens, rapid climate change, or both. Pattern identification and causal attribution are hampered by low stratigraphic density of pollen-sampling and radiometric dates at most sites, and by absence of highly resolved, paired pollen and paleoclimate records from single sediment cores, where chronological order of climatic and vegetational changes can be assessed. We present an intensely sampled (contiguous 1-cm intervals) record of pollen and water table depth (inferred from testate amoebae) from a single core spanning the Tsuga decline at Irwin Smith Bog in Lower Michigan, with high-precision chronology. We also present an intensively sampled pollen record from Tower Lake in Upper Michigan. Both sites show high-magnitude fluctuations in Tsuga pollen percentages during the pre-decline maximum. The terminal decline is dated at both sites ca. 5000 cal yr BP, some 400 years later than estimates from other sites and data compilations. The terminal Tsuga decline was evidently heterochronous across its range. A transient decline ca. 5350 cal yr BP at both sites may correspond to the terminal decline at other sites in eastern North America. At Irwin Smith Bog, the terminal Tsuga decline preceded an abrupt and persistent decline in water table depths by; 200 years, suggesting the decline was not directly driven by abrupt climate change. The Tsuga decline may best be viewed as comprising at least three phases: a long-duration pre-decline maximum with high-magnitude and high-frequency fluctuations, followed by a terminal decline at individual sites, followed in turn by two millennia of persistently low Tsuga populations. These phases may not be causally linked, and may represent dynamics taking place at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Further progress toward understanding the phenomenon requires an expanded network of high-resolution pollen and paleoclimate chronologies.

AB Based on paleoclimatic reconstructions using various proxies, the Holocene Climate Optimum (10.5-6 ka) has been characterized as a warmer and wetter period in most of East Asia. The summer monsoons associated with the East Asian Monsoon evidently intensified and extended further inland from the Pacific Ocean, a source region of moisture. A notable exception to this general pattern exists in northeast China, where less wet conditions are recorded. We determined molecular compositions of individual plant wax hydrocarbons and their hydrogen isotope compositions (delta D values) in a radiocarbon-dated peat core recovered from the Hani marsh in Jilin Province (China) and confirmed that the temperature-dependent effective precipitation in northeast China decreased during the Holocene Climate Optimum. A combination Of P-aq, an indicator of the relative contribution of aquatic to terrestrial plants, and the difference in delta D between low (C-23, C-25 and C-27) and high molecular weight (C-31) n-alkanes in the Hani peat bog indicates a dramatic change in vegetation from the deglaciation to the Holocene. No significant differences were observed between the delta D values of low and high molecular weight n-alkanes with relatively high delta D values and low P-aq during the early Holocene, indicating that all n-alkanes were produced by evapotranspiration-sensitive terrestrial plants during that time. However, lower delta D values of mid-chain n-alkanes (C-23, C-25 and C-27) relative to the long chain n-alkane (C-31), together with higher P-aq values during the deglaciation (14-11 ka), suggest an increase in the contribution of aquatic plants and a higher water level during the period. The study demonstrates that northeast China was under a markedly wetter climate condition during the late deglaciation. For the 16 kyr record in the Hani peat sequence, we infer that moisture delivery by the East Asian Monsoon was relatively invariable in northeast China, but increased evaporation during the warmer Holocene Climate Optimum reduced the effective precipitation, defined by the balance between precipitation and evaporation.

AB Data on soils, vegetation and environment were collected between 510 and 1050 m a.s.l. on Mt Sprent, southwestern Tasmania, traversing the Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus sedgeland-alpine vegetation boundary. One or more of the following horizons were found in almost all soil pits (downwards from the surface to the bed rock) fibric peat, hemic peat, sapric peat, organic sand, sand and clay. Mean total soil depth, mean organic soil depth, mean humification of the soil surface horizon, FH and mean organic content of the surface horizon all decline with altitude, while the redness of the soil and the mean depth of the mineral and gravel layers increase. At four intensively studied sites at 620, 850, 930 and 1040 m the relationships between phytosociological, topographic and watertable variables, and soil characteristics were determined. The pH of the topsoil was significantly positively related to water-table depth at three sites, but there were no other relationships between local environmental variation and soil characteristics that were consistent between most of the four sites, despite a large number of locally significant relationships. The alpine and sedgeland soils differ most markedly in colour, number of horizons and degree of humification of the surface horizon. The vegetation at each site was separated into communities along a drainage gradient. The mesoscale differences in soils seem most likely to be attributable to a vegetation productivity gradient.

AB Climate and human activity affected significantly the Eurasian on the forest vegetation zone through the Holocene. This paper presents new multi-proxy records of environmental changes at the southern boundary of the mixed coniferous broadleaved forest zone in the east-central part of the East European Plain during the middle and late Holocene. Palaeoecological analyses of a peat core for pollen, charcoal, peat humification, plant macrofossils and testate amoebae with dating using radiocarbon have shown that climate appears to have been a dominant control on vegetation. There is strong evidence for a reduced precipitation-evapotranspiration ratio and high fire frequency during the Holocene thermal maximum (6.9-5.3 ka BP), leading to dominance of Betula-Pinus forests. By contrast subsequent climatic cooling led to the expansion of broadleaved forests and establishment of Picea. Human activities influenced vegetation from the Neolithic onwards but played a role which was secondary to climate until the recent past. Over the last century, human impacts considerably increased because of harvesting of broadleaved trees and contributed to the formation of the current mixed coniferous broadleaved forests.

AB Restoration efforts in Florida's Everglades focus on preserving and restoring this unique wetland's natural landscape. Because most of the Everglades is a freshwater peatland, it requires surplus rainfall to remain a peatland. Restoration plans generally assume a stable climate, yet projections of altered climate over a 50-year time horizon suggest that this assumption may be inappropriate. Using a legacy regional hydrological model, we simulated combinations of a temperature rise of 1.5 A degrees C, a +/- A 10 % change in rainfall, and a 0.46 m sea level rise relative to base conditions. The scenario of increased evapotranspiration and increased rainfall produced a slight increase in available water. In contrast, the more likely scenario of increased evapotranspiration and decreased rainfall lowered median water depths by 5-114 cm and shortened inundation duration periods by 5-45 %. Sea level rise increased stages and inundation duration in southern Everglades National Park. These ecologically significant decreases in water depths and inundation duration periods would greatly alter current ecosystems through severe droughts, peat loss and carbon emissions, wildfires, loss of the unique ridge and slough patterns, large shifts in plant and animal communities, and increased exotic species invasions. These results suggest using adaptive restoration planning, a method that explicitly incorporates large climatic and environmental uncertainties into long-term ecosystem restoration plans, structural design, and management. Anticipated water constraints necessitate alternative approaches to restoration, including maintaining critical landscapes and facilitating transitions in others. Accommodating these uncertainties may improve the likelihood of restoration success.

AB Little is known about the structure of microbial communities in Sphagnum peatlands, and the potential effects of the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration on these communities are not known. We analyzed the structure of microbial communities in five Sphagnum-dominated peatlands across Europe and their response to CO2 enrichment using miniFACE systems. After three growing seasons, Sphagnum samples were analyzed for heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria, microalgae, heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, testate amoebae, fungi, nematodes, and rotifers. Heterotrophic organisms dominated the microbial communities and together represented 78% to 97% of the total microbial biomass. Testate amoebae dominated the protozoan biomass. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed a significant correlation between the microbial community data and four environmental variables (Na+, DOC, water table depth, and DIN), reflecting continentality, hydrology, and nitrogen deposition gradients. Carbon dioxide enrichment modified the structure of microbial communities, but total microbial biomass was unaffected. The biomass of heterotrophic bacteria increased by 48%, and the biomass of testate amoebae decreased by 13%. These results contrast with the absence of overall effect on methane production or on the vegetation, but are in line with an increased below-ground vascular plant biomass at the same sites. We interpret the increase in bacterial biomass as a response to a CO2-induced enhancement of Sphagnum exudation. The causes for the decrease of testate amoebae are unclear but could indicate a top-down rather than a bottom-up control on their density.

AB Typical sand caps used for sediment remediation have little sorption capacity to retard the migration of hydrophobic contaminants such as PAHs that can be mobilized by significant groundwater flow. Laboratory column experiments were performed using contaminated sediments and capping materials from a creosote contaminated USEPA Superfund site. Azoic laboratory column experiments demonstrated rapid breakthrough of lower molecular weight PAHs when groundwater seepage was simulated through a column packed with coarse sand capping material. After eight pore volumes of flow, most PAHs measured showed at least 50% of initial source pore water concentrations at the surface of 65 cm capping material. PAR concentration in the cap solids was low and comparable to background levels typically seen in urban depositional sediment, but the pore water concentrations were high. Column experiments with a peat amendment delayed PAH breakthrough. The most dramatic result was observed for caps amended with activated carbon at a dose of 2% by dry weight. PAN concentrations in the pore water of the activated carbon amended caps were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower (0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g/L for pyrene) than concentrations in the pore water of the source sediments (26.2 +/- 5.6 mu g/L for pyrene) even after several hundred pore volumes of flow. Enhancing the sorption capacity of caps with activated carbon amendment even at a lower dose of 0.2% demonstrated a significant impact on contaminant retardation suggesting consideration of active capping for field sites prone to groundwater upwelling or where thin caps are desired to minimize change in bathymetry and impacts to aquatic habitats.

AB The results of radiocarbon dating and dendrochronological investigations of timbers (mainly pine and oak) preserved in coastal peats on the Atlantic coast of mid-western Ireland are reported. These are complemented by the results of pollen analytical investigations, including a detailed pollen profile from Lough Atalia, a brackish lake located within present-day Galway city and immediately to the east of the medieval town. The results from the fossil timber investigations show that pine stumps exposed on coastal intertidal peats in mid-western Ireland date mainly to ca. 3000 BC, that is, they are coeval with the so-called pine flushes' on blanket bog in western Ireland. Many of the oak timbers are considerably older while an oak on peat in Turlin Bay, near Silverstrand, persisted until ca. 2100 BC. This fossil timber record, taken in conjunction with the pollen records, suggests conditions very different to those pertaining at present, including absence of direct marine influence because of relative sea levels (RSLs) that were probably at least 2 m, and possibly up to 4 m, lower than at present. Mid-Holocene conditions were less stormy, and lower precipitation and/or higher evapotranspiration facilitated tree colonisation of peat surfaces. Intertidal peat layers at Salthill show that present-day RSL began to be approached at ca. AD 500. This agrees with the evidence from An Loch Mor, Inis Oirr, which indicates that salinity in this brackish lake began to increase noticeably at/immediately prior to ca. AD 1000. A notable feature of the pollen record from L. Atalia is a yew (Taxus)-dominated woodland phase of ca. 600 years duration centred on 2550 BC. A major and widespread expansion of yew at about this time is a distinctive feature of mid-Holocene woodlands in western Ireland.

AB Comparisons between in situ CH4 concentration and potential factors controlling its net production were made in a temperate swamp. Seasonal measurements of water table level and depth profiles of pH, dissolved CN4, CO2, O-2, SO42-, NO3-, formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate were made at two adjacent sites 1.5 to 2 m apart. Dissolved CH4 was inversely correlated to O-2 and, in general, to NO3- and SO42-, potential inhibitors of methanogenesis. At low water table levels (August 1992), maximal CH4 (2 to 4 mu M) occurred below 30 cm, whereas at high water table levels (October 1992) or under flooded conditions (May 1993), CH4 maxima (4 to 55 mu M) occurred in the top 10 to 20 cm. Higher CH4 concentrations were likely supported by inputs of fresh organic matter from decaying leaf litter, as suggested by high acetate and propionate concentrations (25 to 100 mu M) in one of the sites in fall and spring. Measurements of potential CH4 production (and consumption) showed that the highest rates generally occurred in the top 10 cm of soil. Soil slurry incubations confirmed the importance of organic matter to CH4 production but also showed that competition for substrates by nonmethanogenic microorganisms could greatly attenuate its effect.

AB The ionome and stoichiometry of fen mosses have not yet been studied in extensive data sets despite their potential to explain ecological behaviour of the species and to indicate nutrient limitation or oversupply. We analysed element concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe) in apical parts of dominant peat and brown mosses along the complete pH/calcium gradient in fens of three Central European regions (the Western Carpathians, the Bohemian Massif and, marginally, the West-Bohemian mineral springs). We obtained data from 143 localities for 56 species, with the most replicates for calcium-tolerant Sphagnum warnstorfii. Tissue element concentrations were to a great extent determined by species identity, except for magnesium, iron, and potassium (in the potassium-poor region). Water chemistry determined substantially species' magnesium, potassium (in the potassium-poor region), and partially also calcium concentrations. Calcium and potassium concentrations were generally most predictable by water chemistry, water table depth (WTD), and species identity, while concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and especially iron were least predictable. Principal component analysis across the species showed the same two principal gradients in all regions. One reflected the ratios between iron and the other ions and the other the ratios between calcium + magnesium and other ions, sorting the species from calcicole (Scorpidium cossonii) to acidicole (Sphagnum fallax). Particular species differed strongly with respect to calcium concentration in both the biomass and the water, and median calcium concentration in a species coincided greatly with median concentration in the water. Tissue phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium also differed significantly among the species, but analogous coincidences with the concentrations in water were not found. The results for iron and magnesium were inconsistent between the regions. Within particular species, correlations between biomass and water element concentrations were either positive or negative, but largely nonsignificant. The rare moss Hamatocaulis vernicosus had higher element concentrations (except for nitrogen) than would be predicted from water chemistry, resembling the pattern of R-strategy plants. In the Western Carpathians, calcium concentrations in S. warnstorfii decreased significantly with WTD, becoming stabilised at around 5 mg/g at WTD > 15 cm. The inter-regional differences in species element concentrations were usually explainable by different iron, magnesium, and potassium concentrations in water, with signs of phosphorus immobilisation by iron such as generally higher N:P ratios in the iron- and simultaneously phosphorus-richer region (Bohemian Massif). Because moss chemical composition combines the effects of species identity and various effects of the environment, caution is needed in any meta-analysis.

AB Increased sulphate (SO4) export from wetlands following summer droughts in central Ontario, Canada has been associated with the delayed chemical recovery of downstream surface waters following decreased sulphur (S) emissions. Prolonged summer droughts result in a decrease or cessation of stream flow, declines in wetland water table level and oxidation of reduced S compounds to SO4, which is subsequently flushed into drainage streams when stream flow resumes. Sulphate input-output budget calculations (1983-1995 and 1999-2001) at a conifer Sphagnum swamp in the Plastic Lake catchment, indicate that SO4 is retained in most years but is exported on a net basis following particularly severe summer droughts that result in the cessation of stream flow for more than 54 days (95% CI: 41-72 days). Hindcast calculations using long-term (1916-2000) stream discharge records from a nearby station indicate that while droughts occurred frequently in south-central Ontario over the past 85 years, sufficiently dry conditions to cause net SO4 export occurred in only18 of the past 85 years, and indicate a cumulative positive SO4 balance for the swamp (i.e. net SO4 retention). Furthermore, the S pool at the Plastic Lake swamp has been estimated to be similar to 1500 kg S/ha in the upper 40 cm peat layer, which is large compared to the amount of net SO4 export that occurs even in years with particularly dry summers (e.g. -43 kg S/ha in 1987/88). Together, these data suggest that the wetland S pool at Plastic Lake has not been depleted by previous droughts and will continue to sustain episodic drought-related SO4 export for the foreseeable future.

AB By redistributing water and sediment in delta plains, avulsions of river branches have major environmental impacts, notably in changing hydrological and peat-forming conditions in floodbasins. The central part of the Rhine-Meuse delta, with its extensive databases including detailed lithological data and high-resolution age control, offers a unique opportunity to study middle-Holocene avulsion impacts on floodbasin groundwater level and peat formation. Avulsion has caused local accelerations of rising groundwater tables to be superimposed on decelerating base-level rise. This is evident from comparing single-site groundwater rise for multiple floodbasins in the river-dominated part of the delta, with regionally averaged groundwater-rise reconstructions. Floodbasin type (lacustrine versus terrestrial wetland), size and openness, partly through effects on discharge dispersal, affect how strongly the floodbasin groundwater tables respond to avulsion-diverted discharge. Cross-sectional lithology repeatedly indicates a shift from high-organic wood peat to low-organic reed peat in the vicinity of the avulsed channel, resulting from changes in water-table regime and nutrient status. Avulsive impact on the floodbasin groundwater table was most pronounced during the transition from transgressive to high-stand stage (between ca. 6000 and 4000 years ago), owing to developing floodbasin compartmentalization (size reduction, confinement) resulting from repeated avulsion. By way of environmental impacts on groundwater tables and vegetation, avulsions thus affect the heterogeneity of floodbasin facies.

AB Membrane inlet mass spectrometry was used to monitor dissolved gas concentrations (CO2, CH4 and O-2) in a mesotrophic peat core from Kopparas, Sweden.
   1 A comparison of depth profiles (down to 22 cm) with an ombrotrophic peat core (Ellergower, SW Scotland) investigated previously, revealed major differences in gas concentrations. Thus methane reached concentrations more than twice as high (800 muM) at depths greater than 12 cm in the Kopparas core. As shown previously, the primary determinant of the depth of the oxic zone is the level of the water table. Whereas in the Scottish cores, mass spectrometric detectability of O-2 was confined to the first 3 cm below this level, in the Swedish core penetration of O-2 was greater (7 cm). CO2 profiles were similar in cores from both locations.
   2 A thick layer of Sphagnum mosses dominated the plant cover of the Swedish peat core. A poorly developed deep root system, as distinct from that of the vascular plant cover in Scottish cores, diminished gas exchange rates, and presumably aerobic methane oxidation at depth around roots. These characteristics may contribute to the development of discontinuities in gas profiles at depths greater 15 cm as upward gas transport is established predominantly by diffusion and/or ebullition in the Swedish core.
   3 Monitoring gas concentrations at the peat surface and at 2 cm depth after changing water tables showed a delayed response of approximately 4 days as a result of the high water content and moisture-regulating capacity of mosses.
   4 Recovery processes at 2 cm depth after raising the water table revealed final production rates of dissolved CO2 and CH4 in the peat pore water between 0.8 and 4.4 mu mol h(-1) L-1 and between 0.1 and 1.7 mu mol h(-1) L-1, respectively. Higher production rates were found during the day, indicating a diurnal rhythm due to plant photosynthetic activity even at the low values of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR: 110 mu mol s(-1) m(-2)) used in the experimental set-up.
   5 In the water-logged mesotrophic Kopparas core changes of dissolved gas concentrations (DGC) at 3 and 14 cm depth were surface temperature-dependent rather than light dependent. This suggests that changes of air temperature alters the covering vegetation to increase the conductivity for dissolved gases through vascular plants and to facilitate gas transport by diffusion and/or ebullition.

AB 1. Current monitoring strategies of governmental organizations tend to be focused on relatively large flowing and standing waters, and until recently those polluted by point sources. Consequently areas of high conservation interest tend to be understudied, and defining reference conditions, as required by current legislation, is difficult to achieve.
   2. In order to address this imbalance, water samples have been collected and analysed once in each of four seasons during 2003 from 72 locations within a 100 km(2) area of the oligotrophic River Spey catchment in NE Scotland. The sampling design included examples of running water (headwater streams and the main rivers) and standing water (lochs, lochans, pools, ditches, backwaters, bogs). Attitude ranged from 220 to 980 in and incorporated a climatic regime from cool temperate to subalpine. Each sampling campaign targeted low-flow conditions to evaluate steady-state nutrient concentrations.
   3. Concentrations of the major soluble nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus demonstrated high spatial and temporal variability, with soluble organic and molybdate unreactive forms generally being dominant. Concentrations of ammonium-N, nitrate-N and soluble reactive phosphorus were extremely small, with 50% of samples falling below 8, 5 and 1 mu g L-1, respectively, during spring and summer.
   4. Sampling sites were grouped either by water-body type or by the properties of their immediate biophysical zone. Together these two groupings explained 33-38% of the variance in water chemistry. Certain changes were detectable across most habitats and biophysical zones.
   5. A decline in the concentration of nitrate that occurred in reaches downstream from certain headwater streams draining the mountain areas indicated the potential for its within-stream utilization. Inorganic N dynamics differed between small streams and large rivers.
   6. Landscape scale patterns were recorded in spring and summer nutrient availability with inorganic N and P thresholds (arbitrarily defined) of 10 and 1 mu g L-1, respectively. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water movement in hillslopes is determined by the subsurface characteristics that control flow paths connecting precipitation to stream flow. The hydrological response of hillslopes is notoriously non-linear and non-stationary; with the relative importance of vertical and lateral flow paths also depending on event characteristics and antecedent conditions. In northern boreal regions, climate change projections indicate that wetter and warmer winter conditions are likely to generate more extreme flood events. Here, we report a study from an upland catchment in northern Scotland where a monitoring year provided an opportunity to contextualise observations during the hillslope response to a winter rainfall event that locally caused the most extreme flooding for over 200 years. Monitoring the hillslope water table, soil moisture and isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and stream flow provided invaluable insight into hillslope-riparian coupling. Groundwater with a shallow water table ( < 0.05 m deep) in poorly drained valley bottom drift deposits maintained almost fully saturated and stream-connected peat soil profiles in riparian areas. In the wettest periods, the groundwater beneath the peat was artesian. On steeper hillslopes, soils were drier and the water table was generally deeper (0.5-1 m below ground level), though the profile could fully saturate and groundwater levels reach the surface during the wettest period. Groundwater in deeper wells typically showed an anti-clockwise hysteresis compared to stream flow, and peak levels typically lagged behind the stream by a few hours in the valley bottom and > 1 day in the upper hillslope. In contrast, shallower wells in the soil profiles in the riparian area showed a more responsive perched groundwater system with transmissivity feedback in the upper soil layers resulting in much more rapid responses which generally peaked before the stream and exhibited clockwise hysteresis. Analysis of stable isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and streamflow, indicated that groundwater was remarkably well mixed with limited fractionation effects, inferring precipitation on the upper, unconfined hillslopes was the dominant source of recharge - particularly during the winter. The study shows that groundwater plays two roles in generating stream flow: a constant baseflow supply to the stream and time varying-exfiltration into the edge of the riparian zone, which contributes to surface runoff during storm events.

AB 1 In order to test whether the observed invasion of ombrotrophic bogs in the Netherlands by Molinia caerulea and Betula pubescens is the result of long-term high nitrogen (N) loads, we conducted a 3-year fertilization experiment with Sphagnum fallax turfs. Six different N treatments were applied ranging from 0 (control) to 4 g N m(-2) year(-1).
   2 During the experimental period, ammonium concentrations in the peat moisture remained very low due to high uptake rates by Sphagnum. Tissue N concentrations in S. fallax showed a linear response to the experimental N addition. Excess N was accumulated as N-rich free amino acids such as arginine, asparagine and glutamine, especially at N addition rates of 0.25 g m(-2) year(-1) or higher, indicating N-saturation.
   3 Despite the high tissue N : P ratio (above 35), above-ground biomass production by Molinia was still stimulated at N addition rates of 4 g m(-2) year(-1), and foliar nutrient concentrations were unaffected compared to the control. In contrast to Molinia, Betula was unable to increase its above-ground biomass. Foliar N concentrations in Betula were significantly higher at N addition rates of 4 g m(-2) year(-1) and excess N was stored in foliar arginine, making up 27% of the total N concentration. Evapotranspiration was increased at higher N addition rates due to stimulated total above-ground biomass production of the vegetation.
   4 N addition at the actual Dutch deposition rate of 4 g m(-2) year(-1) stimulated the growth of Molinia in this experiment, providing evidence that the observed dominance of Molinia on ombrotrophic bogs in the Netherlands is caused by high N deposition levels. Based on the observed changes in biomass production and tissue nutrient concentrations, we assume that a long-term deposition of 0.5 g N m(-2) year(-1), or higher, leads to undesirable changes in species composition and increased risk of desiccation.

AB The Pleistocene deposits of Schoningen represent an outstanding geological and archaeological archive, where an up to 45 m thick Middle to Late Pleistocene succession has been preserved and unique artefacts from the Lower Palaeolithic have been discovered. The preservation of such a thick and complete glacial/interglacial succession is very rare in the geological record and requires a specific depositional setting. We will present a new depositional model for the Pleistocene succession of Schoningen, integrating outcrop data, borehole data and high-resolution shear wave seismics. A total of four outcrop sections and 744 borehole logs were examined to document the complex facies architecture. All collected sedimentological and geophysical data sets were integrated into a high-resolution 3D geological model (GOCAD (R)) for reconstructing the spatial distribution of fades associations and the large-scale depositional architecture. The spatial distribution of the artefacts will be discussed with respect to the depositional environment.
   The Elsterian and Holsteinian deposits are restricted to a NNW-SSE trending, elongated trough, which is deeply incised into unconsolidated lignite-bearing Palaeogene deposits. The geometry of this erosional structure points to a tunnel valley origin that was incised below the Elsterian ice sheet. The basal tunnel valley fill consists of cross-stratified pebbly sand and gravel overlain by till. After deglaciation the tunnel valley remained underfilled and acted as a depocentre for interglacial deposition. During the subsequent Holsteinian interglacial (MIS 9) a lake formed within this depocentre and lacustrine sediments accumulated. This interglacial succession consists of peat, organic-rich silt and fine-grained sand interpreted as lake-bottom and deltaic sediments fed by surface run-off shed from the Elm ridge. The lacustrine deposition was controlled by repeated lake-level fluctuations in the range of 1-6 m leading to the formation of laterally stacked delta systems. These lake-level changes were probably triggered by climate, causing variations of precipitation and surface run-off. During the late Saalian glaciation the remnant tunnel valley was completely filled with meltwater deposits. The sedimentary facies and depositional architecture point to a shallow-water delta. Subsequently the meltwater deposits were overlain by till.
   The deposition of the Middle Pleistocene sediments within an Elsterian tunnel valley explains the unique preservation of the sedimentary succession of Schoningen. The long-lived interglacial lake provided an attractive site for animals and early humans ambushing them. Artefacts mainly became embedded on the delta plain, which rapidly was transgressed during lake-level rise and artefacts were thus preserved. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although erosion and runoff can contribute to loss of P, the large amount of fertilizer applied causes a rapid build-up of this nutrient, resulting in the downward movement of excess P in the soil profile and subsequent loss through tile drainage water. For arable organic soils, these losses often occur through subsurface tile drains, a common requirement to maintain a favorable air-water balance in the crop root zone, as well as to prevent soil subsidence. As such, subsurface drainage is a major pathway for agricultural P loss, contributing to persistent eutrophication of rivers, lakes, and estuaries globally. Although studies have been conducted on P mitigation within organic soils, application of drainage water management (DWM) as a P mitigation strategy in these soils, has not been extensively studied. The objective of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge by reviewing previous studies on P losses from subsurface drained agricultural organic soils while evaluating potential mitigation strategies. Specifically, this paper assesses the unique properties of organic soils that could influence P fate and transport, such as the distribution of P pools within the soil pools; variable pore geometry, hydrophobicity, and shrinkage; P loads exiting tile drains; and DWM practices in mitigating P losses. It is concluded that P retention is affected by the dynamic nature of soil water movement in organic soils and that substantial P loads enter surrounding water bodies via subsurface drainage effluent. There is evidence that DWM is an effective best management practice in the abatement of subsurface P losses.

AB The relevance of the research is caused by the need to assess the existing engineering geological conditions, processes, and hazards, as well as the risks and impacts related to them with respect to the intended use of the site of the Beregovoe Field of Purovsky District, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. A necessary preliminary step in development of the project is the analysis of engineering-geological data of the construction site.
   The main aim of the research is to create the engineering-geological map of the deposit for assessing the situation and forecasting the changes engineering geological conditions according to the results of the performed geotechnical investigations.
   Objects of researches are surface features and subsurface earth materials for design and construction of the Beregovoe field exploration.
   Methods: the analysis of engineering-geological surveys, detailed lithological-genetic analysis of the territory, taking into account the regularities of the spatial variability of the main indicators of engineering-geological conditions (composition of soils, their temperature, distribution of permafrost and engineering-geological processes).
   Results. The authors identified six types of areas: A (lakes and marshes); B (drained lake); C (riverside); D (hilly ridge); E (linear ridge) and F (man-made soils). The results of the field works and laboratory investigations of geotechnical properties of soils allowed detailing a preliminary assessment of the engineering-geocryological conditions. The main part of the route passes through riparian areas C. The most unfavorable for construction of facilities and pipeline are terrain types: A (found locally in the lowlands, represented by marshes with a capacity of peat to 2,2 m) and B (has wide distribution, represented by wetlands, folded clay soils with no surface runoff). The types D and Fare not met on the route. We recommend placing the linear structures of pipelines on well-drained upland sites spread thawed soils.

AB Boreal wetlands, primarily peatlands, are important global carbon (C) reservoirs and integral components of regional hydrological networks. This paper summarizes our current state of knowledge regarding components of water and nutrient budgets in northern wetlands, with a focus on Canada. Boreal wetland water budgets are strongly influenced by the following: seasonal weather patterns as they relate to the timing of precipitation and meltwater inputs and evapotranspiration (ET) losses; vegetation cover in the wetland and surrounding uplands as it relates to rain and snow interception and evapotranspiration; and connectivity of the wetland to the regional hydrological network. Key factors that influence boreal wetland phosphorus (P) budgets are: spatial and temporal variability in the water table as they relate to reduction-oxidation conditions and rewetting of highly decomposed peat; concentrations of metals and ions involved in P complexation and release; vegetation age and type (herbaceous versus woody); and seasonal weather patterns as they relate to water retention time. As with other components of the boreal forest, wetlands are often limited in bioavailable nitrogen (N), therefore bulk deposition and symbiotic fixation are key N sources. Within many wetlands, N is rapidly cycled through vegetation and microbial communities, and converted to gaseous N or exported as organic N in outflows. In terms of C budgets, boreal wetlands are important reservoirs, converting inorganic and organic C inputs to peat. Climate change and anthropogenic N loading threaten the water and C balance in boreal wetlands.

AB Long-term effects of liming on concentrations of minerals in needles and soil water and peat soil properties in a 29-year-old Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) stand in Northern Ireland were investigated. Liming resulted in increased concentrations of P, Ca, S, Mn and Fe in the peat. It also lowered the average water-table depth during the growing season (March-September). Although the pH in the litter layer of limed plots was still high 26 years after lime application compared with unlimed plots (pH = 3.59), re-acidification of the litter layer was apparent. The pH in the below-litter layers was increased by lime application to a depth of at least 30 cm. Concentrations of Ca and S in the litter layer and top 30 cm of the peat profile and concentrations of P, Mn and Al in the litter layer and top 5 cm of the peat profile were increased by liming. In contrast, concentration of K in the litter layer and concentration of Zn in the 5-25 cm depth of the peat profile were decreased by liming. Concentration of P in needles was increased as a result of liming. Lime had no effect on soil water pH, but lime application increased concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe2+ and decreased concentrations of Zn2+ and Al3+ in the soil water. In February, concentration of NH4+-N in the soil water increased in plots which had received 7.5 t ha(-1) and decreased in plots which had received 22.5 t ha(-1) lime, compared with unlimed plots. Tree growth and fine-root distribution into the peat were highest in the plots which had received lime at 15 t ha(-1), and fine-root growth in these plots was higher than in the unlimed plots. Therefore, it is likely that a further application of lime at 15 t ha(-1) as the best dosage for increasing tree growth would serve to prevent soil acidification. Lime doses and time after initial lime application are important factors affecting nutrient leaching.

AB Temperate grasslands on organic soils are diverse due to edaphic properties but also to regional management practices and this heterogeneity is reflected in the wide range of greenhouse gas (GHG) flux values reported in the literature. In Ireland, most grasslands on organic soils were drained several decades ago and are managed as extensive pastures with little or no fertilisation. This study describes a 2-year study of the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of two such sites. We determined GHG fluxes and waterborne carbon (C) emissions in a nutrient-rich grassland and compared it with values measured from two nutrient-poor organic soils: a deep-drained and a shallow-drained site. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were determined using the chamber technique, and fluvial C fluxes were estimated by combining drainage water concentrations and flows.
   The nutrient-rich site was an annual source of CO2 (233 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), CH4 neutral, and a small source of N2O (0.16 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at the shallow-drained nutrient-poor site was -89 and -99 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Years 1 and 2 respectively, and NEE at the deep-drained nutrient-poor site was 85 and -26 g C m(-2) yr(-1) respectively. Low CH4 emissions (1.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) were recorded at the shallow-drained nutrient-poor site. Fluvial exports from the nutrient-rich site totalled 69.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with 54% as dissolved organic C. Waterborne C losses from the nutrient-poor site reflected differences in annual runoff totalling 44 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 30.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 2.
   The NECB of the nutrient-rich grassland was 663 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with biomass exports being the major component accounting for 53 %. The NECB of the nutrient-poor deep-drained site was less than half of the nutrient-rich site (2-year mean 267 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Although NEE at the nutrient-poor shallow-drained site was negative in both years, high biomass export meant it was a net C source (2-year mean NECB 103 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). While the impacts of the nutrient and drainage status on NEE, biomass exports and fluvial C losses were confirmed, inter-regional differences in management practice and climate were also significant factors which impacted on the overall NECB of these ecosystems. Contrary to expectation, the NECB of nutrient-poor drained organic soils under grasslands is not necessarily a large C source and this has implications for Ireland's choice of national GHG inventory reporting methodologies. This study can also aid the development of strategies to deliver reduced emissions tailored to local grassland types.

AB This study examined the hydrological impact of harvesting aspen (Populus tremuloides) within the subhumid Boreal Plains of Alberta, Canada, following clear-cutting of two stands in successive winters within a small catchment situated in glacial moraine. Impacts were evaluated using a combination of observational data collected from within the harvested catchment and an adjacent reference catchment and numerical simulations conducted with HydroGeoSphere. Sensitivity simulations evaluated the influence of post-harvest evapotranspiration rates and variability in atmospheric conditions on the range of hydrologic response. Study results indicate that aspen harvesting had limited impact on groundwater levels and streamflows within these hydrologic systems because of the subhumid climate with low frequency of large storms, large soil-moisture storage capacity of heterogeneous glacial materials, and high evapotranspiration rates of regenerating aspen. Despite an estimated increase in hillslope groundwater levels of up to 3 m, pond and peatland water levels increased by less than 0.3 m and were accompanied by increased streamflows of less than 10 mm. However, predicted increases in groundwater levels and streamflows were sensitive to regenerating aspen evapotranspiration rates, which can be enhanced by appropriate harvesting techniques but may be reduced by climate change. These results are consistent with previous results from within the Boreal Plains but differ from aspen harvesting studies conducted in other settings where appreciable increases in streamflows have been reported. This disparity highlights the need to consider the integrated response of the hydrologic system when evaluating impacts from disturbance and making comparisons between settings.

AB Responses of wetland productivity to changes in water table depth (WTD) are controlled by complex interactions among several soil and plant processes, and hence are site-specific rather than general in nature. Hydrological controls on wetland productivity were studied by representing these interactions in connected hummock and hollow sites in the ecosystem model ecosys, and by testing CO2 and energy fluxes from the model with those measured by eddy co-variance (EC) during years with contrasting WTD in a shrub fen at Lost Creek, WI. Modelled interactions among coupled processes for O-2 transfer, O-2 uptake, C oxidation, N mineralization, N uptake and C fixation by diverse microbial, root and mycorrhizal populations enabled the model to simulate complex responses of CO2 exchange to changes in WTD that depended on the WTD at which change was occurring. At the site scale, greater WTD caused the model to simulate greater CO2 influxes and effluxes over hummocks vs. hollows, as has been found at field sites. At the landscape scale, greater WTD caused the model to simulate greater diurnal CO2 influxes and effluxes under cooler weather when water tables were shallow, but also smaller diurnal CO2 influxes and effluxes under warmer weather when water tables were deeper, as was also apparent in the EC flux measurements. At an annual time scale, these diurnal responses to WTD in the model caused lower net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (R-h), but higher net ecosystem productivity (NEP = NPP - R-h), to be simulated in a cooler year with a shallower water table than in a warmer year with a deeper one. This difference in NEP was consistent with those estimated from gap-filled EC fluxes in years with different water tables at Lost Creek and at similar boreal fens elsewhere. In sensitivity tests of the model, annual NEP declined with increasing WTD in a year with a shallow water table, but rose in a year with a deeper one. The model thus provided an integrated set of hypotheses for explaining site-specific and sometimes contrasting responses of wetland productivity to changes in WTD as found in different field experiments.

AB The study presents designating, accomplishing, optimizing, and validating a new tool- "passive sampler" (PS) that can be effectively used as a proxy to assess the level of traffic-related pollution. To construct the PS, a drainage pipe filled with a mixture of coarse sand and peat in a volume ratio of 1:1 was used; this was previously verified to exhibit high ability to accumulate pollutants. Magnetic methods supplemented with chemical method evaluating heavy metal content and electron microscopic observations were used to detect the effectiveness of the PS. The PS was validated in Warsaw, Poland, by observing the capacity and trends in the accumulation of traffic-related heavy metals as well as magnetic particles and by comparison of the properties of magnetic fraction of PS filling and street dust collected from the surface of road. A depth decreasing trend in distributions of magnetic susceptibility related to the concentration of magnetic particles and the content of heavy metals confirmed a very strong accumulation of pollution in the surface layer of samplers and their depth-migration. Magnetic fraction of PS filling and street dust revealed similarities in terms of magnetic mineralogy, grain size, domain state, morphology, and chemical composition. The good correlation of concentration of magnetic particles with traffic-related heavy metals indicates their similar transport pathway from road to sampler. Passive sampler is a compact, mobile, low-cost tool that does not require electricity for installation and can be effectively used for the identification of traffic-derived pollution. Moreover, the PS can overcome disadvantages of street dust arising from different geological backgrounds, cleaning of the road surface, runoff of deposited dust, etc., which cause the underestimation of pollution level.

AB This study concerns in situ fluidization (ISF), a new remediation method with potential application to the remediation of NAPL and heavy metal contaminants, by their release from the fluidized zone generated by a water jet. The present study examines the effect of ISF on layers of peat, of significance owing to its role as an important NAPL and metal contaminant trap. Once trapped, such contaminants are not readily accessible by most remedial methods, due to the low permeability and diffusivity of the peat. A simple tank experiment is used to demonstrate rupture of a peat layer by ISF, with removal of the peat as elutriated fines and segregated peat chunks. The application of ISF in the field is then examined by three field trials in uncontaminated sands, in both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Fluidized depths of up to 1.9 m in the saturated zone (with refusal on a peat layer) and 2.5 m in the unsaturated zone (no refusal) were attained, using a 1.9-m-long, 50 mm diameter jet operated at 5-13 l s(-1). Pulses of dark turbidity and shell fragments in the effluent indicated the rupture of peat and shelly layers. The experiments demonstrate the hydraulic viability of ISF in the field, and its ability to remove peat-based contaminants. The issues of appropriate jet design and water generation during ISF are discussed, followed by a preliminary economic analysis of ISF relative to existing remediation methods.

AB Until recently, restoration measures in Dutch brook valley meadows consisted of re-introducing traditional management techniques, such as mowing without fertilisation and low-intensity grazing. In the Netherlands, additional measures, such as rewetting and sod cutting, are now carried out on a large scale to combat negative influences of drainage and acidifying influences by atmospheric deposition. An analysis of successful and unsuccessful projects shows that restoration of brook valley meadows is most successful if traditional management techniques are applied in recently abandoned fields that had not been drained or fertilised. Large-scale topsoil removal in former agricultural fields that had been used intensively for several decades is often unsuccessful since seed banks are depleted, while hydrological conditions and seed dispersal mechanisms are sub-optimal. In areas with an organic topsoil, long-term drainage had often led to irreversible changes in chemical and physical properties of the soil. Successful sites were all characterised by a regular discharge of calcareous groundwater provided by local or regional hydrological systems, and, where not very long ago, populations of target species existed. On mineral soils, in particular, sod removal in established nature reserves was a successful measure to increase the number of endangered fen meadow species. It is argued that attempts to restore species-rich meadows should be avoided on former agricultural fields, where pedological processes have led to almost irreversible changes in the soil profile and where soil seed banks have been completely depleted. From a soil conservation point of view, such areas should be exploited as eutrophic wetlands that are regularly flooded.

AB The construction industry is a large contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, the industry has begun to consider sustainability alongside technical merit, cost and programme when analysing construction options. Construction on peaty soils is challenging and often requires extensive ground improvement which can in itself be carbon intensive, while also generating further emissions where peat is removed. Stabilisation (soil mixing) is a ground improvement technique in which a soft soil such as peat is mixed with a cementitious binder in situ. While life cycle assessments have been carried out on soil mixing scenarios from cradle-to-site, the effect of the process on carbon stocks post construction has not been considered to date, hindering cradle-to-grave assessments. In this research, stabilised peat has been shown to be a small sink of CO2. An extensive laboratory study has investigated the key factors impacting carbonation rates (and thus CO2 intake rates) in stabilised peats. The study revealed that time and a greater surcharge magnitude contributed to a greater carbonation depth, while increased cement content and the presence of a high water table decreased carbonation depth. Carbonation k-rate factors exceed those typical of concrete. This quantitative evidence of the impact of peat stabilisation on embodied carbon levels post construction will enable geotechnical engineers to carry out more representative environmental appraisals of soil mixing schemes. In broader terms, data of this type are important in steering engineers and policy makers towards cleaner production and sustainable practices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Restoration of eroded blanket peatlands through revegetation and gully blocking is observed to also deliver significant natural flood management (NFM) benefits (reduce and delay floodpeaks). But there is a lack of clear understanding regarding how different catchment processes interact/counteract under each intervention scenario. We seek to provide more insight by rigorously calibrating TOPMODEL rainfall-runoff model to different experimental catchments each representing an intervention scenario. Through numerical experimentation with the calibrated parameters, we estimate the impact-magnitude of different processes. Our findings confirm the NFM benefits of these restoration-focused interventions. In both interventions and in our largest storms, both the delay and reduced floodpeaks are primarily due to surface roughness reducing the floodwave speed thus thickening the overland flow; we conceptualize this as an increase in a "kinematic storage." Impact of gully blocking in increasing kinematic storage is very significant and comparable to that of revegetation alone. Interventions' impact on "static storage" (interception + ponding + evapotranspiration) becomes important for smaller storms. Although interventions always increase lag times, they can be less effective in reducing peak magnitude when maximum rainfall intensity is sustained for durations longer than mean catchment delay. We propose two approaches to further increase catchment's static and kinematic storage. Finally, while our field-scale numerical study contributes to the evidence-base for NFM's effectiveness, it also provides a basis for modeling these interventions in the future. Such catchment-scale numerical studies are necessary to extend our findings to spatial scales where flooding can cause socioeconomic damage, and to provide a tool for optimizing the distributed configuration of these interventions.

AB Untangling the relationships between morphology and phylogeny is key to building a reliable taxonomy, but is especially challenging for protists, where the existence of cryptic or pseudocryptic species makes finding relevant discriminant traits difficult. Here we use Hyalosphenia papilio (a testate amoeba) as a model species to investigate the contribution of phylogeny and phenotypic plasticity in its morphology. We study the response of H. papilio morphology (shape and pores number) to environmental variables in (i) a manipulative experiment with controlled conditions (water level), (ii) an observational study of a within-site natural ecological gradient (water level), and (iii) an observational study across 37 European peatlands (climate). We showed that H. papilio morphology is correlated to environmental conditions (climate and water depth) as well as geography, while no relationship between morphology and phylogeny was brought to light. The relative contribution of genetic inheritance and phenotypic plasticity in shaping morphology varies depending on the taxonomic group and the trait under consideration. Thus, our data call for a reassessment of taxonomy based on morphology alone. This clearly calls for a substantial increase in taxonomic research on these globally still under-studied organisms leading to a reassessment of estimates of global microbial eukaryotic diversity.

AB Oil sands mining in Alberta transforms the boreal landscape of forests and wetlands into open pits, tailings ponds and overburden piles. Whereas reclamation efforts have primarily focused on upland forests, rebuilding wetland systems has recently become a motivation for research. Wetland creation and sustainability in this region is complicated by the sub-humid climate and salinity of underlying mining material. In 2012, Syncrude Canada Ltd. completed the construction of the Sandhill Fen Watershed (SFW), a 52-ha upland-wetland system to evaluate wetland reclamation strategies on soft tailings. SFW includes an active pumping system, upland hummocks, a fen wetland and underdrains. To evaluate the influence of management practices on the hydrology of the system, this study reports the water balance from January 2013 to December 2014, the first 2years after commissioning. A semi-distributed approach was taken to examine the fluxes and stores of water in uplands and lowlands. Natural and artificial inputs and outputs were measured using a series of precipitation gauges and pumps, and evapotranspiration was quantified using three eddy covariance towers. A series of near surface wells recorded water table position. Both 2013 and 2014 were normal rainfall years, with 2013 having more and 2014 less snow than normal. In 2013, inflow/outflow from pumping was the predominant hydrological fluxes, resulting in considerable variability in water table position and storage changes throughout the summer. In 2014, the artificial addition of water was negligible, yet the water table remained near the surface in lowland locations, suggesting that wetland conditions could be maintained under current conditions. Evapotranspiration rates between uplands and lowlands were similar between years and sites, ranging from 2.2 +/- 1.8 to 2.5 +/- 1.2mm/day and were largely controlled by climate. These rates were less than nearby older upland systems, suggesting that water balance partitioning will change as vegetation develops. Comparison between years and with natural systems provides insight on how management practices influence hydrologic dynamics and the overall water balance of the SFW.

AB Habitat associations of upper Volga river fishes are defined within a cycle of spawning, feeding and overwintering migrations. The migration cycles of resident riverine fishes are categorized as obligate rheophils, limno-rheophils and limnophils. Forty-four fish species in 14 families occurred in the upper Volga River before regulation. Four mainstem reservoirs were constructed on the upper Volga between 1937 and 1957: Ivankovo, Uglich, Rybinsk and Gorky. They are maintained in a stage of delayed and sustained annual flood pulse. Additional impacts of reservoir construction include the creation of a new pelagic habitat, replacement of floodplains by lacustrine littoral and sublittoral habitats, creation of a complex bathyal habitat from former river channels and replacement of riverine flow patterns by pelagic water mass circulations. Populations of rheophilic species declined, while a new pelagophilic fish guild developed. Forty-six fish species are now present; seven species were lost and nine introduced after impoundment. Spawning, feeding and wintering habitats are outlined for reservoir guilds. Ichthyomass increased three to four times following reservoir construction and commercial fish harvest from Rybinsk Reservoir between 1945 and 1992 ranged from 2220 to 4304 t/y. Reservoirs of the upper Volga have limited bioproductivity due to a deficiency and uneven distribution of reproductive habitats, decreasing bottom irregularity, seasonal anomalies of flooding and draining of the littoral and sublittoral and underestimating the importance of tributaries. Lack of littoral reproductive habitat can be remedied by increasing the area of protected littoral through the construction of chains of small islands, diking and reclamation of bogged areas. Improved reproduction of migrating local stocks can be achieved by removing sand bars across tributary mouths, construction of artificial spawning grounds and restoration and preservation of preferred habitats in the main channel.

AB In the oil sands mining region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, strategies to construct wetlands and peatlands and methods to evaluate their success are just beginning. Reclamation of wetlands is particularly challenging in this region as growing seasons are short, precipitation is variable and often limiting, and the presence of elevated salinity associated with the mining process can be harmful to vegetation. As part of their reclamation programme, Syncrude Canada Ltd constructed a series of test plots (termed cells) to examine specific procedures and management strategies associated with wetland reclamation. In this study, water balance of 12 cells (each similar to 400m(2) in area) with different soil and vegetation treatments were studied over two growing seasons to understand the influence of soil salvage, vegetation, and placement strategy on water balance components. Cells were constructed in (i) the summer or winter, (ii) with either stockpiled material planted with vegetation or with soils directly transplanted from a nearby wetland and (iii) with soil depths of 15, 50 and 100 cm. Cells were built on a liner to eliminate leakage and were watered using an irrigation system along with receiving precipitation inputs. In 2010, cells were irrigated between similar to 100 and 400 mm, and water tables were maintained at or near the surface for the duration of the growing season at most cells. In 2011, watering was reduced considerably, and water tables were on average much lower. Evapotranspiration (ET) losses measured using lysimetres varied throughout the season and among cells. ET rates were greater in 2010 than in 2011 because of wet conditions at the surface, and cells placed in the winter and with shallower organic soils (15 cm) also had enhanced ET. Cumulative water balance suggests that some cells had considerable leakage despite being constructed atop a geotextile. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recently, evapotranspiration has been hypothesized to promote the secondary formation of calcium carbonate year-round on tree islands in the Everglades by influencing groundwater ions concentrations. However, the role of recharge and evapotranspiration as drivers of shallow groundwater ion accumulation has not been investigated. The goal of this study is to develop a hydrologic model that predicts the chloride concentrations of shallow tree island groundwater and to determine the influence of overlying biomass and underlying geologic material on these concentrations. Groundwater and surface water levels and chloride concentrations were monitored on eight constructed tree islands at the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA) from 2007 to 2010. The tree islands at LILA were constructed predominately of peat, or of peat and limestone, and were planted with saplings of native tree species in 2006 and 2007. The model predicted low shallow groundwater chloride concentrations when inputs of regional groundwater and evapotranspiration-to-recharge rates were elevated, while low evapotranspiration-to-recharge rates resulted in a substantial increase of the chloride concentrations of the shallow groundwater. Modeling results indicated that evapotranspiration typically exceeded recharge on the older tree islands and those with a limestone lithology, which resulted in greater inputs of regional groundwater. A sensitivity analysis indicated the shallow groundwater chloride concentrations were most sensitive to alterations in specific yield during the wet season and hydraulic conductivity in the dry season. In conclusion, the inputs of rainfall, underlying hydrologic properties of tree islands sediments and forest structure may explain the variation in ion concentration seen across Everglades tree islands.

AB Late Holocene volcanic activity at Ruapehu has been characterized by the generation of small (< 10(5) m(3)) to very large (> 10(7) m(3)) lahars and repeated, small to medium (VEI 1-3) tephra-producing eruptions. The Onetapu Formation groups all lahar deposits that accumulated during the last 2,000 years on the southeastern Ruapehu ring plain. The andesitic tephras are grouped within the Tufa Trig Formation and are intercalated within the laharic sequence. By correlating these two formations with new radiocarbon ages obtained on interbedded paleosols, we reconstruct a detailed volcanic history of Ruapehu for this period.
   Clast assemblages identified in the laharic sequences record the lithologies of synchronous tephras and rocks within the source region. These assemblages suggest a strong genetic link between the development of Crater Lake, the variation in eruptive styles, and the production of lahars.
   Lahar-triggering mechanisms include: (1) flank collapse of hydrothermally altered and unstable portions of the cone; (2) phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions favoring the generation of snow-rich slurries and hyperconcentrated stream flows; ( 3) sudden Crater Lake rim collapse, releasing large amounts of water inducing debris flows; and ( 4) eruptions that generate large volumes of tephra on snow-covered slopes, later remobilized by heavy rain.
   Two major lahars in the Onetapu sequence had a volume greater than or equal to 4 x 10(7) m(3), roughly 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than the 1953 event leading to the Tangiwai disaster (151 casualties). One of these lahars crossed over a low interfluve currently separating the Whangaehu River from a stream feeding the Tongariro River, sometime since peat accumulated between AD 1400 and AD 1660. A repetition of such a large-scale event would have devastating consequences on the infrastructure, economy and environment within the distal areas of the two catchments. The 1995 - 1996 eruptions were a timely reminder of the hazards posed by the volcano.

AB With the aim of addressing the broader issues of land use, climate change and energy crisis, eddy covariance measurements of energy and CO2 exchange from a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinaceae, L) cultivated on a drained organic soil (a cutover peatland) in eastern Finland were initiated in the spring of 2004. Based on the climatically diverse dataset from the 2004 to 2010 period, the objectives of the work presented here are to characterize the interannual variability in water vapor exchange and to understand the linkage between energy and CO2 exchange from this perennial crop during two extreme growing seasons. Correcting the measured soil heat flux by accounting for the change in heat storage above the heat flux plates helped close the energy balance at this site. Interannual variability in ecosystem processes of energy and CO2 exchange were attributed primarily to marked differences in the amount and distribution of seasonal precipitation. Differences in the phonological development of the crop during seasons with contrasting climatic conditions were reflected in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated from the radiation instruments installed on the tower. Wet years were characterized by an even distribution of seasonal precipitation, low to moderate air and soil temperatures, lower solar and net radiation intensities (owing to reduced number of bright sunshine hours and therefore, higher amount of diffuse sky radiation), moderate to saturated soil moisture conditions and lower vapor pressure deficit. These climatic conditions resulted in high bulk surface conductance (g(s)), high evapotranspiration (ET) and low sensible heat flux with a peak seasonal Bowen ratio (beta = 0.1). These conditions were favourable for a high uptake of atmospheric CO2. Dry years, on the contrary, were marked by long dry spells during important phases of crop growth, climatic and soil moisture stress leading to high evaporative demand, low g(s) values, reduced evapotranspiration and high sensible heat flux (beta = 0.3-0.4). On a seasonal basis, the ET losses during a dry year were 13% lower compared to those during a wet year. The corresponding reduction in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), however, was to the extent of 21%. Owing to the ability of this perennial crop to sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon into its above- and below-ground biomass, the water use efficiency (defined as the slope of the linear regression of monthly values of GEP against ET) of this cultivation system was found to be 9.1 g CO2 per kg of H2O lost as ET. The results stemming from this work further support our earlier conclusions that this bioenergy system is a suitable land use option on drained and abandoned cutover peatlands with a high potential for offsetting CO2 load to the atmosphere.

AB Water loss by evapotranspiration (ET) is a principal component of the hydrologic cycle in wetlands. Using micrometeorological techniques, we measured ET from a Sphagnum-dominated open fen in northcentral Minnesota (U.S.A.) from May to October in 1991 and 1992. The daily ET rate ranged from 0.2-4.8 mm d(-1) with a growing season average of 3.0 mm d(-1). The evapotranspiration rate of the fen was near the potential rate of open water evaporation when the vascular plants were actively growing and the water table level was within or above the rooting zone. Using a dual-source modification of the Penman-Monteith equation (Massman, 1992), we partitioned the measured ET into evaporation from the non-vascular Sphagnum surfaces and transpiration from vascular plants. The analysis indicated that about two thirds of the water vapour flux to the atmosphere was from evaporation when the Sphagnum surface was wet. Such an evaporative flux was expected because of vertical distribution of vascular plant leaves which had a small leaf area index (0.4-0.7) and intercepted only about 30% of net radiation (R(n)) during the day. The remainder of R(n) was thus available for evaporation from Sphagnum. Evaporation significantly decreased as the Sphagnum surface dried out. When the water table was within the rooting zone (0-0.4 m), the vascular plants absorbed Sphagnum-generated sensible heat, which amounted up to one third of their transpiration energy flux. Under these conditions, the total water vapour flux remained near its potential rate owing to the enhanced transpiration from vascular plants. A drop in water table of 0.15-0.2 m below the hollow bottom during vascular plant senescence resulted in ET rates lower than the potential rates by 5-65%.

AB Microcosms were used to determine the influence of N additions on active bacterial and fungal biomass, atrazine and dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) mineralization at 5, 10 and 15 weeks in soils from blackwater and redwater wetland forest ecosystems in the northern Florida Panhandle. Active bacterial and fungal biomass was determined by staining techniques combined with direct microscopy. Atrazine and 2,4-D mineralization were measured radiometrically. Treatments were: soil type, (blackwater or redwater forested wetland soils) and N additions (soils amended with the equivalent of 0, 200 or 400 kg N ha(-1) as NH4NO3). Redwater soils contained higher concentrations of C, total N, P, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, B and Zn than blackwater soils. After N addition and 15 weeks of incubation, active bacterial biomass in redwater soils was lower when N was added. Active bacterial biomass in blackwater soils was lower when 400 kg N ha(-1), but not when 200 kg N ha(-1) was added. Active fungal biomass in blackwater soils was higher when 400 kg N ha(-1), but not when 200 kg N ha(-1), was added. Active fungal biomass in redwater soils was lower when 200 kg N ha(-1), but not when 400 kg N ha(-1), was added. After 15 weeks of incubation 2,4-D degradation was higher in redwater wetland soils than in blackwater soils. After 10 and 15 weeks of incubation the addition of 200 or 400 kg N ha(-1) decreased both atrazine and 2,4-D degradation in redwater soils. The addition of 400 kg N ha(-1) decreased 2,4-D degradation but not atrazine degradation in blackwater soils after 10 and 15 weeks of incubation. High concentrations of N in surface runoff and groundwater resulting from agricultural operations may have resulted in the accumulation of N in many wetland soils. Large amounts of N accumulating in wetlands may decrease mineralization of toxic agricultural pesticides.

AB The northwestern Nile delta of Egypt between the Rosetta promontory and Abu Qir carbonate ridge is characterized by a concave coastline backed by the Idku lagoon, extensive coastal sand flats and dunes. The late Quaternary evolution of this region is interpreted primarily on the basis of petrological and faunal analyses of 22 radiocarbon-dated cores. The subsurface study reveals thin Holocene sections in the southern and western sectors, previously unrecognized marine bay facies in the western sector, thick vegetal-rich layers of marsh origin in the eastern sector, thick barrier beach sands in the northern sector, and thick fluvial-derived sands at the Rosetta promontory. Interpretation of subsurface sediment distribution and paleogeography takes into account natural factors that determine sediment distribution (eustatic sea level, subsidence, paleoclimate and sediment transport processes) and the impact of man.
   The evolving configuration of this delta area during the past approximately 35,000 years is shown by a series of time-slice paleogeographic maps. These maps highlight the migration of the coastline, shifts of major channel systems and shrinkage of lagoons with time. Late Pleistocene to early Holocene sequences (approximately 35,000 to 7,500 years BP) include mostly alluvial and shallow marine siliciclastic deposits. Holocene sequences (since approximately 7,500 yews BP) include delta-front, marine bay, lagoon, marsh and delta plain facies. Accumulation rates, highest in the sand-rich Rosetta promontory, locally exceed 600 cm/1,000 yr. The study area, in contrast to the delta region to the east, comprises open marine bay deposits and thick peats (to 5 m), and records some emerge.ce in the area south of Abu Qir ridge.
   The positions and ages of the former major Nile distributary channels in this region are revealed by analysis of radiocarbon-dated cores. These include a large Pleistocene channel which extended just to the east of Abu Qir ridge into what is now Abu Qir bay and, perhaps, further onto the Egyptian shelf. During the Holocene, the north-flowing Canopic channel was first positioned along the western margin of Idku lagoon (approximately 6,900-4,000 yr BP), then migrated westward to just east of Abu Qir ridge (approximately 4,000-3,000 yr BP), and then shifted eastward to its former position along the western margin of Idku lagoon (approximately 3,000-2,500 yr BP) where it has remained until recent time. It is postulated that erosion of the Canopic promontory in presently submerged western Abu Qir bay gave rise to large volumes of sands which formed coastal ridges, broad sand flats and coastal dunes along the northwestern delta. The Bolbitic-Rosetta distributary to the east is a younger system (from approximately 2,500 yr BP) that, during most of its history, has been modified by man. Shallow lagoons have prevailed in the study area, at least since approximately 5,000 yr BP, and have been increasingly subject to human influence. Abu Qir lagoon, still in existence 200 years ago, has completely disappeared. The large, Idku lagoon is reduced to only 20% of its original size, as a function of reduced fresh water flow to the coast, land reclamation and irrigation projects. This study calls attention to the need to protect these natural habitats which are vital to an in the Nile delta.

AB This study assesses the major chemical processes leading to acid extremes in a small, moorland stream in mid-Wales, UK, which has been monitored since 1979. Results suggest that base cation (mainly calcium) dilution, the "sea-salt effect", and elevated nitrate pulses, are the major causes of seasonal/episodic minima in acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and that the relative importance of these drivers has remained approximately constant during 25 years of decreasing acid deposition and associated long-term chemical recovery. Many of the chemical variations causing short-term reductions in stream acidity, particularly base cation dilution and organic acid increases, are closely related to changes in water-flowpath and therefore to stream discharge. Changes in the observed pH-discharge relationship over time indicate that high-flow pH has increased more rapidly than mean-flow pH, and therefore that episodes have decreased in magnitude since 1980. However a two-box application of the dynamic model MAGIC, whilst reproducing this trend, suggests that it will not persist in the long term, with mean ANC continuing to increase until 2100, but the ANC of the upper soil (the source of relatively acid water during high-flow episodes) stabilising close to zero beyond 2030. With climate change predicted to lead to an increase in maximum flows in the latter half of the century, high-flow related acid episodes may actually become more rather than less severe in the long term, although the model suggests that this effect may be small. Two other predicted climatic changes could also detrimentally impact on acid episodes: increased severity of winter "sea-salt" episodes due to higher wind speeds during winter storms; and larger sulphate pulses due to oxidation of reduced sulphur held in organic soils, during more extreme summer droughts. At the Gwy, the near-coastal location and relatively small extent of peat soils suggest that sea-salt episodes may have the greatest influence.

AB In 1995 a working group was assembled at the request of OECD/IPCC/IEA to revise the methodology for N(2)O from agriculture for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Methodology. The basics of the methodology developed to calculate annual country level nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from agricultural soils is presented herein. Three sources of N(2)O are distinguished in the new methodology: (i) direct emissions from agricultural soils, (ii) emissions from animal production, and (iii) N(2)O emissions indirectly induced by agricultural activities. The methodology is a simple approach which requires only input data that are available from FAO databases. The methodology attempts to relate N(2)O emissions to the agricultural nitrogen (N) cycle and to systems into which N is transported once it leaves agricultural systems. These estimates are made with the realization that increased utilization of crop nutrients, including N, will be required to meet rapidly growing needs for food and fiber production in our immediate future. Anthropogenic N input into agricultural systems include N from synthetic fertilizer, animal wastes, increased biological N-fixation, cultivation of mineral and organic soils through enhanced organic matter mineralization, and mineralization of crop residue returned to the field. Nitrous oxide may be emitted directly to the atmosphere in agricultural fields, animal confinements or pastoral systems or be transported from agricultural systems into ground and surface waters through surface runoff. Nitrate leaching and runoff and food consumption by humans and introduction into sewage systems transport the N ultimately into surface water (rivers and oceans) where additional N(2)O is produced. Ammonia and oxides of N (NO,) are also emitted from agricultural systems and may be transported off-site and serve to fertilize other systems which leads to enhanced production of N(2)O. Eventually, all N that moves through the soil system will be either terminally sequestered in buried sediments or denitrified in aquatic systems. We estimated global N(2)O-N emissions for the year 1989, using midpoint emission factors from our methodology and the FAO data for 1989. Direct emissions from agricultural soils totaled 2.1 Tg N, direct emissions from animal production totaled 2.1 Tg N and indirect emissions resulting from agricultural N input into the atmosphere and aquatic systems totaled 2.1 Tg N(2)O-N for an annual total of 6.3 Tg N(2)O-N. The N(2)O input to the atmosphere from agricultural production as a whole has apparently been previously underestimated. These new estimates suggest that the missing N(2)O sources discussed in earlier IPCC reports is likely a biogenic (agricultural) one.

AB Organic soils are an excellent substrate for commercial lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) farming; however, drainage accelerates oxidation of the surface layer and reduces the water holding capacity, which is often lethal for crops that are sensitive to water stress. In this case study, we analyzed 942 peat samples from a large cultivated peatland complex (18.7 km(2)) in southern Quebec, Canada, and demonstrated from spatial and temporal patterns that agriculture resulted in a compacted layer below the root zone. We grouped the samples based on the year in which the corresponding fields were created on the previously undisturbed peatland (cutoff years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and discovered that bulk density has continued to increase, partly due to the overburden pressure, while organic matter has continued to decline since the fields were reclaimed and drained in phases between 1955 and 2006. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in the upper 20 cm was remarkably lower on fields older than 10 yr (p = 0.0973 for Wilcoxon rank test), with more samples having a Ks < 2.0 x 10(-3) yr. Soil water available capacity (SWAC) was between approximately 5 and 33 cm on fields reclaimed after 2000, while samples from fields reclaimed before 2000 had a lower SWAC between 2 and 23 cm (groups discernable at p = 0.0203). It is possible, however, that the greatest rate of change in Ks and SWAC occurred within even a year of reclamation. The results of this study call for active measures to reduce organic soil degradation such as reducing tillage and on-field traffic or following a crop rotation scheme.

TI Overview of Hydrologic and Geologic Investigations Conducted in Canaan
   Valley, West Virginia
SO SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
AB Canaan Valley (hereafter, the Valley), a unique wetland complex set in the Allegheny Highlands of northeastern West Virginia, has been the subject of several investigations by the US Geological Survey (USGS). These projects include studying the surface-water hydrology and processes affecting dissolved oxygen, groundwater hydrology, wetland biogeochemistry, and the formation of peat. Additionally, recent revisions of the region's geologic maps have enhanced our understanding of the Valley's surface rocks. The Valley's streams typically conduct dilute calcium- and magnesium-bicarbonate type waters that are low in alkalinity, nutrients, and dissolved solids. The Blackwater River and its major tributaries, the Little Blackwater River and the North Branch of the Blackwater River, are low-gradient streams. Other tributaries are high-gradient streams that originate on the Valley's sides and fall rapidly to the Valley floor before joining the Blackwater River and the major tributaries. Generally, low-gradient streams are less turbulent than high-gradient streams and dissolved oxygen concentrations are strongly affected by turbulence, re-aeration, benthic photosynthesis, and high biochemical oxygen demand in the numerous beaver ponds through which streams flow and which are present in the Valley. Groundwater in the Valley flows primarily along joints, faults, and bedding planes, and its quality is affected primarily by the mineral composition of the source rock. Septic discharges and, to a lesser extent, land applications of fertilizers and pesticides have affected groundwater locally. The most prevalent contaminants of concern in groundwater are bacteria, radon, and manganese. Nearly half of the wells sampled contained detectable concentrations of fecal streptococcus bacteria, and 25% had detectable concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria. Radon, a carcinogenic gas, was detected in 8 of 12 samples at concentrations exceeding proposed drinking water standards. During periods of stream base-flow, groundwater discharge dominates the flow and influences the chemical characteristics of the Valley's streams. Substrate chemistry, communities of denitrifying bacteria, and plant-community structure were compared among four different wetland types in the Valley. Further wetland studies have estimated the peat resources available in the northern end of the Valley. In this paper, we summarize hydrologic and geologic investigations conducted by the US Geological Survey and others in the Valley over the last 8 decades.

AB Mid-Holocene changes in vegetation, palaeohydrology and climate were investigated from the sediments of Lake Vankavad in the northern taiga of the Usa Basin, NE European Russia, through the analysis of pollen, plant macrofossils, Cladocera and diatoms. Lake Vankavad was probably formed at ca. 5000 BP ( ca. 5600 cal. BP) and initially it was shallow with a littoral cladoceran fauna. Macrofossil and pollen results suggest that dense Betula-Picea forests grew in the vicinity and the shore was close to the sampling point. At ca. 4600 BP ( ca. 5400 cal. BP) the water level rose coincident with the decrease in the density and area of forests, probably caused by cooling climate and accelerated spread of mires. There was also a further rise in the water level at ca. 3500 BP ( ca. 3800 cal. BP). The initiation of the lake, followed by two periods of rising water-level, as well as the increase in mire formation, was a consequence of a rise in groundwater level. This probably reflects lower evapotranspiration in a cooling mid-Holocene climate and/or higher precipitation in the lowland area. Also the decreased forest density and area may have contributed to the lower evapotranspiration. It is also possible that permafrost aggradation or changes in peat ecosystems might have affected the hydrological conditions in the area.

AB Temperature and relative humidity measurements were made within and outside a lowland fen in eastern England during 2009 and 2010. Summer temperatures were found to be on average 0.24 degrees C lower within the fen than outside, whilst summer vapour pressures were found to be on average 0.074 kPa higher within the fen. In contrast, winter temperatures were found to be higher within the fen by an average of 0.03 degrees C. These differences may be expected to influence evapotranspiration estimates derived using data from each of the sites. The influence of the location of meteorological measurements on evapotranspiration estimates was therefore evaluated. The existence of a wetland microclimate results in up to a 7% reduction in annual reference evapotranspiration compared to a site surrounded by arable farmland only 5.5km away.

AB There is increasing interest in improving understanding of evaporation within a catchment for an enhanced representation of dominant processes in hydrological models. We used a dual-isotope approach within a nested experimental design in a boreal catchment in the Scottish Highlands (Bruntland Burn) to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of evaporation fractionation in a peatland drainage network and its effect on stream water isotopes. We conducted spatially distributed water sampling within the saturated peatland under different wetness conditions. We used the lc-excesswhich describes the offset of a water sample from the local meteoric water line in the dual-isotope spaceto understand the development of kinetic fractionation during runoff in a peatland network. The evaporation fractionation signal correlated positively with the potential evapotranspiration and negatively with the discharge. The variability of the isotopic enrichment within the peatland drainage network was higher with higher potential evapotranspiration and lower with higher discharge. We found an increased evaporation fractionation toward the center of the peatland, while groundwater seepage from minerogenic soils influenced the isotopic signal at the edge of the peatland. The evaporation signal was imprinted on the stream water, as the discharge from a peatland dominated subcatchment showed a more intense deviation from the local meteoric water line than the discharge from the Bruntland Burn. The findings underline that evaporation fractionation within peatland drainage networks affects the isotopic signal of headwater catchments, which questions the common assumption in hydrological modeling that the isotopic composition of stream waters did not undergo fractionation processes.

AB Previous experimental studies suggest that methane emission from wetlands is influenced by multiple interactive pathways of gas production and transport through soil and sediment layers to the atmosphere. The objective of this study is to evaluate a new simulation model of methane production and emission in wetland soils that was developed initially to help identify key processes that regulate methanogenesis and net flux of CH4 to the air but which is designed ultimately for regional simulation using remotely sensed inputs for land cover characteristics. The foundation for these computer simulations is based on a well-documented model (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach, CASA) of ecosystem production and carbon cycling in the terrestrial biosphere. Modifications to represent flooded wetland soils and anaerobic decomposition include three new submodels for (1) layered soil temperature and water table depth (WTD) as a function of daily climate drivers, (2) CH4 production within the anoxic soil layer as a function of WTD and CO2 production under poorly drained conditions, and (3) CH4 gaseous transport pathways (molecular diffusion, ebullition, and plant vascular transport) as a function of WTD and ecosystem type. The model was applied and tested using climate and ecological data to characterize tundra wetland sites near Fairbanks, Alaska, studied previously by Whaler, and Reeburgh [1992]. Comparison of model predictions to measurements of soil temperature and thaw depth, water table depth, and CH4 emissions over a 2-year period suggest that intersite differences in soil physical conditions and methane fluxes could be reproduced accurately for selected periods. Day-to-day comparison of predicted emissions to measured CH4 flux rates reveals good agreement during the early part of the thaw season, but the model tends to underestimate production of CH4 during the months of July and August in both test years. Important seasonal effects, including that of falling WTD during these periods, are apparently overlooked in the model formulation. Nevertheless, reasonably close agreement was achieved between the model's mean daily and seasonal estimates of CH4 flux and observed emission rates for northern wetland ecosystems. Several features of the model are identified as crucial to more accurate prediction of wetland methane emission, including the capacity to incorporate influences of localized topographic and hydrologic features on site-specific soil temperature and WTD dynamics and mechanistic simulation of methane emission transport pathways from within the soil profile.

AB As widely recognized, bush encroachment on mire meadows induces species and habitat biodiversity. However, it is unclear if expansion of either a coherent, continuous forest or randomly distributed groups of trees, so-called tree isles, in formerly open landscapes of mire meadows influences differently the water balance of the system due to changing vegetation structure, landscape, and thus evapotranspiration. In this paper we use a quasi-3D unsaturated saturated groundwater flow model to reveal the feedback between the actual evapotranspiration and diurnal phreatic groundwater level dynamics. A schematized numerical experiment was setup to elucidate the ecohydrological functioning of mire meadows in the Biebrza Valley (NE Poland), which have been influenced by bush encroachment due to abandonment of mowing. Model calibration and validation was based on field collected data on groundwater dynamics showing the feedback between the evapotranspiration and diurnal groundwater level fluctuations. The model was applied for different landscape compositions of encroachments as well as different stages of shrubby vegetation expansion in a formerly open meadow. It is concluded that for coupled unsaturated saturated flow models of mires, analysis of diurnal groundwater level fluctuations combined with evapotranspiration quantification is an efficient yet simple method for model calibration and validation. Results of the modelling experiment indicated that the tree-isle-type of bush encroachment entails higher losses of water from the system due to evapotranspiration than coherent forest expansion. For a hypothetical summer drought and an encroachment cover of 50% the total evapotranspiration is shown to be 13% higher for the tree-isle-type encroachment than for expansion of a coherent forest. Consequently, it is concluded that conservation of mires requires continuous control of encroachment not only because of potential loss of biodiversity, but more importantly to limit significant loss of water due to increased evapotranspiration.

AB Many lowland rivers across northwest Europe exhibit broadly similar behavioural responses to glacial-interglacial transitions and landscape development. Difficulties exist in assessing these, largely because the evidence from many rivers remains limited and fragmentary. Here we address this issue in the context of the river Kennet, a tributary of the Thames, since c. 13,000 cal BP. Some similarities with other rivers are present, suggesting that regional climatic shifts are important controls. The Kennet differs from the regional pattern in a number of ways. The rate of response to sudden climatic change, particularly at the start of the Holocene and also mid-Holocene forest clearance, appears very high. This may reflect abrupt shifts between two catchment scale hydrological states arising from contemporary climates, land use change and geology. Stadial hydrology is dominated by nival regimes, with limited winter infiltration and high spring and summer runoff. Under an interglacial climate, infiltration is more significant. The probable absence of permafrost in the catchment means that a lag between the two states due to its gradual decay is unlikely. Palaeoecology, supported by radiocarbon dates, suggests that, at the very start of the Holocene, a dramatic episode of fine sediment deposition across most of the valley floor occurred, lasting 500-1000 years. A phase of peat accumulation followed as mineral sediment supply declined. A further shift led to tufa deposition, initially in small pools, then across the whole floodplain area, with the river flowing through channels cut in tufa and experiencing repeated avulsion. Major floods, leaving large gravel bars that still form positive relief features on the floodplain, followed mid-Holocene floodplain stability. Prehistoric deforestation is likely to be the cause of this flooding, inducing a major environmental shift with significantly increased surface runoff. Since the Bronze Age, predominantly fine sediments were deposited along the valley with apparently stable channels and vertical floodplain accretion associated with soil erosion and less catastrophic flooding. The Kennet demonstrates that, while a general pattern of river behaviour over time, within a region, may be identifiable, individual rivers are likely to diverge from this. Consequently, it is essential to understand catchment controls, particularly the relative significance of surface and subsurface hydrology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane (CH4) emission from boreal, arctic and subarctic wetlands constitutes a potentially positive feedback to global climate warming. Many process-based models have been developed, but high uncertainties remain in estimating the amount of CH4 released from wetlands at the global scale. This study tries to improve estimates of CH4 emissions by up-scaling a wetland CH4 emission model, PEATLAND-VU, to the global scale with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees for the period 2001-2006. This up-scaling was based on the global circum-arctic distribution of wetlands with hydrological conditions being specified by a global hydrological model, PCR-GLOBWB. In addition to the daily hydrological output from PCR-GLOBWB, comprising water table depths and snow thickness, the parameterization included air temperature as obtained from the ECMWF Operational Archive. To establish the uncertainty in the representations of the circum-arctic distribution of wetlands on the CH4 emission, several existing products were used to aggregate the emissions. Using the description of potential peatlands from the FAO Digital Soil Map of the World and the representation of floodplains by PCR-GLOBWB, the average annual flux over the period 2001-2006 was estimated to be 78 Tg yr(-1). In comparison, the six-year average CH4 fluxes were 37.7, 89.4, 145.6, and 157.3 Tg yr(-1) for different estimates of wetland extends based on the studies by Matthews and Fung, Prigent et al., Lehner and Doll, and Kaplan, respectively. This study shows the feasibility to estimate interannual variations in CH4 emissions by coupling hydrological and CH4 emission process models. It highlights the importance of an adequate understanding of hydrology in quantifying the total emissions from northern hemispheric wetlands and shows how knowledge of the sub-grid variability in wetland extent helps to prescribe relevant hydrological conditions to the emission model as well as to identify the uncertainty associated with existing wetland distributions.

AB Greater understanding of the relationship between soil test phosphorus (STP) and loss of soluble phosphorus (P) from soil to water is essential for integrated management strategies attempting to reduce diffuse P losses to aquatic systems. Although previous studies have suggested that the relationship between STP and soluble P loss is soil-type specific [e.g. Pote, D.H., Daniel, T.C., Nichols, D.J., Sharpley, A.N., Moore, P.A., Miller, D.M., Edwards, D.R., 1999b. Relationship between phosphorus levels in three ultisols and phosphorus concentrations in runoff. J. Environ. Qual. 28,170-175; Daly, K., Mills, P., Coulter, B., McGarrigle, M., 2002. Modeling phosphorus concentrations in Irish rivers using land use, soil-type, and soil phosphorus data. J. Environ. Qual. 31, 590-599]; these conclusions were typically derived from analyses on dried soil samples. Drying soil samples has been found to substantially increase P solubility [e.g. Bartlett, R., James, B., 1980. Studying dried, stored soil samples-some pitfalls. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 44, 721-724; Turner, B.L., Haygarth, P.M., 2001. Phosphorus solubilization in rewetted soils. Nature 411, 258]. In this study, P solubility was compared among air-dried soil samples, and samples maintained at sampled moisture content in order to minimise drying-induced changes. Water-extractable P (P-w) and P desorbed to solutions containing an iron-oxide strip (P-feo) were used to represent soil P solubility. The soils analysed included a range of soil-types from the Mask catchment in western Ireland. STP (Morgan P) and the degree of P sorption saturation (DPSS) were found to be strongly linearly related with moist soil sample P solubility (e.g. P-feo with Morgan P r(2) = 0.81, p <= 0.0001). Soil organic matter content had a significant negative influence on P solubility, and, among moist samples, peat soils contained significantly less soluble P than mineral soils per unit Morgan P content (p <= 0.0001) and per unit DPSS (p <= 0.05). A solubility factor of 0.27 was derived for peat soils, compared with mineral soils, per unit Morgan P content. This solubility factor was incorporated into a simple P desorption index (PDI). When this PDI was applied to existing Morgan P and soil-type data for the 12 Mask subcatchments of contrasting typology, the consequent subcatchment ranking was correlated weakly but significantly with average subcatchment stream P concentrations and annual molybdate-reactive P loads (r(s) = 0.54-0.64, p < 0.02 to < 0.05). Drying soil samples resulted in large increases in soil P solubility, obscured the differential peat-mineral soil-type effect, and resulted in the development of an unsuccessful PDI.

AB In Finland, ditch network maintenance (DNM) is carried out annually on 60-70,000 ha of drained peatland to promote tree growth for forestry purposes. However, it is important to avoid ditching that contributes little to the stand growth and productivity, both to improve the economical profitability of forestry and to mitigate DNM-induced nutrient release to watercourses.
   We hypothesised that mature forest stands with substantial evapotranspiration potential do not necessarily need DNM, even if the ditch networks are in poor condition. We estimated evapotranspiration (EVT) of forest vegetation during the growing seasons (June-September) of 2007-2011 in four forested artificial peatland catchments dominated by Scots pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.) (stand volume 93-151 m(3) ha(-1)) located in southern, western, central and northern Finland. Precipitation (P), runoff (R) and water table level (WTL) were monitored continuously in the field. The water storage change (Delta S) was estimated on the basis of WTL measurements and peat pF curves determined from in situ peat samples. In addition, tree stand transpiration (T) was estimated in two of the catchments using the sap flow method. EVT was estimated as the residual term of the water balance equation.
   During the growing season, EVT (153-295 mm) was 49-161 % of the total accumulated P (155-368 mm), and decreased from south to north. Within each growing season, EVT was always largest in July or August. Tree transpiration was about 50 % of the total forest EVT in the two sites where it was measured directly. The mean WTL was at depth 36-63 cm during the growing seasons. Clear-cutting of a 100m(3) ha(-1) stand on one site resulted in an average rise of WTL by 18 cm.
   The results suggested that, in the southernmost site in particular, no drainage network management would be necessary to sustain satisfactory drainage conditions for tree growth because growing-season precipitation is transferred back to the atmosphere by forest EVT. In the northernmost site, ditch networks were considered important in controlling drainage conditions because of the low EVT potential of <100 m(3) ha(-1) tree stands. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind forest EVT potential, as one site with high tree stand volume had surprisingly low EVT potential.

AB Due to the scarcity of reliable palaeoecological and climatic proxy records from the Eastern Baltic covering the Holocene, there has been increased interest for multi-proxy studies in the region to detect local to regional environmental changes. The Cepkeliai wetland complex, SE Lithuania, provides an uninterrupted Holocene sediment sequence, which is used here to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental history in the southern part of the Eastern Baltic. High-resolution lithological (LOI, magnetic susceptibility), palaeobotanical (pollen, plant macrofossil, tree rings), isotopic (C-14) and geochemical data were employed to reconstruct the peculiarities of vegetation and hydroclimate dynamics, as well as to discuss results in a local to regional context. Temporal lags of environmental reactions to Holocene climatic warming were recorded both in lithostratigraphical and biostratigraphical data, thus confirming regional significance of this phenomenon. A deep meso- to eutrophic basin - influenced by high surface runoff and surrounded by early boreal forest - existed at the site until about 11,300 cal BP. Thereafter, immigration of thermophylous taxa such as Ulmus (since 10,700-10,800 cal BP), Corylus (since 10,400 -10,300 cal BP), Tilia and Quercus (after 9500 cal BP) as well as changes in the limnic environment point to an amelioration of the environmental situation, i.e. to a predominance of a warm and dry climatic regime. Instability of palaeobotanical and lithological records suggests that environmental anomalies of the Early Holocene occurred at about 11,200-11,000 cal BP, 10,600-10,300 cal BP, and 8200-7800 cal BP. These anomalies are thus contemporaneous with the pronounced climatic shifts (i.e. dry and cool intervals) known at the continental scale. An expansion of Picea was facilitated by the 8200-7800 cal BP climatic shift whereas early establishment of Alnus glutinosa suggests an onset of a wet interval (10,200 cal BP) which was previously unknown in the area. The stepwise lowering of the water table noted at about 7300-7200 and 6600-6700 cal BP, with the termination of the lake-phase and change to telmatic environment after 6100 cal BP, proves the positive reaction of the site to the dry climatic reversals of the Middle Holocene. Following the decay of the broad-leaved thermophilous forest after 4500 cal BP, a cold climatic reversal favored the formation of a diverse mosaic-like vegetation which was then replaced by homogenous Pinus-Picea vegetation after 3400 cal BP. The climatic and site-specific factors have been playing a leading role in the development of the site whereas signals of human interference remain negligible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Wetlands provide many services and commodities to humanity. Wetlands, the home of fish, animals, waterfowl and timber, provide important and valuable harvests and plenty of recreational fishing and hunting for local populations and tourists. At the ecosystem level, wetlands moderate the effects of floods, improve water quality and are aesthetically pleasing. They also contribute to the stability of the global levels of available nitrogen, atmospheric sulfur, carbon dioxide and methane. The hydrologic condition of wetlands is extremely important for their structure and functioning and affect many abiotic factors, including soil anaerobiosis and nutrient availability.
   In the following paper an evaluation of the hydrologic condition and quantification of the particular components entering into the water budget in the case of the Zelienka peat bog are presented.

AB This paper presents a novel method to reconstruct sea-level change in coastal freshwater back-barrier marshes. Freshwater environments have long been considered to be unsuitable for the reconstruction of Holocene sealevel changes as they provide limiting, rather than precise, sea-level index points. We recorded the stratigraphy of a small beach and back-barrier coastal Phragmites (reed) marsh at Hallsands, south Devon, southwest England, using hand-drilled cores and ground-penetrating radar, and collected five new sea-level index points from the base of a Holocene peat sequence to refine the regional Holocene relative sea-level curve. We demonstrate that the samples, despite their freshwater origin, yield accurate sea-level index points as determined from the quantifiable relationship between tide levels and groundwater. By means of water-table monitoring and groundwater modelling we show that the primary controls on the water table in the marsh are: (1) stratigraphy; (2) peat permeability; and (3) recharge rates in the back-barrier marsh. The five index points document relative sea-level positions between 7200 and 2400 cal yr BP. Three points are in good agreement with previously collected regional data from intertidal deposits and two points usefully fill gaps in the existing reconstruction. An amended Holocene relative sea-level curve for south Devon, based on 30 data points, is presented. We conclude that the combined approach of data collection and modelling used in this paper can be applied to similar coastal settings around the world and allows the collection of sea-level index points from locations not previously thought suitable for this purpose.

AB Testate amoebae are increasingly used in ecological and palaeoecological studies of wetlands. To characterise the amoeba community a certain number of individuals need to be counted under the microscope. To date, most studies have aimed for 150 individuals, but that sample size is not based on adequate evidence. When testate amoeba concentrations are low, it can be difficult or impossible to reach this total. The impacts of lower count totals have never been seriously scrutinised. We investigated the impact of count size on number of taxa identified, quantitative inferences of environmental variables and the strength of the links between amoebae and environmental data in the context of predicting depth to water table. Low counts were simulated by random selection of individuals from four existing datasets. Results show progressively diminishing returns by all criteria as count size increases from low numbers to counts of 150. A higher count is required to identify all taxa than to adequately characterise the community for transfer function inference. We suggest that in most cases, it will be a more efficient use of time to count a greater number of samples to a lower count. While a count of 50 individuals may be sufficient for some samples from some sites we recommend that counts of 100 individuals should be sufficient for most samples. Counts need only be increased to 150 or more where the aim is to identify relatively minor, but still potentially ecologically relevant community changes. This approach will help reduce lack of replication and low resolution, which are common limitations in testate amoeba-based palaeoecological and ecological studies.

AB The present paper investigates the influence of stabilization with cement, peat ash, and silica sand on permeability coefficient (k(v)) of compacted clay, using a novel approach to stabilize the clay with peat ash as a supplementary material of cement in the compacted and stabilized soil. In order to assess the mentioned influence, test specimens of both untreated and stabilized soil have been tested in the laboratory so that their permeability could be evaluated. Falling head and one dimensional consolidation tests of laboratory permeability were performed on the clay specimens and the chemical compositions of the materials as well as microstructure of the stabilized soil with 18% cement, 2% peat ash, and 5% silica sand were investigated, using X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy respectively. Results show that for soil stabilization with up to 8% cement content (of the dry weight of the soil), the average value of coefficient of permeability (k(v)) is very close to that of untreated soil, whereas the k(v) value decreases drastically for 18% cement under identical void ratio conditions. It is further revealed that addition of 18% cement, 2% peat ash, and 5% silica sand had decreased the coefficient of permeability by almost 2.2 folds after 24 h, while an about 1.7-fold increase was observed in coefficient of permeability once 13.5% of cement, 1.5% of peat ash, and 20% of silica sand were added. The partial replacement of cement with the 2% peat ash can reduce the consumption of cement for soil stabilization.

AB Limited research exists on the sources of nitrogen (N) in cranberry floodwaters, which have been identified as a prominent cause of concern to watershed N loading in the cranberry-producing region of southeastern Massachusetts. In this study, we used naturally occurring chemical and isotopic tracers to infer the sources of N transported by harvest floodwaters. In 2012, the cranberry bed was a net source of total N (TN), exporting 0.8 kg N ha(-1) (primarily as organic N) to a nearby lake. Systematic increases in TN concentration were associated with increasing fractions of pre-event soil water and groundwater ("porewater") in discharge. Results showed that N concentrations in porewater generally derive from the natural mixing of soil water and perched groundwater within the cranberry bed but locally display a connection to deep groundwater where the underlying peat is absent. These findings illustrate the environmental significance of stored pools of porewater in cranberry beds and the ability to focus on moments of disproportionate N transfer to most efficiently curtail floodwater N losses (i.e., 58% of N export occurred in only 22% of floodwater discharge).

AB Agronomic soil test P (STP) and soil type data may be used to predict diffuse soluble P loss from soil to water (e.g. Withers, P.J. A., Dils, R.M., Hodgkinson, R.A., 1999. Transfer of phosphorus from small agricultural basins with variable soil types and land use. p. 41. In: Impact of Land use change on nutrient loads from different sources. IAHS publication no. 257; Daly, K., Mills, P., Coulter, B., McGarrigle, M., 2002. Modelling phosphorus concentrations in Irish rivers using land use, soil type, and soil phosphorus data. J. Environ. Qual., 31: 590-599). However, previous studies quantifying the effect of STP and soil type on P solubility have usually relied on laboratory analyses of dried soil samples to quantify P solubility. Drying soil samples has been found to substantially increase P solubility (e.g. Bartlett, R., James, B., 1980. Studying dried, stored soil samples-some pitfalls. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 44: 721-724; Turner, B.L., Haygarth, P.M., 2001. Phosphorus solubilization in rewetted soils. Nature, 411: 258-258), and microbial biomass and organic matter (OM) have been implicated in this (e.g. Chepkwony, C.K., Haynes, R.J., Swift, R.S., Harrison, R., 2001. Mineralization of soil organic P induced by drying and rewetting as a source of plant-available P in limed and unlimed samples of an acid soil. Plant Soil, 234: 83-90; Turner, B.L., Driessen, J.P., Haygarth, P.M., McKelvie, I.D., 2003. Potential contribution of lysed bacterial cells to phosphorus solubilisation in two rewetted Australian pasture soils. Soil Biol. Biochem., 35: 187-189). Many grassland soils in western Ireland contain high OM and moisture contents, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to drying-induced soluble P release. This study quantifies drying-induced changes in P solubility, by measuring water-extractable P (P-w) and desorbable P (P-feo) contents in moist and dried samples of a range of 33, mainly grassland, soils from western Ireland. Molybdate analyses of P-w extracts before and after acid digestion were used to quantify dissolved reactive P (PwDRP), taken to represent predominantly readily soluble inorganic P, and dissolved molybdate-unreactive P (MUP), taken to represent predominantly readily soluble organic P. Dried soil samples were analysed for a wide range of general and P-specific characteristics, including STP (Morgan P and Olsen P) and the degree of sorption saturation (DPSS). Based on OM content, soils were divided into peat (> 30% OM) and predominantly mineral (< 30% OM) soils after Daly et al. (2000). Almost all soils exhibited large increases in P solubility after drying, with the size of drying-induced soluble P increases increasing in the order PwDRP < PwMUP < P-feo. Absolute drying-induced increases were statistically similar between peat and mineral soil groups (e.g. P-feo mean increases of 9.06 and 13.81 for peat and mineral soil groups, respectively). However, when expressed as a proportion of moist sample P solubility, all soluble P increases were significantly greater for peat compared with mineral soils (e.g. P-feo percentage increases 735% and 155% for peat and mineral soil groups, respectively). Consequently, some differentiation in P solubility between peat and mineral soil groups was lost after drying. Drying-induced P-w increases appeared to be related to soil OM and moisture contents, indicating drying-induced P release through microbial cell lysis and OM destabilisation.
   Increases were not related to oist sample P solubility or STP, resulting in the loss of some differentiation in P solubility between high and low STP soils. Drying-induced P-feo increases were positively related to DPSS, reflecting chemical equilibrium control of desorbable P released from dried samples. It was concluded that the standard practice of drying soils prior to P solubility analyses reduces the inferred importance of soil type and STP as risk factors in diffuse soluble P losses.

TI Modeling the long-term transport and accumulation of radionuclides in

SO AMBIO

ID FATE
AB To evaluate the radiological impact of potential releases to the biosphere from a geological repository for spent nuclear fuel, it is necessary to assess the long-term dynamics of the distribution of radionuclides in the environment. In this paper, we propose an approach for making prognoses of the distribution and fluxes of radionuclides released from the geosphere, in discharges of contaminated groundwater, to an evolving landscape. The biosphere changes during the temperate part (spanning approximately 20 000 years) of an interglacial period are handled by building biosphere models for the projected succession of situations. Radionuclide transport in the landscape is modeled dynamically with a series of interconnected radioecological models of those ecosystem types (sea, lake, running water, mire, agricultural land and forest) that occur at present, and are projected to occur in the future, in a candidate area for a geological repository in Sweden. The transformation between ecosystems is modeled as discrete events occurring every thousand years by substituting one model by another. Examples of predictions of the radionuclide distribution in the landscape are presented for several scenarios with discharge locations varying in time and space. The article also outlines an approach for estimating the exposure of man resulting from all possible reasonable uses of a potentially contaminated landscape, which was used for derivation of Landscape Dose Factors.

AB The differential accumulation or loss of carbon and nutrients during decomposition can promote differentiation of wetland ecosystems, and contribute to landscape-scale heterogeneity. Tree islands are important ecosystems because they increase ecological heterogeneity in the Everglades landscape and in many tropical landscapes. Only slight differences in elevation due to peat accumulation allow the differentiation of these systems from the adjacent marsh. Hydrologic restoration of the Everglades landscape is currently underway, and increased nutrient supply that could occur with reintroduction of freshwater flow may alter these differentiation processes. In this study, we established a landscape-scale, ecosystem-level experiment to examine litter decomposition responses to increased freshwater flow in nine tree islands and adjacent marsh sites in the southern Everglades. We utilized a standard litterbag technique to quantify changes in mass loss, decay rates, and phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) dynamics of a common litter type, cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco L.) leaf litter over 64 weeks. Average C. icaco leaf degradation rates in tree islands were among the lowest reported for wetland ecosystems (0.23 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)). We found lower mass loss and decay rates but higher absolute mass C, N, and P in tree islands as compared to marsh ecosystems after 64 weeks. With increased freshwater flow, we found generally greater mass loss and significantly higher P concentrations in decomposing leaf litter of tree island and marsh sites. Overall, litter accumulated N and P when decomposing in tree islands, and released P when decomposing in the marsh. However, under conditions of increased freshwater flow, tree islands accumulated more P while the marsh accumulated P rather than mineralizing P. In tree islands, water level explained significant variation in P concentration and N: P molar ratio in leaf tissue. Absolute P mass increased strongly with total P load in tree islands (r(2) = 0.81). In the marsh, we found strong, positive relationships with flow rate. Simultaneous C and P accumulation in tree island and mineralization in adjacent marsh ecosystems via leaf litter decomposition promotes landscape differentiation in this oligotrophic Everglades wetland. However, results of this study suggest that variation in flow rates, water levels and TP loads can shift differential P accumulation and loss leading to unidirectional processes among heterogeneous wetland ecosystems. Under sustained high P loading that could occur with increased freshwater flow, tree islands may shift to litter mineralization, further degrading landscape heterogeneity in this system, and signaling an altered ecosystem state.

AB 1 Most studies of the community-level effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been conducted in upland grassland plant communities where a majority of the plant species are colonized by AMF. Here, we examine the effects of AMF on plant community composition in experimental wetland plant communities, where the dominant plant species are non-mycorrhizal and subordinate plant species are colonized by AMF. We also assess how an important abiotic soil variable, depth to water table (soil saturation), might mediate the community-level effects of AMF.
   2 In the low water table (un-saturated) treatment, above-ground plant biomass increased in the presence of AMF relative to the controls, while in the high water table treatment, biomass decreased with the presence of AMF. Contrary to predictions, plant diversity was unaffected by the presence of AMF in the low water table treatment, but significantly decreased in the presence of AMF in the high water table treatment. Changes in biomass and composition were driven by the interactions between the dominant non-mycorrhizal species Carex hystercina, and the remaining mycorrhizal plant species.
   3 Our results indicate that AMF have the potential to influence plant community composition in calcareous fens and that these effects can be mediated by soil saturation.
   4 This study has implications for understanding how established principles of above-ground/below-ground interactions from upland communities translate to wetland plant communities and for understanding how AMF function can be mediated by abiotic soil properties. Contrary to previous thought, AMF may be important drivers of plant community composition in wetland plant communities.

AB A static, dark chamber technique was used weekly from mid-July to mid-November in 1995 and biweekly from mid-May to late November in 1996, to measure methane (CH4) flux and soil and plant community res ration of CO2 from 36 sites in two wetlands In Kejimkujik National Park in south-central Nova Scotia, Canada. Overall mean fluxes of CH4 were 43 mg m(-2) d(-1) in 1995 and 20 mg m(-2) d-1 in 1996. Respiration rates were 5.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1995 and 3.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1996. Fluxes of CH4 and CO2 were related to microtopography and ecological grouping, depth to water table, and air and peat temperatures. Edge and hummock sites showed the lowest CH4 flux and the highest respiration rate, while pools showed the highest CH4 and lowest respiration rate. Gas emissions displayed a strong seasonal pattern with highest values occurring during the summer (June to August) and with a marked reduction in late fall. Depth to water table and air temperature explained 34 to 43% of the variance in CH4 flux and respiration from the sites over the 2 years (n = 666 to 824). We developed algorithms relating the daily mean flux of CH4 and respiration from the wetlands to an aspatial soil moisture, water table, and temperature model (ForHyM2) applied to the wetland basins. We then applied this model to calculated May to October fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from 1966 to 1998. We estimated that CH4 fluxes ranged from 2.8 to 7.4 g m(-2) with a mean of 3.7 g m(-2) and a standard deviation of 1.2 g m(-2) over the 1966-1998 period. Respiration estimates ranged from 0.60 to 1.16 kg CO2 m(-2) with a mean of 0.74 kg CO2 m(-2) and a standard deviation of 0.11 kg CO2 m(-2). Application of a 2xCO(2) General Circulation Model scenario to temperature and precipitation for this part of eastern Canada resulted in increases of growing season CH4 emissions from 4.7 to 11.4 g m(-2) and respiration from 0.77 to 1.32 kg CO2 m(-2).

AB Flooding regime changes resulting from natural and human activity have been projected to affect wetland plant community structures and functions. It is therefore important to conduct investigations across a range of flooding gradients to assess the impact of flooding depth on wetland vegetation. We conducted this study to identify the pattern of plant height, species richness and aboveground biomass variation along the flooding gradient in floodplain wetlands located in Northeast China. We found that the response of dominant species height to the flooding gradient depends on specific species, i.e., a quadratic response for Carex lasiocarpa, a negative correlation for Calamagrostis angustifolia, and no response for Carex appendiculata. Species richness showed an intermediate effect along the vegetation zone from marsh to wet meadow while aboveground biomass increased. When the communities were analysed separately, only the water table depth had significant impact on species richness for two Carex communities and no variable for C. angustifolia community, while height of dominant species influenced aboveground biomass. When the three abovementioned communities were grouped together, variations in species richness were mainly determined by community type, water table depth and community mean height, while variations in aboveground biomass were driven by community type and the height of dominant species. These findings indicate that if habitat drying of these herbaceous wetlands in this region continues, then two Carex marshes would be replaced gradually by C. angustifolia wet meadow in the near future. This will lead to a reduction in biodiversity and an increase in productivity and carbon budget. Meanwhile, functional traits must be considered, and should be a focus of attention in future studies on the species diversity and ecosystem function in this region.

AB This study quantified the temporal properties of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in the Zoige basin of the Yellow River source region, China during the 1967-2011 period, as well as their influence to the area reduction of peatland. We extracted areas of different land-use and land-cover (LULC) types and obtained daily precipitation data. Then, we calculated annual precipitation (AP) and specific cumulative precipitation (SCP), which is the sum of precipitation to the date when an image was taken, and showed that the peatland areas were strongly affected by SCP. Using a modified Penman-Monteith equation, we calculated ETa for each LULC type and the area-weighted ones to show that the area-weighted total ETa was mainly contributed from grassland and peatland, which was between 450 and 550 mm. Temporal trends of the ratio of SCP to evapotranspiration showed that precipitation was generally greater than evapotranspiration rate not only during the summer but also over the 1967-2011 period. This trend failed to completely explain the continuous decrease of peatland area in the Zoige basin in decades. The draining effect of artificial ditches and natural gullies might play an additional role in causing peatland degradation but requires further process-based studies.

AB Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

AB During the last 60 years, pollution of the groundwater with NO3- has greatly increased in many parts of Europe, as a consequence of excessive use of manure and synthetic fertilisers. Monitoring of groundwater-fed wetlands indicated that sediments with high NO3- concentrations had the lowest Fe and PO43- concentrations in the pore water. A comparison of two restored open water fens, differing in NO3- supply via the groundwater, indicated that the redox potential and the sulphate (SO42-) reduction rate were lower when the groundwater contained not only SO42- but also high NO3- concentrations. The lower SO42- reduction rates in the NO3--rich open water fen were associated with lower PO43- concentrations and the presence of plant species characteristic of clear water. In contrast, the higher SO42- reduction rates in the NO3--poor open water fen were associated with very high PO43- concentrations and massive development of plant species characteristic of eutrophic environments. Investigations at NO3--rich seepage sites in black alder carrs , showed that high NO3- concentrations in the pore water caused chlorosis in the alder carr vegetation due to lower availability of Fe in the pore water and less Fe uptake by the plants. Experimental desiccation of sediments proved that the NO3--rich seepage sites contained no oxidisable FeSx, contrary to NO3--poor locations, which became acidified and mobilised extremely high amounts of SO42- due to FeSx oxidation. A laboratory experiment showed that NO3- addition to sediments led to reduced release of Fe and S-2(-) and increased release of SO42-, very likely due to the oxidation of reduced Fe and S compounds. Overall, the results confirmed that NO3- is an energetically more favourable electron acceptor in anaerobic sediments than Fe and SO2- and that high NO3- loads function as a redox buffer, preventing reduction of Fe and SO42-. Limited SO42- reduction prevents S-2(-)-mediated mobilisation of PO43- from Fe-PO43- complexes. At a higher redox potential, reduced Fe, including FeSx, was oxidised, increasing the content of Fe(III) capable of binding PO43-. This prevented increased PO43- availability and the concomitant massive development of plant species characteristic of eutrophic environments.

AB Relationships between species abundance and water table depth and soil moisture have been modeled using weighted averaging and species niches have been calculated as optima and tolerance for these parameters. Niche separation of closely related taxa has been examined in detail and it has been shown that there is often a gradient of hydrological preference within each taxon. Wet to dry gradients include those found in the Trigonopyxis arcula group (T. arcula var. major > T. arcula > T. minuta), Assulina-Valkanovia group (A. seminulum > A. muscorum > V. elegans), and Trinema lineare group (T. lineare var. truncatum > T. lineare > T. lineare var. terricola), all of which are associated with a large to small size gradient. In addition, spined forms within the Euglypha and Placocista genera have been shown to consistently occur in wetter habitats than glabrous forms of those with shorter spines. A conclusion has been drawn that palaeoecological studies should cover the lowest taxa possible within these groups to maximize the ecological indicator value of the assemblages recorded.

AB The groundwater level of a conifer stand established on a lowland in eastern Canada was periodically measured using water wells installed in an experimental design composed of. four. completely randomized blocks and five levels of cutting (0, 40, 50, 60, and 100% of basal, area (BA) removed). The three partial cutting treatments were applied following the principles of low thinning, but with the seed cutting objectives of the shelterwood method. Before cutting, highly similar values for groundwater level were recorded for plots targeted to receive the planned treatments During the first growing season after cutting, the water table rise was linearly related to the percentage of cutting, and this effect was more apparent it the lower levels recorded for the control water table. This finding is partly explained by the leaf biomass of residual trees that intercepted an increasing proportion of rainfall with decreasing cutting intensity. Five years after cutting, although the water table of clearcut experimental units (EU) was still higher than that of the controls, it was no longer related to cutting intensity. During the 5 years following cutting, the slopes of the relationship between the water table depth of the control plots and those of any treatment gradually approached the value calculated before,cutting. This water table recovery was related to the increasing leaf biomass of the regeneration stratum over time, rather than to the crown expansion of residual trees. The shelterwood method should be considered for forest management of wetlands, since it mitigates water table rise after, the first cut and promotes a vigorous regeneration stratum which should also mitigate water table rise following the. final cut.

AB Contaminated soils, especially when Pollutant concentrations are high, pose potentially serious threats to surface and groundwater quality, when there are spills, discharges, or leaking storage tanks. For in situ remediation of nitrate in groundwater, the use of zero-valent iron (Fe(0)) is suggested. The formation of passivating scales on Fen overtime may limit the long-term reduction potential of Fe(0). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasound and pH on the destruction of passive oxide film. Batch tests were conducted in a specially designed protocol using ultrasound, and changing iron (commercial iron powder of micro-scale grain size) loading and pH. The results showed deactivation of the degradation process by Fe(0) with combined ultrasound/iron system and with ultrasound alone. However, the degradation rate increases with decrease in pH. The degradation rate was 45% for pH 2 and 20% for pH 4. The combination of iron, acidification, and ultrasound showed excellent degradation efficiency, and the degradation rate was 99%. Acidification could destroy passive oxide film and activate iron, thus, hastening the reaction between Fen and nitrate. Ultrasound was helpful in destroying or preventing the formation of passive oxide film under acidification. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of changing climate and disturbance on forest water cycling are not well understood. In particular, bryophytes contribute significantly to forest evapotranspiration in poorly drained boreal forests, but few studies have directly measured this flux and how it changes with stand age and soil drainage. We measured bryophyte evaporation (E) in the field (in Canadian Picea mariana forests of varying ages and soil drainages) and under controlled laboratory conditions, and modelled daily E using site-specific meteorological data to drive a Penman-Monteith-based model. Field measurements of E averaged 0.37 mm day(-1) and ranged from 0.03 (Pleurozium schreberii in a 77-year-old dry stand) to 1.43 mm day(-1) (Sphagnum riparium in a 43-year-old bog). In the laboratory, moss canopy resistance (which ranged from similar to 0 to 1500 s m(-1)) was constant until a moss water content of similar to 6 g g(-1) and then climbed sharply with further drying; unexpectedly, no difference was observed between the three moss groups (feather mosses, hollow mosses and hummock mosses) tested. Modelled annual E ranged from 0.4 mm day(-1), in the well-drained stands, to similar to 1 mm day(-1) in the 43-year-old bog. The Penman-Monteith modelling approach used was relatively insensitive to most parameters but only explained 35% of the variability in field measurements. Bryophyte E was greater in bogs than in upland stands, was driven by low-lying mosses and varied with stand age only in the poorly drained stands; this suggests that bryophytes may provide a buffering effect to fire-driven changes in tree transpiration.

AB The Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) are large-scale freshwater wetlands constructed to reduce total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in runoff to support restoration of the Everglades. TP reduction and retention in STAs occurs through settling, plant growth and accumulation of dead plant material in a layer of peat. This study evaluated the performance of six treatment flow-ways in STA - 2 and STA-3/4, two of the best performing Everglades STAs, through water and TP budget analyses based on over a decade of hydrological, meteorological, and water quality data.
   STA performance was evaluated by comparing annual and long-term average annual flow-way and treatment cell TP flow-weighted mean outflow (FWMC) concentrations, TP load retention percentage, and TP FWMC reduction percentage. The effects of annual hydraulic loading rate, annual phosphorus loading rate, annual average hydraulic residence time, inflow TP FWMC and annual average water depth on annual flow-way TP FWMC were evaluated. For the six flow-ways studied, a higher frequency of low-level outflow TP annual FWMC was achieved when the annual hydraulic residence time was longer than 14 d, annual hydraulic loading rate was less than or equal to 3.5 cm day(-1), the annual water depth was shallower than or equal to 0.65 m, the annual phosphorus loading rate was smaller than or equal to 1.2 g m 2 yr(-1), or the annual inflow TP FWMC was less than or equal to 100 mu g L-1. This study demonstrated that TP settling rate alone is not adequate to evaluate STA treatment performance especially when hydraulic loading rates differ. This study also helped improve understanding of the factors that affected the treatment performance of large-scale constructed wetland flow-ways which consistently retained TP and reduced TP concentrations over a long-term operational period.

AB The paper describes the application of the Soil Water-Balance Bucket Model (SWBBM), version B, to outline potential Holocene climate conditions leading to water fluctuations at the Lagoni peat-bog (Mercurago, Northern Italy). These are reconstructed from a series of radiocarbon-dated peat cores taken along present-day shores. Attention focuses on an event occurring during the late Sub-Boreal (4000-3000 years before present [BP]), during which peat recedes and subsequently expands, indicating reduced and increased water availability, respectively. This period is associated with a major change in human settlement patterns, both at local and regional scales, the appearance and disappearance of Bronze age lake-dwelling sites in Northern Italy; settlement patterns shift from the low plains of the Po valley to the upper plain and hills of the pre-Alpine system. Palynological data indicate no shift in mesic regional vegetation while changes are documented at the local scale, with an increase in hygrophilous vegetation as a response to raised lake levels. SWBBM/B, using a limited number of input climate parameters (temperature, precipitation and insolation), quantifies changes in soil hydrology parameters (evapotranspiration, soil water, percolation and runoff). Modern climate at the site is perturbed with insolation, temperature and precipitation altered to obtain variations in percolation and runoff, without varying evapotranspiration. Results show that 10% seasonal differences in total precipitation, with only a minor temperature change < 1 degrees C, lead to 30% changes in percolation and runoff but with no change in evapotranspiration. It appears that for this minor climatic shift in the late Sub-Boreal, palynological evidence does not seem to be a suitable proxy-climate indicator at regional scales. This results from sensitivity of lake levels and vegetation to different components of the hydrological cycle.

AB Wetland management in the United States has never been as challenging as in today's highly modified landscape. Initially, wetland science and management emerged as professions in response to widespread conversion of wetlands to other uses and concerns over negative impacts on wildlife populations, especially migratory birds. Consequently, wetland management was focused on wildlife, and the initial management technique was simply to protect wetlands. However, extensive conversion of lands for agricultural and urban expansion over the past 60 years has modified ecosystem processes at the landscape scale sufficiently to compromise wetland management activities on adjacent lands dedicated to conservation. Moreover, society now expects a broad suite of ecosystem services to be delivered. As a result, many previously used wetland management techniques are no longer appropriate because they do not take into account influences of adjacent land uses or other ecosystem services, such as ground-water recharge. Other early management approaches may have been ineffective because they were based on an incomplete understanding of wetland processes or social influences. Meanwhile, wetland losses continued, as well as loss of services provided by the remaining managed wetlands. Regulation starting in the 1970s and subsequent research attention on wetland functioning has led to new knowledge and a broader understanding of wetland processes and recognition of the full suite of services (e.g., water storage, water quality improvement, aquifer maintenance, climate mitigation). To be effective in today's highly modified landscape, knowledge of social choices, political influences, and dynamic wetland processes is required to meet wetland management objectives for a range of ecosystem services. We argue that adopting a process-based perspective is critical to develop strategies to optimize a suite of wetland services, including providing traditional wildlife habitat.

AB Water-run inoculation is a novel means of inoculating crop legumes with species of Rhizobium or Bradyrhizobium. Inoculant suspended in irrigation water is delivered into the seedbed. This procedure may be apt for situations when a farmer has limited time to sow a large area and more conventional and time-consuming means of inoculation may create a bottleneck during sowing.
   Field experiments with water-run inoculation of irrigated soybeans were conducted at 2 sites using furrow or flood irrigation. With furrow irrigation immediately after sowing, rhizobia-laden water had to infiltrate the soil laterally a distance of about 18 cm to reach the seed sown in single rows on hills (parallel ridges). With flood irrigation before sowing, water needed to percolate vertically only 5 cm to sowing depth.
   A peat inoculant of B. japonicum remained uniformly in suspension during flow of irrigation water over periods of 45 min and distances of 80 m from the point where the inoculant was introduced. With furrow irrigation on a poorly structured red brown earth, water-run inoculation applied at the normal (commercially recommended) rate did not initiate a satisfactory soybean symbiosis and was inferior to the more conventional methods, seed coat and seedbed inoculation. Rhizobial colonisation of seedling rhizospheres was limited, nodulation was sparse, and low numbers of B. japonicum re-established in the soil after harvest. Symbiosis was improved by higher rates of inoculation and was particularly enhanced in an area where the irrigation water ponded for 3-4 h allowing more time for the rhizobia-laden water to percolate the soil. With flood irrigation on a grey clay, an approximately normal rate of water-run inoculation induced an effective symbiosis especially when compared with lower rates of inoculation. Substantial populations of rhizobia developed in soybean rhizospheres, plant growth and nitrogen (N) content were enhanced, and higher levels of N2 fixation led to increased levels of N in the seed.
   We conclude that water-run inoculation is not an appropriate means of legume inoculation in furrow-irrigated systems on poorly structured soils but it may be a practical option for inoculation of crop legumes grown under flood irrigation.

AB Testate amoebae (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) are frequently used as indicators of past environmental changes, and the interpretation of fossil assemblages depends upon our knowledge of ecological affinities of taxa in modern environments. A variety of taxonomic approaches have been used in fossil studies, mostly involving grouping of closely related taxa. This paper presents data from peatlands in western Russia relating surface wetness parameters to species occurrence. Relationships between species abundance, water table depth and soil moisture are modelled using weighted averaging, and species niches are calculated as optima and tolerance for these parameters. Niche separation of closely related taxa is examined in detail and it is shown that there is often a gradient of hydrological preference within each group of taxa. Wet to dry gradients include those found in the Trigonopyxis arcula group (T. arcula var. major > T. arcula > T. minuta), the Assulina-Valkanovia group (A. seminulum > A. muscorum > V. elegans), and the Trinema lineare group (T. lineare var. truncatum/T. lineare > T. lineare var. terricola), all of which are associated with a large to small size gradient. In addition, spined forms within the Euglypha and Placocista genera are shown to consistently occur in wetter habitats than glabrous forms or those with shorter spines. It is concluded that palaeoecological studies should attempt the lowest taxonomic divisions possible within these groups, to maximise the ecological indicator value of the assemblages recorded.

AB Over the last decades, Arctic landscapes have experienced intense warming leading to permafrost degradation and rapid ecosystem changes. Active layer thickening, widespread melting of ground ice and thermo-erosion have affected the mobilization of organic and mineral elements. While the carbon and nitrogen cycles are intensively studied, the soil weathering has been less documented. In the present study, we monitored the chemistry of soil capillary and gravitational pore waters, rainfall and stream waters daily during the growing season in two experimental sites under tussock tundra vegetation in the low-Arctic region, in Salluit (Nunavik, Canada). We aimed to investigate the seasonal thaw controls on the evolution of concentrations of major organic and inorganic elements in the active layer (i.e., seasonally thawed surface layers) of two permafrost soils (Cryosols) differing in parental materials: an ombrotrophic bog (i.e., Histic Cryosol) and post-glacial marine sediments continuously waterlogged (i.e., Turbic Cryosol). In the Histic Cryosol, the electrical conductivity was <100 mu S cm(-1) and Cl- and Na+ were the dominant soluble ions originating from atmospheric depositions. In the Turbic Cryosol, decarbonated in the first 40 cm, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were the dominant soluble ions in the capillary water reflecting the dissolution of soil minerals, while Cl- and SO42- dominated in gravitational water, illustrating inputs from uphill. In the two soils, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations as well as Mg/Na and Ca/Na increased with depth. Along summer, the soil pore water chemistry evolved with thaw front and water table depths in the two sites. Particularly in the Histic Cryosol, electrical conductivity, solute concentrations, Mg/Na and Ca/Na ratios increased with the thaw front deepening. Our observations suggest that the active layer thickening and increasing supra-permafrost flow contribution, expected to increase with Arctic warming, could lead to a shift in chemistry of pore waters in organic and mineral permafrost soils, differently depending on permafrost landform settings.

AB Most citrus nurseries in Florida, USA use overhead irrigation, but subirrigation methods, including ebb-and-flow and capillary mats, have been shown to conserve water and accelerate plant growth relative to overhead irrigation for other nursery species and may be a viable alternative to overhead irrigation in citrus liner production. The objectives of this study were to (1) automate an ebb-and-flow system for citrus liner production using capacitance sensors, and (2) evaluate how subirrigation and overhead irrigation methods affect water use, plant growth parameters, and substrate chemical properties. A study was conducted from 22 May to 23 September 2018 in which liners of six commercially important rootstock cultivars in cone-shaped containers were subjected to one of the following irrigation methods: ebb-and-flow triggered at substrate volumetric water contents (theta) of 0.24, 0.36, or 0.48 m(3) m(-3), capillary mats, and overhead irrigation. Capacitance sensors successfully monitored irrigation throughout the study. Ebb-and-flow benches used substantially less water (similar to 411 L) than either capillary mats (13,098 L) or overhead irrigation (3193 L). By the end of the study, rootstock cultivars propagated using subirrigation methods were approximately 22% taller with 7% more total biomass than plants subjected to overhead irrigation. Additionally, plant growth at the 0.24 m(3) m(-3) threshold used to trigger ebb-and-flow was as great or greater than growth at 0.36 and 0.48 m(3) m(-3) thresholds. During the final five weeks of the study, substrate electrical conductivity was higher using subirrigation methods (0.84-1.3 ds m(-1)) than under overhead irrigation (0.55-0.8 ds m(-1)), but there were no symptoms of salt stress observed in plants at any time. Results from this study show that ebb-and-flow is a viable alternative to overhead irrigation and is superior to capillary mats for water conservation. In automated ebb-and-flow systems in Florida, we recommend using the 0.24 m(3) m(-3) threshold to produce the citrus rootstock cultivars used in this study with peat: perlite substrate.

AB Coal of varying age (Upper Carboniferous to Pliocene) and coalification rank (lignite to anthracite) from nineteen coal-bearing basins and deposits, belonging to 8 coal-bearing provinces from Bulgaria, were examined for the occurrence and distribution of Fe. For the majority of the coals, the average Fe concentrations vary from 1.1 to 10.2 wt% and are higher than the World's average. An exception exists only for Karlovo and Dobrudzha Basins, where slight depletion of Fe (<1 wt%) was established. On contrary, carbonaceous shales from the majority of the basins show Fe depletion in comparison to the Clarke values for clays. Based on the negative correlations with the ash yields, organic affinity of the element can be suggested for most of the studied coals. An exception exists for the Burgas Basin, for which predominantly inorganic affinity of the element can be suggested, whereas for Stanvantsi, Samokov, Bobov Dol, Dobrudzha and Svoge Basins mixed organic/inorganic affinity of Fe can be presumed. The element most probably predominantly occurs in the form of organometallic compounds, especially in the coals that formed in preferentially acidic peat-forming environment. Nevertheless, small contribution from biogenic iron cannot be excluded. The mineral form of Fe is probably mainly associated with sulfides, carbonates, and sulfates, although the presence of Fe oxides, silicates and hydroxides is also established. The analysis of Fe occurrence and its organic/ inorganic affinity in Bulgarian coals reveal the following controlling factors: i) Fe concentration within the basin's provenance; ii) the type (i.e. terrigenous or groundwater) of element supply; and iii) environmental conditions during peat-formation.

AB The Val Fenga in the Central Alps has been selected as the study area of a project comprising palaeoecological and phytosociological investigations, of which the results have been connected. The valley is situated in the border district between Austria and Switzerland. Its geological-geomorphological situation is complicated due to its location in the transition zone of two different geological nappes. The eastern side of the valley is part of the Lower Engadine Window and it is composed by flysch of the Penninic nappes while the western part belongs to the Austroalpine nappes, dominated by the crystalline rocks of the Silvretta massif. As a consequence of the comparatively high degree of hygric continentality the Val Fenga belongs to the climatic region of the Central Alps.
   To reconstruct the holocene climate and vegetation development palaeobotanical investigations of pear profiles, and in addition, analysis of pollen dispersal have been conducted. The investigations of the actual pollen deposition are made of moss cushions out of the entire investigation area. Different groups of pollen types (''indicator units'') which characterize the representation of different vegetation units and human impact in surface samples are determined by the results of the pollen analysis. The suitability of these units for the judgement of fossile pollen profiles is discussed.
   The main emphasis of the investigations about the climate and vegetation history was put on the palaeobotanical analysis made of five pear profiles which are situated in a transect from the lower subalpine up to the alpine belt. A survey of the investigated mires is given in Tab. 3. By a synoptic reflection the palynological results of these pear profiles are discussed, and the synchronous effects of climatic change and human impact on the landscape in different altitudes are shown.
   From the Boreal to the beginning of the Atlantic period a section of high climatic dynamics is shown by the pollen diagrams. During this time, the timberline, which reached almost the altitude of today's alpine belt, was depressed several times. Approximately at the beginning of the older Atlantic period Picea abies immigrated into the region during a section, which is characterized by humid climatic conditions. Sometime later, about 7000 BP, the spruce spread our at the same time the Larch-Arolla pine wood reached its highest extension. Findings of fossile Pinus cembra prove the rise of the Arolla pine to an altitude of about 2400 m asl. During the following time Alnus viridis immigrated into the region as well as Picen abies under more oceanic conditions. But because of the continental climate of the Central Alps, the species only occurs in small amounts since then.
   Climatic oscillations with only small effects on the timberline characterize the section of the younger Atlantic period. Only in the second half of the younger Atlantic and the following Subboreal period the intensity of the climatic changes increased and also had effects on the subalpine spruce forest. At that time the timberline reached an altitude of today's upper subalpine belt.
   At the end of the Atlantic period first palynological references of human impact appear, which are intensified during the following section of the Subboreal period, and which were connected with fortified settlements in the Lower Engadin. During the second part of the Subboreal period the pollen diagrams show clearings of the mountain forest downvalley to the lower subalpine belt.
   By the beginning of the Subatlantic period the human impact became more intensive. Sections of different human impact characterize the diagrams from the Early Middle Age. Since then the lower areas of the Val Fenga also were influenced by this impact. About 1400 BP, 1000 BP and during the period from the 15th to the 19th cent. the human impact culminated. During this time, the mountain forest was extensively destroyed.
   The area investigated phytosociologically in the middle and upper section of the Val Fenga contains plant communities of fourteen different classes. Basing on their vertical occurrences a separation of the subalpine and alpine belt into three resp. into two zones has been carried out. The description of the various plant communities focusses on rare syntaxa and those which are characterized by their insufficient state of investigation in the Alps up to now.
   This group includes the relictual Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis which occurs on alluvions, alluvial terraces and fens. In the Val Fenga the alliance is represented by five character species (Carer atrofusca, Carex microglochin, Juncus arcticus, Kobresia simpliciuscula und Tofieldia pusilla) and three associations of different ecological habitats. The Juncetum arctici appears at comparatively dry sites whilst the sparse stands of the Caricetum atrofusco-vaginatae occur on alluvions irrigated by quickly flowing water. The Caricetum microglochinis can be separated into two subassociations: the kobresietosum simpliciusculae on drier habitats and the very wet caricetosum microglochinis. Often a close relationship between the latter unit and stands of Eleocharis quinqueflora can be observed. Due to floristic, syndynamic and habitual reasons the community of Eleocharis has been adjoined as an initial unit to the Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis. As a result of their rarity, threat and the high rate of species mentioned in the Red Lists the communities of the Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis need the uppermost level of protection and conservation. According to investigations about the stratigraphy of pear layers the bryophyte Calliergon trifarium has attained a considerable importance concerning the foundation of the mire communities and the formation of pear in the higher elevated fens of the upper Val Fenga.
   In small pools becoming temporary dry shallow-water swards constituted by Alopecurus aequalis, Callitriche palustris, Ranunculus trichophyllus ssp. lutulentus und Rorippa mentioned, yet. According to the current knowledge these stands can be classified as Veronico scutellatae-Alopecuretum aequalis within the Littorelletea uniflorae.
   The very heterogenous composition of species of a special kind of meadows called Hypochoeris uniflora-Nardion strictae-community can be regarded as a consequence of their former irrigation by melted snow water enriched with dung and the decrease of mowing. In the subalpine belt the poorly investigated Chaerophyllo villarsii-Agrostietum schraderianae colonizes scree slopes composed of large rocks of gneisses of the Silvretta crystalline. A subtype of this association including tall herbs and named after Valeriana versifolia occurs on slippery and moist slate slopes. On stable scree slopes the Chaerophyllo villarsii-Agrostietum schraderianae develops to the heath community of the Junipero-Arctostaphyletum. A Chaerophyllum villarsii-subtype of the latter association with Laserpitium halleri, Ranunculus nemorosus s.str., Hieracium hoppeanum und Poa chaixii represents a conspicuous stage of this succession.

AB The consolidation behavior of Sri Lankan peaty clay is analyzed using an elasto-viscoplastic model. The model can describe the secondary compression behavior as a continuous process and it can also account for the effect of structural degradation on the consolidation analysis. The analysis takes into account all the main features involved in the process of peat consolidation, namely, finite strain, variable permeability, and the secondary compression. The material parameters required for the analysis and the procedures to evaluate them, using both standard laboratory and field tests, are explained. Initially, the model performance is assessed by comparing the predicted and the observed peat consolidation behavior under laboratory conditions. The results indicate that the model is capable of predicting the observed creep settlements and the effect of layer thickness on the settlement analysis of peaty clay. Then, the model is applied to predict the consolidation behavior of peaty clay under different field conditions. In this context, firstly, the one-dimensional field consolidation of peaty clay, brought about by the construction of compacted earth fill, is predicted. Then, the two-dimensional peat foundation response upon embankment loading is simulated. A good agreement is seen in the comparison of the predicted results with the field observations.

AB By using sites in the Great Marshes at Barnstable (Massachusetts. USA) this study examines the effects of a set of environmental parameters on the foraminiferal distribution. The studied parameters are: elevation above mean high water: salinity of the porewater: various sediment characteristics: vegetation: and food source. Relations between the environmental parameters and foraminiferal properties (frequencies. densities and diversities) are quantified with correlation coefficients. For the first time Siphotrochammina lobata and Balticammina pseudomacrescens are documented in the New England region.
   The following species show a significant correlation with one or more of the studied parameters and are designated as key-species: Haplophragmoides manilaensis. Jadammina macrescens. Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Milammina fusca and Tiphotrocha comprimata. Based on cluster analysis and the presence. absence or dominance of the key-species characteristic associations art: distinguished. The distribution of three associations is indicative of specific marsh environments: the marsh fringe, the middle marsh and the marsh edge. These three marsh units are separated by their own salinity regime. flooding and sediment characteristics.
   The marsh fringe is typified by the H. manilaensis, Association and experiences freshwater input (seepage, surface runoff and rainwater) and only slight marine influence. resulting in low salinity values (2.5-20 parts per thousand). The width of the marsh fringe is variable, dependent on the amount of seepage which in turn is controlled by the permeability of the basement and the peat. The J. macrescens Association characterizes the middle marsh where salinities are controlled by infiltration of sea- and rainwater and by evaporation. Salinity values are higher than 20 parts per thousand while temporarily salinity can reach extreme high values during periods without flooding and high evaporation rates (e.g., 44 parts per thousand). The fully marine M. fusca Association occupies the daily hooded marsh edge where,:he salinities have the same values as Cape Cod bay water (ca. 28 parts per thousand).
   Unlike many other salt marshes the distribution of foraminiferal assemblages in the Great Marshes does not show a vertical zonation with respect to mean high water. This shows that a worldwide applicable model for paleoenvironmental studies in salt marshes based on foraminifera is not feasible. Each salt marsh has its own characteristics. Regional factors such as climate play an important role in the salinity regime. while the local upland characteristics determine if seepage takes place. Thus each marsh has its own foraminiferal fingerprint showing the opportunistic behaviour of the salt marsh agglutinants. A surface study is an indispensable first step in assessing the value of foraminifera as paleo-ecological indicators. (C) Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Peatlands occupy around 13% of the land cover of Canada, and thus they play a key role in the water balance at high latitudes. They are well known for having substantial water loss due to evapotranspiration. Since measurements of evapotranspiration are scarce over these environments, hydrologists generally rely on models of varying complexity to evaluate these water exchanges in the global watershed balance. This study quantifies the water budget of a small boreal peatland-dominated watershed. We assess the performance of three evapotranspiration models in comparison with in situ observations and the impact of using these models in the hydrological modeling of the watershed. The study site (similar to 1 km(2)) is located in the eastern James Bay lowlands, Quebec, Canada. During summer 2012, an eddy flux tower measured evapotranspiration continuously, while a trapezoidal flume monitored streamflow at the watershed outlet. We estimated evapotranspiration with a combinational model (Penman), a radiation-based model (Priestley-Taylor), and a temperature-based model (Hydro-Quebec), and performed the hydrological modeling of the watershed with HYDROTEL, a physically based semi-distributed model. Our results show that the Penman and Priestley-Taylor models reproduce the observations with the highest precision, while a substantial drop in performance occurs with the Hydro-Quebec model. However, these discrepancies did not appear to reduce the hydrological model efficiency, at least from what can be concluded from a 3-month modeling period. HYDROTEL appears sensitive to evapotranspiration inputs, but calibration of model parameters can compensate for the differences. These findings still need to be confirmed with longer modeling periods.

AB Alpine wetlands in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a crucial role in the regional hydrological cycle due to their strong influence on surface ecohydrological processes; therefore, understanding how TP wetlands respond to climate change is essential for projecting their future condition and potential vulnerability. We investigated the hydrological responses of a large TP wetland complex to recent climate change, by combining multiple satellite observations and in-situ hydro-meteorological records. We found different responses of runoff production to regional warming trends among three basins with similar climate, topography and vegetation cover but different wetland proportions. The basin with larger wetland proportion (40.1%) had a lower mean runoff coefficient (0.173 +/- 0.006), and also showed increasingly lower runoff level (-3.9% year(-1), p = 0.002) than the two adjacent basins. The satellite-based observations showed an increasing trend of annual non-frozen period, especially in the wetland-dominated region (2.64 day.year(-1), p < 0.10), and a strong extension of vegetation growing-season (0.26-0.41 day.year(-1), p < 0.10). Relatively strong increasing trends in evapotranspiration (ET) (similar to 1.00 mm.year(-1), p < 0.01) and the vertical temperature gradient above ground surface (0.043 degrees C.year(-1), p < 0.05) in wetland-dominant areas were documented from satellite-based ET observations and weather station records. These results indicate recent surface drying and runoff reduction of alpine wetlands, and their potential vulnerability to degradation with continued climate warming.

   WETLANDS; MEAN WATER-TABLE DEPTH; SEA-LEVEL RISE
AB The relationship between ground-water fluctuations and the canopy compositions of five tidal freshwater swamps were examined. Tide gauge data were compared with measured ground-water fluctuations to assess the role of tides in driving the hydrologic regimes of tidal swamps. Flooding in tidal swamps was found to be closely associated with high tides. As the tides dropped through the hummock zone (elevated area, about 15 cm high, to which the trees are restricted), drainage of the hollows (low areas between hummocks) occurred at the same rate as the falling tides. After the tides dropped below the elevation of the hollows, the lowering of the water table became much slower than that of the falling tides, presumably because peat in the root zone inhibited drainage. When the subsequent rising tides reached the elevation of the water table, the water table rose vertically with the tides. Flooding recurred in the hollows as the tides rose above the surface of the ground. The composition of the canopy was found to be related to the mean water-table depth (WTD) (i.e., the depth in relation to the hummock elevation at which the soil was flooded 50% of the time) and not to the duration, depth, or frequency of flooding. Tidal swamps dominated by Fraxinus spp. and Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora occurred in the wetter sites (mean WTD = 17 cm), whereas swamps dominated by Acer rubrum and Liquidambar styraciflua occurred in less wet sites (mean WTD = 21 to 30 cm). Tidal freshwater swamps are precariously positioned at the upper portion of the tidal range where they seem to keep pace with a rising sea level by accumulating biomass (logs and roots). Potential threats to the distribution and areal extent of tidal freshwater swamps include any abrupt changes in the rate of sea-level rise, periodic logging, or blockage of their upriver migration due to incompatible land use.

   DRAINAGE EVOLUTION; CLIMATIC-CHANGE; TSODILO HILLS; MANTLE PLUMES; RIVER
   SYSTEM; PEAT FIRE
AB The Okavango Delta is southern Africa's largest wetland ecosystem and probably the most pristine large wetland ecosystem in the world. Alex du Toit was the first to recognize the role of faulting in the origin of the Delta, proposing that the Delta lies within a graben structure related to the East African Rift Valley system. The history of its rivers is more ancient, extending back to the breakup of Gondwana.
   Two mantle plumes initiated the breakup of Gondwana: the 140 Ma Karoo plume and the 130 Ma Parana-Etendeka plume. Domical uplift and rifting associated with these plumes created two major river systems: the Okavango-Zambezi-Limpopo system and the Vaal-Orange system. The climate at the time of breakup was hot and humid and the interior experienced extensive erosion, so much so that by the Oligocene (ca. 30 Ma), the sub-continent had been planed, to base level, rising only a few hundred metres above sea level and mantled by thick, leached soils (now known as the African Erosion Surface).
   Warping in the continent interior created uplifted arches and depressions, most notably the Kalahari basin. Arching severed the link between the lower Limpopo and its central African headwaters (Zambezi-Okavango), and a large lake formed in the Kalahari depression (Lake Palaeo-Makgadikgadi). This lake gradually disappeared, partly due to sedimentation but mainly due to the increasing dry climate.
   The East Africa Rift system commenced in the Afar about 30 Ma ago and began to propagate southwards. In southern Malawi and especially in Zambia, the path of rifting has not yet been clearly established and the region is characterized by numerous horsts and grabens. One of these grabens passes through the Okavango Delta. The formation of these grabens has profoundly affected the courses of the rivers in the region.
   The Okavango River debouches into the graben forming a large alluvial fan. Lakes have periodically existed at the toe of the Okavango fan where it abuts the bounding fault scarps, but these are not permanent. Some Okavango water discharges across the bounding fault scarps and flows into the Makgadikgadi depression to the southeast.
   The Okavango River catchment is largely underlain by Kalahari sand, which forms the major particulate sediment carried by the river. Consequently, sediment carried by the river is mainly fine sand, with little silt and mud. The dissolved solid concentration in the river water is low (ca. 40 mg/L) and consists mainly of silica and calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. However, the volume of water entering the Delta each year is large and hence the solutes constitute the largest component of the sediment carried into the Delta.
   The Okavango River discharges onto the alluvial fan where water is carried in channels that form the major primary distributaries. Channel margins are formed by vegetal material and are permeable, leaking water which sustains permanent swamps in the upper portion of the alluvial fan. The arrival of the seasonal flood increases the rate of channel leakage, forming the seasonal swamps on the lower fan. The advance of the flood water across the seasonal swamps is slow, as much of it infiltrates the ground, taking four to five months to traverse the 250 km length of the fan.
   Bedload is confined to channels and as water leaks through the channel margins, channel beds aggrade, increasing leakage, which further promotes bed aggradation. Channels eventually fail and water diverts elsewhere. Channel formation and failure results in a constant shift in the distribution of water across the Delta surface. The demise of a channel system results in desiccation of the surrounding peat, which is then destroyed by slow-burning peat fires. Nutrients and fine particulate material accumulated in the peat is released, enriching the soil.
   Most of the water delivered to the Delta annually is lost to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration because of the semi-arid climate. Transpiration of groundwater by terrestrial plants is the dominant means of water loss. The high transpiration rate of trees is particularly important: trees grow on islands and their transpiration lowers the water table beneath islands so there is a net flow of water towards islands. Solutes, especially silica and carbonates of calcium and magnesium, precipitate, leaving only the very soluble sodium carbonate in solution. Its concentration rises and impacts on the vegetation, resulting in a zonation in the distribution of plant species on islands. The salinity of the groundwater ultimately rises to the point where gravity induced advection occurs, thus transferring the sodium carbonate to the deep groundwater. This process prevents the formation of surface saline brine in the Delta and surface water remains fresh. The accumulation of precipitated solutes results in expansion and this form of chemical precipitation is the major mechanism of sedimentation in the distal regions of the Delta. Islands are mainly initiated as a consequence of termite activity during dry periods. Sand ridges which form by channel bed sedimentation may also result in islands.
   Constant changes in the distribution of water across the fan due to channel failure have profound effects on the ecology of the Delta: regions of swamp may revert to dry land, when rain flushes accumulated salts from the island soils; and formerly dry areas become seasonally or even permanently flooded. Such constant changes, operating on time-scales of decades to centuries, underpin the immense habitat diversity of the Okavango Delta.

TI HOLOCENE EVOLUTION OF RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL AND LOCAL MEAN HIGH WATER
   SPRING TIDES IN BELGIUM - A FIRST ASSESSMENT
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Holocene age-depth data from the Belgian coastal plain, basal peat data particularly, are assessed in terms of local water and tide levels. Basal peat formation was generally induced by sea-level rise; effects of local seepage were limited and significant river-gradient effects were absent. No relation was found between the timing of basal peat inception and substrate permeability. In general, edaphic (moisture) conditions were unfavourable for organic accumulation prior to sea-level related rise of the groundwater table. Error envelopes for the minimum level of local mean high water spring tides and for upper and extreme lower relative mean sea-level limits during the last 9400 solar years (8400 yrs B.P.) are presented. These indicate that the rate of relative sea-level rise showed marked retardations at ca. 7500-7000 yrs cal B.P. (+/-6650-6100 yrs B.P.) and ca. 5500-5000 yrs cal B.P. (4400 yrs B.P.). A eustatic explanation appears to be plausible, particularly for the former. Prior to ca. 4000 yrs cal B.P. (ca. 3600 yrs B.P.), the relative sea-level rise in Belgium differs noticeably from that established for the western Netherlands, with both diverging progressively back in time. This implies that considerable differential crustal movement occurred between the two areas in the early Holocene.

   LOGGING RESIDUE; NITROUS-OXIDE; CO2 EXCHANGE; WATER-VAPOR; N2O FLUXES;

AB The most common forest management method in Fennoscandia is rotation forestry, including clear-cutting and forest regeneration. In clear-cutting, stem wood is removed and the logging residues are either removed or left on site. Clear-cutting changes the microclimate and vegetation structure at the site, both of which affect the site's carbon balance. Peat soils with poor aeration and high carbon densities are especially prone to such changes, and significant changes in greenhouse gas exchange can be expected. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy fluxes with the eddy covariance method for 2 years (April 2016-March 2018) after clear-cutting a drained peatland forest. We observed a significant rise (23 cm) in the water table level and a large CO2 source (first year: 3086 +/- 148 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1); second year: 2072 +/- 124 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). These large CO2 emissions resulted from the very low gross primary production (GPP) following the removal of photosynthesizing trees and the decline of ground vegetation, unable to compensate for the decomposition of logging residues and peat. During the second summer (June-August) after the clear-cutting, GPP had already increased by 96% and total ecosystem respiration decreased by 14% from the previous summer. The mean daytime ratio of sensible to latent heat flux decreased after harvesting from 2.6 in May 2016 to 1.0 in August 2016, and in 2017 it varied mostly within 0.6-1.0. In April-September, the mean daytime sensible heat flux was 33% lower and latent heat flux 40% higher in 2017, probably due to the recovery of ground vegetation that increased evapotranspiration and albedo of the site. In addition to CO2 and energy fluxes, we measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes with manual chambers. After the clear-cutting, the site turned from a small CH4 sink into a small source and from N2O neutral to a significant N2O source. Compared to the large CO2 emissions, the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) of the CH4 emissions was negligible. Also, the GWP100 due to increased N2O emissions was less than 10% of that of the CO2 emission change.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to quantify the potential risk of P leaching to groundwater in characteristic soil types in The Netherlands. In areas with shallow groundwater P losses via groundwater to surface waters is an important pathway.
   Methods: The risk of P leaching to groundwater can be assessed by means of the phosphate saturation degree (PSD) methodology. The PSD is an index of the actual phosphate accumulation in the soil (P-act) in relation to the maximum phosphate sorption capacity (PSCm) of the soil to a reference depth. To assess the risk of P leaching the actual PSD of soils has to be compared to the critical PSD (PSDcrit) of the soil type. The critical PSD is determined for characteristic soil types based on phosphate sorption and desorption characteristics, and a reference depth (L-ref) where a defined P concentration (C-p) in solution may not be exceeded. A stratified soil survey is used to determine the actual PSD of the soils.
   Results: The critical phosphate saturation degree we determined for the main Dutch soil types varies from 5%-78%. The average P accumulation in agricultural soils in The Netherlands is about 2050 kg P ha(-1) (4700 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) and the 5 parts per thousand and 95 parts per thousand are approximately 850 and 4500 kg P ha(-1). Since maize can tolerate high manure application rates, more phosphate has been applied on maize in the past, and high P accumulations are measured. In about 43% of the agricultural land in The Netherlands the critical PSD value for the given soil type is exceeded.
   Practice: Consequently, a large area of agricultural land contributes, or is expected to contribute to the P pollution of surface water in the nearby future. Especially from fields with a high PSD severe P losses can occur due to the convex relationship between the PSD and the P concentrations in soil solution.
   Implementation: Strategies and additional measures are needed for fields with a high PSD in order to substantially reduce the P losses from agricultural land to surface waters within a catchment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrodynamics of tree islands during the growth of newly planted trees has been found to be influenced by both vegetation biomass and geologic conditions. From July 2007 through June 2009, groundwater and surface-water levels were monitored on eight recently planted tree islands at the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA) facility in Boynton Beach, Florida, USA. Over the 2-year study, stand development coincided with the development of a water-table depression in the center of each of the islands that was bounded by a hydraulic divide along the edges. The water-table depression was greater in islands composed of limestone as compared to those composed of peat. The findings of this study suggest that groundwater evapotranspiration by trees on tree islands creates complex hydrologic interactions between the shallow groundwater in tree islands and the surrounding surface water and groundwater bodies.

AB This study examines the influence of riparian zone hydrology, lithology and redox chemistry on groundwater phosphate dynamics. Patterns of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), dissolved oxygen (DO) and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in combination with hydrologic data and sediment characteristics were studied in a forested floodplain connected to a large upland sand aquifer in an agricultural region of southern Ontario, Canada. Groundwater discharge from the upland aquifer flowed laterally beneath peat in a 2-4 m thick zone of permeable sands across the floodplain to the river. Within the sands, low SRP concentrations (<25 <mu>g L-1) occurred in a plume of groundwater with DO concentrations >3 mg L-1 and Fe2+ concentrations <0.2 mg L-1 which extended for a horizontal distance of 100-140 m across the riparian zone. High SRP concentrations (50-950 <mu>g L-1) were associated with low DO and high Fe2+ concentrations which exceeded 1 mg L-1 in buried channel sediments near the river bank. Sediment P fractionation indicated that the: buried channel sediments contained a much higher pool of total P and Fe + AI-P than the sands. Groundwater SRP concentrations at the river bank were 25-80 mug L-1 compared to < 10 <mu>g L-1 in river water indicating that the floodplain was a source of SRP to the river. Areas of elevated SRP and Fe2+ within the floodplain expanded in August when DO concentrations in groundwater were lower than in late spring or autumn. These data suggest that the microbial reduction of Fe3+ to soluble Fe2+ in anaerobic conditions influences groundwater SRP concentrations in the riparian zone. This study shows that well organized patterns of groundwater SRP concentrations occur in riparian zones which reflect the interaction of hydrologic flowpaths and environments of different redox state. Internal sources of P associated with buried channel sediments can also influence subsurface SRP transport and release to streams. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands and their ability to mitigate climate change motivates restorative and protective action; however, scientific understanding of land-atmosphere interactions is restricted by our limited continuous observations of gaseous fluxes. Many wetlands are small in spatial scale and embedded in forested landscapes. Yet, little is known about how the relative sheltering of forests affects net carbon (C) and energy balance. Here, we analyze coterminous USGS and Ameriflux eddy covariance flux tower observations over 3 years in two shrub fens in Northern Wisconsin, one more sheltered (US-ALQ) than the other (US-Los). Unsurprisingly, the open site showed higher overall wind speeds. This should have implications for atmospheric fluxes in wetlands as wind-forced processes are essential in promoting gas exchange over water. While both sites had similar half-hourly net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) during daytime, there were significant differences in nighttime NEE, as well as in net radiation partitioning in early spring and late summer. Sensible heat (H) fluxes were smaller at the sheltered fen except for the months of July-September. In contrast, latent heat (LE) fluxes were higher in every month except July. Additionally, sheltered fen ecosystem respiration had a weaker linear correlation with air temperature (R: 0.08 vs. 0.57 for the open fen). Our work suggests that canopy sheltering does not cause significant differences in half-hourly NEE during the day, but rather the largest differences such as lower CO2 emissions occur at nighttime due to higher variance at very low wind speeds. Sheltering also influenced direction of air flow, mean wind speeds in day vs. night, energy balance, and sensible and latent heat fluxes. We discuss implications of these findings for wetland restoration.

AB The main results of a long-term ecological study from 1957 to 1994 are presented. Aspects of vegetation dynamics and hydrology of a South German ombrogenous bog were analysed in different spatial scales and temporal periods.
   Vegetation change from 1957 to 1992 was documented by permanent plots and comparison of vegetation maps. Pinus sylvestris dominated forest stages, bog forests and Calluna vulgaris hummocks increased by replacing Sphagnum lawns and hollow structures in the course of succession.
   Fundamental changes in hydrology occurred in the same period of time. Monthly water level means dropped by approximately 10-15 cm and duration and extent of the maximum water levels were reduced. Discharge of the catchment area remained almost constant during the winter months, but summer discharge significantly declined. Important climatic factors (air temperature, monthly and annual precipitation) showed a common high variability during the same period, but no significant trend could be found. At the same time, trend analysis indicates a 350 mm increase in the total yearly evapotranspiration.
   Numerous interdependences between vegetation development and hydrology are hidden behind the long-term dynamics of this ecosystem. The complexity of the bog ecosystem prevents a simplistic separation of causes and effects. But this long-term study can help to clarify the debate about the effectiveness of vegetation switches or species acting as ecosystem engineers.
   The invasion of tree species of the genus Pinus and Betula contributes to structure important hydrologic features that change abiotic conditions for other species within the ecosystems. However, such processes of interaction between biotic and abiotic ecosystem properties cause additional positive or negative feedback mechanisms. Succession in raised bogs might be a good way of showing that discrimination between biotic and abiotic ecosystem processes requires an interdisciplinary approach.

ID IMAGE-ANALYSIS; SECTIONS
AB Great quantities of organic matter are added reconstituting soils in urban conditions. To evaluate the efficiency of organic matter on physical properties of reconstituted soils, we studied the effects of loading on intrinsic permeability of soils mixed with peat. Percolation theory associated with a statistical porosity approach was used to explain variation of permeability related to porosity. After compression, sample porosity was measured and the pore-space morphology described by image analysis. An ellipse with major axis (a) and minor axis (b) was inscribed within each pore. All the pores appeared as lenses of different sizes which could be assumed to represent disk-shaped cracks characterized by a diameter d and an aperture e. The crack model was calculated by means of a percolation threshold, p(c) = 0.33, along with values d and e as well as the measured porosity. This allowed a determination of the crack interconnection factor f. During compression, the number of pores per unit area decreased. Increasing the loading closed off pores and modified flow pathways. Connected sites facilitating percolation became disconnected from each other and the now was reduced. The effective porosity, which actually took part in flow, was determined for all the samples and was dependent on peat content.

AB The pollution of rivers and streams with agro-chemical contaminants has become one of the most crucial environmental problems in the world. The assessment of spatial and temporal variations of water quality influenced by point and diffuse source pollution is necessary to manage the environment sustainably in various watershed scales. The overall objectives of this study were to assess the transferability of parameter sets between lowland catchments on different scales using the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of water quality in the whole catchments before and after implementation of best management practices (BMPs).
   The study area Kielstau catchment is located in Northern Germany as typical example of lowland - flood plain landscape. Sandy, loamy and peat soils are characteristic for this area. Land use is dominated by arable land and pasture. In this study we examined two catchment areas including Kielstau catchment 50 km(2) and its subcatchment, namely Moorau, with the area of 7.6 km(2). The water quality of these catchments is not only influenced by diffuse sources from agricultural areas but also by point sources from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Diffuse sources as well as punctual entries from the WWTPs are considered in the model set-up. For this study, the calibration and validation of the model were carried out in a daily time step for flow and nutrients. The results indicate that the parameter sets could be transferred in lowland catchments with similar environmental conditions. Shallow groundwater is the major contributor to total nitrate load in the stream accounting for about 93% of the total nitrate load, while only about 7% originates in surface runoff and lateral flow. The study also indicates that applying a spatially distributed modeling approach was an appropriate method to generate source maps showing the spatial distribution of TN load from hydrologic response units (HRUs) as well as from subbasins and to identify the crucial pollution areas within a watershed whose management practices can be improved to control more effectively nitrogen loading to water bodies.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID HIGH PLATEAUS; ALTITUDE; RECHARGE; AQUIFERS
AB The hydrodynamics of the groundwater system of the upland granito-gneissic plateau of Madagascar is governed by the structure of the underlying aquifer. In the alteritic interfluves, the aquifer has two layers; the peat aquifer is multilayered.
   Groundwater levels and spring discharges observed over 3 successive years distinguish between two different types of hydraulic behaviour. (1) Under the interfluves, unconfined conditions are found in allochtonous weathered material, and semi-confined conditions in the autochtonous weathered basement. These two systems are separated by a semi-permeable clay layer. The first system responds rapidly to rainfall (approximately 15 days) whereas the second system responds more slowly (approximately 3 months). This leads to a vertical flux between the two aquifers, the direction of which depends on the season; at the beginning of the wet season the flux is downwards, but during the later part of the season the direction reverses. (2) In the low-lying regions, where sequences are superimposed, the direction of the vertical flow changes several times over a year. At the beginning of the wet season the flux is downwards, it reverses at the end of the season. A downwards flux is then observed towards the second part of the dry season. Such behaviour is only observed in the lowest third of the catchment where permeable silts take the place of less permeable peat.
   This pattern of fluxes suggests a close relationship between surface water and groundwater regimes, and has a major influence on the individual water balances of the two systems.

AB As a phenomenon integrating climate conditions and hydrological control of the connection between streams and terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources, groundwater dynamics control patterns of stream DOC characteristics (concentrations and fluxes). Influence of intra-annual variations in groundwater level, discharge and climatic factors on DOC concentrations and fluxes were assessed over 13 years at the headwater watershed of Kervidy-Naizin (5 km(2)) in western France. Four seasonal periods were delineated within each year according to groundwater fluctuations (A: rewetting, B: high flow, C: recession, and D: drought). Annual and seasonal base flow versus stormflow DOC concentrations were defined based on daily hydrograph readings. High interannual variability of annual DOC fluxes (5.4-39.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) indicates that several years of data are required to encompass variations in water flux to evaluate the actual DOC export capacity of a watershed. Interannual variability of mean annual DOC concentrations was much lower (4.9-7.5 mg CL-1), with concentrations decreasing within each year from ca. 9.2 mg CL-1 in A to ca. 3.0 mg CL-1 in C. This indicates an intra-annual pattern of stream DOC concentrations controlled by DOC source characteristics and groundwater dynamics very similar across years. Partial least squares regressions combined with multiple linear regressions showed that the dry season characteristics (length and draw-down) determine the mean annual DOC concentration while annual runoff determines the annual flux. Antagonistic mechanisms of production-accumulation and dilution-depletion combined with an unlimited DOC supply from riparian wetland soils can mitigate the response of stream concentrations to global changes and climatic variations.

AB At AECL - Chalk River Laboratories, Ontario, Canada solid, low-level radioactive wastes from industrial, academic and medical applications have been stored in trenches above unconsolidated sandy glacial tills and permeable very-fine to fine-grained sands overlying crystalline bedrock. The sandy aquifer system drains into a swamp comprised of approximately 3 m of sphagnum peat. A comprehensive field and analytical program, involving measurements of total iodine, I-129, tritium, C-14 and C-13/C-12 ratios in groundwater and geologic materials (sands and peats), was initiated at this site to examine the partitioning of I-127 I and I-129 amongst the various reservoirs in this system and the controlling factors.
   The maximum iodine concentration and I-129 inside the groundwater contaminant plume at the recharge and discharge sites were 67.0 ng/ml and similar to 8.3 x 10(11) atoms/liter, and 32.4 ng/ml and similar to 2.9 x 10(11) atoms/liter, respectively, with positive correlations between iodine, C-14 (0.82), and tritium (0.87). Maximum total iodine concentrations for in-plume, recharge-site sands and discharge-site peats were 190.1 mug/kg and 14100 mug/kg, respectively. I-129 analyses on these same samples showed concentrations of 2.3 x 10(7) and 6.4 x 10(9) atoms/g of soil, respectively.
   K-D values (concentration on porous medium/concentration in co-existing water) calculated from the contaminant plume data for I-127 and I-129 were 1.3 and 1.61/kg, respectively, at the recharge site and 486 and 931/kg, respectively, at the discharge area, indicating that both stable and radio-iodine are preferentially sorbed to the organic rich, aquifer materials at the discharge sites. Incremental leach experiments on these same geologic materials have borne out these differences, with I-127 being more strongly sorbed than I-129, probably as the result of kinetically controlled sorption mechanisms and the differing residence times of stable and radio-iodine in this hydrologic regime.

AB Although the ability of stream riparian buffers to reduce nitrate in groundwater has been promoted, the effectiveness of nitrate removal in riparian zones with upwelling springs and overland flows is not well understood The relationship between groundwater-fed surface flow path hydrodynamics and nitrate removal was investigated in three riparian zones in southern Ontario, Canada. Spring-fed surface flow in white cedar forests at the upland perimeter of the riparian zones occurred as rivulets linked to shallow horizontal pipe systems in peat deposits. These rivulet-pipe systems transported water at rates that were up to 13x faster than in downslope portions of the riparian zones where diffuse flow paths occurred in marshes and areas of mixed cedar-grass vegetation Bromide tracers indicated the exchange of water along surface flow paths between areas of faster flow and storage zones in soil pore-water or in slow moving and stagnant pools of surface water. High nitrate concentrations in upwelling groundwater showed little decline for distances of up to 100 m along rivulet-pipe networks suggesting that these flow paths were ineffective in nitrate removal. Nitrate concentrations declined by 50-95% during the summer in areas of diffuse surface flow in the three riparian zones. Analysis of the distribution of delta(15)N-NO(3) values suggests that denitrification is an important mechanism of nitrate removal. Nitrate concentrations also declined by 25-80% along diffuse surface flow paths in the spring season when the riparian water table was at or above the ground surface. Cold water temperatures (1-6 degrees C) limited biological removal and most of this nitrate decline resulted from dilution by exfiltration of groundwater that had a low nitrate concentration as a result of denitrification during subsurface transport Measurements in one of the riparian zones showed that, despite this nitrate dilution, the increase in runoff volume resulted in an 8x larger nitrate-N flux entering the stream from riparian surface flow paths in the spring vs. summer. This study indicates that riparian zones with groundwater-fed surface flow paths vary in their ability to deplete nitrate A conceptual model linking different surface flow patterns to solute exchanges with riparian soils and water residence time is developed to understand and predict nitrate removal effectiveness.

AB Wonderkrater, a Middle Stone Age site in the interior of South Africa, is a spring and peat mound featuring both paleoclimatic and archaeological records. The site preserves three small MSA lithic assemblages with age estimates of 30 ka, >45 ka and 138.01 +/- 7.7 ka. Here we present results of the pollen analysis of a core retrieved from the middle of the peat mound, which covers, with hiatuses, the timespan between ca. 70 +/- 10 ka and 30 ka. Pollen percentages of terrestrial, local aquatic, and semi-aquatic plants reveal changes in the regional climate and in the water table of the spring. Results identify regional wet conditions at ca. 70 +/- 10 ka, followed by a dry and a wet period between 60 ka and 30 ka. Superimposed on these three phases, recurring changes in the size and depth of the water table are observed between >45 ka and 30 ka. Wet conditions at 70 ka and 30 ka are tentatively correlated here with Marine Isotope Stage 4 and Heinrich Stadial 3, respectively. A warm and dry savanna landscape was present during human occupation older than 45 ka, and a wet phase was contemporaneous with the final occupation, dated at similar to 30 ka.

AB Wetland biogeochemistry is strongly influenced by water and temperature dynamics, and these interactions are currently poorly represented in ecosystem and climate models. A decline in water table of approximately 30 cm was observed at a wetland in Northern Wisconsin, USA over a period from 2001-2007, which was highly correlated with an increase in daily soil temperature variability. Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were compared with measured CO2 fluxes at two nearby forests in order to distinguish wetland effects from regional trends. As wetland water table declined, both ecosystem respiration and ecosystem production increased by over 20% at the wetland, while forest CO2 fluxes had no significant trends. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide at the wetland was not correlated with water table, but wetland evapotranspiration decreased substantially as the water table declined. These results suggest that changes in hydrology may not have a large impact on shrub wetland carbon balance over inter-annual time scales due to opposing responses in both ecosystem respiration and productivity.

AB We used a process-based model to examine the role of spatial heterogeneity of surface and sub-surface water on the carbon budget of the wetlands of the West Siberian Lowland over the period 1948-2010. We found that, while surface heterogeneity (fractional saturated area) had little overall effect on estimates of the region's carbon fluxes, sub-surface heterogeneity (spatial variations in water table depth) played an important role in both the overall magnitude and spatial distribution of estimates of the region's carbon fluxes. In particular, to reproduce the spatial pattern of CH4 emissions recorded by intensive in situ observations across the domain, in which very little CH4 is emitted north of 60 degrees N, it was necessary to (a) account for CH4 emissions from unsaturated wetlands and (b) use spatially varying methane model parameters that reduced estimated CH4 emissions in the northern (permafrost) half of the domain (and/or account for lower CH4 emissions under inundated conditions). Our results suggest that previous estimates of the response of these wetlands to thawing permafrost may have overestimated future increases in methane emissions in the permafrost zone.

AB Organic-rich, eutrophic peat soils (Histosols) represent a major store of carbon (C) within the terrestrial biosphere. However, these soils are also highly susceptible to damage, particularly when used for intensive agricultural production. Sustainable management of such soils is contingent upon improved understanding of the impact of their management on the environment. In this context, we report the first annual budget of greenhouse gas emissions from temperate peat soils under intensive horticultural production. Fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured using static chambers on three farms along an organic matter loss gradient (similar to 20%, similar to 35%, and similar to 70% soil organic matter (SOM) content respectively), under a number of commercially important crops in similar rotations. Cumulative annual fluxes of CO2 in fallow and cropped soils were large and ranged from 13.0 +/- 2.4 to 30.9 +/- 2.5 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1), showing a general increase with SOM, and on cropped compared to bare soils. Annual emissions of N2O varied from 5.0 +/- 0.7 to 13.9 +/- 1.9 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1), and CH4 from 0.02 +/- 0.08 to 0.04 +/- 0.02 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1); neither showed a significant relationship with either SOM content or cropping. Distinct seasonal patterns of CO2 and N2O fluxes were observed, corresponding to significant correlations between emissions and soil and air temperature, soil moisture content, water table depth, and soil nitrate on some soil types. No discernible seasonal pattern in CH4 fluxes was observed, and very few significant correlations with soil environmental variables were found. Compared to emissions estimates suggested in IPCC inventory guidelines for cultivated peat soils, the observed emissions in this study were relatively high, and net annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are equivalent to a loss of soil depth of 0.33-0.75 cm y(-1). We conclude that arable farming is promoting extreme mineralization of the soil's organic carbon reserves and that a change in land use or management regime is needed to protect and preserve this natural capital.

TI Moving beyond the direction of climate change to estimating its

AB Paleoclimate proxy studies of wetland sediment cores often document the direction if not the magnitude of climate change because transfer functions (pollen, diatoms, etc.) are unavailable or imprecise. A water-budget approach, presented here, circumvents the need for transfer functions in wetlands, using the Garden Basin cattail fen (GBC; Fish Lake Plateau, Utah, USA) as a model system. Prior studies of the GBC fen revealed both high and low-frequency oscillations between fen and pond states over the last 12.5 ka. Pollen indicated that pond-like conditions were accompanied by both greater monsoon and annual precipitation rates. However, the magnitude of these changes was not estimated.
   By synthesizing multiple approaches, including water-level monitoring, remote sensing (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), and terrain analysis, limits were placed on precipitation changes required for pond versus fen ecosystems in Garden Basin. NDVI data show that water levels may be controlled by evapotranspiration (ET) instead of spring snowmelt. Water levels increase in mid-winter in response to the decline of photosynthesis of surrounding pi pinon-juniper (PJ) forest. In late summer through fall, ET drives the fen system into a moisture deficit and water declines below the ground surface.
   Quantitative limits on both annual and seasonal precipitation changes can be obtained through water budgets. For the GBC model, mean annual precipitation (similar to 350 mm/yr) must double (similar to 700 mm/yr) to sustain perennial standing water for 95% of years. Increases in late summer (monsoon) through fall (cyclonic) precipitation requires lesser rates (100-200 mm/yr) to satisfy PJ ET demands to maintain standing water. Thus, the habitats of many wetlands globally may be particularly sensitive to late-season precipitation where ET is the primary control on water levels. In summary, the GBC fen and its water budget are a template for quantifying the magnitude, rather than just the direction, of precipitation change in wetland systems through time.

AB We measured molecular distributions and compound-specific hydrogen (delta D) and stable carbon isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of mid- and long-chain n-alkanes in forest soils, wetland peats and lake sediments within the Dorokawa watershed, Hokkaido, Japan, to better understand sources and processes associate with delivery of terrestrial organic matter into the lake sediments. delta C-13 values of odd carbon numbered C-23-C-33 n-alkanes ranged from -37.2 parts per thousand to -31.5 parts per thousand, while delta D values of these alkanes showed a large degree of variability that ranged from -244 parts per thousand to -180 parts per thousand. Molecular distributions in combination with stable carbon isotopic compositions indicate a large contribution of C3 trees as the main source of n-alkanes in forested soils whereas n-alkanes in wetland soil are exclusively derived from marsh grass and/or moss. We found that the n-alkane delta D values are much higher in forest soils than wetland peat. The higher delta D values in forest samples could be explained by the enrichment of deuterium in leaf and soil waters due to increased evapotranspiration in the forest or differences in physiology of source plants between wetland and forest. A delta C-13 vs. delta D diagram of n-alkanes among forest, wetland and lake samples showed that C-25-C-31 n-alkanes deposited in lake sediments are mainly derived-from tree leaves due to the preferential transport of the forest soil organic matter over the wetland or an increased contribution of atmospheric input of tree leaf wax in the offshore sites. This study demonstrates that compound-specific delta D analysis provides a useful approach for better understanding source and transport of terrestrial biomarkers in a C3 plant-dominated catchment.

AB Wetlands are common in Coastal Western Hemlock forests yet the hydrologic processes that generate runoff from small swamps are not completely understood. Direct field observations, hydrologic, and electrical conductivity data were collected from a gently sloping forested swamp complex from July to November 2009. Swamps occupied depressions between raised mounds (0.1 to 3 m high) and were connected by an ephemeral creek. Runoff was controlled by antecedent moisture conditions and influenced by basin microtopography. Two hydrologic regimes occurred during the study period and different runoff processes dominated each regime. Runoff was generated by subsurface flow during dry antecedent conditions as swamps remained hydrologically disconnected from each other. Runoff was generated by surface outflow from hydrologically connected swamps during wet antecedent conditions as ponded water spilled out of the depressions. The forested swamp complex produced a faster but limited hydrologic response during dry antecedent conditions compared to a slower but greater hydrologic response during wet antecedent conditions. Stormwater runoff and runoff ratios were up to two orders of magnitude higher in wet conditions than during similarly sized events in dry conditions. These factors should be considered when designing monitoring programs or runoff models in forested swamps with significant microtopography. Field surveys and estimates of hydrologic inputs and outputs may be useful in predicting the potential hydrologic connectivity of isolated forested swamps.

AB Micrometeorological measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were made in an open peatland in north central Minnesota during two growing seasons (1991 and 1992). The vegetation at the site was dominated by Sphagnum papillosum, Scheuchzeria palustris, and Chamaedaphne calyculata. The objective of the study was to examine the diurnal and seasonal variations in canopy photosynthesis (P) and develop information on the net ecosystem CO2 exchange. The two seasons provided contrasting microclimatic conditions: as compared with 1991, the 1992 season was significantly wetter and cooler. Canopy photosynthesis was sensitive to changes in light, temperature, and moisture stress (as indicated by water table depth and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit). Under moderate conditions (temperature 18-28 degrees C, vapor pressure deficit 0.7-1.5 kPa, and water table near the surface) during the peak growth period, midday (averaged between 1000-1400 hours) P values ranged from 0.15 to 0.24 mg m(-2) s(-1). Under high-temperature (30 degrees-34 degrees C) and moisture stress (water table 0.16-0.23 m below the surface and vapor pressure deficit 2.2-3.0 kPa) conditions, midday P was reduced to about 0.03-0.06 mg m(-2) s(-1). There was a high degree of consistency in the values of P under similar conditions in the two seasons. Seasonally integrated values of the daily net ecosystem CO2 exchange indicated that the study site was a source of atmospheric CO2, releasing about 71 g C m(-2) over a 145-day period (May-October) in 1991. Over a similar period in 1992, however, this ecosystem was a sink for atmospheric CO2 with a net accumulation of about 32 g C m(-2). These results are consistent with previous investigations on CO2 exchange in other northern wetland sites during wet and dry periods.

AB Acid organic soils drained for agriculture are hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Previous studies have indicated that water table (WT) depth and nitrogen (N) availability are important environmental controls, however, little is known about pathways leading to N2O emission. We investigated a raised bog drained for agriculture (pH 4.6 to 5.5) with, respectively, rotational grass and a potato crop in the experimental year and subplots with and without N fertilisation. The emissions and isotopic composition of N2O were monitored during spring and autumn periods with significant changes in WT depth, and in the availability of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrous oxide emissions were determined at 6-h intervals using eight automated chambers interfaced with a laser instrument for N2O isotopomer analysis. A threshold of 600 ppb N2O (final concentration) was adopted to stabilise estimates of site preference (SP) and delta N-15(bulk) of emitted N2O against the background of N2O in ambient air. Nitrous oxide emissions varied consistently with land use, slope position and time of day and year, but with little effect of N fertilisation. Isotopic signatures of N2O from the grassland site could not be investigated due to generally low emissions. In the potato field, in total 255 and 266 flux measurements exceeded the 600 ppb threshold in unfertilised and fertilised subplots, respectively. Both N2O emissions and isotopic signatures responded to WT dynamics, individual rain events, and soil N availability. Across eight individual periods, the delta N-15(bulk) of N2O emitted from the soil varied between - 55 and + 18 parts per thousand, while site preference (SP) varied between - 4 and + 25 parts per thousand. The first and the last period (shoulder seasons) were both N limited, and here isotopic signatures of N2O were similar and distinctly different from signatures in mid-season periods with mineral N accumulation. Nitrifier denitrification and chemodenitrification were proposed as potential pathways to N2O production in shoulder seasons, whereas in mid-season periods the isotopic signatures could be associated with either ammonia oxidation or fungal denitrication (late spring), or with bacterial denitrification (early autumn). The interpretation of isotopic signatures of N2O was confounded by the possible effect of N2O reduction. The study provides evidence that both sources and pathways of N2O emissions from managed organic soil vary dynamically with WT changes and N availability.

AB The application of plant growth regulators and the use of different culture media are common practices in potted ornamental crops. We report the results of a study to evaluate the effect of two substrates (peat moss or coconut fiber) and spraying 30 ppm paclobutrazol (PAC) on water resource management of zonal geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum LH. Bailey) seedlings growing in a greenhouse during spring-summer. Growth. water consumption, leaching, evapotranspiration rate (ET), water use efficiency (WUE) and leaf water potential were determined. Plant growth was greater in peat moss (peat) than in coconut fiber (coconut), while the use of PAC decreased plant growth in both substrates, although more markedly in peat. Coconut produced a higher leaching fraction than peat in both PAC-treated plants and non-treated plants, although PAC application increased the leaching fraction in both substrates. Water consumption was lower in coconut than in peat and decreased in response to PAC. Peat was more effective at improving the water-use efficiency and increased the electrical conductivity in the leachate, while PAC decreased the latter in this same substrate. Daily ET showed a maximum of 200 mL/pot in peat and a minimum of 60 mL/pot in the coconut-PAC treatment. During the experimental period, accumulated ET values were higher in peat than in coconut, while the application of PAC reduced the value in peat but increased it in coconut. The evolution of ET per hour during the day showed that the highest rate (23 mL/h) was registered at midday in peat, while about 90% of ET occurred between 10 and 18 h in all treatments. When a cycle of water stress and recovery was applied, the peat induced the highest ET values of all treatments during the first days of drought, but the lowest ET after a week of drought. PAC modified this response, favoring a more balanced behavior of ET, although after the second cycle of drought this effect disappeared. Based on these results, the best strategy in normal irrigation conditions would be to use coconut fiber and not apply PAC, because this provides plants of excellent commercial quality with low water consumption. In plants at moderate water deficit PAC played a more important role than the substrate, improving the water status of plants with both substrates used. However, in the face of severe water stress the effect of PAC disappeared and peat acted as a better substrate than coconut fiber. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Wetlands are threatened by desiccation, eutrophication and changing water quality, generally leading to greatly altered biogeochemical processes. Sulphate pollution can lead to severe eutrophication and sulphide toxicity, but may also interact with the availability of iron and other metals.
   2. In the present study, we examined the biogeochemical interactions between sulphate and iron availability, and their effects on aquatic macrophytes, in a field experiment with enclosures. The natural iron supply by groundwater was mimicked by adding iron to the sediment, and the effect of increased sulphate concentrations in the surface water was also studied. The enclosure experiment was performed in a mesotrophic, anaerobic ditch in a peat meadow reserve in the Netherlands. In all enclosures, three Stratiotes aloides plants were introduced to serve as indicator species.
   3. Addition of sulphate led to the mobilisation of phosphate, whereas addition of iron or both iron and sulphate did not affect P mobilisation. Growth of S. aloides was decreased by both iron addition and sulphate addition (sulphide toxicity). Addition of iron under sulphidic conditions, however, led to mutual detoxification of both toxicants (iron and sulphide) and did not decrease S. aloides growth. The uptake of metals was highest in the treatment involving sulphate addition, probably as a result of increased mineralisation of the peat soil.
   4. Growth of Elodea nuttallii, which grew naturally in the enclosures, was stimulated by iron or iron plus sulphate addition. It did not, however, grow in the enclosures with sulphate addition, as a result of sulphide toxicity or sulphide-induced iron deficiency. Under iron-rich conditions, E. nuttallii appeared to be a better competitor than S. aloides and depressed the growth of the latter species.
   5. We propose that the growth of S. aloides is directly regulated by interactions between sulphide and iron and indirectly by the effects of both compounds on the competitive strength of E. nuttallii. In general, we conclude that biogeochemical interactions between sulphate and iron can have a strong influence on plant species composition in freshwater wetlands, because of direct effects or changes in the competitive strength of plant species related to differential sensitivity to either iron or sulphide.

AB Weed management for nursery ornamental plants requires several applications of preemergence herbicides to control recurring weed emergence and to counter chemical dissipation and leaching losses. Herbicide losses from plant containers in runoff water may pose risks to surface and groundwater supplies. Sphagnum pear is a frequently used rooting medium. Limited information exists on the fate of herbicides applied to pear. The leaching of two commonly used chemicals in Europe by the containerized ornamental plant industry, isoxaben and BAS 479 14H, was measured. Herbicides were applied to 1-yr-old conifers (Juniperus communis, cv. Repanda [common juniper]) grown in pots containing sphagnum pear. The isoxaben-treated pots were placed on 1- by 1-m lysimeters that were buried in the center of replicated field plots. Pots were also placed in subirrigated sandbeds to determine herbicide dissipation and movement in irrigation water. With overhead irrigation, isoxaben had a half-life of 2 mo in the 0- to 5-cm depth of the pear container. More than 96% of applied isoxaben was recovered in the 0- to 5-cm depth. Less than 4% of the amount applied was found in the 5- to 10-cm depth, and none was detected in the 10- to 15-cm depth. No isoxaben residues were detected in water percolating through the field lysimeters. In subirrigated sandbeds, no isoxaben was detected in the water rising by capillary tension. Most of the applied isoxaben was found in the 0- to 5-cm layer of the pear container, where its half-life was also 2 mo. Similar results were observed in containers treated with BAS 479 14H, which had a half-life of 1.2 mo. The high organic matter content of the pear medium strongly sorbed both isoxaben and BAS 479 14H, and these herbicides remained primarily in the near-surface zone of the pear containers. No significant herbicide leaching or loss from the containers was found when subirrigated or irrigated by sprinkler.

AB Seawater circulation in permeable coastal sediments is driven by tidal changes in hydraulic gradients. The resulting submarine groundwater discharge is a source of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the water column. Yet, little is known about the cycling of DOM within tidal sediments, because the molecular DOM characterization remains analytically challenging. One technique that can dissect the multitude of molecules in DOM is ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). To aim at a high resolution DOM analysis we study the seasonal turnover and marine and terrestrial sources of DOM in an intertidal creek bank of the southern North Sea down to 3 m depth and link the biogeochemical processes to FT-ICR-MS data and the analyses of inorganic porewater chemistry, delta C-13 of solid-phase extracted dissolved organic carbon (SPE-DOC), dissolved black carbon (DBC) and dissolved carbohydrates (DCHO). Increasing concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, P, total alkalinity, dissolved nitrogen, DOC and a concomitant decrease of sulfate along the seawater circulation path from the upper tidal flat to the tidal flat margin indicate continuous microbial activity. The relative increase of Si concentrations, unsaturated aliphatics, peptide molecular formulae and isotopically more C-13-enriched SPE-DOC towards the tidal flat margin suggests that remineralization processes mobilize DOM from buried algal (diatoms) and microbial biomass. Porewater in sediments <100 cm depth contains C-13-depleted SPE-DOC and highly unsaturated compounds which are probably derived from eroded peats, suggesting rapid removal of bioavailable marine DOM such as DCHO from the water column and selective enrichment of terrestrial DOM. DBC concentrations are highest in the discharging porewater close to the tidal creek suggesting that the intertidal flat is an important DBC source to the coastal ocean. Porewater DOM accumulating at the low water line is enriched in N and S. We hypothesize that this is partly due to DOM reacting with dissolved sulfide and ammonium which may increase the refractory character of the DOM, hence making it less bioavailable for in situ active microbes.

AB Herbivory is an important part of most ecosystems and affects the ecosystems' carbon balance both directly and indirectly. Little is known about herbivory and its impact on the carbon balance in high arctic mire ecosystems. We hypothesized that trampling and grazing by large herbivores influences the vegetation density and composition and thereby also the carbon balance. In 2010, we established fenced exclosures in high arctic Greenland to prevent muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) from grazing. During the growing seasons of 2011 to 2013 we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes in these ungrazed blocks and compared them to blocks subjected to natural grazing. Additionally, we measured depth of the water table and active layer, soil temperature, and in 2011 and 2013 an inventory of the vegetation density and composition were made. In 2013 a significant decrease in total number of vascular plant (33-44%) and Eriophorum scheuchzeri (51-53%) tillers were found in ungrazed plots, the moss-layer and amount of litter had also increased substantially in these plots. This resulted in a significant decrease in net ecosystem uptake of CO2 (47%) and likewise a decrease in CH4 emission (44%) in ungrazed plots in 2013. While the future of the muskoxen in a changing arctic is unknown, this experiment points to a potentially large effect of large herbivores on the carbon balance in natural Arctic ecosystems. It thus sheds light on the importance of grazing mammals, and hence adds to our understanding of natural ecosystem greenhouse gas balance in the past and in the future.

TI Uncertainties in the fate of nitrogen II: A quantitative assessment of

AB Enhanced levels of nitrogen in the environment may have several adverse effects, including decreased plant species diversity in ( semi) natural terrestrial ecosystems, eutrophication of surface waters, pollution of ground-water due to nitrate leaching and global warming due to nitrous and nitrogen oxide (N2O and NOx) emissions. To determine the effectiveness of policies aimed at the reduction of emission of ammonia (NH3), N2O and NOx, nitrate (NO3) leaching and nitrogen (N) runoff, it is essential to have information on the fate of nitrogen in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils on a regional and national scale and its inherent uncertainties. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainties in the emission, uptake, accumulation, denitrification, leaching and runoff of nitrogen at a national scale and for specific land use-soil type combinations. Furthermore, we identified which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty in the emission of ammonia to the atmosphere and the leaching/runoff to groundwater and surface water. To gain quantitative insight into the propagation of the uncertainty, a model was developed representing all crucial processes in the N chain by simple process descriptions. Uncertainties were quantified for the Netherlands as a whole, including terrestrial systems, both agricultural and non-agricultural land, and aquatic systems. For agricultural and non-agricultural land, plots were distinguished, consisting of a multiple of 500 3 500 m and of 250 3 250 m grid cells, respectively, with unique combinations of soil use, soil type and groundwater table class that were derived from existing digital maps. Model parameters were assigned by using relationships with soil type, groundwater level class and land use. The uncertainty was quantified by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, whereas statistical approaches were used to identify which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the fate of nitrogen. The 90% confidence interval for the fluxes of N compounds to air, groundwater and surface water (in Gg N.yr(-1)) ranged between 102 and 194 for ammonia emission, between 18 and 51 for N2O emissions, between 32 and 108 for NO3 inflow to groundwater and between 2 and 38 for N inflow to surface water. The uncertainty in NH3 emission was mainly caused by the uncertainty in the NH3 emission fractions for animal manure, whereas the uncertainty in N2O emission was mainly due to the uncertainty in the fractions relating total nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions. The uncertainty in inflow to groundwater and runoff to surface water was mainly caused by the uncertainty in denitrification in the soil and in upper groundwater and in non-agricultural soils also by the N accumulation in the soil. In view of the need to monitor and evaluate the impact of N reduction policies and measures, it is essential to put more effort in activities yielding a reduction of these large uncertainties, such as additional data gathering and process research under field circumstances.

AB On-going permafrost thaw in discontinuous permafrost regions produces significant amounts of small permafrost subsidence and depressions, while large lakes are likely to drain into streams and rivers. The intensification of permafrost thaw may alter the size distribution and chemical composition of organo-Fe-Al colloids in lakes and rivers. We used a continuum of surface water bodies, from permafrost subsidence, small depressions and thaw ponds to large lakes and rivers that drain the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), to assess OC, major and the trace element size distribution between the 20-mu m, 5-mu m, 1.2-mu m, 0.45-mu m, 0.22-mu m, 0.025-mu m and 1-kDa (similar to 1.4 nm) size fractions. This approach allowed us to distinguish the organic and organo-ferric colloids that were responsible for the transport of trace elements in surface waters and address their evolution during possible physico-chemical and biological processes. Both conventionally dissolved (<0.22 mu m) and low-molecular-weight (<1 kDa) fractions exhibited an order of magnitude decrease in DOC/Fe in the landscape continuum "depressions and permafrost subsidence -> thaw ponds -> thermokarst lakes -> streams -> rivers". Thermodynamic modeling and on-site size separation suggested that a number of trace elements (TEs), including alkaline earth elements and several micronutrients (Zn, Ba, Mn, and Ni), decreased the degree of their binding to DOM along the landscape continuum, whereas the majority of insoluble TEs (Al, Fe, Co, Cd, Cu, Pb, REEs, Th, and U) remained complexed with DOM in the LMW<1 kDa fraction. Two primary sites of colloid generation included (i) ground vegetation and peat leaching, which supplied DOM complexes of divalent metals and organo-Al entities to thaw ponds and lakes; and (ii) Fe2+ oxidation and TE co-precipitation with Fe hydroxides in the presence of surface DOM at groundwater discharge sites within the riparian/hyporheic zones of rivers. Under a warming climate scenario, an increase in the thickness of the thawing depth will intensify the input of inorganic components from deep mineral horizons and possibly underground waters thus producing the enrichment of large lakes in Fe-rich colloids and particles. The speciation of divalent metal micronutrients (Cu, Ni, and Co) and toxic metals (Al, Cd, Pb, and U) that are complexed within DOM will most likely remain conservative. Overall, the WSL's surface water colloidal composition may shift from DOM-rich and DOM-Al-rich to Fe-rich, and the export of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates from the soil to rivers will increase.

ID MILLED PEAT; WASTE
AB The use of peat as a filter medium for the treatment of a variety of liquid and gas waste streams has increased over the past decade. Peat has been used as an alternate treatment medium to treat septic tank effluent (STE) from domestic and small communal systems. Very little research has been completed to study the hydraulics and water budget of a peat filter operating in the field. This study evaluated the water budget of a peat filter operating at an elementary school near Ottawa, Canada. The peat filter was instrumented with tensiometers to measure the pore water pressures within the filter and a weather station to collect weather data required to estimate potential evapotranspiration. A one-dimensional unsaturated flow model, SoilCover, was calibrated using the pressure data and weather data collected in the field. The calibrated model was use to estimate the water budget for the filter operating: with and without STE loading. The calibrated model predicted. that the annual precipitation exceeded evapotranspiration for both scenarios. For the filter treating 50 mm/day of STE, there was a slight dilution due to the infiltration resulting in a net dilution factor of 0.97 (loading divided by the loading plus infiltration). The largest rainfall event of 49.9 mm resulted in a dilution factor of approximately 0.87, which corresponded to an approximate decrease in the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of between 12 and 33% depending on the calculation used to determine the HRT. When the filter does not receive STE, the precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration and hence the filter should not dry out when the filter is not in use. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Continuous cover management on peatland forests has gained interest in recent years, in part because the tree biomass with significant evapotranspiration capacity retained in selection cuttings could be used as a tool to optimize the site water table level (WTL) from both tree growth and environmental perspectives. This study reports WTL responses from six field trials established on fertile Norway spruce-dominated drained peatland forests across Finland. At each site, replicates of different intensity selection cuttings (removing 17-74% of the stand basal area) or clear-cut in parallel with intact control stands were established and monitored for the WTL for 2-5 postharvest years. The observed WTL rose after selection cuttings, and the response increased with harvest intensity and depended on the reference WTL; that is, larger responses were found during dry summers or in more southern location. Selection cuttings removing about 50% of the stand basal area raised the WTL typically by 15-40%. Using a process-based ecohydrological model, tested against data from the field trials, we show that the role of tree stand in controlling the WTL clearly decreases along the latitudinal climate gradient in Finland. This suggests that the potential of controlling WTL using selection cuttings is more prominent in southern than in northern Finland. Predictions with future climate (2070-2099) further indicated a general decrease of the WTL and that the importance of the tree stand in controlling the WTL will increase, especially in northern Finland. The results overall thus suggest that selection cuttings can be used as a tool to control the WTL in boreal drained peatland forests, and the potential is likely to increase in future climate.

AB Agriculture in the Czech Republic after 1989 has been passed through many changes, at the same time also with searching for the optimum situation of an area of extensive and intensive use of the soil fund. Changes in utilization of lands may have a different impact as on all components of hydrological balance (infiltration and seepage of water through soil profile, retention of water in soil, transpiration and evapotranspiration, surface runoff, complement of reserves of underground waters), as on the quality of water of the given localities and regions. In 36 weighable lysimeters at Borkovice actual evapotranspiration (ET) of the grassland in conditions of different water supply of the stand (1991 to 1992), black and green fallow, mulching and regular utilization of the grassland (1993 to 1997) in three soil textures (sandy, loam and peat) was studied. Mixed sward (madow fescue, timothy, Kentucky bluegrass) was sown in lysimeters in 1989. Interval of observation was weekly in the first two years, then a fortnight one. Statistical evaluation of the ET results was performed by multi-factor analysis of variance by the Scheffe test. The experimental plot is situated at the altitude of 416 m above sea level, climatic region is in the district B3 - slightly warm. The normal of precipitation is 588 mm, the normal of temperature is 7.3 degrees C, in the growing season 378 mm and 13.47 degrees C (precipitation measured at Sobeslav, temperatures at Tabor). According to the Departmentalism of Agricultural Production of the CSSR (1963) the village Borkovice belongs to the agricultural production region IIIc/3 (potato-wheat type). The system of variants Borkovice: The year 1991 to 1992. variant I - without water supply (control), variant 2 - 60% of available water capacity (AWC), variant 3 - 80% AWC (all variants - three-cut utilization). The year 1993 to 1994: variants I - without water supply (control) and variants II - 100% AWC with subvariants: 1 - fallow, 2 - self-grassing, 3 - uncut, without fertilization, 4 - one cut, 25 kg N.ha(-1) + PK, 5 - two cuts, 50 kg N.ha(-1) + PK, 6 - three cuts, 75 kg N.ha(-1) + PK. The year 1995 to 1997: variant 1 - fallow, variant 2 - self-grassing, 3 - uncut, unfertilized, variant 4 - one cut, mulching by cut mass, variant 5 - one cut, mass harvested, unfertilized, variant 6 - two cuts, 50 kg N.ha(-1), in all variants irrigation to 80% AWC.
   In investigation of evapotranspiration (ET) of the grassland in weighable lysimeters in the locality Borkovice, statistically significant difference between average ET values of different soils in four (1991, 1994 to 1997) of six studied years (Tabs II and III, Figs 1 to 4) was recorded. The peat soil was significantly different (highest ET values) from sand and loamy soils. With increasing water content in the soil, the ET values were increasing too also in dependence on the retention capacity of soil profile. The effect of different utilization of the grassland (one-, two-cut, self-grassing, fallow, mulching) in conditions of the site, including dominant effect of the year on the ET level, despite a great variability of values, was manifested by their differentiation, the most among fallow variants and other variants. The highest ET values were achieved in the years 1995 to 1997 in the two-cut variant or one-cut variant in 1996 (578.6 mm and 550.4 mm or 501.7 mm) in the peat soil. On an average of the years and soils self-grassing showed after two-cut utilization the highest value of evapotranspiration. Mulching in the years 1995 to 1997 was manifested in the loam soil by the lowest ET values in variants with the stand (352.7 mm and 336.7 mm or 376.3 mm). The results indicate the application of the given interventions in loam soils with more uniform water regime of the site. In view of water management the variant with self-grassing seems to be very negative when succession of weed species and their different water running and root system may induce unfavourable phenomena in hydrological balance.

AB Rain-fed peatlands are dominated by peat mosses (Sphagnum sp.), which for their growth depend on nutrients, water and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. As the isotopic composition of carbon (C-12(,)13) and oxygen (O-16(,)18) of these Sphagnum mosses are affected by environmental conditions, Sphagnum tissue accumulated in peat constitutes a potential long-term archive that can be used for climate reconstruction. However, there is inadequate understanding of how isotope values are influenced by environmental conditions, which restricts their current use as environmental and palaeoenvironmental indicators. Here we tested (i) to what extent C and O isotopic variation in living tissue of Sphagnum is speciesspecific and associated with local hydrological gradients, climatic gradients (evapotranspiration, temperature, precipitation) and elevation; (ii) whether the C isotopic signature can be a proxy for net primary productivity (NPP) of Sphagnum; and (iii) to what extent Sphagnum tissue delta O-18 tracks the delta O-18 isotope signature of precipitation. In total, we analysed 337 samples from 93 sites across North America and Eurasia us ing two important peat-forming Sphagnum species (S. magellanicum, S. fuscum) common to the Holarctic realm. There were differences in delta C-13 values between species. For S. magellanicum delta C-13 decreased with increasing height above the water table (HWT, R-2 = 17 %) and was positively correlated to productivity (R-2 = 7 %). Together these two variables explained 46 % of the between-site variation in delta C-13 values. For S. fuscum, productivity was the only significant predictor of delta C-13 but had low explanatory power (total R-2 = 6 %). For delta O-18 values, approximately 90 % of the variation was found between sites. Globally modelled annual delta O-18 values in precipitation explained 69 % of the between-site variation in tissue delta O-18. S. magellanicum showed lower delta O-18 enrichment than S. fuscum (-0.83 %0 lower). Elevation and climatic variables were weak predictors of tissue delta O-18 values after controlling for delta O-18 values of the precipitation. To summarize, our study provides evidence for (a) good predictability of tissue delta O-18 values from modelled annual delta O-18 values in precipitation, and (b) the possibility of relating tissue delta C-13 values to HWT and NPP, but this appears to be species-dependent. These results suggest that isotope composition can be used on a large scale for climatic reconstructions but that such models should be species-specific.

AB The Canadian boreal forest consists of a mosaic of landscapes of varying soil drainage and forest age driven by wildfire. The hydrological consequences are complicated by plant responses to soil moisture and forest age, both potentially influencing evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration was measured using the energy balance residual technique in 2006 and 2007 at forested upland and fen sites that originated following fire in 1964, 1930 and about 1850, near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. Both net radiation and sensible heat flux density were greater at the older sites than those at the younger sites. Evapotranspiration was also greater at the older sites by between 4 and 19% for the 1930-1964 comparison, and 15% for the 1930-1850 comparison. There was no difference in net radiation between upland and fen sites of the same age, although upland sites had a higher sensible heat flux density. Albedo was greater at the fen sites. Evapotranspiration was greater at the upland sites by 11-20%, likely driven by greater leaf area at the upland sites. These intermediate to mature boreal forest sites still show the persistence of the impact of fire. and it is clear that changes in drainage and local hydrology will also have an impact on local evapotranspiration. The implication is that even these small changes in evapotranspiration can have a great regional and global effect because of the large land area of the boreal forest.

AB This study provides an in-depth analysis of the runoff generation dynamics and hydrological connectivity across upland-wetland transitions within a wetland-dominated headwater basin in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), Canada. Basin runoff response between and among years was driven largely by differences in the timing and magnitude of precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration, hence antecedent moisture conditions, which varied markedly over the four-year study (April-Sept). Runoff coefficients for individual precipitation events ranged from <1 to >90% depending on storm dynamics and antecedent conditions. Owing to its higher elevation, the basin received 55% more precipitation per month on average compared to 30-year climate normals and an average of 86 mm more precipitation per season than the nearby regional weather station. The wetland and adjacent forestlands became coupled during intermittent wet periods which generated substantial runoff. The findings of the current study suggest that, in contrast to conventional conceptual models, headwater catchments within the subhumid WBP have the capacity to generate significant runoff throughout the snow-free period. This has important implications for wetland maintenance and represents an important water delivery mechanism for downstream ecosystems where excess water is scarce. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Quantitative insight into the reaction capacity of porous media is necessary to assess the buffering capacity of the subsurface against contaminant input via groundwater recharge. Here, reaction capacity is to be considered as a series of geochemical characteristics that control acid/base conditions, redox conditions and sorption intensity. Using existing geochemical analyses, a statistical regional assessment of the reaction capacity was performed for two geologically different areas in the Netherlands. The first area is dominated by Pleistocene aquifer sediments only, in the second area a heterogeneous Holocene confining layer is found on top of the Pleistocene aquifer sediments. Within both areas, two or more regions can be distinguished that have a distinctly different geological build-up of the shallow subsurface. The reactive compounds considered were pyrite, reactive Fe other than pyrite, sedimentary organic matter, carbonate and clay content. This characterization was complemented by the analysis of a dataset of samples newly collected, from two regions within the Pleistocene area, where the sedimentary fades of samples was additionally distinguished. The statistical assessment per area was executed at the levels of region, geological formation and lithology class. For both areas, significant differences in reaction capacities were observed between: 1. different lithology classes within a geological formation in a single region, 2. identical geological formations in different regions and 3. various geological formations within a single region. Here, the reaction capacity is not only controlled by lithostratigraphy, but also by post-depositional diagenesis and paleohydrology. Correlation coefficients among the reactive compounds were generally higher for sand than for clay, but insufficiently high to allow good estimation of reactive compounds from each other. For the sandy Pleistocene aquifer sediments, the content of reactive compounds was frequently observed to be below detection limits. From this, future characterization of sediment reaction capacity is best performed at the sublevel of lithology class, being the geochemically near-uniform unit identifiable for individual geological formations within geographic regions. Additional subdivision on facies provides particular insight in the spatial entity where relatively high reaction capacities may be encountered. To obtain quantitative insight into the reaction capacity of aquifer sediments, non-sandy minor subunits should be well characterised on their reaction capacity as well as their spatial occurrence in the geological formations. A straightforward approach is presented in which the regional statistics on geochemical reactivity become combined with a 3-dimensional geological voxel model. This results into 3-dimensional data fields on reactivity, which are suitable for, for example, groundwater transport modelling. The sedimentological architecture of the deposits becomes well maintained in the geochemical data field, which is an advantage in itself. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantification of activity data and emission factors for carbon (C) in inland wetland mineral soils (IWMS) lack suitable low cost indicators for key soil C processes in temperate forests. In a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest near Soro, Denmark, SOC stocks and the risk of losing pre-drainage legacy SOC were studied using a digital elevation model (0.4 m resolution), redox potential and soil respiration measurements. The results were compared with a digitized legacy soil map used in the national GHG reporting to UNFCCC. In upland, flat and sloping terrain, an aerobic soil environment (Eh > 400 mV) prevailed throughout most of the year, but in a peat-filled topographic depression (TD) anaerobic conditions (Eh < 400 mV) fully or sporadically occurred in the growing season, controlled by the ditching-affected water table. The relief included SOC rich TDs making up 18.9% of the area based on the "Filled sink" algorithm (Saga GIS). In contrast, the peat cover on the legacy soil map was 8.2%. Furthermore, the mapped peat polygons were offset from the TDs defined by the DEM. The SOC stocks at 0-40 cm depth outside TDs (least squares mean 8.4 +/- sem 0.3 kg C m(-2)) were significantly lower than within TDs (11.9 +/- sem 0.5 kg C m(-2)). Average annual soil respiration increased linearly with the SOC stock by 0.06 kg C per kg SOC up to a SOC stock of 11 kg C m(-2) to 20 cm depth, and a SOC loss of 0.23 +/- se 0.10 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) was indicated inside the TD areas, close to the IPCC estimate of 0.26 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for drained organic soils under forest. Our results show that continuous sensor-based monitoring of redox potential and shallow water tables linked with high-resolution DEMs offer the possibility to estimate the spatial extent of inland wetland mineral soils and their status as aerobic or anaerobic as indicated by iron rods with higher accuracy than previously. This underpins the potential use of such data for activity data mapping in Tier 3 greenhouse gas reporting.

AB The impact of diffuse pollution, agricultural land use and climate change on the long-term response of subsurface-surface water quality is not well understood, but is a prerequisite for evaluation of water management options. The goal of this study is to model geochemical evolution of water chemistry from the infiltration through soil into the unsaturated zone, transport through bedrocks and granular aquifers to a river in order to identify zones of steep concentration gradients and high dynamics under transient flow conditions. A numerical model was constructed comprising a 2-D 1,500 m x 150 m vertical cross-section of typical sedimentary rock formations, a glacio-fluvial quaternary gravel aquifer in the valley and soil layers. The model coupled saturated/un-saturated flow and reactive transport under steady state and transient conditions. Geochemical interactions, include intra-aqueous kinetic reactions of oxygen with dissolved organic matter, as well as kinetics of carbonate dissolution/precipitation. This model section was chosen to provide insight in to the principal processes and time scales affecting water chemistry along different flow paths. The numerical simulator MIN3P was used, a finite volume program for variably saturated subsurface flow and multi-component reactive transport. The results show that subsurface water residence times range from approximately 2 to 2,000 years. Different zones are to be expected with respect to the development of mineral equilibria; namely, purely atmospherically influenced, as well as open and closed system carbonate dissolution. Short-term responses to daily averaged changes in precipitation, however, are only visible to some extent in the shallower and near-river parts of flow system and solute loads. This can most likely be explained by directional changes in flow paths, indicating that equilibrium geochemical condition predominate at the hillslope scale, i.e. water quality depends on transport pathways rather than on kinetic effects. The extent of reducing conditions is controlled by the presence of organic-rich layers (i.e. peat deposits), the dissolution kinetics of aquifer organic matter and the subsequent mixing with oxygenated water by hydrodynamic dispersion.

AB Tree islands have been hypothesized to induce calcite precipitation by concentrating ions in the groundwater through evapotranspiration processes. This research investigates how lithology regulates the hydrologic and geochemical conditions within two types of constructed Everglades tree islands: peat-based and limestone-core surrounded by peat. Three years of hydrochemical and hydrologic data (2013-2015) obtained from the constructed tree islands suggest that under current climatic and managed hydrologic conditions, calcite dissolution is prevalent within the top meter of soil in both types of tree islands. Mass-balance calculations along groundwater flow paths in one peat-based tree island that contained clay at depth, indicated that calcite precipitation is likely 1 m below the soil surface. The lithological characteristics of that peat-based island supported a persistently depressed groundwater table, while tree islands with elevated ratios of peat-to-sand content did not. Limestone-core tree islands also supported a depressed water table, particularly during the dry season. This study determined that the lithology of a set of man-made Everglades tree islands played a primary role in regulating the seasonal fluctuation of the water table and hydrogeochemical processes. Understanding the mechanisms of tree-island formation and maintenance is important for preserving the overall ecosystem function of the freshwater-Everglades.

AB The carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of five different peatland systems across Europe with a wide gradient in land use intensity, water table depth, soil fertility and climate was simulated with the process oriented CoupModel. The aim of the study was to find out whether CO2 fluxes, measured at different sites, can be explained by common processes and parameters or to what extend a site specific configuration is needed. The model was calibrated to fit measured CO2 fluxes, soil temperature, snow depth and leaf area index (LAI) and resulting differences in model parameters were analyzed. Finding site independent model parameters would mean that differences in the measured fluxes could be explained solely by model input data: water table, meteorological data, management and soil inventory data.
   Seasonal variability in the major fluxes was well captured, when a site independent configuration was utilized for most of the parameters. Parameters that differed between sites included the rate of soil organic decomposition, photosynthetic efficiency, and regulation of the mobile carbon (C) pool from senescence to shooting in the next year.
   The largest difference between sites was the rate coefficient for heterotrophic respiration. Setting it to a common value would lead to underestimation of mean total respiration by a factor of 2.8 up to an overestimation by a factor of 4. Despite testing a wide range of different responses to soil water and temperature, rate coefficients for heterotrophic respiration were consistently the lowest on formerly drained sites and the highest on the managed sites. Substrate decomposability, pH and vegetation characteristics are possible explanations for the differences in decomposition rates.
   Specific parameter values for the timing of plant shooting and senescence, the photosynthesis response to temperature, litter fall and plant respiration rates, leaf morphology and allocation fractions of new assimilates, were not needed, even though the gradient in site latitude ranged from 48 degrees N (southern Germany) to 68 degrees N (northern Finland) differed largely in their vegetation. This was also true for common parameters defining the moisture and temperature response for decomposition, leading to the conclusion that a site specific interpretation of these processes is not necessary. In contrast, the rate of soil organic decomposition, photosynthetic efficiency, and the regulation of the mobile carbon pool need to be estimated from available information on specific soil conditions, vegetation and management of the ecosystems, to be able to describe CO2 fluxes under different conditions.

AB Hummock-hollow microtopography is a unique feature of wetland ecosystems, but our understanding of its effects on soil carbon and nutrient cycling is limited. We investigated effects of microtopography on hydrology, phenol oxidase activity (POX) and nutrient availability in a freshwater forested wetland of coastal North Carolina. Water table depth (WTD) was measured from September 2012 to August 2013. Ion exchange probes were used to measure nutrient concentrations prior to soil sample collection in August 2013. WTD fluctuated seasonally with maximum and minimum WTD resulting in 92% (September 2012) to 8% (June 2013) of the site in flooded and non-flooded conditions, respectively. Hummocks had greater POX activity (12 +/- 2.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) compared to hollows (4 +/- 0.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and greater concentrations of potassium and sulfur, but lower concentrations of calcium, iron, zinc, boron, and lead. POX was negatively correlated with soil water content. Higher enzyme activity in hummocks likely drives greater rates of carbon and nutrient cycling compared to hollows, consistent with observations that hummocks are hotspots for CO2 fluxes. Microtopography altered site-level hydrologic conditions, phenol oxidase activity and nutrient availability with important implications for understanding carbon and nutrient cycling in forested wetlands and response to changes in hydrology.

AB Testate amoebae are common inhabitants of moist soils, wetland, and lacustrine habitats. They produce a decay-resistant test, or shell, which can be identified to species in most cases and recovered from sediments in quantities sufficiently large to permit estimation of relative abundance. The objectives of this study were to assess the potential of testate amoeba assemblages as paleoenvironmental and environmental indicators in two Lake Superior coastal wetlands and to determine if morphological variation in four common taxa (Arcella spp., Assulina spp., Centropyxis cassis type, and Nebela tincta-parvula-collaris group) is related to microenvironment. Study localities included ridge-swale wetland systems adjacent to Grand Traverse Bay and Tahquamenon Bay in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Testate amoeba assemblages from 74 microsites were compared with percent moisture, depth to water table, pll, porosity, depth of living moss, and associated moss and vascular plant species. Morphometric analysis (e.g., test length and aperture diameter) was conducted on 25 individuals from at least 10 microsites for each of the four selected taxa. Gradient analysis indicated that testate amoeba assemblages are primarily controlled by substrate moisture and pH, consistent with results from other regions. Transfer functions for pH and substrate moisture were developed using 'jack-knifed' validation procedures. Little relationship was found between microenvironmental parameters and morphological variation in the investigated taxa, except for the Nebela tincta-parvula-collaris group, where test size was significantly correlated with pH (r(2) = 0.68). Results indicate that wetland testate amoeba assemblages in these coastal wetland systems are sensitive environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators that can be used to monitor and reconstruct water-level or pll changes.

AB Forest swamps are widely distributed in cold temperate regions, with important landscape and ecological functions. They are prone to conversion caused by complex factors. Forest swamp conversions involve forest swamping, meadow swamping, water body swamping, and conversion to farmland. An understanding of the landscape characteristics and primary environmental factors driving forest swamp conversions is imperative for exploring the mechanism of forest swamp conversions. We investigated the landscape characteristics of forest swamp conversions and quantified the relative importance of environmental factors driving these conversions for the period from 1990 to 2015 in the Great Xing'an Mountains of China. We found that forest swamping displayed high patch numbers (34,916) and density (8.51/100 ha), commonly occurring at the edge of large areas of forests. Meadow swamping was localized with low patch numbers (3613) and density (0.88/100 ha) due to lack of water recharge from ground water. Water body swamping had complex shapes (perimeter area ratio mean = 348.32) because of water table fluctuations and helophyte growth during this conversion process. Conversions to farmland presented fairly regular (perimeter area ratio mean = 289.91) and aggregated (aggregation index = 67.82) characteristics affected by agricultural irrigation and management. We found that climatic and geomorphic factors were relatively important compared to topographic factors for forest swamp conversions. Negative geomorphic conditions provided the waterlogging environment as a precondition of swamp formation. Sufficient precipitation was an important source of water recharge due to the existence of permafrost regions and long-term low temperature reduced the evaporation of swamps water and the decomposition rate of organisms. These wet and cold climatic conditions promoted forest swamp development in cold temperate regions. Humans exerted a relatively important role in forest swamping and conversions to farmland. Fire disturbance and logging accelerated the conversion from forest to swamp. This study provides scientific information necessary for the management and conservation of forest swamp resources in cold temperate regions.

AB The wet heathland communities of the Ericetum tetralicis and the Cirsio-Molinietum have declined in the Netherlands due to acidification, eutrophication and lowering of the water table. To investigate the prospects of restoration of both communities, the effects of sod cutting and hydrological measures on vegetation and soil chemistry were studied in two nature reserves where these plant communities occurred decades ago. The combination of sod cutting and hydrological measures has restored several rare,groundwater dependent heathland communities. Sod cutting has restored the Ericetum tetralicis, but not the Cirsio-Molinietum. This might be due to the absence of viable seeds of characteristic species of the Cirsio-Molinietum and/or the absence of optimal site conditions, especially high phosphorus concentrations in the top soil. The high phosphorus concentrations might be a consequence of high mineralization rates and/or prolonged inundation with iron-poor water and the decreased flux of iron-rich groundwater into the topsoil. Restoration of the Cirsio-Molinietum only seems possible when sod cutting is carried out together with hydrological measures that counter prolonged inundation and reinforce the discharge of base and iron-rich groundwater.

AB The Amsterdam area, a highly manipulated delta area formed by polders and reclaimed lakes, struggles with high nutrient levels in its surface water system. The polders receive spatially and temporally variable amounts of water and nutrients via surface runoff, groundwater seepage, sewer leakage, and via water inlets from upstream polders. Diffuse anthropogenic sources, such as manure and fertiliser use and atmospheric deposition, add to the water quality problems in the polders. The major nutrient sources and pathways have not yet been clarified due to the complex hydrological system in lowland catchments with both urban and agricultural areas. In this study, the spatial variability of the groundwater seepage impact was identified by exploiting the dense groundwater and surface water monitoring networks in Amsterdam and its surrounding polders. A total of 25 variables (concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH4, NO3, HCO3, SO4, Ca, and Cl in surface water and groundwater, N and P agricultural inputs, seepage rate, elevation, land-use, and soil type) for 144 polders were analysed statistically and interpreted in relation to sources, transport mechanisms, and pathways. The results imply that groundwater is a large source of nutrients in the greater Amsterdam mixed urban-agricultural catchments. The groundwater nutrient concentrations exceeded the surface water environmental quality standards (EQSs) in 93% of the polders for TP and in 91% for TN. Groundwater outflow into the polders thus adds to nutrient levels in the surface water. High correlations (R-2 up to 0.88) between solutes in groundwater and surface water, together with the close similarities in their spatial patterns, confirmed the large impact of groundwater on surface water chemistry, especially in the polders that have high seepage rates. Our analysis indicates that the elevated nutrient and bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater seepage originate from the decomposition of organic matter in subsurface sediments coupled to sulfate reduction and possibly methanogenesis. The large loads of nutrient-rich groundwater seepage into the deepest polders indirectly affect surface water quality in the surrounding area, because excess water from the deep polders is pumped out and used to supply water to the surrounding infiltrating polders in dry periods. The study shows the importance of the connection between groundwater and surface water nutrient chemistry in the greater Amsterdam area. We expect that taking account of groundwater-surface water interaction is also important in other subsiding and urbanising deltas around the world, where water is managed intensively in order to enable agricultural productivity and achieve water-sustainable cities.

DT Article
DE boreal forest hydrology; forest management; black spruce-feather moss
   domain; paludification; partial harvest; water table level
AB The boreal forest is considered to be a low productivity forest due to its cold climate and poorly drained soils promoting paludification. These factors create conditions favouring accumulation of undecomposed organic matter, which causes declining growth rates of forest stands, ultimately converting mature stands into peatlands. Under these conditions, careful logging is conducted during winter, which minimizes soil disturbance in northwestern Quebec boreal forest. This results in water table rise, increased light availability and paludification. Our main objective was to evaluate the short-term effect of partial harvesting as an alternative method to careful logging in winter to mitigate water table rise on black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) stands. We quantified tree stem diameter variation and daily variation in water table depth in mature spruce stands before and after partial harvest (basal area reduction of 40%) and girdling (same basal area reduction with delayed mortality) during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons. Water table variation prior to and following silvicultural treatments did not differ one year after treatment. Daily stem diameter variation in black spruce did not differ between treatments and control. Furthermore, temperature exerted a positive effect on variation in water table and on stem diameter. These results suggest that partial harvest could be more effective than clearcutting to mitigate negative effects of a high water table while limiting paludification.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes 1997-2010 were studied by combining remotely sensed normalised difference water index (NDWI) with in situ CH4 fluxes from Rylekaerene, a high-Arctic wet tundra ecosystem in the Zackenberg valley, north-eastern Greenland. In situ CH4 fluxes were measured using the closed-chamber technique. Regression models between in situ CH4 fluxes and environmental variables [soil temperature (T-soil), water table depth (WtD) and active layer (AL) thickness] were established for different temporal and spatial scales. The relationship between in situ WtD and remotely sensed NDWI was also studied. The regression models were combined and evaluated against in situ CH4 fluxes. The models including NDWI as the input data performed on average slightly better [root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.56] than the models without NDWI (RMSE = 1.67), and they were better in reproducing CH4 flux variability. The CH4 flux model that performed the best included exponential relationships against temporal variation in T-soil and AL, an exponential relationship against spatial variation in WtD and a linear relationship between WtD and remotely sensed NDWI (RMSE = 1.50). There were no trends in modelled CH4 flux budgets between 1997 and 2010. Hence, during this period there were no trends in the soil temperature at 10 cm depth and NDWI.

AB A restored riparian zone was characterized to understand the effects of flooding on subsurface hydrological flow paths and nitrate removal in groundwater. Field and laboratory investigations were combined with numerical modeling of dynamic flow and reactive nitrate transport. Flooding enhances nitrate removal in groundwater primarily by two mechanisms. First, by creating a stagnant flow zone beneath the flooded area thereby increasing the residence time and leaving more time for nitrate removal. Secondly, nitrate removal is increased by enhancing upward flow into the highly reactive organic-rich top layers. Flooding therefore contributes to nitrate removal in hot spots, where nitrate is transported to the peat and during hot moments, when flow is stagnant. The permeability of the capping peat layer relative to the aquifer is important as it controls both mechanisms. The model shows that the deep-seated nitrate removal is greater than projected from the laboratory nitrate reduction experiments.
   Plain Language Summary Managed riparian zones are often used as buffer zones to enhance removal of nitrate. Restoration of riparian zones has included re-meandering of the river with the purpose of creating frequent flooding events so that river-associated nitrate could be removed due to denitrification and/or plant uptake on the floodplain. Little focus, however, has been on the effects of flooding on nitrate removal in groundwater. This study demonstrates that flooding also has a beneficial effect on nitrate removal, because of two physical flow mechanisms. When a riparian zone is flooded, groundwater beneath the flooded area will be more stagnant and any nitrate trapped inside this zone will be more quickly removed. Secondly, groundwater will also flow to the surface of the flooded part and bring nitrate into contact with organic-rich peat layers at the surface, also enhancing nitrate removal.

AB [1] This study analyzed controls on evapotranspiration (E) from a western Siberian bog, from a perspective that surface constraints limit the E available for atmospheric evapotranspiration demands. Ratios of E to potential evapotranspiration (E-P) ranged from 0.2 to 0.9, and were clearly related to changes in surface constraints represented by the bulk transfer coefficient for latent heat C-E (= betaC(H) where beta is the surface moisture availability and CH is the bulk transfer coefficient for sensible heat). Both E-P and equilibrium evaporation (E-EQ) showed similar seasonal trends, suggesting the importance of radiation to the seasonal variation of E-P. The atmospheric drying power (E-a) was a minor factor in E-P and showed less seasonal change during most of the growing season. However, the presence of a dry air mass caused by synoptic scale advection (most frequently observed in May 1999) significantly enhanced E-a; consequently, the seasonal maximum of E-P occurred earlier than the seasonal maximum of E-EQ. Values for C-H (0.004-0.011) increased with leaf area index except Sphagnum moss (LAI(g)), indicating that vegetation growth contributes to changes in bog roughness through canopy height changes. The beta value gradually decreased with decreases in the water table position (z(wt)); the open water surface area and water content of Sphagnum moss depended on z(wt). Furthermore, the absence of a significant relationship between beta and phenology implies that changes in evaporation contribute to variations in E more than changes in transpiration. Hence roughness change created by vegetation growth and surface wetness limit evapotranspiration to less than the potential evapotranspiration.

AB To better understand large-scale interactions between fresh and saline groundwater beneath an Atlantic coastal estuary, an offshore drilling and sampling study was performed in a large barrier-bounded lagoon, Chincoteague Bay, Maryland, USA. Groundwater that was significantly fresher than overlying bay water was found in shallow plumes up to 8 m thick extending more than 1700 m offshore. Groundwater saltier than bay surface water was found locally beneath the lagoon and the barrier island, indicating recharge by saline water concentrated by evaporation prior to infiltration. Steep salinity and nutrient gradients occur within a few meters of the sediment surface in most locations studied, with buried peats and estuarine muds acting as confining units. Groundwater ages were generally more than 50 years in both fresh and brackish waters as deep as 23 m below the bay bottom. Water chemistry and isotopic data indicate that freshened plumes beneath the estuary are mixtures of water originally recharged on land and varying amounts of estuarine surface water that circulated through the bay floor, possibly at some distance from the sampling location. Ammonium is the dominant fixed nitrogen species in saline groundwater beneath the estuary at the locations sampled. Isotopic and dissolved-gas data from one location indicate that denitrification within the subsurface flow system removed terrestrial nitrate from fresh groundwater prior to discharge along the western side of the estuary. Similar situations, with one or more shallow semi-confined flow systems where groundwater geochemistry is strongly influenced by circulation of surface estuary water through organicrich sediments, may be common on the Atlantic margin and elsewhere.

AB Annual sulfate mass balances have been constructed for four low-lying peat polders in the Netherlands, to resolve the origin of high sulfate concentrations in surface water, which is considered a water quality problem, as indicated amongst others by the absence of sensitive water plant species. Potential limitation of these plants to areas with low sulfate was analyzed with a spatial match-up of two large databases. The peat polders are generally used for dairy farming or nature conservation, and have considerable areas of shallow surface water (mean 16%, range 6-43%). As a consequence of continuous drainage, the peat in these polders mineralizes causing subsidence rates generally ranging between 2 and 10 mm y(-1). Together with pyrite oxidation, this peat mineralization the most important internal source of sulfate, providing an estimated 96 kg SO4 ha(-1) mm(-1) subsidence External sources are precipitation and water supplied during summer to compensate for water shortage, but these were found to be minor compared to internal release. The most important output flux is discharge of excess surface water during autumn and winter. If only external fluxes in and out of a polder are evaluated, inputs average 37 +/- 9 and exports 169 +/- 17 kg S ha(-1) y(-1). During summer, when evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall, sulfate accumulates in the unsaturated zone, to be flushed away and drained off during the wet autumn and winter. In some polders, upward seepage from early Holocene, brackish sediments can be a source of sulfate. Peat polders export sulfate to the regional water system and the sea during winter drainage. The available sulfate probably only plays a minor role in the oxidation of peat: we estimate that this is less than 10% whereas aerobic mineralization is the most important. Most surface waters in these polders have high sulfate concentrations, which generally decline during the growing season when aquatic sediments are a sink. In the sediment, this sulfur is reduced and binds iron more strongly than phosphorus, which can be released to the overlying water and potentially fuels eutrophication. About 76% of the sampled vegetation-sites exceeded a threshold of 50 mg l(-1), SO4, above which sensitive species, such as Stratiotes aloides, and several species of Potamogeton were significantly less abundant. Thus high sulfate concentrations, mainly due to land drainage and consequent mineralization, appear to affect aquatic plant community composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater and surface-water interactions are regulated by catchment characteristics and complex inter- and intra-annual variations in climatic conditions that are not yet fully understood. Our objective was to investigate the influence of catchment characteristics and freeze-thaw processes on surface and groundwater interactions in a boreal landscape, the Krycklan catchment in Sweden. We used a numerical modelling approach and sub-catchment evaluation method to identify and evaluate fundamental catchment characteristics and processes. The model reproduced observed stream discharge patterns of the 14 sub-catchments and the dynamics of the 15 groundwater wells with an average accumulated discharge error of 1% (15% standard deviation) and an average groundwater-level mean error of 0.1 m (0.23 m standard deviation). We show how peatland characteristics dampen the effect of intense rain, and how soil freeze-thaw processes regulate surface and groundwater partitioning during snowmelt. With these results, we demonstrate the importance of defining, understanding and quantifying the role of landscape heterogeneity and sub-catchment characteristics for accurately representing catchment hydrological functioning.

AB Organic soils drained for crop production or grazing land are agroecosystems with potentially high but variable emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). The present study investigated the regulation of N2O emissions in a raised bog area drained for agriculture, which is classified as potentially acid sulfate soil. We hypothesised that pyrite (FeS2) oxidation was a potential driver of N2O emissions through microbially mediated reduction of nitrate (NO3-). Two sites with rotational grass, and two sites with a potato crop, were equipped for monitoring of N2O emissions and soil N2O concentrations at the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm depth during weekly field campaigns in spring and autumn 2015. Further data acquisition included temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, water table (WT) depth, and soil NO3- and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations. At all sites, the soil was acidic, with pH ranging from 4.7 to 5.4. Spring and autumn monitoring periods together represented between 152 and 174 d, with cumulative emissions of 4-5 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with rotational grass and 20-50 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with a potato crop. Equivalent soil gas-phase concentrations of N2O at grassland sites varied between 0 and 25 mu L L-1 except for a sampling after slurry application at one of the sites in spring, with a maximum of 560 mu L L-1 at the 1 m depth. At the two potato sites the levels of below-ground N2O concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 2270 mu L L-1 and from 0.1 to 470 mu L L-1, in accordance with the higher soil mineral N availability at arable sites. Statistical analyses using graphical models showed that soil N2O concentration in the capillary fringe (i.e. the soil volume above the water table influenced by tension saturation) was the strongest predictor of N2O emissions in spring and, for grassland sites, also in the autumn. For potato sites in autumn, there was evidence that NO3- availability in the topsoil and temperature were the main controls on N2O emissions. Chemical analyses of intact soil cores from the 0 to 1m depth, collected at adjacent grassland and potato sites, showed that the total reduction capacity of the peat soil (assessed by cerium(IV) reduction) was much higher than that represented by FeS2, and the concentrations of total reactive iron (TRFe) were higher than those of FeS2. Based on the statistical graphical models and the tentative estimates of reduction capacities, FeS2 oxidation was unlikely to be important for N2O emissions. Instead, archaeal ammonia oxidation and either chemodenitrification or nitrifier denitrification were considered to be plausible pathways of N2O production in spring, whereas in the autumn heterotrophic denitrification may have been more important at arable sites.

AB Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) was measured with eddy covariance method for two adjacent forests located at the southern boundary of European taiga in Russia in 1999-2004. The two spruce forests shared similar vegetation composition but differed in soil conditions. The wet spruce forest (WSF) possessed a thick peat layer (60 cm) with a high water table seasonally close to or above the soil surface. The dry spruce forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a deep water table (> 60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE fluxes (2000 and 1440 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF, respectively) indicated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during the experimental years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year average NEE fluxes were 1800 and -2200 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with observations. The modeled data also showed high soil heterotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO2; while along with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded period reduced and more organic matter in the soil profile suffered from rapid decomposition that gradually converted the ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO2. The general effect of water table variation on wetland carbon balance observed from this modeling study could be applicable for a wide range of wetland ecosystems that have accumulated soil organic carbon while face hydrological changes under certain climatic or land-use change scenarios.

TI Evapotranspiration 1961-1990 in Finland as function of meteorological

SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Basin-wise values of mean annual total evapotranspiration for the period 1961-1990 were obtained from the water balance equation and examined using following factors: the sum of effective temperature (over the land area), the relative area of open peatlands, the amount of growing forest stock (m(3) ha(-1)), the proportion of dense stands (i.e. the reduction in forests where evapotranspiration increases with the volume of growing stock less than usual, due to the lack of water, reduced vitality of trees and reduced evapotranspiration from the forest-floor vegetation), and lake evaporation, taken from preliminary work. The values of the variables were first obtained in 10 km x 10 km grid-squares, and then averaged over the basin areas. 96% of the total variance of the water balance evapotranspiration was explained. The mean standard error is 14.6 mm, and the maximum 30.7 mm. Evapotranspiration was determined separately for fields, open peatlands, lakes and forests. As compared with that of fields, evapotranspiration from open peatlands was 305 mm higher, and from lakes 170-300 mm. higher, with an inreasing difference southwards. In Lapland evapotranspiration from forests was 35 mm higher than over fields, and in other regions 50 mm. higher. The change in evapotranspiration from 1961-1975 to 1976-1990 was also studied.

AB Stability was tested on 46-year-old Sitka spruce trees (over 20 m tall) growing on gleyed soils. Trees with a range of root depths on peaty gley and surface-water gley soils were selected by studying their water regime. Trees were pulled over horizontally with a winch and the vertical displacement of the soil-root plate was measured as the load was applied. The resistive turning moment at the point of soil failure and the maximum resistive turning moment were measured. Thin plates, which developed over a shallow water table, had a greater surface area than thick plates that developed over deeper water tables. However, they also had a smaller soil mass and tended to shear in soil material of lower shear strength and were particularly flexible. Thicker plates sheared in stronger soil and were more rigid. Soil-root plate rigidity was shown to be a major factor affecting the contribution of soil resistance to overturning. Regression analysis revealed that the more rigid the plate the greater the applied turning moment at soil failure. Trees that develop rigid soil-root plates through adaptive growth of their structural roots will therefore also have improved stability. The results indicate that intensive drainage of peaty gleys will increase rooting depth and the resistance to overturning.

TI Saturated and unsaturated flow dynamics in a floodplain wetland
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-TABLE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; PEAT; RESPONSES; METHANE
AB This paper describes initial work modelling unsaturated processes within floodplain wetlands. The limitations of solely considering the dynamics of the wetland water table and hence saturated processes are examined. Water table, precipitation and evapotranspiration data from Narborough Bog, a degraded floodplain wetland of 10 ha in Leicestershire, were used in the development of a one-dimensional saturated-unsaturated flow model using UNSAT1. Hydraulic parameters were derived from a combination of field and laboratory analysis of wetland deposits previously undertaken to develop a saturated flow model of the wetland. Additional parameters describing unsaturated flow were derived by a mathematical approximation based upon the soil moisture characteristic of representative wetland sediments. The resulting model is used to explore the interaction between water table position, vertical soil moisture fluxes and evapotranspiration. Model simulations are completed over a 25-day period, and used to indicate the relationship of moisture content to key hydraulic properties of soil profiles typical of the wetland and illustrate the way in which this varies laterally along a transect. The results highlight the need to consider the importance of correct description of the wetland substrate and, notwithstanding difficulties in describing unsaturated flow parameters, there is a considerable need to improve the description of near-surface wetland water fluxes and their expansion to two dimensions.

AB There is growing interest in generalizing the impact of hydrogeomorphology and weather variables on riparian functions. Here, we used RZ-TRADEOFF to estimate nitrogen, phosphorus, water table (WT) depth, and greenhouse gas (GHG: N2O, CO2, CH4) functions for 80 riparian zones typical of the North American Midwest, Northeast (including Southern Ontario, Canada), and Mid-Atlantic. Sensitivity to weather perturbations was calculated for temperature and precipitation-dependent functions (CO2, phosphate concentration, and water table), and multivariate statistical analysis on model outputs was conducted to determine trade-offs between riparian functions. Mean model estimates were 93.10 cm for WT depth, 8.45 mg N L-1 for field edge nitrate concentration, 51.57% for nitrate removal, 0.45 mg PO43- L-1 for field edge phosphate concentration, 1.5% for subsurface phosphate removal, 91.24% for total overland phosphorus removal, 0.51 mg N m(-2) day(-1) for N2O flux, 5.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) for CO2 fluxes, and -0.41 mg C m(-2) day(-1) and 621.51 mg C m(-2) day(-1) for CH4 fluxes in non-peat sites and peat sites, respectively. Sites in colder climates were most sensitive to weather perturbations for CO2, sites with deep water tables estimates had the highest sensitivity for WT, and sites in warm climates and/or with deep confining layers had the lowest sensitivity for phosphate concentration. Slope, confining layer depth, and temperature were the primary characteristics influencing similarities and trade-offs between sites. This research contributes to understanding how to optimize riparian restoration and protection in watersheds based on both water (nitrogen, phosphorus) and air quality (GHG) goals.

AB The response of tree-ring widths to groundwater-level decline varies among individual trees in forest stands. By contrast, vessel lumen area series contain common climatic signal of previous summer temperature.
   Drought events and the overuse of groundwater for water supply can cause significant declines of groundwater levels in naturally poorly drained forest stands. However, the documented growth reactions of trees to declines in groundwater level vary a lot and range from positive because of increased soil aeration to strongly negative because of drought stress. We analysed changes in tree-ring width and earlywood average vessel lumen area of Quercus robur from sites above an artesian aquifer, whose groundwater level declined in the late 1980s by about 5 m due to water pumping. Because we expected different responses of individual trees due to local microtopography and fine root distribution, we performed both site-level and tree-level analyses. Our results show that the site-level response of tree growth to groundwater-level pumping was not uniform. Individual trees were clustered into groups of drought-limited and water abundance-limited individuals. The response of trees to groundwater pumping differed between clusters-drought-sensitive trees responded negatively, whereas the growth of trees limited by water abundance remained stable or slightly increased. Inter-series correlation of drought-limited trees significantly increased in the period with the lowest groundwater level. In contrast to tree-ring widths, earlywood vessel lumen area series contained common temperature signal, with no imprint of groundwater-level alteration. Our results indicate that poorly drained forest ecosystems are characterized by a significantly individualistic response of radial growth to groundwater-level alteration. These individualistic responses could be, however, overshadowed in stand-level average tree-ring width chronologies.

AB The natural reactive media palygorskite, peat, and scoria were chosen for the in situ remediation of petroleum-contaminated groundwater in a northeast field of China based on its geologic and hydrogeologic characterization. The adsorption capacity of the compound media for removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the groundwater was investigated. The results indicated that the adsorption efficiency of palygorskite and peat were greatly improved after heat treatment for 2 h at 140 degrees C. Taking consideration of the permeability and adsorption efficiency of particle size on TPH removal of each media, the suitable particle size of 0.5-2.0 mm was selected. The optimal mass ratio of the compound reactive media was 2.0:0.8:0.2 for scoria, peat, and palygorskite, respectively, and the permeability of compounds media was 208 m/d. The results from the 31 days of operation showed that the TPH removal rate of compounds reached up to 96 %, pH varied between 7.49-7.63, and the ORP value generally decreased from -3 to -33. During the process of the cation exchange and the ion adsorption, the concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, K2+, Na2+, and SO42- decreased. However, the concentration of HCO3- increased due to the dissolved calcite of palygorskite in the slightly alkaline aqueous environment. This chemical and physical reaction allowed the TDS to gradually decrease from 717.15 to 330.94 mg/L, which then became stable after 31 days. The experiments suggested that the PRB reactor had a strong capacity to adsorb the petroleum hydrocarbon, enhance the ability of water redox state, and decrease the groundwater salinity.

AB Understanding the role of fire in the Earth system, and particularly regional controls on its frequency and severity, is critical to risk assessment. Charcoal records from lake sediment and fire-scar networks from long-lived tree species have improved our understanding of long-term relationships between fire events and climate. This work has primarily focused on historically fire-prone ecosystems and regions. In the northeastern USA, where wildfire has been relatively infrequent in historical times, fire-risk assessments have incorporated little-to-no pre-historical data and little is known about long-term fire-climate relationships. We developed coupled, high-resolution records of moisture variability and fire from three ombrotrophic peatlands in Maine using testate amoebae and analysis of microscopic charcoal. Water-table depth reconstructions among the three sites were generally coherent, with high-magnitude dry and wet events corresponding within the uncertainty of age-depth models. At all sites, there was a significantly higher probability of fire events during high-magnitude droughts. However, although prolonged droughts were widespread and associated with higher probability of fire, the fire events were rarely synchronous among sites, with the exception of similar to 550 years before present (yr BP) when all three sites experienced both drought and fire. While fire has been relatively uncommon in the northeastern USA during the past century, our records clearly highlight the potential vulnerability of the region to future drought and fire impacts. Results also demonstrate the utility of coupled records of fire and climate in understanding regional fire-climate dynamics.

AB The Miller Woods wetland system contains over 150 individual minerotrophic fens. The fens are established in a progradational beach complex of relict beach ridges and parabolic dunes and are in hydraulic connection with Lake Michigan. Large-scale flow in the wetland system is horizontal to the northwest. The position of a ground-water divide which forms the southern hydrologic boundary does not coincide with geographical boundaries of the system and migrates in time and space. The position of the divide is not solely a function of topography, but is dependent on an interplay among evapotranspirative demands, antecedent soil moisture. and recent recharge. Small-scale, local flow systems develop and dissipate on variable temporal scales along the margins of individual wetlands in response to evapotranspirative demands by wetland vegetation and other climatic influences.

The bulk density, particle size distribution, and water retention curve of the substrates were determined. Furthermore, the water profiles, oxygen (O-2) concentration, and O-2 diffusion rate of all substrates were determined during a 16-week cultivation period. Plant height, flower production, and both shoot and root dry weights as well as percent growth increase of plants were measured at the end of the experiment. The substrate water profiles showed that the water content was greater and air content was less in substrates of pots irrigated with drip irrigation than with sub-irrigation. The O-2 concentration in all substrates irrespective of the irrigation method was high. The O-2 diffusion rate values of sub-irrigated substrates were greater than those drip-irrigated, and Ps(60):Pb-30:P-10 showed the greatest values. Shoot and root dry weights and percent growth increase of drip-irrigated plants were greater than that of sub-irrigated plants.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from arable soils are released to the atmosphere in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These soil emissions were measured from three horticultural production systems in Quebec and Ontario, Canada, for the following crops: (1) cranberry production in an artificial bog on sandy soil; (2) tomato production on a conventionally farmed loamy sand soil; and, (3) onion production on an organic soil. In-situ soil N2O, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured at each site using the non steady-state static chamber method. Tomato production on the loamy sand and onion production on the organic soils were the greatest producers of soil GHG emissions, with highest global warming potentials of 11,000 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) and 7800 kg CO2-eq ha(-1), respectively. The cranberry crop had the lowest global warming potential (2700 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)). Water management (water table depth, subsurface and surface drip irrigation) had a negligible impact on soil GHG emissions. The main factors influencing the production of N2O were spring thaw, rate and timing of inorganic fertilizers, and precipitation. Soil CO2 fluxes were primarily governed by soil temperature. Soil CH4 fluxes were low, as the soils from all crops were both oxidizing and producing CH4 simultaneously. Production of CH4 increased when the cranberry fields were flooded. Organic and mineral soils produced comparable amounts of soil greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Water tables in the Netherlands have been greatly lowered in recent decades, largely in order to favour agricultural activities. Drought and increased nitrate (NO3-) leaching from agricultural land lead to oxidation of iron-sulphide (FeSx) in the subsoil, resulting in increased sulphate (SO42-) concentrations in the groundwater. In addition, increased atmospheric sulphur (S) deposition and leaching of SO42- from agricultural land have increased SO42- concentrations in the groundwater. Attempts to retain groundwater in desiccated wetlands by simply damming drainage ditches have resulted in greatly increased retention times of the water, die-back of the original vegetation and massive development of algae and lemnids in summer. In order to determine whether stagnation of SO42--rich groundwater plays an important role in eutrophication, nine bottomless enclosures were placed in the sediment of an open water body to block the supply of groundwater. Na2SO4 was added to three enclosures twice a year to simulate a minimised input of SO42--rich groundwater. In addition NaCl was added to three enclosures, while three enclosures were left untreated. (Pore) water quality and vegetation development were compared with those at seepage-fed sites outside the enclosures. The results show that stagnating SO42--rich groundwater led to increased SO42- reduction in the sediment, resulting in phosphate (o-PO43-) mobilisation from the sediment and eutrophication of the water layer, due to the interference of S2- with the iron-phosphorous cycle. This was accompanied by massive growth of common duckweed (Lemna minor) and filamentous algae and a decreased growth of broad-leaved pondweed (Potamogeton natans). The consistently high input of SO(4)2- via seepage did not lead to eutrophication. The results indicated that SO42- reduction rates at sites fed by seepage were very low. This was probably caused by the consistently high input of Fe and NO3- via the groundwater, which prevents reduction of SO42- by providing energetically more favourable electron acceptors. In fens with stagnating groundwater, Fe and NO3- will be rapidly depleted, stimulating SO42- reduction resulting in development of toxic S2- concentrations and eutrophication of the water layer.

AB Subarctic wetlands that exist as bogs, fens, swamps, marshes and shallow water, comprise 3% of the Canadian landscape. They have been recognized as important ecotones between the arctic tundra and boreal forest. Recently, there has been growing research interest in the hydrological characteristics of arctic and subarctic wetland systems in the need for more efficiently conserving wetlands and assessing climate change related impacts. This research targets the Deer River watershed near Churchill, Manitoba, which represents a typical subarctic wetland system in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. An extensive field investigation was first conducted during the summer from 2006 to 2008 to facilitate in-depth understanding of the wetland hydrology. The results provided evidence to indicate a strong relationship between air temperature and evapotranspiration. Permafrost table, soil moisture and streamflow were monitored and analyzed to advance the acknowledgement of the climatic, geographical and hydrological characteristics of subarctic wetlands. To quantify the water cycle and further validate the findings from field investigation, a Canadian distributed hydrological model, WATFLOOD, was employed to simulate the hydrologic processes in the targeted watershed. The results demonstrated that snowmelt in the spring season (April-June) was the major source of water supplement of subarctic wetlands. Most light and moderate rainfall events in summer (July-September) generated relatively small amounts of runoff which can be related to canopy interception, depression storage, porous soil layers, impermeable permafrost and intensive evapotranspiration. A lag of 2-8 days between the peaks of rainfall and stream runoff was observed in both summer and fall. This study is expected to benefit wetland conservation and the assessment of climate change related impacts in the Canadian northern regions.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN MINNESOTA
AB Badley Moor Fen exists in a region of the UK where potential evapotranspiration exceeds annual rainfall. The wetland is maintained by an input of Chalk groundwater in an area where the groundwater aquifer is regionally confined below boulder clay. The large groundwater contribution to the water balance arises from a unique local geological situation on the margin of the valley floor that allows the vertical movement of groundwater to the surface under a strong upward head gradient. The groundwater contribution is the dominant water input and maintains saturation within the immediate vicinity of the source of groundwater. Surface water outflow, via adjacent drainage channels, is the major output. The groundwater component is also important in that, as a result of hydrochemical change in the groundwaters with flow towards the surface, tufa has been precipitated. The calcium bicarbonate rich groundwater and tufa accumulation have given the site a unique character, with an exceptionally rich calcareous fen community.

AB Solar eclipses provide opportunities to observe unusual natural phenomena. This paper presents data showing that diurnal groundwater fluctuations were briefly interrupted in a Southern Appalachian fen following a total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017. Groundwater levels, which were rapidly declining in the middle of a summer afternoon, nearly stabilized following totality. This anomaly in the water-level record was caused by reduced evapotranspiration (ET). ET was significantly lower (36% +/- 11%, p < 0.02) over a 45-min time period following the eclipse when compared with other days within the study period, although the effects were short lived and did not have a significant impact on the daily total ET (p > 0.05). These findings may prompt evaluation of existing groundwater records along the path of totality from past eclipses or plan for studies ahead of future eclipses.

AB Since the 1990s, the territory of the Sumava National Park (Czech Republic) has faced significant changes in land cover, especially deforestation, in conjunction with several bark beetle disturbances and hurricane Kyrill in 2007. The aim of the study is to review the hydrological and climatic function of the forest and deforestation impacts on the landscape temperature. As a case study, surface temperature changes of the selected area of Sumava National Park from the satellite Landsat thermal data is presented from 1991 to 2016. At the sites with decayed forest, the surface temperature increased by 2-4 degrees C. Images from ground temperature measurements illustrate extreme temperature differences (similar to 35 degrees C) at locations where dead wood has not been removed; in the live forest, they are around 5 degrees C. Further, we show the increase in air temperature is associated with the decay of forest stands, including snow melting. The duration of the permanent snow cover on the mountaintops with the growing forest in the last four years is, on average, 11 days longer than the areas with decayed forest. The results show that the increase in surface temperature in the large area causes changes in the local climate and hydrological regime. These changes may have a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystems, including the Sumava wetlands and peat bogs belonging to the Ramsar sites.

AB The level of environmental impact from emergency oil spills in the Arctic region is wide variety even for small areas due to considerable heterogeneity of factors affecting the fate of spilled oil. Authors suggest a point rating classification model for assessment the hazard level of oil spills by means of the sum of products of the factor indicators and their weight coefficients. This paper investigates next factors: oil spreading assessment; number of water bodies that can be polluted; surface slope. Calculations performed for " Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu - Varandey" pipeline in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russian Federation. Oil spreading assessment is calculated with hydrodynamic model considering type of soil (in this ease - various types of peat), soil permeability, soil humidity, oil viscosity, evaporation of oil and others. Number of water bodies is calculated by means of Earth satellite images, surface slope - by means of topographic map. The number of water bodies along this pipeline is 59, including 39 lakes and 20 rivers. Average surface slope for pipeline is low (1%), t his is not so significant for hazard level assessment. Authors determined that level of potential risk to the environment is significantly different depending on factor influence. Paper suggests five-step verbal-numeric rating scale for assessment. the hazard level, and pipeline zoning has been carried out on this basis.

AB The aim of this study was to establish the main drivers of the spatial variability in growing season CH4 flux within an arctic wetland ecosystem. During 3 years (2011-2013) we measured CH4 flux and potential drivers, e.g., CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration), temperature, water table depth, pore-water concentration of organic acids (e.g., acetate) and the vascular plant composition and density. The study included 16-20 main plots (C-main) and in 2013 also experimental plots (10 excluded muskoxen grazing, 9 snow fence and 10 automated chamber plots) distributed over 0.3 km(2). The results show a 1.8-times difference in CH4 flux magnitude inter-annually and 9- to 35-times spatially (depending on year and treatment). During all 3 years GPP was a strong driver of the variability in C-main plots. Accordingly, the plant productivity related variables NEE, GPP and acetate were singled out as the strongest drivers of the variability in 2013, when all variables were measured on a majority of the plots. These variables were equally strong drivers of the spatial variability in CH4 flux regardless of whether experimental plots were included in the analysis or not. The density of Eriophorum scheuchzeri was the strongest driver of the spatial variability in NEE, GPP and acetate. In conclusion, changes in vegetation composition or productivity of wet arctic ecosystems will have large impacts on their carbon balance and CH4 flux, irrespective of whether these changes are driven directly by climate change or by biotic interactions, such as grazing.

AB Nitrate (NO3 (-)) reduction processes are important for depleting the NO3 (-) load from agricultural source areas before the discharge water reaches surface waters or groundwater aquifers. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the co-occurrence of microbial iron sulfide oxidation by NO3 (-) (MISON) and other NO3 (-)-depleting processes in a range of contrasting sediment types: sandy groundwater aquifer, non-managed minerotrophic freshwater peat and two brackish muddy sediments. Approximately 1/3 of the net NO3 (-) reduction was caused by MISON in three of the four environments despite the presence of organic carbon in the sediment. An apparent salinity limitation to MISON was observed in the most brackish environment. Addition of high surface area synthetically precipitated iron sulfide (FeS (x) ) to the aquifer sediment with the lowest natural FeS (x) reactivity increased both the relative fraction of NO3 (-) reduction linked to MISON from approximately 30-100 % and the absolute rates by a factor of 17, showing that the potential for MISON-related NO3 (-) reduction is environmentally significant and rate limited by the availability of reactive FeS (x) .

AB Arctic regions contain large amounts of stored soil carbon and comprise huge areas of discontinuous vegetation. The potential for feedback effects on possible changing climatic conditions through altered source/sink action for atmospheric CO2 is therefore an important issue in tundra regions. In this, study we investigate environmental controls on CO2 evolution rates in Arctic soils through observations along a Eurasian transect of tundra sites and comparative experiments in northern Sweden and northeast Greenland. Among factors potentially controlling decomposition rates in Eurasian wet and mesic tundra temperature and depth of the water table significantly influenced the CO2 efflux, while thaw depth, soil nitrogen, and organic matter concentrations explained very little of the variation in fluxes. The minor importance of the soil N status in controlling decomposition rates was confirmed in experiments in which N and P was added in a factorial manner at a subarctic heath and a high-Arctic drained fen. Phosphorus decreased the CO2 emissions, while the combined N and P treatment increased the emissions in the subarctic. These effects were not reproduced in the high Arctic. The results support most assumptions in current decomposition models on the soil climatic controls on decomposition rates in the Arctic.

AB Anthropogenic and environmental pressures on wetland hydrology may trigger changes in carbon (C) cycling, potentially exposing vast amounts of soil C to rapid decomposition. We measured soil CO2 efflux (R-s) continuously from 2009 to 2010 in a lower coastal plain forested wetland in North Carolina, U.S., to characterize its main environmental drivers. To understand and quantify the spatial variation due to microtopography and associated differences in hydrology, measurements were conducted at three microsites along a microtopographic gradient. The seasonal hysteresis in R-s differed by microtopographic location and was caused by the transitions between flooded and nonflooded conditions. Because flooded R-s was small, we reported R-s dynamics mainly during nonflooded periods. A nested model, modified from conventional Q(10) (temperature sensitivity) model with dynamic parameters, provided a significantly better simulation on the observed variation of R-s. The model performed better with daily data, indicating that soil temperature (T-s) and water table depth (WTD) were the primary drivers for seasonal variation. The diel variation of R-s was high and independent of T-s and WTD, which both had small diel variations, suggesting the likely association with plant activity. Overall, the site-average soil CO2 efflux was approximately 960-1103gCm(-2)yr(-1) in 2010, of which 93% was released during nonflooded periods. Our study indicates that R-s is highly linked to hydroperiod and microtopography in forested wetlands and droughts in wetlands will accelerate soil C loss.

AB The use of potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates to identify irrigation timing for greenhouse tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) grown in peat-based substrate was evaluated for a spring and fall crop. PET (using the Penman equation) was calculated from leaf, wet and dry bulb temperatures, and incident and reflected photosynthetic photon flux. Substrate matric potential (SMP) was monitored continuously using electronic tensiometers. Two irrigation starting setpoints (-4.5 and -6.5 kPa SMP) and two nutrient solution electrical conductivity (EC) treatments (1.5 and 3.0 dS.m(-1)) were factorially combined in a completely randomized design. Irrigation frequency was greater in treatments irrigated at -4.5 than at -6.5 kPa. The integral of calculated PET values was correlated with SMP for both experiments. Accumulated PET values were higher at the start of irrigation in the -6.5-kPa treatments for spring and fall crops. Nutrient solution EC did not influence irrigation frequency. Leaf pressure potential (LPP) was correlated to PET-predicted LPP (r(2) > 0.56) in plants subjected to high EC,low (-6.5 kPa) matric potential setpoint, or both treatments. PET and electronic tensiometer technology can be used jointly to improve irrigation management for tomatoes groan in peat-based substrates by more accurately responding to crop needs for water and nutrients.

AB Within the framework of the European LAPP-project (Land Arctic Physical Processes) and as part of the Danish Research Council's Polar Programme, studies on water and surface energy balance in NE Greenland were conducted in 1996 and 1997. Eddy correlation measurements of water vapour and sensible heat fluxes above the three dominant vegetation types: fen, willow snowbed, and heath were conducted for the entire growing season. This was supplemented by measurements of evaporation from snow covered areas and from a small pond. The evapotranspiration was found to be relatively high with the maximum from the fen (approximate to 86 per season). For the two other vegetation types the evapotranspiration was less, for heath 61 mm per season, while willow snowbed had evaporation rates on intermediate level. By use of the Penman-Monteith equation it was possible to estimate the altitude dependence of the evapotranspiration and calculate the annual evaporation for the whole area to 80 mm per year. By applying a bucket model the evaporation was found to be in accordance with changes in soil moisture as monitored with TDR.
   The observed surface water balance was compared to river discharge, which shows a glacio-nival regime with an early spring flow (June), determined by the snow melt in the main valley and an July-August maximum determined by melt on higher plateau areas. When balancing the individual hydrological components an annual deficit of 180 mm was observed, but it was found that this deficit could be reduced by correcting for aerodynamic and altitude effects on the precipitation. Finally some of the possible consequences of a global warming is discussed in relation to the water and energy balance in the high-arctic ecosystem.

AB The research activities on soil-freshwater interactions and freshwater biotic structure and processes in the Hoylandet area during the years 1986-89 are presented in this issue of Hydrobiologia. The 9 papers cover a range of topics from physiochemical gradients and processes in soils and freshwaters to selected aspects of freshwater biotic community structure and temporal variability. This synopsis aims (a) to present an overview of major findings, (b) to interpret the results in the context of air pollution effects and (c) to outline suggestions for future research activities in Hoylandet. The area has a sub-oceanic climate varying from 1100 to 2200 mm of precipitation normally originating from unpolluted airmasses from the North Atlantic. It is chemically dominated by sea salts, has low concentrations and low deposition of mineral acids. The catchment geology is variable and complex and consists mainly of various granites and gneisses. The soils are undisturbed 'ancient' soils, primarily iron podzols associated with forests, or intact histosols with strong organic character associated with mires, often quite acidic. They are sensitive because occurrence of predominantly insoluble unstable Al-complexes may leach out if exposed to anthropogenically acidified soil drainage water and turn up as toxic inorganic aqueous Al in surface runoff. Small amounts of locally generated nitrogen compounds are mostly retained in the catchment. The water qualities of these Hoylandet sites are run by inputs of sea salts, hydrological processes including dilution of the base flow, or lateral surface or overland flow and in-catchment processes. Relative to affected areas, it appears that the inputs and catchment processes are in balance, i.e., that the inputs of strong acid anions, hydrogen ions and sea salts are equilibrated by internal weathering and other processes and integrated within apparently intact biogeochemical cycles. The overall result is that these soils remain a net source of alkalinity to the runoff. These results are confirmed by regional studies of water quality both at low and high flow which show that the humus and ionic content of the water decreased with elevation, headwaters being more dominated hv sea salts and dilution processes. Excess sulphate concentrations are low, and few if any sites appear anthropogenically acidified, the most acid pH's reflecting presence of natural weak organic acids.
   The resulting surface water quality allows a diverse aquatic fauna and flora with representatives of many acid-sensitive groups. The fish fauna consists of self-reproducing salmonid populations with normal demography and ecological interactions. Despite high in-lake mortality, both brown trout and Arctic charr exhibited normal age-class compositions, with no indication of the recruitment failure or high post-spawning mortality commonly observed in acid-stressed situations. The zooplankton and benthos in the lakes are inhabited by populations of several acid sensitive species, like Daphnia spp and Gammarus lacustris, and with dominance of mayfly species of the genus Baetis in the stream fauna. The diatom flora includes many species which are rare or absent in acidified waters. The observed gradients in diversity and biomass seem dominated by local environmental conditions which reflect natural rather than man-made processes. The pristine nature of the area also emerges from the paleoecological studies in Lake Royrtjonna which show that the low acidity of this lake evironment has persisted from preindustrial till present times. Suggestion for future research activities in Hoylandet are outlined.

AB The article presents the results of a combination of isotopic (delta N-15 and delta C-13), geochemical (TOC, TN, C/N) and palaeobotanical investigations. They were carried out on organic matter (OM) that had been deposited from the Younger Dryas to the Subboreal chronozone in palaolake sediments (north-eastern Poland). OM from the late Younger Dryas consists only a small amount of TOC and TN, which together with the lack of aquatic macrophyte macrofossils confirm low primary production in the then reservoir. The higher values of C/N ratio (18-27) and delta C-13 (ca. -26 parts per thousand) suggest that OM was mainly terrestrial in origin. During the Preboreal chronozone (11,450-10,150 cal. BP), there was a probable deepening of the reservoir through the melting of dead ice. This might have been intensified by an increase in precipitation and a fall in evapotranspiration during the 'Preboreal oscillation'. From the early Preboreal chronozone (ca. 11,345 cal. BP), a mixed source of OM is indicated by C/N ratio (from 8 to 13). At the same time significant increase in TOC and TN probably registered a rise in primary production in the palaeolake. From the older part of the Boreal chronozone (ca. 9865 cal. BP) algae productivity increased (the C/N ratio dropped to ca. 8 and was then constant). At the beginning of the Atlantic chronozone (ca. 8650 cal. BP) a probable increase in the water level caused the partial relocation of OM from the reed swamp belt and/or the adjacent alder carr into deeper sections of the palaeolake (an increase in TOC and TN). In the late Atlantic chronozone (ca. 6965-6650 cal. BP), TOC and TN decreased while delta C-13 had high values, which probably reflected a more distinct stratification of the water column with anoxic bottom waters. Next, in the late Atlantic and early Subboreal chronozone (ca. 6650-5205 cal. BP) the amount of OM in palaeolake sediments was still rising. The delta C-13 values dropped, suggesting an intensification of processes of water mixing. These processes were simultaneous with the constant shallowing of the palaeolake and the disappearance of habitats suitable for submerged macrophytes. The topmost part of the profile is characteristic of a strong decomposition of peat, causing a release of carbon dioxide and therefore the depletion of the carbon pool in the peat (a drop in the C/N ratio). The concurrent upward trend of the delta N-15 curve is probably the effect of a greater anthropogenic impact on the palaeolake/mire and its catchment and/or more recent human interference in the topmost peat layers.

AB Since the advancement in CH4 gas analyser technology and its applicability to eddy covariance flux measurements, monitoring of CH4 emissions is becoming more widespread. In order to accurately determine the greenhouse gas balance, high quality gap-free data is required. Currently there is still no consensus on CH4 gap-filling methods, and methods applied are still study-dependent and often carried out on low resolution, daily data.
   In the current study, we applied artificial neural networks to six distinctively different CH4 time series from high latitudes, explain the method and test its functionality. We discuss the applicability of neural networks in CH4 flux studies, the advantages and disadvantages of this method, and what information we were able to extract from such models.
   Three different approaches were tested by including drivers such as air and soil temperature, barometric air pressure, solar radiation, wind direction (indicator of source location) and in addition the lagged effect of water table depth and precipitation. In keeping with the principle of parsimony, we included up to five of these variables traditionally measured at CH4 flux measurement sites. Fuzzy sets were included representing the seasonal change and time of day. High Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of up to 0.97 achieved in the final analysis are indicative for the high performance of neural networks and their applicability as a gap-filling method for CH4 flux data time series. This novel approach which we show to be appropriate for CH4 fluxes is a step towards standardising CH4 gap-filling protocols.

AB Understanding and predicting surface movement is important both technically and for social reasons. The shallow processes contributing to subsidence include construction works, peat oxidation, clay compaction, and groundwater withdrawal; deep causes are hydrocarbon and salt production. We describe an inversion procedure we have devised to disentangle the deep and shallow causes of surface movement. It employs a Bayesian inversion scheme, using forward models and other 'a priori' information about shallow and deep compaction. Parameter estimation thus takes place at two different depths, thereby disentangling the deep and shallow compaction processes responsible for surface movement. The uncertainty in the surface measurements and 'a priori' estimates is naturally incorporated. Furthermore, spatial and temporal correlations can be taken into account through inclusion of the covariance matrix. The inversion scheme is demonstrated for two synthetic cases. The first combines a compacting gas field and a compacting shallow peat layer. We demonstrate that assumptions on the shape of the subsidence bowl are not necessary. We also show how neglecting either deep or shallow causes of subsidence can produce spurious results. The advantage of using the 'a priori' estimates of the compaction and the covariance matrix obtained by Monte Carlo simulations is demonstrated with a second synthetic example involving two polders and different depths of their water table. A robust solution is obtained for each polder unit, while a simpler (and faster) 'a priori' estimate based on the expected average clay thickness fails to reproduce the actual compaction. Monte Carlo simulations can also be applied to compaction in depleting gas reservoirs. Information on spatial correlations is often available, even when the absolute values of the 'a priori' compaction data are quite uncertain. Explicitly incorporating such 'a priori' known spatial correlations improves the result significantly.

ID SECONDARY COMPRESSION; STRESS
AB Dredged harbor mud is being increasingly used as backfilling and construction material in harbor development or reorganization to gain financial and operative advantages compared to disposal or ex situ treatment of the often contaminated material. However, the suitability of such soft organic sediments as construction material is unclear. This study presents geotechnical parameters for describing the one-dimensional consolidation based on large-scale long-term and standard oedometer tests using organic harbor mud from the Osthafen (East Harbor) reorganization project in Bremerhaven, Germany. Determined compression indices C(c) are in the range of peat, whereas the water permeabilities resemble those of clay. The coefficients of consolidation cv vary between 10(-9) and 10(-8) m(2)/s and large coefficients of secondary compression C(alpha) between 0.065 and 0.14 are observed. Differences in parameters from large-scale and standard tests can be explained by volume and time effects likely linked to biogeochemical degredation of organic carbon and the resulting methane degassing. A curve fit based on the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares optimization method confirmed the applicability of the Terzaghi theory in combination with a creep term.

Both the response variables of diurnal and nocturnal NEE (NEEd and Reco-n) and the explanatory variables of latent heat (LE), relative humidity (RH), and atmospheric CO2 and H2O concentrations (AtmCO(2) and AtmH(2)O) were denoised with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using coiflet (coif10-6). Denoised NEE fluxes and their temporal components were modeled using multiple linear regression (MLR), polynomial regression (PR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models as a function of LE, RH, AtmCO(2), AtmH(2)O, air temperature (T-air), day of year (DOY), and local time. Peak NEEd flux, and peak Reco-n efflux were 0.37 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in late July and 0.27 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in mid-August. Mean annual NEE was estimated at -1157 g CO2 m(-2) which is in agreement with previous results of peatland studies. The use of DWT-augmented ANN, MLR and PR models significantly increased predictive power and reduced uncertainties in predicting the temporal dynamics of the biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange, relative to the models without DWT denoising. Out of 28 DWT-augmented ANNs, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent network (RN) models were the best diurnal and nocturnal ones, respectively, based on accuracy metrics derived from training, cross-validation and independent validation. Among the DWT-based ANN, MLR and PR models, diurnal MLP and nocturnal MLR outperformed the others. Wavelet-augmented ANN and MLR models appear to be a promising tool to quantify diurnal and nocturnal NEE dynamics, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The vast wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau are expected to be an important natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. The magnitude, patterns and environmental controls of CH4 emissions on different timescales, especially during the nongrowing season, remain poorly understood, because of technical limitations and the harsh environments. We conducted the first study on year-round CH4 fluxes in an alpine wetland using the newly developed LI-COR LI-7700 open-path gas analyzer. We found that the total annual CH4 emissions were 26.4 and 33.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and the nongrowing season CH4 emissions accounted for 43.2-46.1% of the annual emissions, highlighting an indispensable contribution that was often overlooked by previous studies. A two-peak seasonal variation in CH4 fluxes was observed, with a small peak in the spring thawing period and a large one in the peak growing season. We detected a significant difference in the diurnal variation of CH4 fluxes between the two seasons, with two peaks in the growing season and one peak in the nongrowing season. We found that the CH4 fluxes during the growing season were well correlated with soil temperature, water table depth and gross primary production, whereas the CH4 fluxes during the nongrowing season were highly correlated with soil temperature. Our results suggested that the CH4 emission during the nongrowing season cannot be ignored and the vast wetlands on the Tibetan plateau will have the potential to exert a positive feedback on climate considering the increasing warming, particularly in the nongrowing season in this region.

AB Carbon cycling is central to nutrient dynamics and accretion rates in wetlands.  Drainage and conversion of wetlands has been occurring at an accelerating rate.  This paper compares decay rates in natural and disturbed peatlands in the southeastern USA and examines relationships between edaphic factors and decay rates.  Cellulose decay rates (as tensile strength loss of cotton fibers) were used to compare decomposition potentials in these peatlands.  A 1984 pilot experiment included undisturbed short pocosin and several sites under various stages of agricultural conversion.  A spring 1987 experiment included an increasing nutrient availability gradient in undisturbed communities from short pocosin to tall pocosin to gum swamp, drained pocosin with natural vegetation remaining, and pocosin converted to pine forestry and agriculture.  In the 1984 experiment, disturbed sites had decay rates approximately nine times greater than undisturbed pocosin.  In the 1987 experiment, disturbed sites had decay rates from 1.8 to 10.3 times natural sites.  The greatest decay rates occurred in the agricultural site with its high nutrients, less acidic conditions, and relatively low soil moisture.  Drained pocosin had the next highest decay rates, although pH and nutrients were low.  Pine (Pinus taeda L.) forestry had intermediate rates of decay, while undisturbed sites had low rates.  The more nutrient-rich, but wet and low pH, gum swamp site had similar or slightly higher rates than the pocosin sites.  Drainage, relieving excessive soil moisture and the resultant anaerobiosis, was the dominant factor explaining the greater decay rates in the disturbed sites.  Other factors, such as nutrient availability and low pH, may have had secondary effects on cellulose decay.  Rates were also compared to a global data set based on potential evapotranspiration.  Natural sites have rates very close to those predicted, while disturbed sites have much higher rates (1.9-4.4 x predicted).

AB We investigated turnover of methane (CH4) in soils from a poorly drained UK forest. In situ, this forest exhibited a negligible soil - atmosphere CH4 flux, whereas adjacent grassland plots were sources of CH4. We hypothesised that the forest plots exhibited reduced anaerobic CH4 production through water-table draw down. Consequently, we exposed soil cores from under oak to high and low water-table conditions in the laboratory. Methane fluxes increased significantly in the high water-table (1925 +/- 1702 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) compared to the low one (- 3.5 +/- 6.8 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Natural abundance delta C-13 values of CH4 showed a strong depletion in high water-table cores (- 56.7 +/- 2.9 parts per thousand) compared to methane in ambient air (- 46.0 parts per thousand) indicative of methanogenic processes. The delta C-13 values of CH4 from low water-table cores (delta C-13 - 46.8 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) was similar to ambient air and suggested little alteration of headspace CH4 by the soil microbial community. In order to assess the CH4 oxidizing activity of the two treatments conclusively, a (CH4)-C-13 spike was added to the cores and (CO2)-C-13 production was measured as the by-product of CH4 oxidation. (CH4)-C-13 oxidation rates were 57.5 (+/- 12.7) and 0.5 (+/- 0.1) mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) for high and low water-tables, respectively. These data show that the lower water-table hydrology treatment impacted methanogenic processes without stimulating methanotrophy.

AB Greenhouse tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Capello) were grown in peat bags and rockwool slabs to examine the effects of varying the electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution and substrate matric water potential (Psi(sub)) on plant water relations. EC of the nutrient solution delivered to peat bags varied between 1 to 4 dS.m(-1) with Psi(sub) of either-5 kPa or-9 kPa as the setpoint for starting the irrigation. The EC variations were adjusted automatically by a computer system according to potential evapotranspiration (PET), which was calculated from radiation and vapor pressure deficit. Plants in rockwool slabs were treated with three EC levels, 2.5, 4.0 and 5.5 dS.m(-1). Plants in both peat bags and rockwool slabs were overwatered once a week to leach accumulated salts out of the substrates. Before plants were overwatered, leaf water potential (Psi(L)) was lower in the plants treated with high EC and low Psi(sub) but turgor potential (P) was maintained close to the control value. This was attributed to the osmotic adjustment caused mainly by the active solute accumulation. After plants under high EC or low Psi(sub) were overwatered, Psi(L) recovered to the control level, and P became higher because of the lower osmotic potential (pi) than in the control plants. At a given Psi(L), the plants under variable EC, high EC, and low Psi(sub) maintained higher leaf relative water content (zeta) These leaves had high turgid water content, high symplasmic (osmotically active) water content, low apoplasmic (osmotically inactive) watger content and low rat the point of zero turgor (incipient plasmolysis). EC variations in peat bags according to PET caused osmotic adjustment and turgor regulation although the extent was small. Maintenance of P after overwatering was directly proportional to stomatal conductance and photsynthetic rate. Our results suggested that tomato plants adjusted their internal water status and compartment of tissue water in symplasmic and apoplasmic fractions in response to high EC and low Psi(sub) and that varying EC together with overwatering plants once a week not only reduced salinity stress but also favored turgor maintenance.

AB Two C-14-dated pollen profiles from mires in the steppe belt of southern Russia are presented. On the basis of these and data from earlier investigations, the Holocene forest history of the southern part of Russia and Ukraine is reconstructed. The steppe belt is very sensitive to climatic oscillations and, in particular, to changes in evapotranspiration. The most favourable climate occurred between 6000 and 4500 B.P. (6800-5200 cal. B.P.), when forest attained its maximum extent in the steppe belt. The period 4500-3500 B.P. (5200-3800 cal. B.P.) was characterised by drier climate with the most arid phase occurring between 4200-3700 B.P. (4700-4000 cal. B.P.). During arid phases, the area under forest and also peat accumulation rates declined. Subsequently, a number of less pronounced climatic oscillations occurred such as in the period 3400/3300-2800 B.P. (3600/3500-2900 cal. B.P.) when there was a return to more humid conditions. During the last 2500 years, the vegetation cover of the steppe belt in southern Russia and Ukraine took on its present-day aspect. On the one hand, there is close correlation between the Holocene vegetation history of southern Russia and Ukraine and, on the other hand, the steppe belt of Kazakhstan and transgressions in the Caspian sea. Human impact on the natural vegetation became important from the Bronze Age onwards (after 4500 B.P.; 5200 cal. B.P.). Particular attention is given to the history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), which had a much wider distribution in the southern part of eastern Europe in the early Holocene. The reduction in range during recent millennia has come about as a result of the combined effects of both climatic deterioration and increased human impact.

AB Shifting precipitation patterns brought on by climate change threaten to alter the future distribution of wetlands. We developed a set of models to understand the role climate plays in determining wetland formation on a landscape scale and to forecast changes in wetland distribution for the Midwestern United States. These models combined 35 climate variables with 21 geographic and anthropogenic factors thought to encapsulate other major drivers of wetland distribution for the Midwest. All models successfully recreated a majority of the variation in current wetland area within the Midwest, and showed that wetland area was significantly associated with climate, even when controlling for landscape context. Inferential (linear) models identified a consistent negative association between wetland area and isothermality. This is likely the result of regular inundation in areas where precipitation accumulates as snow, then melts faster than drainage capacity. Moisture index seasonality was identified as a key factor distinguishing between emergent and forested wetland types, where forested wetland area at the landscape scale is associated with a greater seasonal variation in water table depth. Forecasting models (neural networks) predicted an increase in potential wetland area in the coming century, with areas conducive to forested wetland formation expanding more rapidly than areas conducive to emergent wetlands. Local cluster analyses identified Iowa and Northeastern Missouri as areas of anticipated wetland expansion, indicating both a risk to crop production within the Midwest Corn Belt and an opportunity for wetland conservation, while Northern Minnesota and Michigan are potentially at risk of wetland losses under a future climate.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effects of substrate, irrigation scheduling and nutrient solution electrical conductivity (EC) on plant growth and photosynthesis of tomato plants. The plants grown in peat-bags were irrigated by a potential evapotranspiration (PET) dependent irrigation system. The first peat-bag treatment (control) was irrigated when the soil water potential reached -5 kPa. EC was fixed at 2.5 dS m(-1). EC of other two peat-bag treatments was varied between 1 and 4 dS m(-1) with a soil water potential setpoint (SWPS) of either -5 or -9 kPa. Plants grown in rockwool and by the nutrient film technique (NFT) were treated with EC levels of 2.5, 4.0 and 5.5 dS m(-1). EC variation resulted in higher photosynthetic capacity (P-c), quantum use efficiency (QUE) and dry matter production (DMP) under high SWPS compared with the control. The increase in DMP resulted mainly from fruit yield increase. In the treatment of EC variation with low SWPS, P-c and DMP were lower than in treatment of EC variation with high SWPS, but not different from that in the treatment of fixed EC. The high EC treatment of 4.0 dS m(-1) decreased DMP in NFT, but did not in rockwool. EC of 5.5 dS m(-1) decreased fruit yield but did not affect shoot DMP. However, high EC treatments, especially EC of 4 dS m(-1), increased P-c as well as QUE in rockwool and in NFT. DMP and P-c was not positively correlated with each other for EC treatment, However, it is concluded that PET-dependent EC variation increases photosynthetic capacity, plant growth and fruit yield of greenhouse tomato plants.

AB We compared median runoff (R) and precipitation (P) relationships over 25years from 20 mesoscale (50 to 5,000km(2)) catchments on the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada, to understand controls on water sink and source dynamics in water-limited, low-relief northern environments. Long-term catchment R and runoff efficiency (RP-1) were low and varied spatially by over an order of magnitude (3 to 119mm/year, 1 to 27%). Intercatchment differences were not associated with small variations in climate. The partitioning of P into evapotranspiration (ET) and R instead reflected the interplay between underlying glacial deposit texture, overlying soil-vegetation land cover, and regional slope. Correlation and principal component analyses results show that peatland-swamp wetlands were the major source areas of water. The lowest estimates of median annual catchment ET (321 to 395mm) and greatest R (60 to 119mm, 13 to 27% of P) were observed in low-relief, peatland-swamp dominated catchments, within both fine-textured clay-plain and coarse-textured glacial deposits. In contrast, open-water wetlands and deciduous-mixedwood forest land covers acted as water sinks, and less catchment R was observed with increases in proportional coverage of these land covers. In catchments dominated by hummocky moraines, long-term runoff was restricted to 10mm/year, or 2% of P. This reflects the poor surface-drainage networks and slightly greater regional slope of the fine-textured glacial deposit, coupled with the large soil-water and depression storage and higher actual ET of associated shallow open-water marsh wetland and deciduous-forest land covers. This intercatchment study enhances current conceptual frameworks for predicting water yield in the Boreal Plains based on the sink and source functions of glacial landforms and soil-vegetation land covers. It offers the capability within this hydro-geoclimatic region to design reclaimed catchments with desired hydrological functionality and associated tolerances to climate or land-use changes and inform land management decisions based on effective catchment-scale conceptual understanding.

ID ENERGY-BALANCE; TUNDRA
AB Measurements of the surface fluxes of heat and water vapour were taken at four sites across the European Arctic as part of the EU funded LAPP project. The sites cover a range of latitudinal, altitudinal and climatic conditions. The most northerly site is near Ny-Angstrom lesund, Svalbard, a polar semi-desert with continuous permafrost. A second permafrost site is a fen area in the Zackenberg valley, East Greenland. Finally two sites in northern Finland, Skalluvaara and Kaamanen are on the southern boundary of the region affected by permafrost. At all sites measurements were made of the turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapour using eddy correlation equipment for at least one active season.
   The net radiation totals for July and August are similar at all sites. At the sites with permafrost a substantial proportion (over 20%) of the net radiation goes into soil heat flux, to thaw the soil moisture in the top metre. Of the remaining energy just over half is used for evaporation. At the Finnish sites the vegetation is largely deciduous and this is seen in the record with higher evaporative ratios in July and August, after the vegetation becomes green.
   The Finnish sites tend to have higher surface resistance to evaporation; however, the evaporative demand is greater leading to slightly higher evaporation rates. The two Finnish sites have a similar seasonal pattern determined by the water table and seasonality of the vegetation. The two northern sites show a pattern that is determined primarily by the variation of water table only. It is concluded that the water balance through the active season is influenced primarily by the history of snow cover. The seasonality of the vegetation, the permafrost and the depth of water table, are also important influences.

AB Hydrological cycle changes that occur due to a changing environment is a hot topic in the field of hydrological science. It is of great practical significance to study the response mechanism of hydrological process change for future water resources planning and management. In this study, the effects of climate and watershed characteristic change on the streamflow in a typical tributary of the Yellow River (the Fen River watershed) are studied based on the Budyko hypothesis. The results show that: the sensitivity coefficients of streamflow to precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and the watershed characteristic coefficient were 0.1809, -0.0551, and -27.0882, respectively. This meant that a 1 mm decrease in the precipitation would induce a 0.1809 mm decrease in the streamflow. Additionally, a 1 mm decrease in the potential evapotranspiration would induce a 0.0551 mm increase in the streamflow, and an increase of 1 in the watershed characteristic coefficient would induce a 27.0882 mm decrease in the streamflow. The streamflow of the Fen River watershed showed a significant decreasing trend during the reference period (1951-1977). In addition, the streamflow of the change period (1978-2010) decreased 26.87 mm; and this was primarily caused by watershed characteristic change which accounted for 92.27%, while climate change only accounted for 6.50%.

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB Environmental conditions and soils of nine natural oases in the Alashan Gobi Desert of Mongolia are characterized. All these oases are allocated to the zones of tectonic faults, where the discharge of slightly saline groundwater takes place. The absolute heights are about 1500 m a.s.l. The oases are found on piedmont plains or in hilly areas occupied by true deserts with fragments of extremely arid deserts. With respect to geomorphological conditions, four types of oases can be distinguished: isolated (isle-type) oases, oases in large mesodepressions, oases formed in naturally ponded areas, and oases within terraced valleys. Each of these types is characterized by specific soil cover patterns controlled by the geomorphological features of the territory, the character of parent materials, and the groundwater depth. At the same time, some common soil properties are typical of all the oases. Hydromorphic soils-peat meadow-swampy soils, dark-colored nonsaline meadow soils, oasis solonchaks that developed in areas with shallow nonsaline groundwater, solonchaks with different degrees of hydromorphism that developed from mottled-colored salt-bearing Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits, and soddy alluvial (floodplain) soils-predominate in the central parts of the oases. Under conditions of deep groundwater, takyric and sandy desert soils are formed. The oases are encircled by desert ecosystems with gray-brown desert and extremely arid soils and with poorly developed stony soils that formed on the low residual mounts. In the period of the study (1991), irrigated farming was only developed within one of the studied oases. The main part of the land was used for pasturing. In some cases, the high grazing pressure led to degradation (desertification) of oasis ecosystems. A comparison of the oases studied in the Alashan Gobi with the Ekhiin-Gol oasis in the Transaltai Gobi attests to the similarity of their nature.

AB Oil sands development within the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) has accelerated in recent decades, causing alteration to natural ecosystems including wetlands that perform many vital ecosystem functions such as water and carbon storage. These wetlands comprise more than half of the landscape, and their distribution and local hydrology are the result of interactions among a subhumid climate, topography, and spatially heterogeneous surficial and bedrock geology. Since hydrology plays a fundamental role in wetland ecological functioning and determines wetland sensitivity to human disturbances, the characterization of anthropogenic impacts on wetland hydrology in the AOSR is necessary to assess wetland resilience and to improve current best management practices. As such, this paper reviews the impacts of oil sands development and related disturbances including infrastructure construction, gravel extraction, and land clearing on wetland function in the AOSR. Hydrologic disturbances in wetlands in the AOSR include changes to soil hydrophysical properties that control water table position, the interruption of recharge-discharge patterns, and alteration of micrometeorological conditions; these in turn govern wetland ecological structure and wetland ecosystem processes (e.g., evapotranspiration, nutrient cycling). Given that anthropogenic disturbance can affect natural wetland succession, long-term hydrological monitoring is crucial for predicting the response of these ecosystems to varying levels of human impact.

AB Mor is a typical humus form in the boreal coniferous forests, but little is known about its air permeability and pore geometry. Thirty undisturbed core samples were collected from a mor layer under a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand. Air permeability (K-a) was measured in each sample at six different air-filled porosities (epsilon(A)) using a constant-pressure air permeameter. The air permeability and the air-filled porosity were used to determine different indices of pore geometry and continuity. The average K-a increased logarithmically from 7.4 x 10(-1) to 1.3 x 10(3) mu m(2) when epsilon(A) increased from 0.1 to 0.8. Both the air permeability and pore continuity were high when compared with most other mineral soils and well-decomposed peats. The variations in air permeability and pore continuity with epsilon(A) were very large. The studied properties had a very large spatial variation in the mor layer which could be caused by the variation in the quality of the debris and the environmental factors affecting the decomposition process during the development history of the mor layer.

AB Aminopolycarboxylic acid (APCA) complexones, commonly referred to as ligands or chelating agents, like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), are commonly used in soluble fertilizers to supply copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and/or zinc (Zn) to plants. Offsite runoff and contamination of surface waters with these chelating agents is of increasing concern as a result of their reported ability to remobilize heavy metals in sediments and their low susceptibility to biodegradation. The APCA ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) is a structural isomer of EDTA with the [S,S'] stereoisomer of the complexone, a compound naturally produced by actinomycetes, and is biodegradable. Information on the use of [S,S']-EDDS as a chelating agent in formulating soluble fertilizers for the production of horticultural crops is limited. Therefore, a series of studies were conducted with the objectives of evaluating Fe[S,S]-EDDS as an Fe-chelate fertilizer agent in the production of marigold and [S,S']-EDDS (free ligand) and/or Fe[S,S']-EDDS spectral properties and vulnerability to photodegrdation. Marigold grown in peat-based media were fertilized with complete nutrient solution containing 1 mg.L(-1) Fe from FeEDDS, FeEDTA, or FeDTPA. There was no significant difference in foliar Fe or Mn between Fe-chelate treatments, averaging 140 mu g.g(-1) and 88 mu g.g(-1), respectively, nor were there significant differences in leaf dry weight (2.30 g) between Fe treatments. Spectra of [S,S]-EDDS and Fe[S,S']-EDDS produced from ferrous or ferric sources of Fe absorbed maximally in the 210 to 230 nm and 238 to 240-nm range, respectively. The [S,S']-EDDS complexone used in the current study, a 30% assay solution, had chromaphoric properties, appearing light yellow in color.

AB Bio-mediated soil improvement methods (those that use biological processes) have potentially low cost and environmental impact, but can be difficult to control to ensure effective results, especially if engineered bacteria are used. A novel application of using agarose gel as a soil analogue is proposed, which can enable development of advanced bio-mediated soil improvement methods by reproducing relevant mechanical properties while allowing complex biological processes to be studied in detail, before testing in soils. It is envisaged that agarose gel will be used instead of soil when developing early-stage prototype methods, as it provides an ideal environment to facilitate growth and monitoring of bacteria. A programme of geotechnical tests and scanning electron microscopy on Agarose Low Melt (LM) gel is presented. The results demonstrate comparable pore size, undrained strength, and permeability to soft clays and peats, but more linear stress-strain behaviour and higher compressibility. This paper offers proof of this novel concept, but further investigation is required as only a single type of agarose, at a single concentration is tested. By varying these factors, along with use of different solvents, there is significant potential to tune the behaviour of the analogue to particular soils or construction scenarios.

AB Methane fluxes measured in a eutrophic peat meadow in The Netherlands dominated by vascular plants showed high spatial and temporal variability. To elucidate this variability as well as the underlying processes, various measurement techniques were used: soil gradients of methane concentrations, the chamber method, and the eddy covariance technique. Additionally, soil temperature at multiple depths, soil water level, root depth, carbon dioxide fluxes, incoming radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, friction velocity latent, heat fluxes, and living biomass were monitored.
   A comparison of the measurement techniques showed that: (a) the soil gradient method and the chamber method showed comparable methane fluxes only at a site with low water table and shallow roots, while at other sites methane fluxes were underestimated with the soil gradient method by an order of magnitude: (b) a footprint analysis showed that the chamber method and eddy covariance showed similar methane fluxes for the different land elements (dry land, wet land, and ditches plus borders). However, when up-scaling the chamber measurements over time using a regression model based on soil temperature, methane emissions were overestimated by 37% compared to the eddy covariance data. The chamber method was the best technique to assess spatial variability, while eddy covariance was best for assessing temporal variability as well as up-scaling. The soil gradient method for methane fluxes should be used with great care, and probably generates reliable results only in areas with low water table and shallow roots.
   Both the chamber method and eddy covariance showed significant spatial variability, which was best explained by soil water level in combination with root depth patterns. Together, these variables probably determined the net methane production and the available mechanisms for methane transport to atmosphere. The methane fluxes showed strong temporal variability at different scales: diurnal cycles, significant day-to-day variability, and seasonal variations. Clear diurnal cycles of methane fluxes were observed synchronous to incoming radiation, latent heat and net ecosystem exchange, but not synchronous to temperature. This suggested that stomatal opening and/or pressurized convective throughflow were important mechanisms for gas transport through plants. The variability at the day-today scale was best explained by soil temperature below the water level combined with soil water level. Highest methane fluxes were observed during summer and lowest fluxes during autumn and winter. The vegetation density together with temperature and length of day-light probably determined this seasonality. Also, temporal variability varied spatially, probably due to the water table and root depth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrological cycle has significant effects on the terrestrial carbon (C) balance through its controls on photosynthesis and C decomposition. A detailed representation of the water cycle in terrestrial C cycle models is essential for reliable estimates of C budgets. However, it is challenging to accurately describe the spatial and temporal variations of soil water, especially for regional and global applications. Vertical and horizontal movements of soil water should be included. To constrain the hydrology-related uncertainty in modelling the regional C balance, a three-dimensional hydrological module was incorporated into the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon-budget model (InTEC V3.0). We also added an explicit parameterization of wetlands. The inclusion of the hydrological module considerably improved the model's ability to Simulate C content and balances in different ecosystems. Compared with measurements at five flux-tower sites, the model captured 85% and 82% of the variations in volumetric soil moisture content in the 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depths during the growing season and 84% of the interannual variability in the measured C balance. The simulations showed that lateral subsurface water redistribution is a necessary mechanism for simulating water table depth for both poorly drained forest and peatland sites. Nationally, soil C content and their spatial variability are significantly related to drainage class. Poorly drained areas are important C sinks at the regional scale, however, their soil C content and balances are difficult to model and may have been inadequately represented in previous C cycle models. The InTEC V3.0 model predicted an annual net C uptake by Canada's forests and wetlands for the period 1901-1998 of 111.9 Tg C yr(-1), which is 41.4 Tg C yr(-1) larger than our previous estimate (InTEC V2.0). The increase in the net C uptake occurred mainly in poorly drained regions and resulted from the inclusion of a separate wetland parameterization and a detailed hydrologic module with lateral flow in InTEC V3.0.

AB The distribution and metabolic activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in a shallow, suboxic aquifer were studied. A radioimaging technique was used to visualize and quantify the activity of sulfate reducers in sediments at a centimetre-level scale. The distribution of SRB metabolic activity was heterogeneous with areas showing little activity far outnumbering areas with high activity. Variation in sulfate-reducing activity was not statistically correlated with variation in depth, bacterial numbers, or the following sediment properties: sediment type (sand, peat or silt), grain size, permeability and hydraulic conductivity. Sulfate-reducing bacteria activity did vary significantly with sediment porosity (multivariate analysis, r = 0.48). We hypothesized that the small pore sizes associated with sediments with low porosity restricted the ability of SRB to grow to high numbers as well as their access to nutrients. To further explore the relationship between pore size and microbial metabolic activity, columns with varying pore diameters were constructed. Sulfate-reducing bacteria in the columns with the smallest pore diameters had the lowest rates of metabolism and SRB metabolic rates increased as the pore diameter increased. For the aquifer studied, sediment porosities and pore sizes were the main factor controlling SRB activity.

AB The water balance of a High Subarctic wetland was measured in a newly established research basin near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Measurements spanned the growing season from early June through to the end of August 1991. The watershed was instrumented such that the water budget could be monitored over each of the dominant terrain units. The study basin has 5 major terrain types consisting of sedge-dominated wetland, upland lichen-heath, tundra lakes and ponds, willow-birch wetland, and open spruce forest, in decreasing order of coverage. These terrain units, and the ecosystem as a whole, are representative of coastal wetlands underlain by permafrost in the Hudson Bay Lowland. Runoff and thus streamflow were closely tied to the moisture status of the peatlands and to the depth of the active layer. During 2 unusually dry periods, the peatlands remained wet, which indicates a lack of water mobility when the water table drops below the surface of the wetland. Streamflow response to rainfall during these periods was small in comparison to early summer when the frost table was near the surface, or to wet periods when the water table rose above the surface. Energy balance measurements showed the lakes and ponds to have about 15% higher net radiation than wetlands and 29% greater than upland lichen-heath. From 9 to 18% of net radiation was used in thawing and heating the ground whereas the latent heat flux for the various terrain types utilized from 49 to 83% of net radiation. Even with unusually large rainfalls that occurred in July, evaporation exceeded precipitation over the course of the summer. Despite this, runoff was high and required a large negative change in groundwater storage to account for it. The Lichen-heath and ponds exhibited the greatest change in water storage. The drainage of water from the uplands to the lowlands maintained the soil moisture of the peatlands and contributed to streamflow. Each terrain type had a characteristic water balance due to differences in one or more of the hydrologic variables (evapotranspiration, runoff and storage). This has important implications concerning the impact on the water balance of a change in surface cover brought about by a change in climate.

AB Terrestrial plant communities have the potential to respond to climate change rapidly, if dominant species are killed by a series of extreme events, or slowly, if the cumulative effects of shorter-term climate fluctuations result in longR term compositional change. We used pollen and charcoal records from a lake and a testate amoebae-derived history of water-table depth in a nearby peatland to assess the response of the jack pine-dominated forests of northwestern Wisconsin to the climate variability of the last similar to 2000 years. The hydrology record and the charcoal record indicate that the climate near Warner Lake over the last similar to 2000 years was characterized by multidecadal variation in moisture availability with no apparent multicentennial-long trends in moisture balance or fire frequency. However, the pollen record suggests that there were multicentennial-scale changes in the vegetation composition around Warner Lake. Direct comparison of the three proxy records is challenging, because of their differing temporal resolutions and the complexity of potential ecological responses to climate variability. Therefore, we developed an interpretive model to compare multiple simulated proxies under two scenarios of environmental variability in order to determine under what conditions apparently contradictory records are likely to be found. The interpretive model reveals that a record of multicentennial-long change in vegetation is possible if multidecadal climate variability interacts with ecological processes influencing the direction and magnitude of succession. Compositional changes in the Warner Lake pollen record could reflect longR term variation in temperature, seasonality or other climate factors independent of moisture balance; however it is also possible that multidecadal moisture variability interacted with ecological processes affecting recruitment and mortality of species following fires of varying size and severity. Decadal-scale climatic variability can lead to altered successional pathways and to changes in forest composition that last for centuries.

AB The reuse of organic wastes in agriculture is an appropriate method for environment management and providing nutrients to the plants. The objective of this study is to utilize possibility of agricultural waste as component of growing media and comparative evaluation of best potting media for flower production. The research was conducted at Floriculture Research Area, Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. There were total four treatments (garden soil, biochar + peat moss + leaf compost, leaf compost + soil, peanut shell compost + soil, rice straw + soil). Each treatment was replicated three times, having 10 plants each. Different agricultural waste materials such as leaf compost, peanut shell compost, rice straw and biochar were used as source for quality growth of Stock and Geranium. Physio-chemical analysis (N, P, K, pH, EC) were best in the growing media comprising biochar + peat moss + leaf compost. The experiment was arranged according to Completely Randomized Design (CRD) under factorial arrangement. The results regarding maximum plant height (57.4 cm), number of leaves per plant (62.5), root length (43.1 cm), number of flowers (31.6), flower diameter (4.8 cm), evapotranspiration rate (7.38 mol/m(2)/s), transpiration rate (46.4 mmol/m(2)/s) and leaf total chlorophyll contents (81.0 SPAD) were recorded in biochar + peat moss + leaf compost media while maximum leaf area (46.58 cm(2)), photosynthetic rate (2.11 mu mol m(2)/s), stomatal conductance (1.73 mol/m(2)/s), respiration rate (416.67), internal CO2 (375.67) and minimum days to first flower emergence (43.8) were observed in peanut shell + soil media. Statistically all the parameters were positively correlated with each other.

AB The Loess Plateau is the main source of water in Yellow River, China. After 1980s, the Yellow river water presented a significant reduction, what caused the decrease of the Yellow river discharge had been debated in academic circles. We proceeded with runoff generation mechanisms to explain this phenomenon. We built saturation excess runoff and infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms for rainfall-runoff simulation in Jingle sub-basin of Fen River basin on the Loess Plateau, to reveal the influence of land use change on flood processes and studied the changes of model parameters under different underlying conditions. The results showed that the runoff generation mechanism was mainly infiltration-excess overland flow, but the flood events of saturation-excess overland flow had an increasing trend because of land use cover change (the increase of forestland and grassland areas and the reduction of cultivated land). Some of the model parameters had physical significances,such as water storage capacity (WM), infiltration capacity (f), evapotranspiration (CKE), soil permeability coefficient (k) and index of storage capacity distribution curve (n) showed increasing trends, and index of infiltration capacity distribution curve (m) showed a decreasing trend. The above results proved the changes of runoff generation mechanism from the perspective of model parameters in Jingle sub-basin, which can provide a new perspective for understanding the discharge reduction in the Yellow River basin.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane flux were carried out in an arctic tundra landscape in the central Lena River Delta at 72 degrees N. The measurements covered the seasonal course of mid-summer to early winter in 2003 and early spring to mid-summer in 2004, including the periods of spring thaw and autumnal freeze back. The study site is characterized by very cold and deep permafrost and a continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of -14.7 degrees C. The surface is characterized by wet polygonal tundra, with a micro-relief consisting of raised moderately dry sites, depressed wet sites, polygonal ponds, and lakes. We found relatively low fluxes of typically 30 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) during mid-summer and identified soil temperature and near-surface atmospheric turbulence as the factors controlling methane emission. The influence of atmospheric turbulence was attributed to the high coverage of open water surfaces in the tundra. The soil thaw depth and water table position were found to have no clear effect on methane fluxes. The excess emission during spring thaw was estimated to be about 3% of the total flux measured during June-October. Winter emissions were modeled based on the functional relationships found in the measured data. The annual methane emission was estimated to be 3.15 g m(-2). This is low compared with values reported for similar ecosystems. Reason for this were thought to be the very low permafrost temperature in the study region, the sandy soil texture and low bio-availability of nutrients in the soils, and the high surface coverage of moist to dry micro-sites. The methane emission accounted for about 14% of the annual ecosystem carbon balance. Considering the global warming potential of methane, the methane emission turned the tundra into an effective greenhouse gas source.

AB [1] Mosses are an important component of the boreal forest, but little is known about their contribution to ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchange. We studied the role of mosses in boreal forest evapotranspiration by conducting two experiments in a black spruce forest in Fairbanks, Alaska. Moss evaporation was measured using lysimeters filled with Hylocomium splendens or Sphagnum capillifolium. Microclimate and moisture content were varied by placing the lysimeters in different habitats ( dense forest, open forest, bog), and by manipulating the water supply (no water, natural rainfall, water added). Moss evaporation rates between 1 June and 8 September averaged 0.3, 0.9, and 1.5 mm day(-1) in the dense forest (Hylocomium), open forest (Hylocomium and Sphagnum), and bog ( Sphagnum) respectively. Assuming a total forest evapotranspiration rate of 2 mm day(-1), this study shows that moss evaporation contributes considerably to boreal black spruce forest evapotranspiration. Moss evaporation rates depended strongly on the openness of the forest and to a lesser degree on the density of the vascular plant canopy and on moss species. The strong influence of habitat suggests that microclimate is the primary factor determining moss evaporation rates. Hylocomium evaporation reacted strongly to experimental water additions, indicating that precipitation frequency is an important factor in addition to microclimate for this species. The large moss evaporation rates in this study suggest a potential cooling effect of mosses, of Sphagnum in particular.

TI Evapotranspiration from a riparian fen wetland
SO NORDIC HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bowen ratio; energy balance; evapotranspiration; wetland
ID WATER; EVAPORATION; BALANCE; ENERGY
AB Evapotranspiration rates were measured in a riparian fen wetland dominated by vascular vegetation and surrounded by open agricultural areas and forests. The wetland is situated on a floodplain in central Denmark. Measurements were taken throughout the growing season (April-September) of 1999.
   Evapotranspiration rates were higher than those published for most other wetland types, with an average of 3.6 mm d(-1) during the growing season and a peak rate of 5.6 mm d(-1). Daily average evapotranspiration was 110% of Penman's potential open water evaporation.
   Evapotranspiration was the dominant sink in the energy balance of the wetland studied. During the day, evapotranspiration accounted for 82% of the available radiant energy, R-n. Due to the presence of deposited fine-grained sediments, soil-water availability was kept high at all times which resulted in moderate canopy resistances, r(c) (overall mean = 32 s m(-1)). Evapotranspiration was controlled by a combination of driving forces: R-n, saturation vapour pressure deficit, D, and r(c).
   It is hypothesized that the results presented in this study are conditioned by the proximity of the wetland to drier upland areas. During periods with high evaporative demand and low precipitation, warm, dry air is formed over the upland areas and wetland evapotranspiration rates are enhanced by local advection. Indicative evidence for the hypothesis is presented. Although the absolute magnitude of the results reported is only directly relevant to similar sites in Denmark, the processes and controls described are considered to be representative of riparian wetlands subjected to frequent flooding and/or with a high groundwater table, with vascular vegetation, and which are narrow corridors in open agricultural landscapes.

AB Thermokarst features, such as thaw ponds, are hotspots for methane emissions in warming lowland tundra. Presently we lack quantitative knowledge on the formation rates of thaw ponds and subsequent vegetation succession, necessary to determine their net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This study sets out to identify development trajectories and formation rates of small-scale (<100 m(2)), shallow arctic thaw ponds in north-eastern Siberia. We selected 40 ponds of different age classes based on a time-series of satellite images and measured vegetation composition, microtopography, water table, and thaw depth in the field and measured age of colonizing shrubs in thaw ponds using dendrochronology. We found that young ponds are characterized by dead shrubs, while older ponds show rapid terrestrialization through colonization by sedges andSphagnummoss. While dead shrubs and open water are associated with permafrost degradation (lower surface elevation, larger thaw depth), sites with sedge and in particularSphagnumdisplay indications of permafrost recovery. Recruitment ofBetula nanaonSphagnumcarpets in ponds indicates a potential recovery toward shrub-dominated vegetation, although it remains unclear if and on what timescale this occurs. Our results suggest that thaw ponds display potentially cyclic vegetation succession associated with permafrost degradation and recovery. Pond formation and initial colonization by sedges can occur on subdecadal timescales, suggesting rapid degradation and initial recovery of permafrost. The rates of formation and recovery of small-scale, shallow thaw ponds have implications for the greening/browning dynamics and carbon balance of this ecosystem.

AB Drought and heat events, such as the 2018 European drought, interact with the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere, potentially affecting albedo, sensible and latent heat fluxes, as well as CO(2)exchange. Each of these quantities may aggravate or mitigate the drought, heat, their side effects on productivity, water scarcity and global warming. We used measurements of 56 eddy covariance sites across Europe to examine the response of fluxes to extreme drought prevailing most of the year 2018 and how the response differed across various ecosystem types (forests, grasslands, croplands and peatlands). Each component of the surface radiation and energy balance observed in 2018 was compared to available data per site during a reference period 2004-2017. Based on anomalies in precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, we classified 46 sites as drought affected. These received on average 9% more solar radiation and released 32% more sensible heat to the atmosphere compared to the mean of the reference period. In general, drought decreased net CO(2)uptake by 17.8%, but did not significantly change net evapotranspiration. The response of these fluxes differed characteristically between ecosystems; in particular, the general increase in the evaporative index was strongest in peatlands and weakest in croplands. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018 severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'.

SO SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; COMMUNITIES; DYNAMICS; WETLANDS
AB Ecosystems dominated by Chamaeoparis thyoides (Atlantic White Cedar) are critically endangered due to hydrologic alterations associated with ditching, logging, development, and agricultural conversion. Few studies have related structural and functional characteristics of this plant community to water tables, yet hydrologic management options may be critical to establish a peat-based seed refugium and allow Atlantic White Cedar self-maintenance in this ecosystem. In this study, we assessed aboveground forest biomass, litter production, and depth to water table at a mature (60-70 v) and an intermediate (20-35 y) age-class stand in two national wildlife refuges. Alligator River (AR) and Great Dismal Swamp (DS) in North Carolina. We calculated forest biomass from morphometric data gathered within randomized study plots. We made monthly litter collections at each study plot from November 1998 to April 2000: litter was sorted by species and type for the first 112 months. Wells installed at each study plot recorded water-table levels, which were at or near the surface at AR but >30 cm below the soil surface at DS throughout the study. Although Atlantic White Cedar was a dominant species at all sites, community structure differed between refuges. Total aboveground biomass was similar among age classes; however, Atlantic White Cedar stem density was greater and mean diameter at breast height was lower at AR. Mean annual litter production was higher at AR sites for each age class despite a persistently high water table. We conclude that the rates of primary production associated with high water tables at AR represent favorable conditions for Atlantic White Cedar self-maintenance.

AB In this study, 10 years (1990-99) of summertime data collected at a representative sedge fen in the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) are used to investigate the energy and water balance dynamics of subarctic wetlands. The summertime climatic characteristics at the study site during the 10 year study period are also examined. It is shown that mean cumulative summertime precipitation P-avg for the study decade closely approximates the 30 year mean P(av)g. However, the mean summertime air temperature T-avg for the study decade is 1 degreesC higher than the 30 year mean T-avg.
   To examine the energy and water balance dynamics at the study site, the variation in each of their respective components throughout the study decade is considered. Little variation is observed in cumulative summertime net radiation Q(cum)* and cumulative summertime ground heat flux Q(Gcum),m; however, substantial year-to-year variation is evident in cumulative summertime water deficit WDcum, cumulative summertime precipitation P-cum, cumulative summertime sensible heat flux Q(Hcum), and cumulative summertime latent heat flux Q(Ecum). It is noted that the variability in Q(Ecum) is particularly significant because it consumes the largest proportion of the available summertime energy, and is the largest component of the summertime water balance at this subarctic wetland.
   Past research has suggested that Q*, P, and T have the most influence on summertime Q(E) at high-latitude wetlands. To test this hypothesis at our study sited Q(Ecum), P-cum, T-avg and Q(cum)* from each year in the study decade were examined. It is observed that high Q(Ecum) is associated with high P-cum, T-avg and Q(cum)* , and that low Q(Ecum) is associated with low P-cum and T-avg. To identify the hydroclimatological variables that are most responsible for controlling Q(Ecum) dynamics at the sedge fen, a stepwise linear regression was performed. This analysis indicates that P-cum and Q(cum)* are the most u important hydroclimatological controls over Q(Ecum). However, it is demonstrated that the variability in P-cum is more responsible than the variability in Q(cum)* for the variability in Q(Ecum) during the study decade because of its higher coefficient of variation. The results of this study have broader applicability to wetlands in other parts of the subarctic ecoregion, including the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB). For example, past studies have shown similarities in the energy balance regimes at wetland sites from the HBL and MRB. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB High-latitude warming has led to radical changes in abiotic conditions influencing forest growth. In the North American boreal forest, widespread declines in forest productivity (particularly in western regions) and changing climate-growth relationships have been documented. Previous studies have proposed that this decline can be attributed to drought stress as increasing temperatures may cause evapotranspirative demand to exceed available moisture. We used tree ring studies to document growth dynamics of black spruce, one of the most dominant boreal tree species, in a boreal peatland experiencing rapid permafrost thaw. We specifically look at how changing permafrost conditions influence growth. Growth of black spruce at this site has declined steadily since the mid-1900s and exhibited a shift from positive responses to temperature pre-1970 to predominantly negative responses in recent decades, despite precipitation increasing over time at this site. Our results show that there is no apparent effect of landscape position or rate of lateral permafrost thaw on growth trends of black spruce, despite gradients in soil moisture and active layer thickness across the mosaic of wetlands and drier permafrost plateaus at this site. However, this does not imply no effect of permafrost thaw on growth; our results support growing evidence that vertical permafrost thaw (i.e., active layer thickening) is causing drought stress in these slow-growing, shallow-rooted trees. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate permafrost as a driver of within-site variability in growth-climate responses, and we provide insight into the widespread growth declines and divergence of climate-growth relationships in high-latitude forests.

AB In boreal forested wetlands. the observed increase in the water table level after clearcutting (watering-up) is often a threat to sustained ecosystem productivity. Hydrologic recovery refers to file processes by which a water table progressively drops back to its initial level after the cut. In eastern Canada, drainage is Used operationally after clearcutting wet sites ill Order to lower the water table level and accelerate hydrologic recovery. The objective of this study was to evaluate (the duration Of (the v,watering-up caused by timber harvesting and the extent to which drainage affected the water table recovery on five peatlands and three hydromorphic mineral sites located ill the St. Lawrence Lowlands of Quebec (Canada). The mixed wood stands studied are dominated by balsam fir (Abies balasamea (L.) Mill.). eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.). and red maple (Acer rubrum L). Results indicate that. 10 years after clearcutting, water table levels in undrained plots are still 5 to 7 cm higher than the pre-cut levels. The slight recovery in water table level plateaued after the third year. Rainfall interception by vegetation was also monitored. and after 10 years had reached nearly 50% of the pre-cut rate. The immediate water table drawdown following drainage mitigated watering-up within 40 m of a ditch. The persistent watering-up observed in this study should encourage using sylvicultureal systems adapted to boreal forested wetlands in order 10 prevent productivity loss and stand conversion.

AB Subirrigation is a closed system which recirculates nutrient solution and reduces water and nutrient improper disposal in soils and groundwater. The system is used commercially by the ornamental industry. However, technical information regarding substrate moisture retention in subirrigation still scarce. Our study evaluated the effect of different water heights and irrigation time on volumetric water content (VWC) of commercial substrates in subirrigation. We tested five water heights (1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 cm), five irrigation times (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min), and three commercial substrates (coconut coir, pine bark with vermiculite, and peat moss with carbonized rice hulls without ashes and vermiculite), arranged in a complete randomized design (factorial 5x5x3), with three replications. We used 55-cm(3) cone-shaped containers divided into three 4.16-cm equal layers (top, middle, and bottom) to study the water capillary action dynamics. All substrates presented a large range of VWC across the container layers (p<0.0001). The substrate moisture varied according to the water height (r(2)>0.9), with little or no influence of the irrigation time. The middle layer provided the best moisture indication among treatments, with moisture ranging from 0.29 to 0.61 m(3)/m(3) in coconut coir, 0.29 to 0.63 m(3)/m(3) in pine bark, and 0.24 to 0.56 m(3)/m(3) in peat moss with carbonized rice hulls. The water height of 4 cm with any irrigation time for coconut coir and peat moss, and the water height of 2 cm and irrigation time of 10 or 20 min for pine bark resulted in the moisture range recommended for most crops (0.4 m(3)/m(3)). The understanding of capillary action dynamics in subirrigation allows the optimization of water heights and irrigation time to apply water efficiently to meet the crop evapotranspiration.

AB The decomposition of cellulose strips in relation to climatic variables was studied in a wide range of forested sites with minimal anthropogenic influence. The 22 study sites located in four catchments (61 degrees-69 degrees N in Finland) had stands composed of varying proportions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and deciduous species (mainly Betula spp.). The cellulose strips were placed both on and buried in the forest floor of upland and peatland sites for two 1-year periods and the weight loss measured. The decomposition data from all plots had the highest correlations with evaporation of canopy intercepted water, actual transpiration and actual evapotranspiration out of the 17 climatic variables studied. These variables (calculated using SOIL-model) incorporate the effects of climate and vegetation. The decomposition in the Scots pine dominated upland plots was additionally well related to the temperature variables of the frost-free period (May-September mean temperature, temperature sum, soil temperature and July mean temperature) and the number of frost days. Some of the correlations between decomposition and climatic variables are among the highest reported for boreal forests (up to r = 0.98, p < 0.001). The nutrients of litterfall were also measured. The weight loss of the cellulose strips, the evaporation of canopy intercepted water and the actual transpiration correlated positively to litterfall amounts of N and P. The same parameters correlated negatively to the litterfall C/N ratio. The results emphasize the need to consider vegetation when effects of climatic factors on decomposition are being studied in boreal forests.

AB Seasonal fluctuating water tables are common in sandy coastal plain soils, but their role in soil organic carbon dynamics is uncertain. Seasonal saturation influences biogeochemical processes that affect fate of organic matter and metals. A column study was conducted to test hypotheses that shallow water table (SWT) fluctuations reduce CO2 loss (H1), increase leaching of dissolved organic C (DOC) and metals (Al and Fe) (H2), and result in greater net soil C storage (H3).
   The A- and E-horizon material of moderately well-drained sandy soils from five sites was collected for the study. Ten columns (two per site) of 90-cm height were packed to a thickness of 60 cm with E-horizon material, above which was packed 15 cm of A-horizon material from the same soil. Five columns were subjected to SWT treatments and five to deep water table (DWT) treatments. Upward CO2 flux was measured using a NaOH (1 M) trap. Metal and DOC-C concentrations in leachates and in water sampled at the surface of columns were measured. Soil samples from the columns were collected by depth at 5-6-cm increments and tested for total and organic C, metals, and < 50-mu m material distribution by WT treatment.
   Upward flux of CO2 was significantly less for SWT treatment. Higher DOC (for all events) and Fe concentrations (for first 18 days) were measured in SWT leachates as compared to DWT. Metal- and C concentrations were correlated (P < 0.0001) for surface pore water samples of SWT but not for DWT. Net loss of C was significantly less under SWT condition. Results indicate significant water-table effects on magnitude and direction of C flux (solution or gaseous) and < 50-mu m particle distribution for sandy coastal plain soils materials.
   Changes in water table depth can potentially alter not only net soil C storage but also the proportion of C converted to CO2 versus DOC. Differences in the proportion would have consequences for C dynamics in ecosystems dominated by soils with fluctuating water tables such as occur extensively in the coastal plain of the SE USA and elsewhere.

AB The residual signals of the physical and chemical processes undergone in a river basin are stored in the isotopic composition of river water and are used here to isolate and quantify fluxes of water, energy and carbon for a large boreal river basin. The integrated nature of the river signal is exploited to provide meaningful basin-wide annual averages for fluxes difficult to quantify and extrapolate by studying highly variable interface exchanges at discrete locations. The slope of the linear regression of deuterium (delta D) and oxygen (delta(18)O) isotopes for the Ottawa River is similar to 6.0, considerably less than the slope of the local meteoric water line (7.7). This discrepancy is a consequence of evaporative loss from open water bodies and soils and, through a new method, is calculated to be 8.1% of annual precipitation. As well, on the basis of thirty years of daily meteorological and discharge data, annual evapotranspiration for the Ottawa River basin is calculated to be 53.1%. Combining the evaporation and evapotranspiration calculations apportions 45% of the water losses to transpiration. The energy required to drive these cycles is calculated to be 8% of annual solar radiation for total evapotranspiration and 13% of growing season solar radiation for transpiration. These energies are transformed into latent heat. The water use efficiency ratio is used to estimate total fixation of carbon (gross primary production (GPP)) for the basin at 15.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1). This rate is substantially greater than the export of carbon via rivers plus rates estimated for carbon respiration in the literature, indicating that the boreal forest is a plausible component of the postulated "missing" carbon sink. Comparison of accumulation rates of C in peatlands and the rates required to account for the missing sink suggest that peat accumulation rates are similar to 20 times too slow to account for the missing sink flux. Speculatively, the living biomass of the boreal forest is the dominant sink. Accepting this, the respiration rate needed for a steady state balance between the calculated boreal forest GPP and the missing global carbon sink is found to be around 5.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1).

AB Water and nutrient budgets were constructed for 13 low-lying peat polders in the Netherlands that varied in elevation relative to sea level (-0.2 to -2.4 m below sea level), land use (7-70% of the total polder area covered by agriculture; largely dairy farming), and surface water prevalence (6-43%). Water balances were verified with chloride budgets and accepted when both met the criterion (total inflows - total outflows)/(total inflows) < 0.05. Apart from precipitation and evapotranspiration (overall means 913 vs. 600 mm), in- and outlet (171 vs. 420 mm) as well as in- and outward seepage (137 vs. 174 mm) were important items in the water budgets. Nutrient budgets, however, were dominated by terms related to agricultural land use (similar to 60% of all inputs, 90% of N-removal and 80% of P removal) rather than water fluxes (8% and 5% of N and P inputs; 6 and 18% of outputs). After agriculture (200 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), mineralisation of the peat soil and atmospheric deposition appear to be important inputs (about 94 and 21 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Major output terms were agricultural output (209 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and denitrification (95 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The average N budget was in balance (difference similar to 1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), whereas P accumulated in most polders, particularly those under agriculture. The mean P surplus (15 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) in the 9 mainly agricultural polders) corresponds well with the accumulated difference observed elsewhere (700 kg P ha(-1) in the upper 50 cm in a nature reserve versus 1400 under agriculture) after over 50 years of dairy farming. Bulk retention of N and P in these polders is taking place in the peat soil, through temporary sorption to the matrix and N is lost through denitrification. In a principal components analysis combining land use, landscape pattern, water balance and nutrient budget terms, the three-first principal components explained 63% of the variability. The first component (PC) correlated strongly with the percentage of land under agriculture (r = 0.82) and negatively with the percentage covered by surface water (r = -0.74). Most input and output terms of the nitrogen budget also correlated with this PC. The second PC covaried distinctly with the total area of a polder (r = -0.79) and human population density at municipality level (r = 0.75). Phosphorus loads in inlet and outlet water correlated with this PC. This suggests that the variability in nutrient budgets among polders is largely governed by agricultural land use.

AB In a field study of 43 Finnish landfills, hydrogeological site conditions were characterized, and toxic substances in ground water were analyzed at 16 sites. The concentrations of several main leachate components, harmful substances and AOX in nearfield ground water were elevated above background values. However, the concentrations of most micropollutants were dominated by small values, causing skewed and truncated frequency distributions. Frequently abundant contaminants included some heavy metals, particularly Zn (median concentration 80 mug L-1), dichloromethane (18) and 1,2-dichloroethane (26). The variation in the concentrations of many contaminants was large (CV > 200%). The concentration ranges generally overlapped with those in other Finnish landfill investigations, but were below many foreign results. Some substances were less prominent in ground water than in leachate, reflecting subsurface retention and removal. The geological formations surrounding the waste deposits commonly include moraines and moors, and the shallow soils are dominated by glacial tills and peat. In eskers more porous and permeable differentiated soils occur. The range of laboratory K(c) values was 10(-3.5) to 10(-8.5) ms-1, with considerable areal variation. Ground water is at most sites rapidly discharged to surface from the small aquifers. Locally more widespread subsurface contamination is possible due to greater conductivities or flow regimes, depending on attenuation factors. The concentration of especially inorganic substances exceeded drinking water norms, mostly by a factor of < 10 and maximally 400 (Fe). The overall health risks caused by the observed ground water contaminant distributions are deemed relatively minor, due e.g. to limited ground water use, but are locally more significant, involve uncertainties and require further study and caution.

AB In order to better address the feedbacks between climate and wetland methane (CH4) emissions, we tested several mechanistic improvements to the wetland CH4 emission model Peatland-VU with a longer Arctic data set than any other model: (1) inclusion of an improved hydrological module, (2) incorporation of a gross primary productivity (GPP) module, and (3) a more realistic soil-freezing scheme.
   A long time series of field measurements (2003-2010) from a tundra site in northeastern Siberia is used to validate the model, and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology is used to test the sensitivity of model parameters.
   Peatland-VU is able to capture both the annual magnitude and seasonal variations of the CH4 flux, water table position, and soil thermal properties. However, detailed daily variations are difficult to evaluate due to data limitation. Improvements due to the inclusion of a GPP module are less than anticipated, although this component is likely to become more important at larger spatial scales because the module can accommodate the variations in vegetation traits better than at plot scale.
   Sensitivity experiments suggest that the methane production rate factor, the methane plant oxidation parameter, the reference temperature for temperature-dependent decomposition, and the methane plant transport rate factor are the most important parameters affecting the data fit, regardless of vegetation type. Both wet and dry vegetation cover are sensitive to the minimum water table level; the former is also sensitive to the runoff threshold and open water correction factor, and the latter to the subsurface water evaporation and evapotranspiration correction factors.
   These results shed light on model parameterization and future improvement of CH4 modelling. However, high spatial variability of CH4 emissions within similar vegetation/soil units and data quality prove to impose severe limits on model testing and improvement.

AB In order to evaluate the stomatal control on the canopy evapotranspiration, diurnal variations in stomatal conductance (g(s)) of individual plants and bulk surface conductance (G(s)) of the canopy were measured independently in the Sarobetsu mire of northern Japan. During July-August 1993 and 1994, g(s) was measured for four species (Sasa palmata, Moliniopsis japonica, Myrica gale L. var. tomentosa and Ilex crenata var. paludosa) growing in the mire. In July and August 1995, G(s) was determined using Penman-Monteith equation. In this equation, evapotranspiration rate was determined by the Bowen ratio/energy balance method. Diurnal hysteresis curves of g(s) in relation to leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (nu) followed different courses from day to day according to the magnitude of nu, and daily maximum g(s) was correlated negatively with daily maximum nu except for Ilex crenata var. paludosa. Similar clockwise hysteresis curves were observed between G(s) and Vapor pressure deficit at the mean evaporative surface (D-0), and daily maximum G(s) decreased with daily maximum D-0 in midsummer. In particular, on days when daily maximum D-0 increased up to 1.9 kPa, the large decrease in G(s) decreased the evapotranspiration rate, despite high irradiance levels. Thus, stomatal control by individual plant leaves strongly affects evapotranspiration from the canopy and prevents excessive water loss on days when vapor pressure deficit is high, even when soil water is plentiful. On the rising limb of the diurnal course of the transpiration rate (T-r), increases in T-r with change in nu, Delta T-r/Delta nu varied from day to day, in particular for M. gale L. var, tomentosa. Further, a negative relationship was found between Delta T-r/Delta nu and the rate of increase of nu for unit change in time. We believe that the change of the daily course of g(s) and T-r was caused by the response of stomata to the increased rate of change of nu. Thus, in order to predict the diurnal variation of g(s), the magnitude and tendency of nu for each day must be considered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the simulation of a succession of annual hydro-periods describing water table variations in a British floodplain wetland, Narborough Bog. This is achieved through the application of a model, developed using MODFLOW, which requires inputs of weekly precipitation, evapotranspiration and river stage. The model reproduces the observed temporal variation in the wetland water tables illustrating the range in water table conditions experienced by the wetland, their relationship to hydrometeorological conditions, and the seasonal and annual variability in the wetland water budget. The model also estimates defuse water fluxes such as seepage flows to and from the adjacent river. The model simulations demonstrate the importance of successful representation of the stratigraphy of alluvial and organic deposits within the wetland. Model performance is evaluated for 2 years: 1991 and 1992 during a period of field instrumentation. The model is then used to reproduce the wetland hydroperiod for further 6 years: 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1987 and 1988 when local data for precipitatio, evapotranspiration and river stage are available. The results indicate how the wetland responds to a combination of hydrological events and emphasise the importance of percipitation-both weekly totals and its annual distribution. The model simulations reveal the importance of the water storage function of the wetland and indicate the varying relationship of the wetland to the lowland river: at low flows the river represents a base level to which the wetland water table grades. Conversely, for small periods of time wetland water tables are elevated by the effects of marginal silt-clay levee adjacent to the riverbank. Conditions of influent seepage from river to wetland were experienced only on isolated occasions. Such results demonstrate the benefits of floodplain wetlands in moderating extremes of river flow and demonstrating the need for rivers and floodplain wetland to remain closely integrated.

AB The Canadian Land Surface Scheme is employed in off-line tests to represent a 1200 km(2) patch of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study Northern Study Area, a heterogeneous region of boreal forest in north-central Manitoba. The soils in the region vary from rapidly draining coarse sand to poorly drained areas of peat overlying clay, including wetlands. Observed surface fluxes from four sites, a young jack pine stand, an old jack pine stand, an old black spruce stand and a FEN, are scaled by proportional weighting to represent the study area. The performance of the mosaic approach, in which the region has been represented by four distinct patches, is compared with that of the aggregated approach, in which mean surface parameters have been defined based on fractional coverage. Various soil columns are employed in the aggregated approach, in order to assess the effects of representing the heterogeneous soils of the region in a single column.
   While the conservative water use at all of the sites limits the effects of changes in the soil column on the turbulent fluxes, important effects are noted. Soil evaporation is overestimated when an organic or composite soil layer is represented at the surface, and underestimated when a sandy soil column is represented. Soil evaporation can be calibrated to match that of the mosaic method, however, the need for more robust methods of accomplishing this is acknowledged. The process of aggregating the soil column eliminates the dry sandy zones which experience periods of moisture stress. This results in periods of increased canopy conductance and an overestimation of the latent heat flux. A 2-patch mosaic, with one patch consisting of sandy soil and the other patch of organic soil over clay, allows moisture stress to occur and produces modelled half-hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes that agree more closely to those of the 4-patch mosaic than any of the aggregated runs, across the range of hydrometeorological variables. Throughout the course of the model runs presented here, the 2-patch mosaic also exhibits cumulative drainage and evapotranspiration closer to that of the 4-patch mosaic than any of the aggregated soil columns.

AB Measurements, made at a high subarctic, maritime, wetland tundra site, are presented for three different growing seasons. These are divided into hot-dry, normal-dry and normal-wet years and the behaviour of their surface energy and water balances is examined within the framework of a combination model. For periods of comparable energy availability, evapotranspiration during hot-dry conditions can be larger than during cooler and wetter periods. This results from small stomatal resistance in the sparse canopy of well-rooted sedges, and from the ability of peat soils to supply water under conditions of large atmospheric demand. This demand is expressed in terms of the vapour pressure deficit and it counteracts the large surface resistances which develop during dry periods. In many respects, the energy balance of a subarctic wetland tundra is comparable to observations and models for temperate agricultural and forest lands, in spite of the fact that the soils are organic, the vegetation canopy is sparse and there is continuous permafrost. A dry year promotes deeper thaw depths in the permafrost soils, during the growing season, than does a wet one. This is due to larger ground heat fluxes and larger soil thermal diffusivities. We concluded that maritime, wetland tundra, growing on peat soils, displays feedback mechanisms, which can offset the effects of moisture stress, caused by summer climate warming of a similar magnitude to that simulated by General Circulation Models for a 2 X CO2 scenario.

AB Campbell Island, which is 600 km south of New Zealand, has the southernmost tree line in this ocean sector. Directly under the maximum of the westerlies, the island is sensitive to changes in wind strength and direction. Pollen records from three peat cores spanning the tree line ecotone provide a 17,000-year history of vegetation change, temperature, and site moisture. With postglacial warming, tundra was replaced by tussock grassland 12,500 years ago. A subsequent increase of shrubland was reversed at 10,500 years ago and wetland-grassland communities became dominant. Around 9000 years ago, trees spread, with maximum tree line elevation reached around 6500 to 3000 years ago. This sequence is out of step with Southern Ocean sea surface temperatures, which were warmer than 12,500 to 9000 years ago, and, subsequently, cooled. Campbell Island tree lines were decoupled from temperature trends in the adjacent ocean by weaker westerlies from 12,500 to 9000 years ago, which leads to the intrusion of warmer, cloudier northern airmasses. This reduced solar radiation and evapotranspiration while increasing atmospheric humidity and substrate wetness, which suppressed tree growth. Cooler, stronger westerlies in the Holocene brought clearer skies, drier air, increased evapotranspiration, and rising tree lines. Future global warming will not necessarily lead to rising tree lines in oceanic regions.

AB Neotropical savannas exhibit unique patterns of diversity of plant and animal life that are poorly understood. Effective conservation of these often imperiled ecosystems requires a basic understanding of species occurrence as well as the site-specific factors that influence plant community composition. This study focuses on the savanna flora of the island of Utila, Bay Islands, Honduras. Compositional trends were assessed across multiple environmental gradients including surface hydrology, microtopography, nutrient levels and pH using Braun-Blanquet cover abundance in a stratified systematic sampling design. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and non-parametric multiplicative regression were applied to identify community types and to model species' responses to environmental gradients. We separated habitats into three basic types: sedge meadow, Blechnum-Cladium parkland and woody hammock. Compositional gradients along ordination axes were highly correlated with depth of the water table, pH and conductivity. Disturbance history, especially time since fire, was also linked to an indirect gradient. Some species - notably Acoelorrhaphe wrightii and Chrysobalanus icaco - are generalists, and their distributions may reflect past disturbance. Microtopography was critical in determining distribution for a suite of species that occurred only on mound formations in areas subject to prolonged inundation during the rainy season. Disturbance, particularly by hurricanes and fire, may promote within-habitat diversity; for example, the exposed lignotubers and rhizomes of trees killed by saline inundation provide habitat for less flood-tolerant species in wet areas, while burned clones of A. wrightii and surrounding peat areas permit colonization by many herbaceous species. Pair-wise floristic comparisons between Utila and eight other neotropical savannas revealed fewer than half of the 40 savanna species found on Utila were present in any other site. Two species of Cyperaceae, Fuirena scirpoidea and Rhynchospora tracyi, are new records for Honduras.

AB When considering hydrological export pathways from drained pastoral fields, the shallow groundwater underlying the artificial drainage system may fulfil an as important role as the artificial drainage system itself. However, the important split between artificial drainage and groundwater flows at a field site is usually unknown. Consequently, the effects that the groundwater system's redox status may have on the forms and total amounts of nitrogen (N) exported from the site cannot be confidently assessed. We addressed these deficiencies by investigating the export of various forms of N in the artificial drainage and the shallow groundwater beneath two dairy farming sites (Tatuanui, Waharoa) within the Piako River catchment in New Zealand.
   Due to the very low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the saturated zone perched on a clay aquiclude, no significant water or contaminants were exported at Tatuanui via the unconfined shallow groundwater. Accordingly, artificial drainage discharge into the receiving surface collector drain was the only export pathway for N at this site. The sealed nature of the groundwater zone resulted in the accumulation of organic-N and ammonium-N in the peaty shallow saturated zone underlying the mineral soil. In contrast, the Waharoa site featured a more mobile shallow groundwater system, which on average conveyed approximately equal volumes of water offsite as the artificial drainage system.
   Nitrate (NO3-N) was at both sites the predominant form of N (76%) leached from the aerobic soil profile and discharged through the artificial drainage. As the shallow groundwater was at both sites in a reduced redox state, any NO3-N leached from the rootzone into the saturated zone was consumed. Accordingly, even the mobile shallow groundwater at Waharoa did not convey significant NO3-N. The NO3-N consumption in the reduced groundwater presumably occurred due to dissimilatory NO3-N reduction (concomitant increases in ammonium-N concentrations, with no organic material available for mineralisation in the saturated zone) and microbial denitrification (producing gaseous forms of N). The NO3-N reductions in the groundwater resulted in the average total N exports via the shallow groundwater pathway at the Waharoa site being substantially lower (31% of the exported N) than in the artificial drainage (69%). This is despite both pathways exporting similar water volumes. Because of the NO3-N consumption in the reduced shallow groundwater at Waharoa, over 98% of the N exported through this pathway was either as ammonium-N or organic-N.

AB Paramo soils store high amounts of organic carbon. However, the effects of climate change and changes in land cover and use (LC/LU) in this high-elevation tropical ecosystem may cause a decrease in their carbon storage capacity. Therefore, better understanding of the factors influencing the Paramo soils' carbon storage and export is urgently needed. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the soil water of four LC/LU types (tussock grass, natural forest, pine plantations, and pasture) and the factors controlling its variability in the Quinuas Ecohydrological Observatory in south Ecuador. Weekly measurements of soil water DOC concentrations, meteorological variables, soil water content, and temperature from various depths and slope positions were monitored within the soils' organic and mineral horizons between October 2014 and January 2017. These data were used to generate regression trees and random forest statistical models to identify the factors controlling soil water DOC concentrations. From high to low concentrations, natural forest depict the highest DOC concentrations followed by pasture, tussock grass, and pine forest. For all LC/LU types, DOC concentrations increase with decreasing soil moisture. Our results also show that LC/LU is the most important predictor of soil water DOC concentrations, followed by sampling depth and soil moisture. Interestingly, atmospheric variables and antecedent evapotranspiration and precipitation conditions show only little influence on DOC concentrations during the monitoring period. Our findings provide unique information that can help improve the management of soil and water resources in the Paramo and other peat dominated ecosystems elsewhere.

AB Coconut coir dust amended in substrate had effects on water use and some growth in potted marigolds (Tagetes erecta 'Antigua Yellow'). This study was performed to clarify the effect of coir dust amended in substrate media on water use efficiency and nutrient leaching in potted marigold. 'Antigua Yellow' seeds were sown in peat moss to develop 2 pairs of true leaf, then seedlings were randomly transplanted into 15 cm plastic pots containing soilless mix media (40% rice husk charcoal, 20% rice husk, 20% sand and 20% compost leaves; by volume) and followed by coconut coir dust amended treatments with 0, 25, 50 and 75% (v/v). The results exhibited that all amended coconut treatments could improve the physical properties of mix media by decreasing the estimated bulk density, but increased the total porosity (A) and water filled pore (A). Fifty percent con-dust treatment seems to reduce accumulated El', crops evapotranspiration (ETc) and transpiration per leaf area unit per day. Hence, 50% coir dust portion gave the highest water use efficiency (WHE) and the lowest crop co-efficient (Kc) parameter. Nevertheless, 75% coir dust portion also reduced some nutrient leachate in the runoff solution; nitrate (NO3) leachate at early growth stage and phosphate leachate (PO43-) at flowering and senescence. Positive correlation was observed between total leachate volume and total phosphate concentration leachate (R= 0.98). Almost all plant growth parameters had diverse responses during the comparison of each different coconut con dust portion, but flowering yield (total FW and total number) wrere prone to be promoted by 75% coir dust treatment.

AB This paper presents eddy covariance measurements of evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux in wetland area. The rate of evapotranspiration is characterized by a distinct seasonal pattern and assumes the highest values during summer. From April to September, the latent heat flux is characterized by a distinct diurnal pattern with the highest average values (at the noon hours) at a level of ca 200 W center dot m(-2). Moreover, in the period from June to August the values of latent heat flux far outweigh those of sensible heat flux (the Bowen ratio in the noon hours ranging between 0.4 and 0.6) and account for 50-60 % of radiation balance. The average daily totals of evapotranspiration vary from about 0.5 mm center dot d(-1) during the winter months to about 3-3.5 mm center dot d(-1) in summer.

AB [ 1] A fully coupled, integrated surface water/groundwater model was used to study hydrologic controls on lake-groundwater interaction in the subhumid, Boreal Plains of northern Alberta, Canada. Findings from a previous water budget study indicate that lakes on the outwash landscape capture groundwater as a major source of water input and function as evaporation windows. Transient hydrologic responses of a flow-through style lake and outwash groundwater flow system were simulated for a three-dimensional model. Hydraulic heads, surface water depth, and the corresponding exchange fluxes between the surface and the subsurface were all simulated simultaneously and compared to field observations for the summers of 2002 and 2003. Replication of the transient flow regime required an anisotropy ratio of 10: 1 for the outwash deposits and inclusion of riparian peatlands, which control lake-groundwater interaction and maintain surface water on permeable northern landscapes. Spatially and temporally variable evapotranspiration governed the water table configuration and lake-groundwater seepage patterns.

AB Water and heat transport is the focus of hydrological research in seasonal frost areas. Considering Sanjiang Plain as the study area, this study explored the influence of land use change on soil water and heat transport and the future trend of surface water and heat transport. The effects of land use change on soil water and heat transport were revealed using observation data from the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from the period of May 2016 to May 2017. The analysis found evident changes in the water and heat status of different land use types. During conversion from uplands to paddy fields, the surface soil moisture content increased, evapotranspiration increased by approximately 20%, surface infiltration decreased by about 50%, and surface heat flux increased. In a future climate change scenario, the change trend of soil water and heat condition was roughly consistent with the present situation, and the proportion of evapotranspiration of upland and paddy fields in precipitation decreased to 40% and 55%, respectively. These results can provide a theoretical basis for the rational utilization of land and water resources in Sanjiang Plain.

AB The water management of shallow water table sites is often the subject of discussion between distinct interest groups. Different stakeholders typically demand different target groundwater levels. Achieving a suitable compromise is facilitated by sound knowledge about the impacts that water tables have on the water budget components. We used groundwater lysimeters to analyse the effects of increased target groundwater levels in early spring on the development of the water budget components during the vegetation period from April to September. Higher water tables resulted in an increase of evapotranspiration. The additionally stored water buffered the effect of higher evapotranspiration - yet not for the whole vegetation period but only for some weeks. Variations of the meteorological conditions during the investigation period from 2014 to 2017, especially periods with extreme precipitation, were more decisive for the water budget and water table behaviour than the increased spring target groundwater levels. Higher water tables led in the medium and long term to changes in the vegetation composition. The altered vegetation affected the hydrological processes and was the main reason why evapotranspiration values increased.

AB The surface energy balance of a high-elevation groundwater-fed wetland (High Creek Fen) in central Colorado was measured from 9 June 2000 through 18 January 2005. In agreement with observations and predictions for decreased winter snow cover in the region, the low snow cover in 2001-2002 allowed for an examination of the impact of winter drought on the wetland. During years with an average snowpack, summer evaporation far exceeded precipitation. Despite near-normal summer precipitation following a winter drought, the summertime surface energy balance was affected with decreased latent heat fluxes and increased sensible heat fluxes. The leaf area index and the fraction of photosynthetic radiation absorbed were reduced following the winter drought. A shift in the primary controls on evaporation occurred as the surface's response to vapor pressure deficits and soil moisture increased following the winter drought. The earlier snowmelt coupled with earlier increase in soil temperature and moisture following winter drought did not increase evaporation, since vegetation was not yet developed, and evaporation from soil water was low during the early spring period.

AB Silurian organic-rich black shales are widespread and serve as basic source for most U mineralization throughout the entire Variscan Orogen of Central and Western Europe. In particular the lowermost unit of Silurian black shales is regionally strongly enriched in U. The strong U-enrichment of these shales is the result of the Hirnantian glaciation that removed old near-surface rocks that already had lost most leachable U during long-lasting alteration and brought rocks with leachable U to the surface. Sea level rise due to the melting of the Hirnantian ice sheet inundated the glacially modeled continent margin and resulted in regionally restricted oceanic circulation and anoxic conditions that are related to both low initial oxygen levels and sudden increase of organic production. Organic-rich shales on the Gondwana shelf developed particularly high U content as they scavenged U from the surface runoff that was leached after deglaciation from the newly exposed drainage area.
   The present spatial distribution of Silurian U-rich black shales within the Varisan orogenic belt is largely controlled by large-scale tectonic processes operating during the approach and eventual collision of Gondwana and Laurussia, leading to the formation of western Pangea. During the Variscan orogeny, these U-anomalous rocks became stacked and folded at the margins of some low-strain domains of the orogenic belt and exposed to metamorphism and in part to crustal melting - contributing to the formation of U-fertile post-kinematic granites in the high-strain domains of the orogenic belt. There are no U deposits that are directly related to the emplacement of these granites. Variscan granites, however, are the most important source of leachable U for younger, major U mineralization. Late-Variscan reorganization of the plate movement between Gondwana and Laurussia resulted in an extensional tectonic regime throughout Europe with important Permian sedimentary basins. Heat input and fluid migration along Permian fault zones resulted in the formation of episyenite-bound and vein-type U mineralization in the Variscan basement, whereby U was leached from granites and Silurian sedimentary rocks and their metamorphic equivalents and was deposited in local episyenite and vein-type mineralization (e.g., districts of Aue-Niederschlema, Jachymov, Pribram, Forez, and Salamanca).
   Late-Variscan erosion of the orogenic belt resulted in the redistribution of U from Variscan metamorphic rocks and granites, but also the Silurian black shales, into late Carboniferous and Permian sedimentary basins. Permian mobilization of fault zones controled the availability of U-rich source rocks for leaching, the transport of U into the basins, and the distribution of organic-rich sediments that may trap U in organic-rich layers (e.g., Millen, Lodeve). The Permian U redistribution represents the major deposit-forming event throughout Variscan Europe, whereby hydrothermal U mineralization in episyenites and veins in the Variscan basement and low-temperature U mineralization in sandstones and organic-rich sediments are different expressions of the same tectonic process, i.e., the development of the Central European Extensional Province. Later tectonic reactivations of these fault zones during the opening of the Tethys and North Atlantic oceans and during the Alpine Orogeny mainly resulted in the local redistribution of U mineralization along the same fault zones at c. 180 Ma, 150 Ma, and 120 Ma, and more recently during the Alpine orogeny, in part with addition of other metals (e.g., Ag, Bi, Co, Ni, As) leached from the local wall rocks.
   Post-Permian intense chemical weathering, mostly in the Triassic and the Cretaceous, resulted in (i) U redistribution and additional U concentration within near-surface mineralization (e.g., Ronneburg, Aue-Niederschlema), (ii) leaching from near-surface U-rich rocks followed by entrapment in sediments to form lignite-type (e.g., black shales, peats) and roll-type mineralization (e.g., Konigstein), and (iii) the dispersion of U in the supergene environment.
   The rocks of the Variscan belt host a history of more than 400 Ma of U redistribution, starting with the deposition of early Silurian U-rich black shales. The formation of these black shales is climatically controlled. Their spatial distribution eventually controls the spatial distribution of younger mineralization that is generally closely related with the tectonic development and reactivation of the basement and the redistribution by magmatic, hydrothermal, and erosional processes. Basement faults are pathways for fluids and their reactivation controls the formation and inversion of basins and the uplift of basement blocks, eventually linking the endogenic U cycle (magmatic and hydrothermal rocks) with the exogenic U cycle (making U-rich rocks available for erosion and leaching and creating traps to precipitate mobilized U). The timing of post-Variscan U mineralization is controlled by these tectonic reactivations, whereas supergene enrichment or redistribution is particularly efficient in periods of intense chemical weathering.

AB Subarctic and boreal emissions of CH4 are important contributors to the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and subsequently the global radiative forcing. Whilst N2O emissions may be lower, the much greater radiative forcing they produce justifies their inclusion in GHG studies. In addition to the quantification of flux magnitude, it is essential that we understand the drivers of emissions to be able to accurately predict climate-driven changes and potential feedback mechanisms. Hence this study aims to increase our understanding of what drives fluxes of CH4 and N2O in a subarctic forest/wetland landscape during peak summer conditions and into the shoulder season, exploring both spatial and temporal variability, and uses satellite-derived spectral data to extrapolate from chamber-scale fluxes to a 2 km x 2 km landscape area.
   From static chamber measurements made during summer and autumn campaigns in 2012 in the Sodankyl region of northern Finland, we concluded that wetlands represent a significant source of CH4 (3.35 +/- 0.44 mgCm(-2) h(-1) during the summer campaign and 0.62 +/- 0.09 mgCm(-2) h(-1) during the autumn campaign), whilst the surrounding forests represent a small sink (0.06 +/- < 0.01 mg Cm-2 h(-1) during the summer campaign and -0.03 +/- < 0.01 mg Cm-2 h(-1) during the autumn campaign). N2O fluxes were near- zero across both ecosystems.
   We found a weak negative relationship between CH4 emissions and water table depth in the wetland, with emissions decreasing as the water table approached and flooded the soil surface and a positive relationship between CH4 emissions and the presence of Sphagnum mosses. Temperature was also an important driver of CH4 with emissions increasing to a peak at approximately 12 degrees C. Little could be determined about the drivers of N2O emissions given the small magnitude of the fluxes.
   A multiple regression modelling approach was used to describe CH4 emissions based on spectral data from PLEIADES PA1 satellite imagery across a 2 km x 2 km landscape. When applied across the whole image domain we calculated a CH4 source of 2.05 +/- 0.61 mgCm(-2) h(-1). This was significantly higher than landscape estimates based on either a simple mean or weighted by forest/wetland proportion ( 0.99 +/- 0.16, 0.93 +/- 0.12 mgCm(-2) h(-1), respectively). Hence we conclude that ignoring the detailed spatial variability in CH4 emissions within a landscape leads to a potentially significant underestimation of landscape-scale fluxes. Given the small magnitude of measured N2O fluxes a similar level of detailed upscaling was not needed; we conclude that N2O fluxes do not currently comprise an important component of the landscape-scale GHG budget at this site.

AB Litter quality and environmental effects on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) fine woody debris (FWD) decomposition were examined in three forestry-drained peatlands representing different site types along a climatic gradient from the north boreal (Northern Finland) to south (Southern Finland) and hemiboreal (Central Estonia) conditions. Decomposition (percent mass loss) of FWD with diameter <= 10 mm (twigs) and FWD with diameter > 10 mm (branches) was measured using the litter bag method over 1-4-year periods. Overall, decomposition rates increased from north to south, the rate constants (k values) varying from 0.128 to 0.188 year(-1) and from 0.066 to 0.127 year(-1) for twigs and branches, respectively. On average, twigs had lost 34%, 19% and 19%, and branches 25%, 17% and 11% of their initial mass after 2 years of decomposition at the hemiboreal, south boreal and north boreal sites, respectively. After 4 years at the south boreal site the values were 48% for twigs and 42% for branches. Based on earlier studies, we suggest that the decomposition rates that we determined may be used for estimating Scots pine FWD decomposition in the boreal zone, also in upland forests. Explanatory models accounted for 50.4% and 71.2% of the total variation in FWD decomposition rates when the first two and all years were considered, respectively. The variables most related to FWD decomposition included the initial ash, water extractives and Klason lignin content of litter, and cumulative site precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration. Simulations of inputs and decomposition of Scots pine FWD and needle litter in south boreal conditions over a 60-year period showed that 72 g m(-2) of organic matter from FWD vs. 365 g m(-2) from needles accumulated in the forest floor. The annual inputs varied from 5.7 to 15.6 g m(-2) and from 92 to 152 g m(-2) for FWD and needles, respectively. Each thinning caused an increase in FWD inputs, Up to 510 g m(-2), while the needle inputs did not change dramatically. Because the annual FWD inputs were lowered following the thinnings, the overall effect of thinnings on C accumulation from FWD was slightly negative. The contribution of FWD to soil C accumulation, relative to needle litter, seems to be rather minor in boreal Scots pine forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Simple models are less input demanding and their calibration involves a lower number of parameters, however their general applicability to vast areas must be tested. We analysed if a simple ecosystem model (PRELES) can be applied to estimate carbon and water fluxes of Boreal forests at regional scale.
   Multi-site (M-S) and site-specific (S-S) calibrations were compared using evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) measurements from 10 sites. The performances of M-S were similar to S-Ss except for a site with agricultural history. Although PRELES predicted GPP better than ET, we concluded that the model can be reliably used at regional scale to simulate carbon and water fluxes of Boreal forests.
   We further found that, in the calibration, the use of a long and carefully collected flux dataset from one site that covers a wide range of climate variability leads to better model performance in other sites as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Salinity gradients across estuaries influence wetland carbon storage, methane (CH4) biogeochemistry, and plant productivity. Estuarine freshwater wetlands may experience increases in salinity during drought; however, the impact of salinization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is uncertain. We measured ecosystem-scale GHG emissions from a wetland experiencing salinization during the 2011-2017 California drought and used information theory analyses to quantify couplings and causal interactions between CH4 fluxes and two dominant environmental drivers; gross ecosystem photosynthesis and temperature. Machine learning models were then used to estimate salinization-induced changes in CH4 fluxes and plant productivity. We observed dynamic CH4 flux-driver relationships across the salinization disturbance event, where temperature connections strengthened, and productivity connections dampened during salinization. Annual gross ecosystem productivity reduced by 64% during peak salinization, whereas annual CH4 emissions only reduced by 10%, suggesting that other CH4 substrate sources compensated for reductions in recent photosynthate. Our results demonstrate the value of applying information theory and machine learning approaches to ecological analyses and suggest that drought-induced salinization may increase GHG emissions from estuarine freshwater wetlands.

AB The pesticides in flooded applications model (PFAM) is a regulatory model for government agencies and others interested in estimating water concentrations of pesticides used in flooded agriculture applications such as rice paddies and cranberries bogs. PFAM was designed around the specific parameters that are typically available for a pesticide risk assessment, thereby simplifying the model and allowing the user to concentrate on only the most relevant model inputs. The model considers the fate properties of pesticides and allows for the specifications of typical flooded agriculture management practices such as scheduled water releases and refills. It also allows for natural water-level fluctuations resulting from precipitation and evapotranspiration. Model quality assurance requirements for regulatory models aimed at protecting the public are that the models err on the high side of measured data and at the same time should not cause undue burden to stakeholders by being overly conservative. For the studies herein, PFAM did tend to err on the high side of the data yet provided more realistic estimates than the currently used methods, which thereby reduced stakeholder burden. As is also important for a regulatory model, PFAM is nonproprietary and freely available.

AB The formulation of a model that can reliably simulate the temporal groundwater level fluctuations of an aquifer is important for effective water resource management and for the prevention of possible desertification effects. Mires Basin at the island of Crete, Greece, is part of a major watershed with significantly reduced groundwater resources because of overexploitation during the past 30 years. In this work, the interannual variability of groundwater level is modeled with a discrete time autoregressive exogenous variable (ARX) model that is based on physical grounds (soil-water balance equation). Precipitation surplus is used as an exogenous variable in the ARX model. Three new modified versions of the original form of the ARX model are proposed and investigated: the first considers a larger time scale; the second considers a larger time delay in terms of the groundwater level input; and the third considers the groundwater level difference between the last two hydrological years, which is incorporated in the model as a third input variable. Modeling results for the time series of the spatially averaged groundwater level show very good agreement, after an initial adaptation period, with measured data. Among the three modified versions of the original ARX model considered in this work, the third model version shows significantly better agreement with measured data.

AB The kriging spatial statistical analysis technique was used to analyze spatial variability in the groundwater levels in irrigated grassland catchment in the Piwonia River valley. The geostatistical analysis in this study was performed using ArcGIS software, and the spatial distributions on fluctuations in groundwater levels were also studied. The objective of study was to evaluate the applicability of the kriging method for the analysis of the groundwater level.
   Field observation data collected in Sosnowica in 2011 were used (Western Polesie). The study area is located in Eastern Poland in the province of Lublin and has an temperate climate with temperature extremes -30 degrees C and 35 degrees C (average 8 degrees C). The annual rainfall in the area is about 600 mm, 40% of which occurs between June and September, and the evapotranspiration potential is high. The catchment area of the ditches is 0.46 km(2) and is 86% of area is used as a one-crop seminatural meadows land. The soil cover is dominated by degraded soil muck-peat (MtII). In the catchment area 75% of the habitat moorshed and moist with a high groundwater level.
   In spring and summer, flooding of grassland in the eastern part of the study area was observed. It was caused by seepage of water from the pond and the supply of water after ice thawing or after rainfall. The obstruction of drainage including neglected ditches had also impact on flooding. The groundwater level in the western part of the study area decreased excessively in the fall because of drainage influence of the river which depth is 2 m.
   The dataset consisted of groundwater level measured at 15 points in three test periods (spring, summer and autumn). The measured groundwater levels were used to construct experimental semivariograms to characterize the spatial variability in the levels. A range of theoretical models (spherical, exponential, Gaussian models) were fitted to the experimental semivariograms. The models were validated using cross-validation statistics. Surface generated hydroizohipses maps were produced to illustrate spatial variations in the groundwater level in the study area. The spatial analysis of the groundwater level data from the piezometers led to the following conclusions:
   groundwater levels in the study area were autocorrelated in the distance between 203.5 and 300 m - depending on series,
   the groundwater level depth was smallest in the vicinity of the Hetman pond and greatest near the Piwonia river,
   spatial variability in the groundwater levels was described better by the Gaussian model than by the other models for all test series.

AB The present area of European wetlands is only a fraction of their area before the start of large-scale human colonization of Europe. Many European wetlands have been exploited and managed for various purposes. Large wetland areas have been drained and reclaimed mainly for agriculture and establishment of human settlements. These threats to European wetlands persist. The main responses of European wetlands to ongoing climate change will vary according to wetland type and geographical location. Sea level rise will probably be the decisive factor affecting coastal wetlands, especially along the Atlantic coast. In the boreal part of Europe, increased temperatures will probably lead to increased annual evapotranspiration and lower organic matter accumulation in soil. The role of vast boreal wetlands as carbon sinks may thus be suppressed. In central and western Europe, the risk of floods may support the political will for ecosystem-unfriendly flood defence measures, which may threaten the hydrology of existing wetlands. Southern Europe will probably suffer most from water shortage, which may strengthen the competition for water resources between agriculture, industry and settlements on the one hand and nature conservancy, including wetland conservation, on the other.

AB This paper presents vegetation and climate reconstructions for the forest zone in the central part of the East European Plain, Russia, for the time period 10,000-7900 cal. BP. Reconstructions were based on pollen records from three key regions located in taiga, mixed coniferous-broadleaved and broadleaved forest zones. Results showed that the considered period was characterized by relatively low air temperatures and high precipitation compared with modern conditions. Analysis of the long-term pattern of the mean annual temperature for all three regions reveal two synchronous significant cooling periods observed 9300-9100 cal. BP and 8500-8100 cal. BP as well as rapid growth of the air temperature in 8100-7800 cal. BP, when the annual temperatures increased by 3 degrees C during about 300 years. The cooling phase of 8500-8100 cal. BP could correspond to the distinct "8.2 ka event" widely recorded across Europe. Periods of climate warming are coincided with periods of precipitation rise whereas the cool phases are characterized by its decrease. The ratio of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation amount selected as indicator of surface moistening conditions decreased significantly in period of cooling phases (down to 0.27) and can be used as a clear indicator of ground surface overwatering and strengthening of mire formation processes.

AB Planet Earth is undergoing significant changes which are driven by natural and anthropogenic factors. However, it is difficult to identify the drivers and their effect on the environment and ecosystems because there are many interdependencies. In this study we present a multi-parameter approach to assess the effect of changes in human-induced and natural drivers on a wetland ecosystem. The study area is one of the most prominent European wetlands: the Biebrza Basin, located in north-eastern Poland. We analysed long-term (ca. 1960-2000) changes in meteorology, hydrology, soil and vegetation, and also conservation history. This approach enabled us to identify interactions between environmental change and management. We found significant trends (1960-2012) indicating climate change: increases in temperature, evapotranspiration and earlier start of spring floods. We identified (1970-2000) a shift towards drier vegetation types after drainage. However, we also found that restoration measures that were implemented have mitigated climate change effects and have led to increases in soil moisture and wetter vegetation types. We conclude that, if carried out sufficiently frequently, the management measures implemented in the Biebrza Basin, which are a combination of different restoration measures (blocking drainage, not clearing aquatic vegetation, bush removal, mowing), can to some extent mitigate the effects of climate change.

AB This paper characterizes a seasonally inundated Danish floodplain wetland in a state close to naturalness and includes an analysis of the major controls on the wetland water and nitrogen balances.
   The main inputs of water are precipitation and percolation during ponding and unsaturated conditions. Lateral saturated subsurface flow is low. The studied floodplain owes its wetland status to the hydraulic properties of its sediments: the low hydraulic conductivity of a silt-clay deposit on top of the floodplain maintains ponded water during winter, and parts of autumn and spring. A capillary fringe extends to the soil surface, and capillary rise from groundwater during summer maintains near-saturated conditions in the root zone, and allows a permanently very high evapotranspiration rate. The average for the growing season of 1999 is 3(.)6 mm day(-1) and peak rate is 5(.)6 mm day(-1). In summer, the evapotranspiration is to a large degree supplied by subsurface storage in a confined peat layer underlying the silt-clay.
   The floodplain sediments are in a very reduced state as indicated by low sulphate concentrations. All nitrate transported into the wetland is thus denitrified. However, owing to modest water exchange with surrounding groundwater and surface water, denitrification is low; 71 kg NO3-N ha(-1) during the study period of 1999. Reduction of nitrate diffusing into the sediments during water ponding accounts for 75% of nitrate removal. Biomass production and nitrogen uptake in above-ground vegetation is high-8(.)56 t dry matter ha(-1) year(-1) and 103 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Subsurface ammonium concentrations are high, and convective upward transport into the root zone driven by evapotranspiration amounted to 12(.)8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The floodplain wetland sediments have a high nitrogen content, and conditions are very favourable for mineralization. Mineralization thus constitutes 72% of above-ground plant uptake.
   The study demonstrates the necessity of identifying controlling factors, and to combine surface flow with vadose and groundwater flow processes in order to fully comprehend the flow and nitrogen dynamics of this type of wetland. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Over the last several decades the hydrologically sensitive Boreal Plains ecoregion of Western Canada has experienced significant warming and drying. To better predict implications of land cover changes on evapotranspiration (ET) and future water resources in this region, high resolution light detection and ranging and energy balance data are used here to spatially parameterize the Penman-Monteith ET model. Within a 5 km x 5 km area of peatland ecosystems, riparian boundaries, and upland mixed-wood forests, the influence of land cover heterogeneity on the accuracy of modeled ET is examined at pixel sizes of 1, 10, 25, 250, 500, and 1,000 m, representing resolutions common to popular satellite products (SPOT, Landsat, and MODIS). Modeled ET was compared with tower-based eddy covariance measurements using a weighted flux footprint model. Errors range from 10% to 36% of measured fluxes and results indicate that sensors with small pixel sizes (1 m) offer significantly better accuracy in large heterogeneous flux footprints, while a wider range of pixel sizes (<25 m) can be suitably applied to smaller homogeneous footprints. Mid (250 m) and coarse (>500m) pixel sizes offered significantly less accuracy, although changes in pixel size within this range offered comparable results.

AB Extensive portions of the southern Everglades are characterized by series of elongated, raised peat ridges and tree islands oriented parallel to the predominant flow direction, separated by intervening sloughs. Tall herbs or woody species are associated with higher elevations and shorter emergent or floating species are associated with lower elevations. The organic soils in this "Ridge-and-Slough" landscape have been stable over millennia in many locations, but degrade over decades under altered hydrologic conditions. We examined soil, pore water, and leaf phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) distributions in six Ridge and Slough communities in Shark Slough, Everglades National Park. We found P enrichment to increase and N to decrease monotonically along a gradient from the most persistently flooded sloughs to rarely flooded ridge environments, with the most dramatic change associated with the transition from marsh to forest. Leaf N:P ratios indicated that the marsh communities were strongly P-limited, while data from several forest types suggested either N-limitation or co-limitation by N and P. Ground water stage in forests exhibited a daytime decrease and partial nighttime recovery during periods of surface exposure. The recovery phase suggested re-supply from adjacent flooded marshes or the underlying aquifer, and a strong hydrologic connection between ridge and slough. We therefore developed a simple steady-state model to explore a mechanism by which a phosphorus conveyor belt driven by both evapotranspiration and the regional flow gradient can contribute to the characteristic Ridge and Slough pattern. The model demonstrated that evapotranspiration sinks at higher elevations can draw in low concentration marsh waters, raising local soil and water P concentrations. Focusing of flow and nutrients at the evapotranspiration zone is not strong enough to overcome the regional gradient entirely, allowing the nutrient to spread downstream and creating an elongated concentration plume in the direction of flow. Our analyses suggest that autogenic processes involving the effects of initially small differences in topography, via their interactions with hydrology and nutrient availability, can produce persistent physiographic patterns in the organic sediments of the Everglades.

AB A numerical model was developed for simulating groundwater-wetland interactions and contaminant transport. The model calculates transient hydraulic head and a transient free surface in a two-dimensional, heterogeneous domain, with variable and transient boundary conditions (infiltration, evapotranspiration, surface water), and water and contaminant fluxes across the aquifer-wetland interface. Contaminant transport is also simulated, with contaminant sources located at the free surface, wetland, or within the saturated domain. The model was applied to assess groundwater-wetland interactions and the transport of septic-system-derived contaminants at Point Pelee, Ontario, Canada. The model successfully simulated the field observations of groundwater flow and contaminant plumes. Where the barrier bar is narrow, the seasonal reversal in the direction of groundwater flow is caused by differences in the elevation of the water surface of Lake Erie and that of the marsh. This, in turn, induces the contaminants to oscillate between movement towards the lake during the winter and towards the marsh during the summer. Hence, contaminant plumes are bimodal in shape. Where the barrier bar becomes wider, the lake and the marsh have less effect, and hence contaminants move in one direction. along the principal direction of groundwater flow towards the marsh.

AB Drained wetland sites with shallow water tables cover large parts of Central and Western European lowlands. Their hydrological behaviour is complex and depends on their specific characteristics. In this paper, we analysed how the water budget components of such areas behaved when undergoing rainfall events with amounts greater than 10 mm. All the water budget components were determined using a weighable groundwater lysimeter that was installed in the Spreewald wetland, Germany. On average, 69% of the rainfall was stored in the wetland, while only 8% was discharged and 23% was dissipated by evapotranspiration during the time of the runoff process during and after the rainfall event. More than half of the water that was stored could be attributed to storage within the unsaturated zone, while only a minor part was due to the water storage change under quasi-equilibrium conditions. Hence, the soil moisture depletion in the unsaturated zone in the period before the rainfall had a big influence on the site's available water storage capacity. The findings show that models and approaches assuming hydrostatic conditions might strongly underestimate the water storage capacity of shallow water table sites and, consequently, overestimate the runoff. Hence, the hydrostatic assumption does not describe the process dynamics of these sites in an appropriate manner.

AB The effects of sediment, ground-water, and surface-water processes on the timing, quantity, and mechanisms of N and P fluxes were investigated in the Wood River Wetland 5-7 years after agricultural practices ceased and seasonal and permanent wetland hydrologies were restored. Nutrient concentrations in standing water largely reflected ground water in winter, the largest annual water source in the closed-basin wetland. High concentrations of total P (22 mg L-1) and total N (30 mg L-1) accumulated in summer when water temperature, air temperature, and evapotranspiration were highest. High positive benthic fluxes of soluble reactive P and ammonium (NH4+-N) were measured in two sections of the study area in June and August, averaging 46 and 24 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Nonetheless, a wetland mass balance simultaneously indicated a net loss of P and N by assimilation, denitrification (1.1-10.1 mg N m(-2) h(-1)), or solute repartitioning. High nutrient concentrations pose a risk for water quality management. Shifts in the timing and magnitude of water inflows and outflows may improve biogeochemical function and water quality by optimizing seed germination and aquatic plant distribution, which would be especially important if the Wood River Wetland was reconnected with hyper-eutrophic Agency Lake.

AB The eddy-covariance method has become a cornerstone in the study of the surface energy and water balances, yet the oft-reported lack of energy-balance closure adds uncertainty to its measurements of evapotranspiration. This study explores the issue of closure based on 10 years of energy and water balance measurements at seven flux-tower sites in the southern boreal forests of western Canada. The sites include mature aspen, black spruce and jack pine forests, three young jack pine forests following harvesting, and one fen. Careful attention was paid to the measurement of evapotranspiration E, surface available energy (net radiation minus storage), precipitation P. and soil water storage S including root-zone soil water and water table elevation. Stand-level outflow O at the flux-tower sites was estimated annually as a residual term in the vertical water balance (O = P - E - Delta S), with and without energy-closure adjustments to E. Six of the flux towers were located within or near the gauged White Gull Creek watershed (603 km(2)). The comparison of measured streamflow from the White Gull Creek with estimated outflow, scaled from the flux towers to the watershed, provides an independent test of the need for energy-closure adjustments to flux-tower E.
   Measured streamflow from the White Gull Creek watershed had a long-term mean (S.D.) of 101 (54) mm y(-1) but was highly variable among years, ranging from 30 mm y(-1) during an extreme dry year to 204 mm y(-1) during an extreme wet year. Stand-level outflow, estimated with an energy-closure adjustment to E, varied by land-cover type, from a mean (S.D.) of 30 (35)mm y(-1) at the mature aspen forest and 52 (125)mm y(-1) at the fen to 108 (85)mm y(-1) at the mature black spruce forest and 187 (55) and 250 (64)mm y(-1) at the mature and young (harvested) jack pine forests, respectively. The dominant land-cover type, mature black spruce forest, typified the hydrology of the boreal forest landscape, with outflow similar to the watershed mean.
   The warm-season, eddy-covariance sensible and latent heat fluxes were 15 +/- 4% (annual mean +/- S.D.) smaller than surface available energy, with reasonable similarity among sites and years. When scaled from stand to watershed, the tower-based estimates of outflow agreed with measured streamflow only when outflow was calculated with an energy-closure adjustment to E. The annual means for the 2002-2009 hydrologic years were: 131 mm y(-1) (measured streamflow); 182 mm y(-1) (tower-based outflow calculated without energy-closure adjustments to E); and 112 and 127 mm y(-1) (tower-based outflow calculated with energy-closure adjustments to E from two different schemes). This result corroborates the need for energy-closure adjustments to eddy-covariance measurements of E, but it does not provide guidance about how the adjustments should be implemented. (C) 2012 A.G.

AB St. Augustinegrass, Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze, is expanding rapidly as a lawn grass, due especially to urban development in warm coastal areas, where it is best adapted. Although first discovered in South Carolina, in 1788, St. Augustinegrass may not be native to North America. The six other species of the genus are endemic to the Old World, and are still confined mainly along shorelines from Africa to the South Pacific. The first recorded use of St. Augustinegrass was in 1880, as a lawn in Florida. Cultivars were named beginning in the 1920s. The first cultivar of known parentage was released in 1980. Genetic diversity in the urban landscape is reduced by reliance on a few vegetatively propagated cultivars. Among breeding collections of St. Augustinegrass, considerable diversity exists for diploids, but not for polyploids. A related species, pembagrass, S. dimidiatum (L). Brongn., is resistant to the southern chinch bug, Blissus insularis Barber, and the sting nematode, Belonolaimus longicaudatus Rau., which are pests of St. Augustinegrass. Currently, only 26 foreign introductions of Stenotaphrum are found in the National Plant Germplasm System. Untapped germplasm potential of polyploid St. Augustinegrass and related species should be explored in southern Africa, where potential sources of resistance to chinch bogs and drought, and shade tolerance might be found. For new problems that will be discovered, genetic diversity must be deployed so as to deter resistance-breaking pest strains. This will require better knowledge of the biological relationships.

AB Detailed botanical (microfossil and macroremain), zoological and geochemical analyses (major and trace elements including C, Al, S, Ca, Fe, P, As, Zn, U, Ba and Rare Earth Elements) of organic deposits provide new insights into Early Holocene environmental change in the Kreekrak area (southwestern Netherlands). The age assessment of the record is based on high resolution AMS C-14 wiggle-match dating (WMD). For the first time an AMS C-14 WMD based chronology covering the Late Glacial/Holocene transition and early Preboreal is introduced for a site in The Netherlands.
   The Kreekrak botanical record reflects the end of the Younger Dryas to early Boreal and can be well correlated with pollen records from other sites in The Netherlands and Belgium. The palaeo-topography showed that the Kreekrak deposits formed in an abandoned channel of the River Schelde. Around ca. 11,490 cal BP, at the end of the Late Glacial/Holocene transition, infilling of the lake started with predominantly organic deposits in slowly running water. As a result of the warmer climate the area became forested with birch and poplar during the Friesland Phase (ca. 11,490-11,365 cal BP). Biological productivity of the lake and its surroundings increased. Aquatic vegetation developed in the lake, while shrubs of willow, reed swamps and grasslands fringed the shores. Precipitation increased, which caused a rise in the lake water table and an increase in the supply of oxic surface (=river) water into the Kreekrak take. During this period, the Kreekrak lake was fed by inflowing river water, runoff, precipitation and seepage of Fe-rich groundwater. Around ca. 11,43 5 cal BP the water became stagnant probably as result of a total cut-off of the river channel. Inflow of river water ceased, while the supply of reduced Fe-rich groundwater became dominant. During the Rammelbeek Phase (ca. 11,365-11,250 cal BP), the climate was more continental and the abundance of grasslands and open herbaceous vegetation increased. Biological productivity remained high. In the lake, the supply of Fe-rich groundwater continued, the water level slightly decreased but aquatic vegetation remained present. At the end of the Rammelbeek Phase a sudden reduction in the supply of Fe-rich reduced groundwater caused a lowering of the groundwater level in the area, resulting in the development of a hiatus. Due to this hiatus, the Late Preboreal (11,250-10,710 cal BP) is absent from the record. During the early Boreal (10,710-10,000 cal BP) the landscape became densely forested and accumulation of peat in the former lake resumed due to a slowly rising groundwater level. The Boreal was a relatively stable period with low sedimentation rates.
   The combination of palaeobotanical and geochemical analyses in the Kreekrak record shows a close interrelation between landscape development and geochemistry. It appears that the environmental development of this area during the Late Glacial/ Holocene transition and Early Holocene was largely influenced (directly or indirectly) by major climatic changes that occurred during this period, which determined local phenomena such as the composition and density of the vegetation, occurrence of seepage and river activity. Further research of this type has the potential to develop the application of major- and trace element geochemistry in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

ID PHOSPHORUS
AB Long-term studies of the influence of biogeochemical barriers (shelterbelts and stretches of meadows) on water cycling and control of ground water pollution in an agricultural landscape have shown that more solar energy is used for evapotranspiration in shelterbelts than in cultivated fields or meadows. Therefore, annual water runoff from cultivated fields is about 170% higher than from coniferous forest, 60% higher than deciduous forest and 16% higher than meadows. The differences in evapotranspiration rates between shelterbelts and meadows increases when additional energy input for evapotranspiration is provided by transport of heat from cultivated fields to these habitats by advection. The average water percolation time through the unsaturated zone of soils varies by 100%. A shelterbelt, having a mixed species composition, more effectively screens the passage of chemical compounds dissolved in ground water than shelterbelts composed of one tree species. Peat soils have a very high cation exchange capacity which increases the efficiency of riparian meadows for the control of ground water pollution. Natural landscape features which assist in controlling matter cycles are of great importance for modifying chemical outputs from agricultural watersheds.

AB The management of shallow water table sites is often the subject of discussion between different interest groups, the most controversial topic being the different target groundwater levels. A good level of knowledge about the effects of the different water levels on the water budget components is a precondition for the development of compromises in well-balanced water resource management.
   We used groundwater lysimeters to investigate the impact of different water level regimes on the water balance. The lysimeters were installed directly within a typical shallow water table site and had a specially designed system to control the lower boundary condition. This enabled us to simulate different management options in a realistic way.
   Our results show increasing evapotranspiration with higher water levels but only if the vegetation is adapted to these conditions. Adaptation may take place within a few years of higher water levels. High water levels in spring are linked to increased water storage. This can help to compensate for the higher evapotranspiration for some weeks but not for the entire season. The meteorological conditions have a large short-term impact on the water budget, which is difficult to compensate for using long-term water management strategies or slow-responding vegetation development. Our results underline the complex ecohydrological dependencies in such site conditions and could be an important basis for the development or improvement of ecohydrological models.

DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; AFRICA; BASIN; PEAT; CHAD
AB The Okavango basin of northern Botswana is an area of active diagenetic carbonate and silica accumulation.  The basin is formed by grabens which represent an extension of the East African Rift system.  The Okavango Delta, a large, marshy, alluvial fan (22,000 km2), occupies most of the surface area of the basin.  Evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation by a factor of 3 and approximately 96% of incoming water is lost to the atmosphere.  Evaporative concentration of dissolved solids occurs and they precipitate in the capillary fringes of islands.  The less soluble components CaCO3 and SiO2 precipitate in the soils, which results in a significant volume increase which has important implications for the topography of the area and the character of the sediment fill.  The more soluble salts, mainly alkali carbonates, accumulate at the surface as efflorescent crusts but are leached into the soil during the rainy season.  This salt accumulation destroys vegetation.  Swamp abandonment leads to leaching to greater depth, and, with reflooding, to the removal of these salts, possibly to form a deep saline groundwater.  Mass-balance calculations indicate that this form of chemical accumulation is the dominant aggradational process occurring in the delta at present.

AB Arctic wetlands store nearly half of the world's soil organic carbon and are crucial to the global carbon cycle. However, most Earth system models fail to account for wetlands given heterogeneity and uncertainty surrounding the response of different wetland types to climate change. We analyzed summer (June-August) carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, meteorological conditions, and ecological conditions at four Arctic wetlands. Micrometeorological flux tower data were used to assess CO2 exchange and meteorological conditions across 7 to 9years of data. Climate data were used to assess meteorological conditions across 30years of data. Satellite data described ecological conditions. Each site acted as a CO2 sink, but strength varied, ranging from -49 to -93gC/m(2) per summer. A trend analysis was used to investigate how CO2 balance and surrounding conditions may have changed. CO2 exchange significantly changed at one site, becoming a stronger sink. Changes in meteorological conditions were variable across sites with the exception of air temperature which, when considering significant trends, unanimously increased across sites. Ecological conditions suggested increased vegetation cover regardless of statistical significance at all sites. A conditional random forest algorithm was used to evaluate drivers of CO2 exchange. Cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity, while ecosystem respiration was primarily driven by air temperature, suggesting that projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns will influence the carbon balance of Arctic wetlands. Variability across sites emphasizes the need for long-term observations across wetland types and climatic gradients.

AB Ecosystem trajectories are inextricably linked to hydrology; however, water availability is not easily observed within the landscape. The response of vegetation to soil water availability may provide an indicator of local hydrology and the resilience or sensitivity of ecosystems to long-term changes in water balance. In this study, vegetation trajectories derived from Landsat Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index over a 22-year period are used as an indicator of spatio-temporal changes of watershed water balance and surface water storage within 6 proximal watersheds of the Boreal Plains ecozone of Alberta, Canada. The interactions between hydrology, topography, geology, and land cover type are examined as they relate to vegetation change.
   In this study, we find that run-off ratio (run-off/precipitation) is greater within watersheds with greater variability of relief, compared within subhumid, wetland-dominated watersheds (average = 0.35, 0.20, respectively), which experience lagged run-off response. A 2-year drought had a greater impact on vegetation trajectories within variable relief watersheds containing a high proportion of coarse-grain surficial geology, compared with peatland-dominated watersheds. The drought extended for an additional 1 to 2 years within 3 subhumid watersheds, reducing watershed run-off to less than 50 mm per water year (November to October) in 2 watersheds. However, proportional area of decline of Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index was significantly less within these watersheds. The results of this study indicate that wetlands play an important role for local water balance and ecosystem maintenance during periods of water stress and should be considered within land use planning and reclamation strategies of the Boreal Plains.

AB The presence of forest vegetation can aid in preserving the permafrost layer by maintaining lower soil temperatures via the accretion of an organic layer at the surface. This layer has a low bulk density and low thermal conductivity (due also to high evapotranspiration rates by forest vegetation), which insulates ice-rich permafrost. Forest removal can lead to significant increases in the summer soil temperature, which increases the thickness of the active layer (i.e., the surficial layer above permafrost which thaws during summer and freezes again in winter) and causes a rise in the active layer towards the surface. When vegetation is sensitive to saturated soil conditions, a rise in the active layer can lead to the conversion of forested areas to wetlands. In this manuscript, we develop a modeling framework to relate vegetation permafrost feedbacks to the emergence of multiple stable ecosystem states. Factors related to soil temperature and hydrologic characteristics of the system were examined to see how they affect the location of the stable and unstable states. This model was also used to examine how an increase in precipitation would affect the temporal dynamics of the active layer and vegetation. Results show that the presence of forest vegetation can enhance the resilience of the system in that it is less prone to state shifts following a disturbance. Understanding these dynamics is important given, (i) the rapid rate at which these systems can shift between states, (ii) the projected climatic changes for forested areas underlain by permafrost and (iii) the high rates of forest loss in these areas.

AB Many ecological functions of wetlands are influenced by wet-periods, i.e., the time interval when groundwater table (GWT) is continuously near the land surface. Hence, there is a crucial need to understand the controls on interannual variations of wet-periods. Given the scarcity of long-term measurements of GWT in wetlands, understanding variations in wet-periods using a measurement approach alone is challenging. Here we used a physically based, fully distributed hydrologic model, in synergy with publicly available hydrologic data, to simulate long-term wet-period variations in 10 inland forested wetlands in a southeastern US watershed. A Bayesian regression and variable selection framework was then implemented to (a) evaluate the extent to which the simulated wet-periods can be estimated and predicted by precipitation (Ppt) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and (b) infer the relative roles of seasonal Ppt and PET. Our results indicate that wet-period start date and duration could vary by more than 6 months during the 32 year simulation period. Remarkably, 60-90% of these variations could be captured using regressions based on seasonal Ppt and PET in most wetlands. Effects of seasonal meteorological conditions on wet-period variations were found to be nonuniform, which indicate that the annual variables may not explain interannual variations in wet-periods. The Bayesian framework was able to predict wet-period variations with errors smaller than 1 month at a 90% confidence level. The presented framework provides a minimalistic approach for estimating and predicting wet-period variations in wetlands and may be used to understand the future responses of associated ecological functions in wetlands.

AB Management of conventional crops must adapt to the particularities of urban greening techniques, such as green roofing. The aim of the study was to determine seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz 'Platinum TE') response when grown in shallow green roof substrates and under moisture deficit conditions during two summer periods. Treatments included: (i) six different green roof substrates formulated from locally available materials by mixing combinations of sandy loam soil, pumice, perlite, clinoptilolite zeolite, peat, and compost; (ii) two substrate depths (7.5 or 15 cm); and (iii) two irrigation regimes (60 or 100% crop evapotranspiration). Measurements included the determination of substrate moisture content (SMC) and turfgrass normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). It was found that, during moisture deficit periods, NDVI was mostly affected by irrigation regime and substrate depth but not by substrate type. Turfgrass retained higher NDVI values for longer time intervals when the high irrigation regime of 100% crop evapotranspiration was combined with the deeper substrates of 15 cm. Regression between SMC and NDVI revealed that SMC should be retained from 23.7 to 28.5% (v/v) to keep seashore paspalum within acceptable NDVI values when grown under shallow green roof conditions.

AB Three naturally intact wetland systems (swamps) were characterised based on sediment cores, analysis of surface water, swamp groundwater, regional groundwater and pore water stable isotopes. These swamps are classified as temperate highland peat swamps on sandstone (THPSS) and in Australia they are listed as threatened endangered ecological communities under state and federal legislation.
   This study applies the stable isotope direct vapour equilibration method in a wetland, aiming at quantification of the contributions of evaporation, rainfall and groundwater to swamp water balance. This technique potentially enables understanding of the depth of evaporative losses and the relative importance of groundwater flow within the swamp environment without the need for intrusive piezometer installation at multiple locations and depths. Additional advantages of the stable isotope direct vapour equilibration technique include detailed spatial and vertical depth profiles of delta O-18 and delta H-2, with good accuracy comparable to other physical and chemical extraction methods.
   Depletion of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in pore water with increasing depth (to around 40-60 cm depth) was observed in two swamps but remained uniform with depth in the third swamp. Within the upper surficial zone, the measurements respond to seasonal trends and are subject to evaporation in the capillary zone. Below this depth the pore water delta O-18 and delta H-2 signature approaches that of regional groundwater, indicating lateral groundwater contribution. Significant differences were found in stable pore water isotope samples collected after the dry weather period compared to wet periods where recharge of depleted rainfall (with low delta O-18 and delta H-2 values) was apparent.
   The organic-rich soil in the upper 40 to 60 cm retains significant saturation following precipitation events and maintains moisture necessary for ecosystem functioning. An important finding for wetland and ecosystem response to changing swamp groundwater conditions (and potential ground movement) is that basal sands are observed to underlay these swamps, allowing relatively rapid drainage at the base of the swamp and lateral groundwater contribution.
   Based on the novel stable isotope direct vapour equilibration analysis of swamp sediment, our study identified the following important processes: rapid infiltration of rainfall to the water table with longer retention of moisture in the upper 40-60 cm and lateral groundwater flow contribution at the base. This study also found that evaporation estimated using the stable isotope direct vapour equilibration method is more realistic compared to reference evapotranspiration (ET). Importantly, if swamp discharge data were available in combination with pore water isotope profiles, an appropriate transpiration rate could be determined for these swamps. Based on the results, the groundwater contribution to the swamp is a significant and perhaps dominant component of the water balance. Our methods could complement other monitoring studies and numerical water balance models to improve prediction of the hydrological response of the swamp to changes in water conditions due to natural or anthropogenic influences.

AB The relationship between evapotranspiration of potted plants on a flooded bench fertigation system and the realised distribution of water in the root zone was studied in detail for a range of fertigation schedules. The physical characteristics of the peat-based potting medium are described by models commonly used in soil physics. The functioning of the substrate in practical situations was highly affected by hysteresis in the water retention characteristic. Daily evapotranspiration of Ficus benjamina plants varied from 0.4 to 4.1 kg m(-2) day(-1), of which 19-41% was lost by evaporation. Water uptake by plant roots resulted in near hydrostatic equilibrium conditions as long as the volumetric water content was above 0.22. Lower average water contents resulted in locally drier conditions in the root environment. The absorption of water during irrigation depended on the soil physical conditions and increased with decreasing volumetric water content before flooding. The majority of the water absorption occurred within the first minutes, making frequent fertigation more effective than increasing the duration. Actual buffer capacity of the potting medium is defined and by combining measured absorption during flooding with data on evapotranspiration, we indicate how minimum requirements of the fertigation schedule can be derived.

AB The Okefenokee Swamp is at 160,000 ha freshwater wetland in Southeast Georgia, USA that developed in a landscape basin. Hydrologic variability across the swamp suggests that water-surface elevations are not uniform across the swamp. The topographic surface map discussed herein was developed to describe the swamp topography at local to landscape scales and relate the swamp peat- and sand-surface elevations to elevation above mean sea level. These data were then used to relate water-surface elevations across the swamp so that the swamp hydrologic environment could be described spatially and temporally with a spatial hydrology model. The swamp was divided into 5 sub-basins that reflect similar seasonal hydrodynamics but also indicate local conditions unique to the basins. Topographic gradient influences water-level dynamics in the western swamp (2 sub-basins), which is dominated by the Suwannee River floodplain. The eastern swamp (3 sub-basins) is terraced, and the regional hydrology is driven less by topographic gradient and more by precipitation and evapotranspiration volumes. The relatively steep gradient and berm and lake features in the western swamp's Suwannee River floodplain limit the spatial extent of the Suwannee River sill's effects, whereas system sensitivities to evapotranspiration rates are more important drivers of hydrology in the eastern swamp.

AB The Western Boreal Plain of north-central Alberta is prone to water-deficit conditions and is hydrologically sensitive to changes in climate, natural resource extraction and disturbance. Accurate measurement and modelling of the main components of the water balance are important for ecosystem and reclamation management; however, the lack of hydro-meteorological instrumentation found within different land cover types makes quantification of changes to the water balance difficult over large areas. Remote sensing data can provide spatial estimates of land cover distribution and leaf area index (LAI) used as inputs into land surface models. However, land surface models can often suffer from inaccuracies as a result of spatial (coarse pixel) and temporal (discrete acquisition) resolutions, mis-classification and inaccurate representation of LAI using remote sensing data. This study uses high-resolution (1mx1m) Light Detection and Ranging-derived vegetation parameters (land cover type, LAI and 3D vegetation frictional influences on air movement) as inputs into the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration (ET) model along with measured hydro-meteorological variables. Comparison with eddy covariance (EC) measurements indicated that spatially explicit ET estimates at 1m resolution (over a 5kmx5km study area) provided better estimates compared with bulk average ET estimates per land cover type. ET estimates scaled using spatially variable vegetation inputs only underestimated measured fluxes by 2% and 3% at 225 and 3m EC instrumentation towers, respectively. Bulk averaged ET estimates underestimated measured ET by 5% at the 3m tower and overestimated EC by 7% at the 225m EC tower. Over coarser scales, the error associated with bulk input parameters can lead to error in overall water balance estimation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Time series remote sensing vegetation indices derived from SPOT 5 data are compared with vegetation structure and eddy covariance flux data at 15 dry to wet reclamation and reference sites within the Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada. This comprehensive analysis examines the linkages between indicators of ecosystem function and change trajectories observed both at the plot level and within pixels. Using SPOT imagery, we find that higher spatial resolution datasets (e.g. 10 m) improves the relationship between vegetation indices and structural measurements compared with interpolated (lower resolution) pixels. The simple ratio (SR) vegetation index performs best when compared with stem density-based indicators (R-2 = 0.65; p < 0.00), while the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) are most comparable to foliage indicators (leaf area index (LAI) and canopy cover (R-2 = 0.52-0.78; p > 0.02). Fluxes (net ecosystem production (NEP) and gross ecosystem production (GEP)) are most related to NDVI and SAVI when these are interpolated to larger 20 m x 20 m pixels (R-2 = 0.44-0.50; p < 0.00). As expected, decreased sensitivity of NDVI is problematic for sites with LAI > 3 m(2)m(-2),making this index more appropriate for newly regenerating reclamation areas. For sites with LAI < 3 m(2)m(-2), trajectories of vegetation change can be mapped over time and are within 2.7% and 33% of annual measured LAI changes observed at most sites. This study demonstrates the utility of remote sensing in combination with field and eddy covariance data for monitoring and scaling of reclaimed and reference site productivity within and beyond the Oil Sands Region of western Canada.

AB Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing of land-surface temperature (LST) provides valuable information about the sub-surface moisture status required for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) and detecting the onset and severity of drought. While empirical indices measuring anomalies in LST and vegetation amount (e.g., as quantified by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI) have demonstrated utility in monitoring ET and drought conditions over large areas, they may provide ambiguous results when other factors (e.g., air temperature, advection) are affecting plant functioning. A more physically based interpretation of LST and NDVI and their relationship to subsurface moisture conditions can be obtained with a surface energy balance model driven by TIR remote sensing. The Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model is a multi-sensor TIR approach to ET mapping, coupling a two-source (soil + canopy) land-surface model with an atmospheric boundary layer model in time-differencing mode to routinely and robustly map daily fluxes at continental scales and 5 to 10-km resolution using thermal band imagery and insolation estimates from geostationary satellites. A related algorithm (DisALEXI) spatially disaggregates ALEXI fluxes down to finer spatial scales using moderate resolution TIR imagery from polar orbiting satellites. An overview of this modeling approach is presented, along with strategies for fusing information from multiple satellite platforms and wavebands to map daily ET down to resolutions on the order of 10 m. The ALEXI/DisALEXI model has potential for global applications by integrating data from multiple geostationary meteorological satellite systems, such as the US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, the European Meteosat satellites, the Chinese Fen-yung 2B series, and the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellites. Work is underway to further evaluate multi-scale ALEXI implementations over the US, Europe, Africa and other continents with geostationary satellite coverage.

AB Drying of terrestrial areas is a critical issue in our era of climate change. However, there is limited knowledge on the current spatial status of drylands, which can be assessed using updated and more rigorous data than information used in the initial dryland estimations. Here we investigate the current extent of drylands globally, continentally and nationally by analysing one of the most recent aridity database (1950-2000 period) and compare statistically, for the first time, with the initial dryland estimations (1951-1980). Using diachronic analysis between the databases, we found that drylands are currently almost 4% larger worldwide than expected and cover 45.4% of the Earth's land surface. This net increase of global dryland areas is due to the expansion of arid (+3.4%) and semi-arid (+0.9%) areas, whilst hyper-arid zones decreased (-0.8%) and dry sub-humid areas remained stable. Except for Europe and South America, all continents have experienced a net expansion of arid environments in the recent climate database. Our findings show that Asia is home to the world's largest increases in dryland areas, where China alone accounts for almost one third of the new lands exposed to aridity worldwide. The Earth's drier conditions can generally be attributed to climate changes occurring after 1980. Our results highlight large-scale drying processes and therefore the exacerbation of land degradative conditions at low and middle latitudes. Also, our findings signal the danger of triggering certain positive feedbacks in global warming, considering the newly-identified drylands migration towards higher latitudes in North America and Asia, which can modify the albedo and destabilize the large carbon pools in permafrost, peatlands or boreal forests.

AB Over the past centuries, the agricultural use of wetlands in Central Europe has required interference with the natural wetland water balance. Often this has consisted of drainage measures alone. In low-precipitation areas, it has also involved the operation of combined drainage and sub-irrigation systems. Model studies conducted as part of planning processes, or with a view to finding out the impact of changing climate conditions on the water balance of wetlands, must take these facts into account. For this reason, a water balance model has been devised for wetlands whose water balance is governed by water resources management systems. It is based on the WBalMo model system. Special modules were integrated into WBalMo to calculate the water balance of wetland areas (WABI module) and to regulate inflow partitioning within the wetland (REGINF module). When calculating the water balance, the WABI module takes into account precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, groundwater levels below surface, soil types, land-use classes, inflows via the running water system, and data for target water levels. It provides actual evapotranspiration, discharge into the running water system, and groundwater levels in the area.
   The example of the Spreewald, a major wetland area in north-eastern Germany, was used to design and test the WBalMo Spreewald model. The comparison of measured and calculated water balance parameters of the wetland area confirms the suitability of the model for water balance studies in wetlands with complex water resources management systems. The results reveal the strong influence of water management on the water balance of such areas. The model system has proved to be excellently suited for planning and carrying out water management measures aimed at the sustainable development of wetlands. Furthermore, scenario analyses can be used to assess the impact of global change on the water balance of wetlands. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Understanding of dragonfly distributions is often geographically comprehensive but less so in ecological terms. White-faced darter (Leucorhinnia dubia) is a lowland peatbog specialist dragonfly which has experienced population declines in Great Britain. White-faced darter is thought to rely on peat-rich pool complexes within woodland, but this has not yet been empirically tested. We used dragonfly recording data collected by volunteers of the British Dragonfly Society from 2005 to 2018 to model habitat preference for white-faced darter using species distribution models across Great Britain and, with a more detailed landcover data set, specifically in the North of Scotland. Across the whole of Great Britain, our models used the proportion of coniferous forest within 1 km as the most important predictor of habitat suitability but were not able to predict all current populations in England. In the North of Scotland, our models were more successful and suggest that habitats characterised by native coniferous forest and areas with high potential evapotranspiration represent the most suitable habitat for white-faced darter. We recommend that future white-faced darter monitoring should be expanded to include areas currently poorly surveyed but with high suitability in the North of Scotland. Our results also suggest that white-faced darter management should concentrate on maintaining Sphagnum rich-pool complexes and the maintenance and restoration of native forests in which these pool complexes occur.

AB Shrubs and herbal wetland stands have a very important influence on microclimatic conditions and short water cycling. However, they have received very little attention. This study concerns with the role of willow and peaty meadow stands and a mesic pasture ill their ability to affect both the temperature and energy regime. Our results showed that the pattern of daily temperatures (diurnal variation and temperature amplitudes) were more balanced ill the wetland stands than in the pasture. The most attenuated and stable temperatures were measured in the willow stands whereas the fastest warming of the soil substrate occurred in the peat meadow. Temperature amplitudes and differences in daily average temperatures on the stand surfaces increased with decreasing air humidity. Thermographic camera pictures showed that in the peaty meadow the means of stand surface temperatures as well as daily temperature oscillations were higher than in the willow stand. Although no significant statistical differences were found, daily time series of the Bowen ratio showed an increase towards midday in the willow stand. This was presumably the result of a midday depression of transpiration. We determined that more solar energy was converted into latent heat than into sensible heat in both wetland stands. Therefore we suggest that these wetland stands function in the landscape as functional dissipative ecological units.

ID SPARSE CROPS; ENERGY; RESISTANCE; VEGETATION; BALANCE
AB Evapotranspiration is a major component of both the energy and water balances of wetland tundra environments during the thaw season. Reliable estimates of evapotranspiration are required in the analysis of climatological and hydrological processes occurring within a wetland and in interfacing the surface climate with atmospheric processes. Where direct measurements are unavailable, models designed to accurately predict evapotranspiration for a particular wetland are used.
   This paper evaluates the performance, sensitivity and limitations of three physically-based, one-dimensional models in the simulation of evaporation from a wetland sedge tundra in the Hudson Bay Lowland near Churchill, Manitoba. The surface of the study site consists of near-saturated peat soil with a sparse sedge canopy and a constantly varying coverage of standing water. Measured evaporation used the Bowen ratio energy balance approach, to which the model results were compared. The comparisons were conducted with hourly and daily simulations.
   The three models are the Penman-Monteith model, the Shuttleworth-Wallace sparse canopy model and a modified Penman-Monteith model which is weighted for surface area of the evaporation sources.
   Results from the study suggest that the weighted Penman-Monteith model has the highest potential for use as a predictive tool. In all three cases, the importance of accurately measuring the surface area of each evaporation source is recognized. The difficulty in determining a representative surface resistance for each source and the associated problems in modelling without it are discussed.

AB Wetlands in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP) of North Central Alberta exist within a moisture-deficit regime where evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant hydrologic flux. As such these systems are extremely susceptible to the slightest climatic variability that may upset the balance between precipitation (P) and ET. Wetland ET is predominantly controlled by vegetation composition but may also vary due to moisture regimes and microclimatic factors. To address this variability in moisture regimes, ET was examined in a typical moraine-wetland-pond system of the WBP during the 2005 and 2006 snow-free seasons. Closed dynamic chamber measurements were used to gather data on plant community-scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) in an undisturbed natural bog with varying degrees of canopy cover surrounding a shallow groundwater-fed pond. For the purposes of scaling plant community ET contributions to those of the wetland, potential ET (PETEQ) was measured using a Priestley-Taylor energy balance approach at three separate wetland sites with varying aspects surrounding the central pond, along with actual evapotranspiration using a roving eddy covariance (EC) tower. Growing season peak ET rates ranged from 0.2 mm/h to 0.6 mm/h depending on the location, vegetation composition and time period. Sphagnum contributions were the greatest early in the growing season, reaching peaks of 0.6 mm/h, while lichen sites exhibited the greatest late season rates at 0.4 mm/h. Thus, Sphagnum and other nonvascular wetland plant species control ET differently throughout the growing season and as such should be considered an integral part of the moisture and water balances within wetland environments at the sub-landscape unit scale.

AB The protection and regeneration of wetlands has been of crucial importance as a goal in ecological research and in nature conservation for some time and is more important than ever now. Knowledge about the biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation retrieved from satellite images enables us to improve the monitoring of these unique areas, which are otherwise very often impenetrable and therefore difficult to examine, analyze and assess by means of site visits. The Biebrza Wetlands are Situated in the North-East part of Poland and are one of the largest areas made LIP of marshes and swamps in the entire EU. This is still one of the wildest areas and one of the least destroyed, damaged or changed by human impact. However, in the recent decades there have been attempts made to intensify and overexploit the natural resources of the region and implement new agriculture practices in the area. In this period, drainage canals have been built, and a good deal of the area has been drained. The area of this precious ecosystem covers 25494 ha. This valuable area of peat with unique vegetation species and with very special birds is one of the most valuable areas in Europe and in 1995 was added to the list of Ramsar sites. The investigation of wetlands in the Biebrza River Valley has been carried out at ground level by taking measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, Leaf Area Index, wet and dry biomass and the levels of ground water and meteorological parameters. Also examined were radiative temperature, detailed vegetation mapping, and APAR. For some years the deterioration of peat lands has been noticed due to the drying out of the area and the frequent outbreak of fires. The consequence is the succession of new vegetation and the appearance of new ecosystems. The Remote Sensing Centre in the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography has undertaken the investigation by applying ERS-2.SAR and ENVISAT ASAR of IS2 and IS4 and VV, HH, HV polarization for the purpose of modeling soil moisture and humidity changes of the area under investigation. The investigation also aimed at finding the best biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation to characterize marshland habitats and its changes. At the same time as registering the microwave data, the optical data from Landsat ETM+, SPOT VEGETATION, ERS-2.ATSR. ENVISAT MERIS, and NOAA/AVHRR have been registered and information about the biomass and heat fluxes as sensible and latent heat has also been calculated. The vegetation indices are calculated from EO satellite data taking into account jointly the features of vegetation responsible for reflection in various bands and combining this information from several spectral bands. Also, the changes in the humidity of the area have been examined by extracting the backscattering coefficients from two SAR images that were taken at a similar period of the year but with a gap of 5 years. The information about soil moisture as retention, soil moisture changes, heat fluxes and evapotranspiration are all very important for estimates of CO2 sequestration. The ENVISAT images have been obtained for the ESA AO-ID122 project. Also the SMOS and ALOS data will be applied for the Biebrza Wetlands in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One technique to evaluate the performance of oil sands reclamation covers is through the simulation of long-term water balance using calibrated soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models. Conventional practice has been to derive a single set of optimized hydraulic parameters through inverse modelling (IM) based on short-term (< 5-10 years) monitoring datasets. This approach is unable to characterize the impact of variability in the cover properties. This study utilizes IM to optimize the hydraulic properties for 12 soil cover designs, replicated in triplicate, at Syncrude's Aurora North mine site. The hydraulic parameters for three soil types (peat cover soil, coarse-textured subsoil, and lean oil sand substrate) were optimized at each monitoring site from 2013 to 2016. The resulting 155 optimized parameter values were used to define distributions for each parameter/soil type, while the progressive Latin hypercube sampling (PLHS) method was used to sample parameter values randomly from the optimized parameter distributions. Water balance models with the sampled parameter sets were used to evaluate variations in the maximum sustainable leaf area index (LAI) for five illustrative covers and quantify uncertainty associated with long-term water balance components and LAI values. Overall, the PLHS method was able to better capture broader variability in the water balance components than a discrete interval sampling method. The results also highlight that climate variability dominates the simulated variability in actual evapotranspiration and that climate and parameter uncertainty have a similar influence on the variability in net percolation.

TI Spatial Distribution Patterns of Soil Water Availability as a Tool for
   Precision Irrigation Management in Histosols: Characterization and
   Spatial Interpolation
SO VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID LETTUCE; PEAT
AB Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) production in organic soils is important in Quebec, Canada. Lettuce is highly sensitive to tip burn, a physiological disorder that can lead to significant yield losses. Tip burn losses have been linked to various factors, such as root water uptake deficits. A precision irrigation approach using local applications of water based on lettuce requirements and soil water available capacity (SWAC) reduces the occurrence of tip burn but may need mapped spatial information of SWAC for proper irrigation management. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine a rapid, efficient, and reliable method for interpolating SWAC and (ii) to use this interpolation method in precision irrigation simulations in management zones to demonstrate the importance of using SWAC maps. The methods for SWAC interpolation used in this study were inverse distance weighting (IDW), thin plate splines (TPS) and kriging with external drift (KED). The simulation used a calculation procedure for mass balance that contained SWAC maps, evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation. A comparison of each interpolation method and multiple statistical criteria revealed that IDW and KED were the most precise methods, depending on the study site. Simulations of precision irrigation showed that in many cases, local irrigation management in seven to eight zones must account for the spatial distribution of SWAC to attain an 80% irrigation adequacy for lettuce. Hence, using SWAC maps as a tool for managing irrigation would allow growers to save water and to apply an accurate amount of water in appropriate areas.

AB [1] Natural soil pipes are now recognized as potentially significant elements in hillslope drainage systems, sometimes developing into open channel tributaries or contributing often substantial volumes of quick flow to streams. However, there has been no detailed, long-term monitoring study of the evolution of pipe networks to indicate how permanent they are or how readily they may develop into open channels. This paper reports a resurvey of a section of stream bank in the English Peak District and compares it with the original survey 35 years previous. Comparison of the distribution, size, and shape of pipes on both banks of a 250 m stretch of the stream reveals significant changes. There were no cases of roof collapse forming new open channels. However, there has been a significant change in land use within the basin, with afforestation of the east bank. The resurvey shows a marked reduction in the number and size of pipes on the forested bank, but no significant change on the opposite bank that has remained moorland. The number of pipe outlets on the afforested bank halved over the period, and their mean diameter has reduced by 30%. In combination with the reduced number the smaller size resulted in a 71% reduction in the total area of stream bank occupied by pipe outlets on the forested bank. It is postulated that the change is primarily due to a change in the amount of throughflow beneath the forest caused by an increase in evapotranspiration.

AB Understanding the role of groundwater for runoff generation in headwater catchments is a challenge in hydrology, particularly so in data-scarce areas. Fully-integrated surface-subsurface modelling has shown potential in increasing process understanding for runoff generation, but high data requirements and difficulties in model calibration are typically assumed to preclude their use in catchment-scale studies. We used a fully integrated surface-subsurface hydrological simulator to enhance groundwater-related process understanding in a headwater catchment with a rich background in empirical data. To set up the model we used minimal data that could be reasonably expected to exist for any experimental catchment. A novel aspect of our approach was in using simplified model parameterisation and including parameters from all model domains (surface, subsurface, evapotranspiration) in automated model calibration. Calibration aimed not only to improve model fit, but also to test the information content of the observations (streamflow, remotely sensed evapotranspiration, median groundwater level) used in calibration objective functions. We identified sensitive parameters in all model domains (subsurface, surface, evapotranspiration), demonstrating that model calibration should be inclusive of parameters from these different model domains. Incorporating groundwater data in calibration objectives improved the model fit for groundwater levels, but simulations did not reproduce well the remotely sensed evapotranspiration time series even after calibration. Spatially explicit model output improved our understanding of how groundwater functions in maintaining streamflow generation primarily via saturation excess overland flow. Steady groundwater inputs created saturated conditions in the valley bottom riparian peatlands, leading to overland flow even during dry periods. Groundwater on the hillslopes was more dynamic in its response to rainfall, acting to expand the saturated area extent and thereby promoting saturation excess overland flow during rainstorms. Our work shows the potential of using integrated surface subsurface modelling alongside with rigorous model calibration to better understand and visualise the role of groundwater in runoff generation even with limited datasets.

AB Maintaining sufficiently high surface (capitula) soil-water pressures to avoid the draining of hyaline cells (desiccation) is paramount to hummock-forming Sphagnum species' survival; however, the mechanisms of capitula water supply are poorly understood. This study investigates how the hydraulic characteristics of different Sphagnum species (Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum rubellum and Sphagnum magellanicum) contribute to desiccation avoidance, on the basis of numerical simulations parameterized with measured soil hydraulic characteristics for each species. Although having similar unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values, the upper 5cm of S.magellanicum retains -20% less moisture under tension than S.fuscum and S.rubellum; in fact, S.rubellum on average retained slightly more water than S.fuscum. Hydrus-1D was used to simulate daytime and nighttime conditions over a 7-day period, where daily potential evaporation was 4mm, to explore the governing mechanisms controlling water supply to the capitula. The simulations showed that S.fuscum and S.rubellum were able to retain sufficiently high moisture content under the prevailing simulated water demand to sustain surface soil-water pressure heads (greater than -100cm), whereas S.magellanicum could not prevent depressurization and the concomitant desiccation of its surface layer. A similar number of the same size pores were observed in all species; however, there was lower pore connectivity in S.magellanicum leading to the desiccation of the capitula. Contrary to previous studies, the results of this study indicate that it is not only soil-water retention but also pore connectivity that allows hummock species to thrive above the water table.

At the same time, widespread browning and reversal of or stalled greening have been reported at high latitudes. One of the main reasons for this browning/lack of greening is thought to be warming-induced water stress, i.e., soil moisture depletion caused by earlier spring growth and increased summer evapotranspiration. To investigate these phenomena, we use MODIS collection 6, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies third-generation (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g), and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) satellite-based root-zone soil moisture data. The study area was the Far North of Ontario (FNO), 453,788 km(2) of heterogeneous landscape typical of the tundra-taiga interface, consisting of unmanaged boreal forests growing on mineral and peat soils, wetlands, and the most southerly area of tundra. The results indicate that the increased plant growth in spring leads to decreased summer growth. Lower summer soil moisture is related to increased spring plant growth in areas with lower soil moisture content. We also found that earlier start of growing season leads to decreased summer and peak season maximum plant growth. In conclusion, increased spring plant growth and earlier start of growing season deplete summer soil moisture and decrease the overall summer plant growth even in temperature-limited high latitude ecosystems. Our findings contribute to evolving understanding of changes in vegetation dynamics in relation to climate in northern high latitude terrestrial ecosystems.

AB East African wetlands are naturally dominated by papyrus, the world's fastest growing herbaceous plant, reaching up to 5 m in height and 3 kg m (2) of standing biomass per year. While its provisioning services are well-known, papyrus plays a less evident role in supporting tropical swamp ecosystems by controlling nutrient balances as well as hydrological flows, and through the provision of critical biotopes vital for the reproduction of insects, fishes and birds, including a small number of endemic species. Claims are made condemning papyrus for enhancing water loss, yet only few proper evapotranspiration studies have been carried out. Conflicting evidence indicates that papyrus swamps could be important in regulating local climate through evapotranspiration and hold significant potential in climate mitigation through carbon sequestration and carbon storage as peat. These benefits may become soon severely eroded because papyrus swamps are degrading rapidly due to direct exploitation, to agricultural encroachment, and to extensive trampling and feeding by cattle. We review papyrus ecosystem services, with a focus on its role on biodiversity enhancement and regulating functions. We present new evidence, showing an inverse temperature gradient within papyrus swamps, indicative of an optimised water retention capacity, with examples from Lake Naivasha and Lake Victoria. Better understanding of papyrus regulating services should underpin papyrus restoration as an ecohydrological tool to improve water quality, to moderate local climate by regulating the water cycle, to provide base material for a variety of provisioning ecosystem services, to enhance biotope structure and to support biodiversity.

AB In an effort to increase the accessibility and functionality of shallow green roof systems, the ability of warm-season grasses to provide acceptable growth needs to be further investigated. In the current study, which was conducted during 2011 and 2012, three warm-season grasses (hybrid bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy 'MiniVerde'; seashore paspalum, Paspalum vaginatum Swartz Platinum TE' and zoysiagrass, Zoysia japonica Steud. 'Zenith') were established in outdoor lysimeters. The lysimeters were equipped with all necessary green roof layers placed below a coarse-textured substrate that comprised pumice, thermally treated attapulgite clay, peat, compost and zeolite. Half of the lysimeters had a substrate depth of 15 cm, while the other half had a substrate depth of 7.5 cm. Irrigation was applied at crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Measurements included determination of substrate moisture content, green turf cover (GTC) and leaf stomatal resistance. Significant differences were observed in the values of GTC among the three turfgrass species and the two substrate depths. Zoysiagrass exhibited the best adaptation at the lower depths of shallow green roof systems. At 15 cm substrate depth, zoysia grass managed to sustain green coverage for the two study periods. In addition, it was the only turfgrass species that managed to perform well at the substrate depth of 7.5 cm. Seashore paspalum exhibited limited green cover at both substrate depths, while hybrid bermudagrass could provide acceptable green coverage only at 15 cm substrate depth. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Hudson Bay remains frozen or is dominated by ice over the summer solstice and throughout much of the high-sun season.  This contributes directly to the winterization of summer.  The juxtaposition of the mean summer position of the Arctic front and of treeline to the west of Hudson Bay has been clearly documented, and the coincidence of treeline and the southern boundary of continuous permafrost is well known.  The strong southward thrust of the Arctic front in summer is, in major degree, a response to cold air masses spawned over Hudson Bay.
   On a mesoscale, Hudson Bay generates onshore winds across a strong temperature and pressure gradient.  This mesoscale regime dominates the temperature and surface energy balance for a large distance inland across the Hudson Bay Lowlands.  Superimposed on the mesoscale wind field is a land-sea breeze, which is sometimes well developed in coastal areas and which can be traced up to 65 km inland.  It is, however, of low frequency occurrence and is usually overridden by the regional wind.
   Progressing inland from the coast, in the central Hudson Bay Lowlands, the landscape becomes dominated by deep peat soils and a surface vegetation which is resistant to evapotranspiration.  As a result, it is much drier than the wetlands near the coast and evapotranspiration is reduced.
   The large-scale cold air masses originating over Hudson Bay and the cold mesoscale winds combine to impose cold air temperatures on the adjacent terrestrial environment.  Even with abundant solar radiation and saturated surfaces, evaporation is vigorously suppressed by these cold temperatures.  Any warming or cooling during climate change will have a double impact on the terrestrial environment through the strong linkages with Hudson Bay.

AB Bromeliads are important ornamental foliage plants, but until now, their daily water use during production was unknown. Using a canopy closure model developed for container-grown woody ornamental plants, in this study we investigated actual evapo-transpiration (ETA) of Guzmania 'Irene' and Vriesea 'Carly' from tissue-cultured liners grown in 15-cm containers to marketable sizes in a shaded greenhouse. The mean daily ETA of Guzmania 'Irene' ranged from 4.02 to 66.35 mL per plant, and the mean cumulative ETA was 16.66 L over a 95-week production period. The mean daily ETA of Vriesea 'Carly' varied from 3.98 to 59.89 mL per plant, and the mean cumulative ETA was 15.52 L over the same production period as the Guzmania cultivar. The best-fit models for predicting daily ETA of the two bromeliads were developed, which had correlation coefficients (r(2)) of 0.79 for Guzmania 'Irene' and 0.68 for Vriesea 'Carly'. The success in the model of ETA for both bromeliads suggested that the canopy closure model was equally applicable to container-grown ornamental foliage plants produced in greenhouse conditions. The daily ETA and cumulative ETA values represent research-based information on water requirements, and, when applied, could improve irrigation practices in bromeliad production. This study also showed that roots per se of the two epiphytic bromeliads were able to absorb water and nutrients from a peat-based container substrate and support their complete life cycles.

AB Based on previously published studies of elemental cycling in Everglades soils, we projected how soil biogeochemistry, specifically carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and mercury might respond to climate change scenarios projected for 2060 by the South Florida Water Management Model. Water budgets and stage hydrographs from this model with future scenarios of a 10 % increased or decreased rainfall, a 1.5 A degrees C rise in temperature and associated increase in evapotranspiration (ET) and a 0.5 m rise in sea level were used to predict resulting effects on soil biogeochemistry. Precipitation is a much stronger driver of soil biogeochemical processes than temperature, because of links among water cover, redox conditions, and organic carbon accumulation in soils. Under the 10 % reduced rainfall scenario, large portions of the Everglades will experience dry down, organic soil oxidation, and shifts in soil redox that may dramatically alter biogeochemical processes. Lowering organic soil surface elevation may make portions of the Everglades more vulnerable to sea level rise. The 10 % increased rainfall scenario, while potentially increasing phosphorus, sulfur, and mercury loading to the ecosystem, would maintain organic soil integrity and redox conditions conducive to normal wetland biogeochemical element cycling. Effects of increased ET will be similar to those of decreased precipitation. Temperature increases would have the effect of increasing microbial processes driving biogeochemical element cycling, but the effect would be much less than that of precipitation. The combined effects of decreased rainfall and increased ET suggest catastrophic losses in carbon- and organic-associated elements throughout the peat-based Everglades.

AB In recent decades, moisture-based subsurface drip irrigation management strategies lead to water savings while maintaining strawberry yields in open fields. Most soils in the Quebec City area are characterized by a high proportion of schist fragments and high hydraulic conductivity, causing substantial water losses following irrigation. Until now, little was known about the efficiency of soil-moisture-based irrigation strategies used on moderately coarse-textured soils and their potential to improve water use efficiency (WUE). The first objective of this study was to test two tensiometer-based irrigation managements for strawberry plants grown in a conventional system. Since field fumigation is increasingly restricted in field-grown strawberries, we designed a raised-bed trough system for use in the field and tested its productivity potential. The two irrigation methods included two treatments using pulsed irrigation: one with a constant irrigation threshold of -15 kPa (Pl), and the other with a variable threshold (-15/-30 kPa) adjusted daily to the predicted crop evapotranspiration (PlETc), in addition to a soilless treatment (SL) using a peat substrate and an irrigation threshold of -5 kPa. Compared to conventional irrigation, the PlETc treatment increased the WUE by 8 to 44% while maintaining marketable yields and fruit quality. Thus, this pulsed irrigation strategy is recommended for strawberry plants grown in clay loam soils. Strawberry plants grown in the soilless system gave 73 to 98% higher early marketable yield than soil cultivation. These results may encourage North American farmers to consider the soilless raised-bed trough system as a viable alternative to conventional strawberry production systems.

AB Understanding heterogeneity or patchiness in the distribution of vegetation and retention of C and nutrients in river corridors is critical for setting priorities for river management and restoration. Several mechanisms of spatial differentiation in nutrient retention in river and floodplain corridors have been recognized, but few studies have distinguished their relative importance or established their role in long-term geomorphic change, nutrient retention, and connectivity with downstream systems. We evaluated the ability of 3 mechanisms (evapotranspiration focusing [EF], differential hydrologic exchange [DHE], and particulate nutrient redistribution [PNR]) to explain spatial patterns of P retention and function in the Everglades (Florida, USA). We used field measurements in sloughs and on slightly higher, more densely vegetated ridges to quantify P fluxes attributable to the 3 mechanisms. EF does not explain Everglades nutrient retention or P concentrations on ridges and in sloughs. However, DHE resulting from different periods of groundwater-surface-water connectivity across topographic elements is the primary cause of elevated P concentrations on ridges and completely explains interpatch differences in long-term P accumulation rates. With historical flow velocities, which were an order of magnitude higher than at present, PNR would have further increased the interpatch difference in long-term P retention rates nearly 2-fold. In conclusion, DHE and PNR are the dominant drivers of nutrient patchiness in the Everglades and are hypothesized to be important in P-limited river and floodplain corridors globally.

AB Small lakes are excellent records of environmental changes and are sensitive to local climate fluctuations. Large lacustrine systems record larger-scale climate events. Wetland deposits also provide high-resolution paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental data. Although wetland deposits are typically associated with wet climatic conditions, they actually occur in a wide variety of climates. Whereas lakes and wetlands are very sensitive to changes in climate, high-resolution data in these archives are lost unless it is possible to differentiate these deposits from other "floodplain" deposits. Synthesis of micromorphological and geochemical data with facies relationships is critical to accurate interpretations of ancient wetland-lacustrine deposits. This study illustrates how micromorphology and geochemistry, combined with facies relationships, provide a viable method for differentiating complex, ancient wetland-lacustrine subenvironments. A hydrogeomorphological classification is proposed to provide appropriate genetic terminology that is useful in the rock record. Eight Morrison Formation subenvironments within lacustrine depositional successions from north central Wyoming were delineated using this interdisciplinary approach. Subenvironments include shallow-water wetlands, marsh, lacustrine fringe, and fen basin and fringe deposits. Synthesized data indicate that an overall basinal infilling succession was punctuated by 3 major lake contraction events, which were followed by extended periods of landscape stability. Initially balance-filled conditions dominated the shallowing-upward lacustrine deposits such that sediment and water supply, and accommodation space were relatively equal. As the lake basin filled, shallower water, underfilled lake conditions prevailed. The distribution of wetland pedotypes indicates that evapotranspiration remained high, suggesting that a stable, semi-arid to arid climate dominated in this area throughout Morrison time. Also supporting a semi-arid to arid climate are more positive carbon isotopes compared to values for disseminated organic material in the surrounding area, abundant barite nodules, gypsum pseudomorphs, and zeolites. Although major fluctuations in lake level may have resulted from punctuated wetter episodes, synthesized data suggest that overall the climate remained relatively arid to semiarid and the lake basin remained closed throughout most of Morrison time. Fluctuations in lake level likely resulted from a significant increase in recharge in the source area. possibly related to volcanic events rather than a change in climate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB To study the effect of land use change from marshland to croplands (rice and soybean cultivation), the water and energy fluxes in marshland, rice and soybeans were measured in northeastern China by the eddy covariance method for two growing seasons (May-October in 2005 and 2006). The rice (flooded until early September) and soybean (dry land) croplands were reclaimed from marshlands over 15 years ago. The annual precipitation in 2005 (480 mm) was below the 1981-2004 average (564 130 mm), the precipitation in 2006 (655 mm) was significantly above average. The conversion of marshland to rice cropland resulted in an enhancement in latent heat flux (LE) and a decrease in sensible heat flux (H), which caused an increase in the ratio of LE and net radiation (LE/ Rn) from 0.6 to 0.8 on average, and a decrease in H/Rn from 0.4 to 0.2 on average for the growing season. However, where the marshland was converted to soybean cropland, the latent heat flux was tower in 2005 under dry conditions, but higher in 2006 under wet conditions than it had been previously been, which was the opposite of the trend of H. Therefore, LE/Rn for soybean dropped to about 0.2 in the dry month of June 2005, and rose to 0.7 in the wet month of June 2006. H/Rn for soybeans shows opposite variation in LE/Rn in both years. The maximum evapotranspiration (ET) was about 4.5, 6-7 and 5 mm day(-1) for marshland, rice and soybeans, respectively. Rn, air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf area index (LAI) were important environmental and biological factors controlling the seasonal dynamics of LE and H for the three ecosystems, which explains about 80% of LE and 50% of H for marshland and rice; and 30-50% of LE and 60% of H for soybeans. Among them, Rn was the primary variable controlling the variations of LE and H for marshland and rice. However, for soybeans, VPD played a more important role in LE under dry conditions.

AB The evaluation of downward water fluxes in Histosols is critical for water budget and irrigation studies in natural and cultivated wetlands. By analyzing water fluxes in cultivated organic soils, our study aimed to (i) compare drainage water fluxes measured using in situ lysimeters to fluxes estimated by three indirect methods, specifically, a simplified water balance, a water balance including soil water storage changes, and a method based on the Buckingham-Darcy law; and (ii) investigate water flux mechanisms using a bromide tracer in the same lysimeters. In 2008-2009, three sites were each set up with four drainage lysimeters equipped with water content probes and tensiometers. Bromide was applied over each lysimeter at the beginning of the lettuce growing cycle. Daily outflow water volumes were measured and solute samples were collected. The results showed that measured cumulative drainage was very low (0-40.2 mm) compared to water input (30-128 mm). A rupture point in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at matric potentials around -4.5 to -6 kPa, combined with the stratified profile of the organic layers, may in part explain these observations. The measured water fluxes were also significantly lower (by 1.2 to 1255.3 times) than the estimations made with the three indirect methods. Finally, the analyses of soil and outflow bromide concentrations confirmed the low fluxes through the lysimeters and revealed an accumulation at the surface layer interface (at a depth of about 0.3 m), indicating that water perched in the profile and suggesting that preferential flow occurred, leading to episodic solute leaching. Direct evaluation of water and solute fluxes are needed in such soils, as all three methods presented important biases. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite increasing awareness about the importance of low flows and droughts, spatial and temporal variations in the quantity and quality of baseflow generated in larger catchments are poorly constrained. Here, tracers are used in conjunction with hydrometric analysis to examine the sources of baseflow in the 1849 km(2) catchment of the River Dee in Scotland. Geochemical. tracers showed that the chemical composition of baseflow evolved downstream, but mainly reflected the dominance of sources in montane tributaries in the upper catchment. These findings were corroborated by hydrometric analysis which showed that the upper 54% of the catchment contributed 71% of baseflow in the tower river. Baseflows in smatter (<10 km(2)) headwater sub-catchments exhibited highly variable hydrochemical characteristics which were averaged at larger scales. Analysis of delta O-18 implies that welt-mixed groundwater sources with similar isotopic signatures dominated baseflow generation throughout most of the catchment, probably indicating that groundwater in the lower slopes of montane headwaters provide a major source of baseflow. Periods of baseflow were found to be dynamic; despite the river system being in overall recession, the channel network exhibited contrasting responses to relatively small (<10 mm) isolated rainfall events in different parts of the catchment. Moreover, diurnal variation in flows in sub-catchments with a high proportion of coverage by peat soils is apparent, which may reflect the daily variation of evapotranspiration as a control on baseflow. Although a relatively stable period in the hydrological year, baseflows in larger catchments result from a complex suite of distributed hydrological processes. Further research is needed to understand how baseflows sustain water supplies and aquatic ecosystems, if managers are to be able to protect these catchment services from environmental change.

AB In this second part of the two-part paper, the data driven modeling (DDM) experiment, presented and explained in the first part, is implemented. Inputs for the five case studies (half-hourly actual evapotranspiration, daily peat soil moisture, daily till soil moisture, and two daily rainfall-runoff datasets) are identified, either based on previous studies or using the mutual information content. Twelve groups (realizations) were randomly generated from each dataset by randomly sampling without replacement from the original dataset. Neural networks (ANNs), genetic programming (GP), evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), Support vector machines (SVM), M5 model trees (M5), K-nearest neighbors (K-nn), and multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques are implemented and applied to each of the 12 realizations of each case study. The predictive accuracy and uncertainties of the various techniques are assessed using multiple average overall error measures, scatter plots, frequency distribution of model residuals, and the deterioration rate of prediction performance during the testing phase. Gamma test is used as a guide to assist in selecting the appropriate modeling technique. Unlike two nonlinear soil moisture case studies, the results of the experiment conducted in this research study show that ANNs were a sub-optimal choice for the actual evapotranspiration and the two rainfall-runoff case studies. GP is the most successful technique due to its ability to adapt the model complexity to the modeled data. EPR performance could be close to GP with datasets that are more linear than nonlinear. SVM is sensitive to the kernel choice and if appropriately selected, the performance of SVM can improve. M5 performs very well with linear and semi linear data, which cover wide range of hydrological situations. In highly nonlinear case studies, ANNs, K-nn, and GP could be more successful than other modeling techniques. K-nn is also successful in linear situations, and it should not be ignored as a potential modeling technique for hydrological applications.

AB Fluvial architecture in conjunction with the morphology, petrographical, mineralogical and geochemical composition of intercalated paleosols of the Middle Moscovian upper Radnice Member of the continental Kladno-Rakovnik Basin, Czech Republic, were studied in order to decipher climatic signals in the eastern Pangea region during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. Analysis of architectural elements reveals vertical changes from strongly amalgamated channel fills of bedload-dominated braided streams, to isolated ribbon-like meandering channel fills in mud-dominated floodplain strata. The resulting large scale fining upward cycles separated by laterally widespread bounding surfaces are interpreted as having been formed in response to allocyclic processes driven by variable intensities of precipitation which affected the density of vegetation cover across the landscape and, in turn, the amount and character of sediment supply. Bedload-dominated parts of the cycles were deposited during periods of low water tables and sparse vegetation, whereas periods of maximum precipitation resulted in higher water tables and a greater density of vegetation cover, which, in turn stabilized the floodplains and fixed streams to narrow meandering/anastomosing channels in mud-dominated floodplain strata. Associated paleosols resemble modem Vertisols, which form under seasonal precipitation in modem settings. However, coeval formation of inertinite-rich peat represented by histosols and gleyed low chroma Vertisols in the stratigraphically lowest paleosol succession occurred under overlapping marginal conditions for the climatically different types of soils (i.e., under a seasonal climate where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration for 6 to 8 months out of the year). Mean annual precipitation calculated from the geochemistry of B horizons of Vertisols (CALMAG proxy) varies between 1815 and 1730 mm/yr. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We aim to understand the interactions between hunter-gatherer plant foraging and climate and environmental change in coastal Mpondoland from MIS 3 to the Early Holocene at Waterfall Bluff. The charcoal and pollen records at Waterfall Bluff show the gathering of a variety of woody taxa characterised by their combustion and medicinal properties (e.g., Millettia grandis and Apodytes dimidiate). The leaves identified in the macrobotanics and in the phytolith record might belong to some of these taxa and it is likely that they were used for medicinal purposes. From a palaeoenvironmental perspective, our results indicate low precipitation and low rainfall seasonality under cool conditions during MIS 3 and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Under these conditions, open woodlands interspersed with dry and hygrophilous grasslands and bushveld vegetation with significant representation of fynbos elements occurred in the local landscapes probably along Podocarpus/Afrocarpus forests. The latter could have been (1) present along river valleys and scarps on the Mpondoland exposed continental shelf towards the south and west of Waterfall Bluff, supported by palaeo-rivers and cool temperatures favouring low evapotranspiration, or (2) present in the interior with pollen grains possibly transported to the site by intensified westerly winds. These forests contracted as a result of the post-glacial marine transgression or reduced westerlies following the LGM. During the Early Holocene, the palaeoenvironmental signal points to higher summer rainfall and higher (summer) seasonality than during MIS 3, the LGM and the LGIT. These changes are coeval with an increase of coastal forests and C-4 mesic grasslands with localized wetland vegetation around Waterfall Bluff. These multi-proxy archaeobotanical and biochemical data show that landscapes surrounding Waterfall Bluff changed in relation to marine transgressions/regressions and changes in rainfall intensity and seasonality. The people of Waterfall Bluff foraged the coasts during glacial periods to collect wood. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The water cycle of sites with shallow groundwater tables is characterized by complex interactions of hydrological and ecological processes. The water balance components, which are subject to diurnal fluctuations, are best measured with groundwater lysimeters. However, the lower boundary condition of such lysimeters affects most of the hydrological variables, particularly when considering short time scales, and has to be defined in such a way as to facilitate realistic simulations. In this paper, different means of controlling the lower boundary condition of groundwater lysimeters were compared with respect to their ability to simulate the behavior of the water balance components properly. Measurements of rain-free periods from a lysimeter station installed in the Spreewald wetland in north-east Germany were evaluated. The most common groundwater lysimeter type is controlled using a Mariotte bottle and sets the groundwater level in the soil monolith to a constant level, which here caused an alteration of the inflow to the lysimeter, with respect to both its value and diurnal behavior. Still, daily evapotranspiration values were realistic and this simple and robust approach may be used for time intervals not shorter than one day. High-resolution measurements can be gained from lysimeters that automatically adjust the groundwater level by a system of pumps and valves on an hourly basis. Still, reliable results were only obtained when the conditions in the lysimeter and the surrounding field, where the target groundwater level was measured, were in accordance. Otherwise (e.g., when the groundwater level differed) an unrealistic inflow behavior evolved. Reasonable results, even for slightly diverging conditions, were gained with a new approach that defined the lower boundary conditions by controlling the inflows and outflows of the lysimeter. This approach further enabled the groundwater level itself to be the study subject, thereby enlarging the field of possible applications of groundwater lysimeters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Loboi Swamp is a 1.5 km(2) freshwater wetland situated near the equator in the Kenya Rift Valley. The climate is semi-arid: precipitation is approximate to 700 mm year(-1), and evapotranspiration is approximate to 2500 mm year(-1). Some of the wetland water is currently used for irrigation. An interdisciplinary study was conducted on the geology, hydrology, pedology and biology of the wetland to determine its origin and history and to assess its longevity under present hydrological conditions. Sedimentary records from two piston cores (1.8 and 4 m long) indicate that the present wetland developed during the late Holocene on a low-relief alluvial plain. Floodplain deposits (sandy silts) are capped with wetland sediments (organic-rich clay and peat), which began to form at approximate to 700 BP. The swamp is dominated by Typha domingensis Pers. (approximate to 80%) and floating Cyperus papyrus L. (20%). It is fed by warm springs (T approximate to 35 degreesC; pH approximate to 6.4-6.9) emanating from grid faults of the rift floor. Water compositions suggest that sources are dominated by shallow meteoric water, with little contribution from deeper geothermal fluids. Siderite concretions in the floodplain silts reflect the Fe-reducing conditions that developed as the surface became submerged beneath the water table. The pollen record captured both local and more regional vegetation, showing the prevailing dry rift valley climate despite development of the wetter conditions on the valley floor. The diatom record also suggests a dramatic change in local hydrology. The combined biological records of this semi-arid wetland indicate an abrupt change to wetter conditions, most probably as a result of a regional change in climate. Rift tectonics provided accommodation space, maintained the wetland at or below the water table and enabled spring recharge. The size of the modern wetland has been reduced by about 60% since 1969, which suggests that the system may now be under hydrological stress due to anthropogenic impacts from land-use change.

AB Commercial production of pecan [Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch.] generates significant woody biomass from hedge prunings with little economic value. Value-added uses could aid pecan growers, and one possible use is wood chips for potting substrates to lessen dependence on peatmoss, thereby aiding greenhouse growers. We evaluated vegetative growth and leaf nutrient responses of 'Carpino' garden chrysanthemum (Dendranthema Xgranchflorunt) over a 60-day period. Plants were grown in five pecan wood chip substrate levels that substituted 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of peatmoss by volume. Three water soluble fertilizer (WSF) rates-N at 0, 200, or 400 mg.L-1 (0-N, 200-N, and 400-N, respectively) were applied with each irrigation and to each of the wood substitution treatments. The WSF and wood substitution treatments interacted strongly. In the presence of wood, (25 100% substitution levels), increasing WSF to 400-N increased cumulative evapotranspiration (ET), crop height, total leaf number and area, total leaf and stem dry weight, and leaf N and P concentrations. However, with 0% wood substitution, 400-N provided little or no such enhancements. With 25% to 50% wood substitution, root dry weight increased by 61% to 91% from 0-N to 200-N, which may be an adaptive response to nutrient-limiting conditions at 200-N. Appearance of a white rot fungal species in and atop pecan wood-supplemented substrate supports the likelihood that microbial activity was, at least in part, responsible for the nutrient limitations. High WSF at 400-N in combination with 25% pecan wood substitution maintained adequate fertility and shoot growth that was comparable to the conventional peat-only substrate at 200-N. With low to moderate amounts of pecan wood, further adjustments to WSF rate and irrigation volume would support sustainable fertigation practices, reduce dependence on peatmoss by greenhouse industry, and provide a value-added recycling option for pecan growers.

AB The growth pattern (phenology), resource allocation (morphology) and biomass accumulation of plant above-ground components is expected to have a feedback on root-associated processes in soil like water uptake, nutrient cycling and gas production. The aim was to see how above-ground plant characteristics (phenology, morphology and biomass) would impact water depletion, mineral nitrogen (N) concentration and carbon dioxide (CO2-C) and nitrous oxide (N2O-N) production from root-associated soil of Arabidopsis thaliana lines (wild ecotypes and down regulated mutants of MYB75, KNAT7 and CCR1 having altered lignin concentration in secondary cell walls) at various plant developmental stages. Phenology and morphology were determined on A. thaliana lines grown to maturity in peat moss-based substrate under controlled conditions. Plant biomass, water use, soil mineral N concentration and root-associated soil respiration were measured at various growth stages of A. thaliana lines grown in un-drained plastic pots containing clay-loam soil. The CCR1 mutant line had delayed maturation. While MYB75 and KNAT7 had similar morphology as the wild ecotype, the CCR1 line had fewer and smaller viable fruits, less crown cover of rosette leaves and lower biomass than the wild ecotype. The CCR1 mutant line had lower evapo-transpiration than the wild ecotype. Respiration of root-associated soil planted with MYB75 and KNAT7 was similar to the wild ecotype. Higher N2O production from soil planted with CCR1 was attributed to higher soil moisture content and mineral N concentration of bulk and rhizosphere soil than the wild ecotype. Morphology and biomass exerts strong influence on water content, mineral N concentration and soil respiration. Due to prolonged vegetative growth phase, reduced fecundity and biomass, the CCR1 mutant lowered evapotranspiration and left more mineral N in root-associated soils, which explained the higher N2O emission from soil during its growth and development.

AB The type of organic matter (OM) in European Carboniferous and Permian swamp and lake sediments from the Carboniferous and Permian was determined using organic petrography, Rock-Eval data and biomarker distributions. Coals deposited in swamps contain humic OM formed under oxic conditions. Bog-head coals and black shales deposited in lakes contain a mixture of algal and humic OM formed under reducing conditions. Diterpanes and previous palaeobotanic studies constrain the species of plants living near the lacustrine shore or in the swamp during deposition, allowing the palaeoclimate to be inferred. During the Carboniferous, the climate was not always tropical wet, as some periods of dryness are evident from the sedimentology, palaeobotany and organic geochemistry. During the Permian, the climate was not always tropical dry as some periods of wetness associated with the monsoons are recorded (Roscher, M., Schneider, J.W., 2006. Permocarboniferous climate: Early Pennsylvanian to Late Permian climate development of central Europe in a regional and global context. In: Lucas, S. G., Cassini, G., Schneider, J.W. (Eds.), Non-Marine Permian Chronology and Correlation, vol. 265. The Geological Society of London, pp. 95-136). The appearance of xerophyte plants from the Stephanian was also recorded by way of aromatic hydrocarbons, retene for gymnosperms and arborane/fernane for cordaites and probably seed ferns. Cycles of wetness and dryness for Europe during the Carboniferous and Permian are proposed on the basis of comparison of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.
   delta D values provided information on the palaeotemperature of the air in the swamps and water in lakes, as well as palaeoclimate. Values of ca. -100 parts per thousand seen in the Carboniferous coals and Permian limnic deposits are indicative of a tropical climate, in contrast to a glacial or temperate climate, where the values are ca. -200 parts per thousand. The value for Carboniferous coals could result from high evapotranspiration of plants living under a wet tropical climate vs. a temperate climate. During the Early Permian the climate was dry tropical. For such samples, the delta D values for the n-alkanes derived from lacustrine algae were depleted in D relative to the values for the n-alkanes derived from terrestrial higher plants, attributed to the higher evapotranspiration on land than evaporation from the lake. Alternatively, the xerophytic plants that drifted into the lake via a river could have grown during a dry phase and the autochthonous algae bloomed during a wet phase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background and Aims Growth of bedding plants, in small peat plugs, relies on nutrients in the irrigation solution. The object of the study was to find a way of modifying the nutrient supply so that good-quality seedlings can be grown rapidly and yet have the high root : shoot ratios essential for efficient transplanting.
   Methods A new procedure was devised in which the concentrations of nutrients in the irrigation solution were modified during growth according to changing plant demand, instead of maintaining the same concentrations throughout growth. The new procedure depends on published algorithms for the dependence of growth rate and optimal plant nutrient concentrations on shoot dry weight W-s (g m(-2)), and on measuring evapotranspiration rates and shoot dry weights at weekly intervals. Pansy, Viola tricola 'Universal plus yellow' and petunia, Petunia hybrida 'Multiflora light salmon vein' were grown in four independent experiments with the expected optimum nutrient concentration and fractions of the optimum. Root and shoot weights were measured during growth.
   Key Results For each level of nutrient supply W, increased with time (t) in days, according to the equation Delta W-s/Delta t = K2Ws/1(100 + W-s) in which the growth rate coefficient (K-2) remained approximately constant throughout growth. The value of K-2 for the optimum treatment was defined by incoming radiation and temperature. The value of K-2 for each sub-optimum treatment relative to that for the optimum treatment was logarithmically related to the sub-optimal nutrient supply. Provided the aerial environment was optimal, R-sb/R-o approximate to W-o/W-sb where R is the root : shoot ratio, W is the shoot dry weight, and sb and o indicate sub-optimum and optimum nutrient supplies, respectively. Sub-optimal nutrient concentrations also depressed shoot growth without appreciably affecting root growth when the aerial environment was non-limiting.
   Conclusion The new procedure can predict the effects of nutrient supply, incoming radiation and temperature on the time course of shoot growth and the root : shoot ratio for a range of growing conditions.

AB Following large-scale surface oil sands mining, large tracts of the boreal forest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of Western Canada are legally required to be reclaimed. A greater understanding of how these novel ecosystems function and develop with regard to water use is crucial to aid in the development of regulatory practices and protocols based on information from ecosystem recovery. In this paper, a 12-year (2003-2014) eddy covariance measurement record of latent and sensible heat fluxes and gross ecosystem productivity of carbon dioxide is analysed to evaluate how a reclaimed boreal forest has developed during its initial growth period. The study site is a reclaimed oil sands saline-sodic clay shale overburden deposit that was topped with 100cm of glacial till and 20cm of peat mineral mix. The site was seeded with barley (Hordeum spp.) in 2001 to reduce erosion of the soil cover whereas aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) boreal tree species were planted in 2004. Changes in structure and function corresponded to the transition of dominant vegetation cover from early successional species to forest. Leaf area index increased from a growing season peak of 0.9 in 2003 to 4.0 in 2014 and was associated with an increased growing season gross ecosystem productivity (4.9 to 8.9g C m(-2) day(-1)), an increased evapotranspiration (1.6 to 3.4mm day(-1)), and a decreased partitioning of energy to sensible heat (Bowen's ratio decreased from 1.1 to 0.4). Although canopy conductance increased throughout the 12years, the shift from early successional species to trees with more conservative water use resulted in a decrease in conductance normalized by leaf area. Water use efficiency has increased slightly since 2008 with an average of 10.0g CO2 kg(-1) H2O for the last 6 years. No prolonged dry periods were observed during the study period. The functioning of this novel ecosystem is evolving as expected on the basis of the trends observed for other natural and disturbed boreal forests.

AB Our aim was to determine whether the pot-in-pot (PIP) system can improve the salinity tolerance of spindle tree (Euonymus japonicus) compared to above-ground pot (AGP) systems in terms of water use efficiency (WUE), irrigation water evapotranspired (IWET), stem diameter variations and photochemical efficiency. The PIP system involves burying a "holder pot" in the ground up to the rim. A second, "cultivation pot" containing the growing plant is placed inside the holder pot, while AGP is the traditional above-ground pot production system. In the present experiment, the cultivation pots in both systems contained a mixture of white peat, coconut fibre and perlite (40/40/20, v/v/v). The following treatments were studied: AGP and PIP with control irrigation using water of 1.76 dS m(-1) (AGPc and PIPc); and AGP and PIP using saline irrigation water of 9.04 dS m(-1) (AGPs and PIPs). A soil moisture sensor-controlled irrigation system was used to irrigate all the treatments when AGPc reached a substrate volume water content (theta) of around 0.34 m(3) m(-3). The theta of the saline treatments increased as the experiment progressed, particularly in PIP. The leaching fraction was 33% in AGPc, 41% in PIPc, 43% in AGPs and 54% in PIPs. PIPs produced the lowest amount of IWET (9.94 L) and AGPc the highest (13.20 L). Salinity reduced the plant dry weight (DW) in AGP (5.39 g), but not in PIP (10.2 g). AGPs led to the lowest WUE (0.52 g DW L-1), while PIPs led to 1.23 g DW L-1. Daily IWET per plant was related with the amount of photosynthetic light received each day (daily light integral, DLI) and age in the control treatments, while, under salinity, IWET was only related with DLI. Stem diameter growth was greater in PIPc (1278 mu m) and lower in AGPs (60 mu m). The discrepancy between the photosystem II efficiency and photosynthesis rate in AGPs pointed to an increasing rate of photorespiration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since 2001, a rising water table occurred in the eastern part of the city of Naples (Italy), leading to flooding of the foundations of many buildings and of the underground infrastructures (garages, subway tracks, etc.). This resulted from the reduction in the exploitation of water for industrial use and drinking water in the central part of the groundwater body of the eastern plain of Naples: the groundwater withdrawal decreased from up to 3 m(3)/s in 1990 to a few hundred litres per second in 1998. The variation of piezometric levels led to flooding of foundations of many buildings and of underground infrastructures, this is a big amount of water lost by the aquifer system and that should be evaluated. In order to assess aquifer hydraulic features and the groundwater quantitative status, a 3D hydrostratigraphic model reconstruction was developed to support the groundwater flow modeling and the evaluation of the groundwater balance. The 3D hydrostratigraphic model reconstructed the subsoil of the study area: layers of tuff and lenses of peat, which play an important hydrogeologic role as aquitard and aquiclude, are faithfully defined. Indeed, the model allows the depiction of the horizontal extension and of the thickness of each hydrofacies, even if strongly heteropic. The groundwater flow model was defined using the 3D hydrostratigraphic model in the construction of the geometry and assignment of hydrodynamic parameters. The calibration and sensitivity analysis prove the goodness of the assigned hydraulic conductivity values. The model, together with a detailed computation of the paved areas with reduced infiltration, evaluated the recharge in 0.101 m(3)/s. The model calibration assessed an evapotranspiration rate lower than the prefixed value, probably due to the absence of vegetation that restricts the phenomenon almost exclusively to evaporation. Moreover, the calibration of the model confirmed: - the assumed groundwater flow towards the sea in 0.313 m(3)/s; - the hypothesized amount of the subsurface inflow from upstream in 0.504 m(3)/s. A considerable amount of water lost by the aquifer system, about 0.315 m(3)/s, could be used by Municipality for different public uses.

AB Numerous freshwater ecosystems, dense concentrations of humans along the eastern seaboard, extensive forests and a history of intensive land use distinguish the New England/Mid-Atlantic Region. Human population densities are forecast to increase in portions of the region at the same time that climate is expected to be changing. Consequently, the effects of humans and climatic change are likely to affect freshwater ecosystems within the region interactively. The general climate, at present, is humid continental, and the region receives abundant precipitation. Climatic projections for a 2 x CO2 atmosphere, however, suggest warmer and drier conditions for much of this region. Annual temperature increases ranging from 3-5 degrees C are projected, with the greatest increases occurring in autumn or winter. According to a water balance model, the projected increase in temperature will result in greater rates of evaporation and evapotranspiration. This could cause a 21 and 31% reduction in annual stream flow in the southern and northern sections of the region, respectively, with greatest reductions occurring in autumn and winter. The amount and duration of snow cover is also projected to decrease across the region, and summer convective thunderstorms are likely to decrease in frequency but increase in intensity.
   The dual effects of climate change and direct anthropogenic stress will most likely alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and, hence, the floral and faunal communities of the region's freshwater ecosystems. For example, the projected increase in evapotranspiration and evaporation could eliminate most bog ecosystems, and increases in water temperature may increase bioaccumulation, and possibly biomagnification, of organic and inorganic contaminants. Not all change may be adverse. For example, a decrease in runoff may reduce the intensity of ongoing estuarine eutrophication, and acidification of aquatic habitats during the spring snowmelt period may be ameliorated.
   Recommendations for future monitoring efforts include: (1) extending and improving data on the distribution, abundance and effect of anthropogenic stressors (non-point pollution) within the region; and (2) improving scientific knowledge regarding the contemporary distribution and abundance of aquatic species. Research recommendations include: (1) establishing a research centre(s) where field studies designed to understand interactions between freshwater ecosystems and climate change can be conducted; (2) projecting the future distribution, activities and direct effects of humans within the region; (3) developing mathematical analyses, experimental designs and aquatic indicators that distinguish between climatic and anthropogenic effects on aquatic systems; (4) developing and refining projections of climate variability such that the magnitude, frequency and seasonal timing of extreme events can be forecast; and (5) describing quantitatively the flux of materials (sediments, nutrients, metals) from watersheds characterized by a mosaic of land uses.

AB Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle and thus global carbon budgets. Climate variability affects amount of material entering and the metabolic balance of wetlands, thereby modifying carbon dynamics. This study presents spatiotemporal changes in air-water CO2 exchange in the vast wetlands of Donana (Spain) in relation to different hydrological cycles. Water sources feeding Donana, including groundwater and streams, ultimately depend on the fluctuating balance between annual precipitation and evapotranspiration. Hence, in order to examine the contribution of the rainfall pattern to the emission/capture of CO2 by a range of aquatic habitats in Donana, we took monthly measurements during severely wet, dry, and normal hydrological years (2010-2013). During wet hydrological cycles, CO2 outgassing from flooded marshes markedly decreased in comparison to that observed during subsequent dry-normal cycles, with mean values of 25.8419 and 5.28mmolm(-2)d(-1), respectively. Under drier meteorological conditions, air-water CO2 fluxes also diminished in permanent floodplains and ponds, which even behaved as mild sinks for atmospheric CO2 during certain periods. Increased inputs of dissolved CO2 from the underground aquifer and the stream following periods of high rainfall are believed to be behind this pattern. Large lagoons with a managed water supply from an adjacent estuary took up atmospheric CO2 nearly permanently. Regional air-water carbon transport was 15.2GgCyr(-1) under wet and 1.24GgCyr(-1) under dry meteorological conditions, well below the estimated net primary production for Donana wetlands, indicating that the ecosystem acts as a large CO2 sink.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle, representing important contributors to the global carbon budget. Climate variability affects productivity in wetlands, thereby modifying their capacity to act as sink or source for atmospheric CO2. This study addresses how the hydrological cycle influences the capacity for carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean wetlands of Donana. Covering a surface of 3560km(2), Donana region includes a rich variety of landforms and vegetation types representative of Mediterranean lowlands. Its wetlands are one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe with a high biotic diversity and unique importance for aquatic wildfowl. The region experiences annual cycles of flooding (October to March) and desiccation (May to June), with the inundation cycles being dependent on rainfall. Our measurements suggest that drier meteorological conditions result in lower CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from flooded marshes and permanent ponds whereas large lagoons with man-managed water supply from an adjacent estuary behave as carbon sequestrators. Predictions indicate an increasing frequency of droughts over the Mediterranean region due to climate change. These results highlight the importance of water management in Donana for wetlands conservation and their role in the atmospheric CO2 exchange.

AB Results from monitoring and experimental studies representing various elements of climatic change are presented to evaluate the concurrent dynamics of vegetation types as well as species-specific responses to climatic variations. The studies were carried out in the high-arctic valley of Zackenbergdalen in Northeast Greenland. Vegetation type dynamics and land surface phenology were studied through the use of hand-held sensors of reflection of vegetation, from which the far red normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI-FR) can be inferred. Furthermore, species-specific dynamics were studied through measures of timing and magnitude of flowering through a period of 10 years.
   Time of snowmelt and temperature were the major controlling factors for the timing of the phenology in the six vegetation types: fell-field, Dryas heath, Cassiope heath, Salix heath, grassland, and fen. Snowmelt had a linear positive effect on the timing of the maximum of the growing season, with late snowmelt, causing a later occurrence of the maximum. While higher summed temperatures during the green-up period (time from snowmelt to maximum) also was shown to be positively related to the timing of the maximum, enhanced flower production seemed to cause lower vegetative biomass production and hence a later maximum.
   The seasonal vegetative production, expressed as the seasonal integrated NDVI-FR (SINDVI), had a linear negative relation with the temperatures during the previous summer. This was probably due to higher temperatures causing more flowers the following year, leading to a lower NDVI-FR.
   A strong negative trend in maximum NDVI-FR is documented in all six vegetation types during the years from 1999 to 2006 with a decrease of 0.01 NDVI-FR per year. The main reason could be drying of the upper soil layers due to earlier snowmelt and higher evapotranspiration during recent years.
   Some general trends in phenological characteristics were recognised, although responses varied among species. The time of snow disappearance was the main determinant for onset of flowering. Shrubs seemed to be superior in taking advantage of an early snowmelt with respect to initiation of flowering. In addition, most species developed flowers and seed capsules faster when temperatures increased. More flowers increase the chance of cross-pollination and hence, offer an increased possibility for sexual reproduction and genetic exchange. Most species increased the number of flowers in years following a warm growing season in the previous year, although some species also depended on climatic conditions in the current year prior to onset of flowering.
   Experimental manipulations of growing season length, temperature and incoming radiation in plots with the dominant dwarf shrub, white arctic bell-heather Cassiope tetragona, confirmed that this species significantly reduced flowering when subjected to shading or reduced growing season length.
   Based on current predictions for climatic changes in the Zackenberg area (Stendel et al., 2008, this volume), it is expected that the plant species currently present will be able to put more effort in sexual reproduction, thus ensuring increased species adaptedness to changing climate through enhanced genetic variance. However, this is provided that seeds are able to germinate, that species are not out-competed by faster growing and canopy-forming invading species, and that species are able to continue flowering even under reduced light levels caused by an increased cloud-cover.

AB Droughts can have an impact on forest functioning and production, and even lead to tree mortality. However, drought is an elusive phenomenon that is difficult to quantify and define universally. In this study, we assessed the performance of a set of indicators that have been used to describe drought conditions in the summer months (June, July, August) over a 30-year period (1981-2010) in Finland. Those indicators include the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), and the Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA). Herein, regional soil moisture was produced by the land surface model JSBACH of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). Results show that the buffering effect of soil moisture and the associated soil moisture memory can impact on the onset and duration of drought as indicated by the SMI and SMA, while the SPI and SPEI are directly controlled by meteorological conditions.
   In particular, we investigated whether the SMI, SMA and SPEI are able to indicate the Extreme Drought affecting Forest health (EDF), which we defined according to the extreme drought that caused severe forest damages in Finland in 2006. The EDF thresholds for the aforementioned indicators are suggested, based on the reported statistics of forest damages in Finland in 2006. SMI was found to be the best indicator in capturing the spatial extent of forest damage induced by the extreme drought in 2006. In addition, through the application of the EDF thresholds over the summer months of the 30-year study period, the SPEI and SMA tended to show more frequent EDF events and a higher fraction of influenced area than SMI. This is because the SPEI and SMA are standardized indicators that show the degree of anomalies from statistical means over the aggregation period of climate conditions and soil moisture, respectively. However, in boreal forests in Finland, the high initial soil moisture or existence of peat often prevent the EDFs indicated by the SPEI and SMA to produce very low soil moisture that could be indicated as EDFs by the SMI. Therefore, we consider SMI is more appropriate for indicating EDFs in boreal forests. The selected EDF thresholds for those indicators could be calibrated when there are more forest health observation data available. Furthermore, in the context of future climate scenarios, assessments of EDF risks in northern areas should, in addition to climate data, rely on a land surface model capable of reliable prediction of soil moisture.

AB A pollen and diatom study of a 40 m-sedimentary sequence from Lake Tritrivakely in the central highlands of Madagascar provides evidence for climatic and environmental changes during the late Pleistocene and the Holocene. The major features of the modern regional climate and vegetation distribution and the hydrological characteristics of the lake basin are first summerized, Lithological units and specific methods used to establish the pollen and the diatom biozones are then presented. The chronology of the upper 13 m of the sequence (0-41 kyr) is supported by AMS radiocarbon dates. It has not been possible to acquire absolute ages fur the lower 27 m of the core. However, a tentative age model based on comparisons between the terrestrial pollen and the Vostok deltaD isotopic temperature records suggests an age of about 150 kyr for the core base. The vegetation primarily responded to variations in temperature. Six major cold/warm cycles are identified. During the cold phases, Ericaceous bush surrounded the site. Assuming that the age model is correct, cold phases (prior to 143, 115-110, 94-88, 75-69, and 22-17 kyr) coincide with periods of high local summer insolation. The warm phases are of different amplitude. They show first the development of a wooded grassland under a dry climate, which may coincide with periods of low summer insolation (around 125, 100, 83, 60 and 10-5 kyr), and then the growth of mid-latitude trees under wetter conditions. The diatom record primarily documents changes in the precipitation minus evaporation balance (P - E) in the lake catchment, which appear consistent with orbitally-induced changes in P and seasonal contrasts as suggested by our pollen-based age model and the C-14-dated section of the record. An overall trend from a relatively deep, nutrient-rich lake to a shallow, oligotrophic peat-marsh, is partly attributed to the basin infilling. However, wet-dry oscillations are superimposed over this trend. The two first lake high stands (before 143 and around 115 kyr if the age model is correct) and low stands (around 125 and 105 kyr) match pollen-inferred cold and warming phases, respectively. Later, periods of low P - E also fit cold phases, and occur apparently every 12-10 kyr. Summer rain during phases of high summer insolation was not heavy enough to compensate for the large evaporation-evapotranspiration losses during warm summers and dry winters, especially during the cold Last Glacial Maximum, which was drier than today.

AB Wetlands are especially at risk from climate change because of their intermediate landscape position (i.e., transition between upland and aquatic environments), where small changes in precipitation and/or evapotranspiration can have substantial impacts on wetland hydrology. Because hydrology is the primary factor influencing wetland structure and function, the important ecosystem services that wetlands provide may be altered or lost as a result of climate change. While a great deal of uncertainty is associated with the projected impacts of climate change on wetlands, hydrologic models and downscaled climate model projections provide tools to reduce this uncertainty. DRAINMOD is one such process-based hydrologic model that has been successfully adapted to simulate the daily water level fluctuations in natural wetlands. The objective of this project was to determine the range of possible impacts of climate change on the hydrologic regimes of non-riverine, non-tidal Coastal Plain wetlands in North Carolina. DRAINMOD models were calibrated and validated for two minimally disturbed, natural wetland sites using observed water table and local weather data. Two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were evaluated: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Nine models were selected from an ensemble of 32 climate models to represent the range of possible changes in mean precipitation and temperature. Downscaled climate projections were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Simulations were run from 1986 to 2099, and results were evaluated by comparing the projected mean water table levels between the base period (1986-2015) and two future evaluation periods: 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. The model simulation results indicated that the projected mean water table level may decline by as much as 25 to 84 cm by the end of this century (2070-2099) for the RCP8.5 scenario and may decline by 4 to 61 cm for the RCP4.5 scenario. In Coastal Plain wetlands, declines in water tables can lead to the subsidence of organic soils, which can lead to the loss of stored carbon and increased risk of peat fires. Lower mean water levels can also lead to shifts in vegetation community composition and loss of habitat functions for wetland-dependent fauna. These results provide an overview of the potential impacts of climate change on North Carolina wetlands, and they provide a range of scenarios to inform and guide possible changes to water management strategies in wetland ecosystems that can be implemented now to limit the loss of ecosystem services over the long term.

AB Few continental palaeoenvironmental sedimentary sequences from Southern Europe are long enough to span the last interglacial period (Marine Isotopic Stage-MIS 5), the last glacial cycle (MIS 4 to 2) and the Holocene. El Canizar de Villarquemado (North-Eastern Iberian Peninsula) is an exceptional sedimentary lacustrine sequence spanning the last ca. 135,000 years of environmental change in an area of inland Iberia characterized by Mediterranean climate with strong continentality. We present a multiproxy study which combines palynological, sedimentological and geochemical analyses framed by an independent, robust chronology. Hydrological and climate evolutions were reconstructed by sedimentological and geochemical proxies. Development of wetlands and shallow carbonate lakes support relatively humid conditions during MIS 6, till the onset of MIS 4, and during the Holocene. Palaeohydrological conditions were drier during MIS 5 (dominance of peat environments) than during the Holocene (more frequent carbonate-producing lakes). Sedimentological evidence indicates extremely arid conditions during MIS 3 with greater activity of alluvial fans prograding into the basin. Sedimentary facies variability highlights a large environmental and hydrological variability during MIS 2 and a rapid humidity response to the onset of the Holocene.
   Compared to classic Mediterranean sites, we found novel pollen assemblages for the end of MIS 6 and MIS 5 indicating that the vegetation cover was essentially represented by sustained high proportions of continentality-adapted taxa dominated by Juniperus during the relatively humid conditions since MIS 6 till the onset of MIS 4. Higher evapotranspiration in inland Iberia would have increased during periods of higher seasonal insolation maxima, impeding soil development and the usual mesophyte expansion during interglacials observed in other Mediterranean areas. Four main periods of forest development occurred in Villarquemado during MIS 5e, MIS 5c, MIS 5a and the Holocene; secondary peaks occurred also during MIS 3. During colder but still relatively humid MIS 4, junipers and Mediterranean taxa disappear but some mesophytes and cold-tolerant species persisted and Pinus became the dominant tree up to modern times. Pollen assemblages and geochemical data variability suggest a dominant control of seasonality and the impact of North Atlantic dynamics both during MIS 5 (cold events C18-C24) and full glacial conditions (HE and D-O interstadials). At millennial scales, steppe herbaceous assemblages dominated during the extremely arid conditions of MIS 3 and pines and steppe taxa during glacial period MIS 2. Villarquemado sequence demonstrates that the resilient behaviour of conifers in continental areas of inland Southern European regions is key to understand the glacial-interglacial vegetation evolution and to evaluate scenarios for potential impacts of global change.
